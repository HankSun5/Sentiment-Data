These Metrics Show Why It Might Never Happen,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/an-altcoin-season-in-sight/,"Bitcoin has yet to relinquish its dominance in this market cycle, leaving many investors still holding onto hopes for the arrival of an altcoin season. Still, there remains a possibility that an altcoin rally might never come to fruition this season, given the recent market trends this cycle. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez echoed this perspective in a recent post on X, claiming that an altcoin season may never return. His observation sheds light on the change in market dynamics and the significant shifts that have occurred since previous alt seasons. Why AltSeason Might Never Happen An altcoin season is defined by a period of rapid price surges across a wide range of altcoins. Furthermore, an altcoin season is characterized by investors cashing out their Bitcoin profits and pouring them into altcoins. This period is always accompanied by social media hype and FOMO from crypto investors as they rush in to get in on the action. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 However, current market conditions have seen the crypto industry grow from its early days into a new market with a close relationship with investors in the traditional finance sector. Additionally, the altcoin market has expanded dramatically since the last major bull run in 2021, and you could argue that it has become somewhat oversaturated. Martinez highlighted a startling statistic: over 36.4 million altcoins are now in circulation. This is a dramatic increase compared to fewer than 3,000 altcoins during the 2017-2018 altcoin season and an even smaller pool of fewer than 500 in the 2013-2014 bull market cycle. The sheer scale of this supply explosion has fundamentally altered the cryptocurrency landscape, diluting attention and capital among an overwhelming number of assets. This oversaturation means that achieving widespread price surges across altcoins has become a far more challenging proposition than in previous market cycles. Furthermore, many of these altcoins have unclear use cases or poor fundamentals and only divert attention from specific altcoins with strong utility. Could The Era Of Altcoin Seasons Be Over? The concept of an altcoin season may be a relic of a less crowded market. Ethereum, the largest altcoin, has largely failed to perform up to expectations this cycle. Known as the primary driver of past altcoin seasons, Ethereum has struggled to gain momentum for over a year, even as other altcoins like Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin continue to push to multi-year highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market If Ethereum, with its established dominance and utility, cannot deliver, it raises serious questions about the potential of other altcoins to rally. Instead, individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique propositions could continue to thrive while the rest of the market remains stagnant. At the time of writing, Coinmarketcap’s dominance data shows that Bitcoin commands 57.9% of the total crypto market cap, increasing by 0.69% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is steadily losing ground, with its dominance dropping by 1.07% over the same period, now accounting for just 11.1% of the overall market.

BlockDAG , a pioneering blockchain initiative that integrates Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with conventional blockchain traits, stands out as one of the key projects to watch by 2025. As its presale nears the impressive $200 million milestone, the enthusiasm for this transformative venture is clearly justified. Could BlockDAG Climb from $0.0248 to $1? Exploring the Potential for a 3932% Return BDAG coins are currently priced at a mere $0.0248 in the ongoing 27th presale batch. Market analysts anticipate that by 2025, BlockDAG’s valuation might reach $1, presenting an opportunity for a remarkable 3932% ROI. Initial holders have already enjoyed significant profits, with gains up to 2380% from the first batch. For those yet to participate, this is a critical time to get involved before this chance passes. BlockDAG is more than just promising numbers; it represents a bold vision for the future of blockchain technology. Its advanced hybrid framework offers unmatched speed, scalability, and security, appealing to both developers and corporate sectors. Equipped to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), BlockDAG enables a robust platform for innovative decentralized applications (dApps). Significant CEX Listings Scheduled for 2025: Key to BDAG’s Valuation Surge A distinct aspect of BlockDAG’s strategy is its detailed roadmap for 2025. Alongside the highly anticipated mainnet debut, there are plans for significant listings on prominent centralized exchanges (CEXs). These listings are poised to greatly boost BDAG’s liquidity and visibility, potentially elevating its market value substantially. Traditionally, tokens that launch on major CEXs see notable increases in value as they attract heightened buyer interest. BlockDAG is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering early adopters a unique opportunity to be part of a groundbreaking endeavor. The presale itself reflects the project’s expanding influence, with nearly $200 million already secured. This early funding from institutional traders, tech developers, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts signals strong market confidence in BlockDAG’s ability to innovate within the industry. For potential traders, the current presale batch presents a prime buying opportunity. As the presale progresses, prices are expected to rise, making the present the optimal moment to buy at a favorable rate. With the mainnet launch and upcoming CEX listings, BDAG’s price trajectory is set for significant growth. Seize the Opportunity: BDAG Poised for Substantial Growth BlockDAG’s trajectory is defined not just by its ambitions but also by its proven commitment to scalability, speed, and developer friendliness, ensuring its continued relevance in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. As it plans to introduce several hackathons and integrate over 200 Web3 projects, BlockDAG is reinforcing its reputation as a forward-looking platform. In a market where opportunities can disappear as quickly as they emerge, BlockDAG represents a fleeting chance for considerable returns. With the presale almost reaching $200 million and major exchange launches planned for 2025, the window for early buying is narrowing. Don’t miss out on being part of one of the most significant cryptocurrency success stories of the decade—secure your BDAG coins today.

In a recent post, Kiyosaki shared his positive view regarding the crypto and emphasized Gresham’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law as the core principles that support his view. Robert Kiyosaki Explains Why Bitcoin Outshines The US Dollar in Today’s Economy Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the Rich Dad Poor Dad, recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) about Bitcoin becoming bigger than the US dollar. He said that according to Gresham’s Law bad money chases good money out of circulation. Kiyosaki noted that fiat currencies, including the US dollar, have lost credibility due to inflation and excessive money printing. He said that in this case, Bitcoin, gold and silver are the “good money.” According to Kiyosaki, such assets are turning into the safest places for investing, given that people no longer trust paper currencies. He also pointed out that people have been using physical metals like gold and silver as a means of accepting value for a long time, and now digital currency has been accepted. Robert Kiyosaki added, “Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding.” Notably, Binance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao and “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki have encouraged buying Bitcoin during dips amid rising FOMO. CZ advised responsible investing due to Bitcoin’s volatility, while Kiyosaki emphasized BTC potential for wealth creation, urging individuals to buy for long-term gains. BTC Network Power Using Metcalfe’s Law Kiyosaki also highlighted Metcalfe’s Law, which states that the value of a network grows exponentially with its number of users. He explained that Bitcoin’s expanding network of users and global adoption contributes to its increasing value and influence. This principle has been a key driver in Bitcoin rise as a decentralized asset. He compared Bitcoin’s network growth to established systems like franchise networks and large corporations, which gain power from their scale. Kiyosaki emphasized that BTC decentralized nature allows individuals and businesses to leverage its growing network for transactions and value storage. However, recently, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon reiterated his belief in the US dollar’s dominance, dismissing Bitcoin as a speculative asset and not a threat to global financial stability. While the bank explores blockchain technology for operational efficiency, it remains restricted from directly owning Bitcoin due to regulations. Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver Are Emerging as Alternatives to the US Dollar As the US dollar faces declining global trust, Kiyosaki pointed out that Bitcoin, gold, and silver are challenging its dominance. He noted that the over-reliance on fiat currencies has led to economic instability, prompting individuals to seek alternatives. Bitcoin network, with its limited supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation. Kiyosaki emphasized that the transition to these assets is a natural response to the erosion of purchasing power in fiat currencies. He reiterated his belief that tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin network offer a more reliable store of value during uncertain times. Rich Dad Poor Dad author also warned of an ongoing giant market crash fueled by reckless monetary policies and financial mismanagement. He attributed this economic downturn to government decisions to print excessive amounts of money, which devalues fiat currencies. The author reaffirmed his bullish outlook on Bitcoin, gold, and silver, urging individuals to focus on accumulating these assets. According to Kiyosaki, they represent the best tools for preserving wealth and stability during the current economic climate.

The protocol focused on what Ethereum could achieve if the developers and the broader community shunned some ideologies. The research discussed ways to accelerate Ethereum’s development to maximize its resources. Paradigm on Ethereum Shipping Issues According to the firm, the network ships updates slowly, at one yearly upgrade. It is noted that this is not ideal and is masked by two major concepts it identified as “inertia” and “the need to ossify.” He emphasized the latter reason as the belief that Ethereum may only maintain its decentralization if changes to the core chain are slow. Paradigm pointed out that Ethereum is often torn between the need to balance values and innovation. However, the investment giant noted that Ethereum has yet to maximize its technical capabilities to start placing so much emphasis on values. “We think ossification is too risky for Ethereum. It prevents Ethereum from staying competitive as a platform, as applications and users move toward more centralized alternatives. Ossification also poses its own centralization risks to Ethereum.” As Paradigm also noted, there are ways Ethereum can overcome these challenges. One is encouraging client teams to have a say, not a veto, in development affairs. In addition, the firm said it would allocate more resources to R&D and improve the All Core Devs process. Paradigm’s Role In Improving Ethereum According to the firm, it contributes to Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), drawing on its status as researchers and engineers. Beyond this, it also assists the ETH growth with data analysis and code, focusing on EIP-7862. This EIP, as noted, does not conflict with the rest of the protocol’s roadmap. Beyond this, the research firm said it developed Reth as an SDK to help with Ethereum’s experimentation. It said it is building and supporting foundational tooling to cap its role within the ecosystem. These include but are not limited to Foundary, Alloy, and Solar. To summarize its latest take, Paradigm believes the protocol can perform better if it ships faster. Expected Upgrades and Price Outlook Based on its recent call from all core developers, key stakeholders agreed on a mid-March launch timeline for the Pectra upgrade . This upgrade has been in the works for months and will enhance usability for both developers and ushers. Ultimately, experts believe the changes within the ecosystem will positively impact prices. At the time of writing, ETH was changing hands for $3,341.89, up by 0.48% in 24 hours. Per the long-term projection offered by Bitwise, the ETH price could hit $7,000 this year.

The past year has seen many crypto enthusiasts make a fortune. Bitcoin has soared over 220% from its 2024 price of $46,000 to all-time highs of $109,000, and many new cryptocurrencies have followed suit. Cardano and Ripple holders have been on the favorable end of the crypto market in recent years, with the latter benefiting from a favorable verdict in its battle with the SEC. With the hype in the market reaching record highs, investors are seeking better opportunities to maximize their investments. 1Fuel, which has delivered a 1,700% return for its Stage 1 presale investors , has become a major name on the radar. XRP’s 2025 started on a high note XRP’s success story has been nothing short of spectacular. A victory against the SEC, new all-time highs, and talks of an XRP ETF have all put Ripple in the spotlight this year. Its unique proposition as a one-stop shop for low-cost cross-border payments may be debated, but its momentum and positive market sentiment cannot be denied. The question on everyone’s mind is: After this SEC victory, what’s next for Ripple? With the price approaching overbought territory, investors are carefully weighing their options for the next big coin to buy. 1Fuel has already emerged as a clear option. With no multi-wallet concerns, seamless cross-chain interoperability, and a strong, unified community, it stands out as a top contender. What next after Cardano hits $1 Soaring to $1.30 was a landmark achievement for Cardano. The almost three-year wait to reach $1 was worth it, but the question on everyone's mind is: What’s next? Cardano seems to need a catalyst to push higher, and the lack of one is evident in its price chart, which suggests a drop to the $0.55 zone is more likely. While chatter about a potential Cardano ETF is growing, it is unlikely to significantly move the needle. With nearly 10 other cryptocurrencies vying for an ETF, and Bitcoin and Ethereum firmly cementing their status as the leading cryptocurrencies, Cardano faces stiff competition. Cardano holders are now turning their attention to a cryptocurrency that doesn’t rely on an ETF, boasts cutting-edge technology, and prioritizes security and privacy 1Fuel ($OFT). Why the hype on 1Fuel 1Fuel is positioning itself as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency industry. With its disposable wallets and inbuilt mixers, privacy and ease of use are brought to the forefront as key focuses of the technology. However, privacy and ease are just the beginning. The 1Fuel platform integrates a wide range of features into one cohesive ecosystem. The goal isn’t simply to be another name in the crypto market but to redefine what cryptocurrencies stand for and drive global adoption. The hype surrounding 1Fuel is already evident in its presales. From a Stage 1 presale price of $0.01 to its current presale price of $0.17, investors are seeing significant gains. Many cryptocurrency analysts predict that 1Fuel could soar by as much as 50x after it lists on exchanges. The presale is underway, offering you the opportunity to secure 1Fuel ($OFT) at the lowest possible price.

Meow, Jupiter’s founder, shared the acquisition update with the community in a post on X. Notably, Moonshot is an app that enables the purchase of memecoins via Apple Pay. Strategic Acquisition to Enhance Memecoin Engagement According to Meow’s announcement, Jupiter has become the primary owner of Moonshot. Users can, therefore, look forward to Moonshot benefitting from the resources of Jupiter and an alignment of goals going forward. The acquisition could result in a unique blend of both entities, as Meow lauded and complimented the Moonshot team. The team is amongst the most innovative, driven group of people I have ever met,” he wrote in his post. This highlights that Moonshot’s team could add significant expertise and value to Jupiter. Industry stakeholders have suggested that the collaboration focuses on memes, digital culture, or humor-based projects. Moonshot’s Amazing Performance Notably, memecoins remain a viable way of engaging users in the crypto space. A clear example was the surprise launch of Donald Trump’s Official Trump (TRUMP) on January 18, 2025. The token immediately gained traction in crypto and beyond, with many raking in huge profits from the project. Interestingly, Moonshot’s popularity soared after the launch of TRUMP. Although it was launched in July 2024, Moonshot did not make much of a splash, remaining in the 309th position on the U.S. App Store ranking as of January 1, 2025. However, following the launch of TRUMP memecoin, Moonshot jumped to the top spot, buoyed by the sentiments. This saw Moonshot’s trading volume leap by approximately $400 million. This positive effect also rubbed off on Solana and pushed it to a new all-time high (ATH) of $294.33 on January 19. Jupiter’s Planned Airdrops and Ecosystem Growth Meanwhile, Jupiter has plans to carry out a major token airdrop worth $580 million this January. According to the announcement last month, it would distribute about 700 million tokens to stakers, users, and contributors in the community. Aside from using it as a loyalty reward program, the airdrop could also attract new users to the platform.

Why Crypto Traders are Crypto dumping Dogecoin (DOGE) at $0.40 Dogecoin (DOGE) price tumbled towards $0.35 on Saturday, January 25, down 20% within the 7-day timeframe. Market data analysis reveals key reasons DOGE traders are taking on a bearish outlook this week. Profit-Taking Following Trump’s Inauguration Leading up to President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, DOGE saw a significant rally, surging from $0.10 to $0.40—a 300% increase. This surge was largely driven by market optimism surrounding Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency stance and the appointment of Elon Musk to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). The inauguration served as a catalyst for profit-taking, with many investors liquidating their positions to realize gains, contributing to the recent price decline. Dogecoin Price Action DOGE price has experienced a 20% decline over the past week, trading around $0.35 as of January 25, 2025. This downturn coincides with the introduction of new memecoins associated with President Donald Trump on the Solana blockchain.2. 2. Emergence of Trump’s Memecoins on Solana On January 18, 2025, President Trump announced the launch of the $TRUMP token on the Solana blockchain. The token quickly gained traction, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion shortly after its release. Trump Launches Official Memecoins, January 20 | Source: X.com The rapid ascent of $TRUMP and similar tokens has diverted investor attention and capital away from DOGE, leading to decreased demand and downward price pressure on Dogecoin. 3. Concerns Over Political Associations The establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and its association with Dogecoin has introduced political considerations for investors. Some market participants are cautious about potential regulatory scrutiny or reputational risks stemming from the cryptocurrency’s perceived alignment with the current administration. Speculators hint Elon Musk could deploy Dogecoin for D.O.GE | Source: X.com Emphasizing this stance, after talks of Dogecoin logo on the official D.O.G.E website, speculations have emerged that Elon Musk might be considering untilzing the Dogecoin blockchain for some of the agency’s activity. This apprehension has led certain investors to reduce or exit their DOGE holdings, further contributing to the recent price decline. In summary, the combination of profit-taking post-inauguration, the rise of competing memecoins like $TRUMP, and concerns over political affiliations has collectively influenced Dogecoin’s recent market performance. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast: Potential Drop to $0.31 Support Dogecoin price forecast chart show that the memecoin currently trades at $0.359, posting modest 2.53% intraday gain. However, the technical indicators suggest a potential bearish shift in the near term. The Keltner Channel highlights DOGE’s price struggling to reclaim the median band at $0.36, with the upper resistance at $0.42 remaining untested since the recent rejection. The Parabolic SAR indicators remain above the price action, signaling bearish momentum dominance. The recent 19.55% price drop over seven days reflects weakening buyer strength, as evidenced by declining volumes post-recovery. Dogecoin Price Forecast | DOGEUSD In a bullish scenario, DOGE would need to reclaim and sustain levels above $0.36 while breaking the upper Keltner Channel resistance near $0.42. A rise in RSI above 55.00 could signal renewed bullish momentum, driven by increased market interest. However, in a bearish case, DOGE risks breaking below immediate support at $0.35, with a potential drop toward the critical $0.31 support. A further RSI dip below 50.00 would confirm overselling pressure, while decreasing trading volumes support this outlook.

Currently in its presale, Remittix has seen close to 3 million token sales, generating about $6.2 million in total. Set to revolutionize crypto-to-fiat PayFi protocol, this token’s appeal keeps investors increasing their holdings. Dogecoin's Price Rally Using advanced AI models, analysts forecast Dogecoin's price could reach $1 this year. According to CoinCodex’s prediction, the popular crypto prediction platform, Dogecoin, could hit the $1 milestone by the end of March 2025. The platform forecasts DOGE could attain the $1.04 milestone by the end of the first quarter and even reach $1.11 by April — an over 215% surge from its current price. As of this press, Dogecoin is trading at 0.3558, a 1.0% rise in the past day. However, its price has been far from impressive in recent days, down by 8.2% in the past week. Dogecoin's loss came at the time Shiba Inu’s image was removed from the newly launched D.O.G.E. website —created by the Department Of Government Efficiency. Interestingly, the website is unrelated to Dogecoin but its name garnered attention within the crypto community due to similarity to DOGE. This removal also marked a sharp decline in Dogecoin's trading volume, falling by 75%. If this bearish trend continues, RTX could overcome DOGE in no time. Bonk Loses First Place To TRUMP Meanwhile, Bonk, a Solana memecoin has seen a better price rally in the past few days, with 7.8% and 11.2% rise in the past week and 14 days respectively. However, its price is still down by 7.2% in the past one month. Meanwhile, Bonk had a beautiful run late last year, reaching a new all-time high at $0.00005916 in November 2024. Bonk currently trades at $0.00003114, marking a year-to-date growth of 196%. Bonk’s market cap currently stands at $2.3 billion, with 24 hours trading volume of $389k. As such, a new entrant in the crypto scene $TRUMP has now flipped Bonk in market cap, tripling Bonk’s as it reaches $6.92 Billion. Meanwhile, analysts project RTX to have even a better run when launch, which could see it also flip Bonk's market cap within a week. Can RTX Obliterate Dogecoin and Bonk? With mixed signals dominating Dogecoin's price and $Trump token flipping Bonk, analysts are overly bullish on RTX’s price prediction, a crypto token that could be the hallmark of this bull run. Citing numerous use cases with patterns mirroring the early days of Solana, analysts predict this token could obliterate Dogecoin and Bonk, giving investors monumental returns on their investment. Remittix, the platform behind the RTX token, is transforming international payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions. Supporting about 50 cryptocurrencies, Remittix enables seamless conversion to fiat currencies like USD and EUR. It offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional systems such as SWIFT. With a transparent flat-fee model, Remittix ensures recipients receive the exact amount sent without hidden charges. Additionally, businesses can utilize the platform’s API for efficient international payroll, converting crypto payments into fiat and directly depositing funds into employees’ bank accounts, streamlining global operations and reducing costs. For transparency, remittix prioritizes user autonomy and security, eliminating third-party involvement in transactions. With audits from Solidproof and BlockSAFU, Remittix also offers a reliable and trusted infrastructure, and Remittix’s locked team tokens for three years eliminates the chance for insider sell-offs and reinforces investor confidence. Priced at $0.0311 during its presale the RTX token offers a promising investment opportunity for any ambitious investors; with a capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens and forecasts of up to 100x returns in 2025, Remittix is well-positioned to transform the cross-border payments sector, obliterating Dogecoin and Bonk in profit potential. What makes Remittix particularly impressive is the way investors are rallying around the token. The Remittix presale has already raised $6.2 million, selling over 320 million tokens in total. Participants who keyed into the project have seen 100% rise in their holdings with analysts expecting the price to surge by 800% as the presale unfolds.

Currently in presale, Remittix has sold nearly 3 million tokens, bringing in approximately $6.2 million in total. Positioned to transform the crypto-to-fiat PayFi protocol, this token's growing appeal continues to attract more investors. Dogecoin's Price Surge Utilizing sophisticated AI models, analysts predict Dogecoin's price could reach $1 this year. CoinCodex, a well-known crypto prediction platform, anticipates that Dogecoin could achieve the $1 mark by the end of March 2025. The platform projects that DOGE could hit $1.04 by the end of the first quarter and reach $1.11 by April — a leap of over 215% from its current value. At this press time, Dogecoin is trading at 0.3558, reflecting a 1.0% increase in the past day. However, its performance in recent days has been underwhelming, with an 8.2% decline over the past week. Dogecoin's downturn coincided with the removal of Shiba Inu’s image from the newly launched D.O.G.E. website, created by the Department Of Government Efficiency. Although the site is unrelated to Dogecoin, its name caught the crypto community's attention due to its resemblance to DOGE. This removal also coincided with a significant drop in Dogecoin's trading volume, which decreased by 75%. If this bearish trend persists, RTX could quickly overtake DOGE. Bonk Overtaken by TRUMP Meanwhile, Bonk, a memecoin on the Solana blockchain, has experienced a more favorable price rally recently, with increases of 7.8% and 11.2% over the past week and 14 days respectively. However, its price remains down by 7.2% over the last month. Bonk enjoyed a remarkable surge late last year, reaching a new all-time high of $0.00005916 in November 2024. Bonk is currently trading at $0.00003114, showing a year-to-date growth of 196%. Its market cap stands at $2.3 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $389k. In the meantime, a newcomer in the crypto space, $TRUMP, has surpassed Bonk in market cap, tripling Bonk's figure as it reaches $6.92 billion. Analysts predict that RTX could perform even better upon launch, potentially overtaking Bonk's market cap within a week. Will RTX Surpass Dogecoin and Bonk? With mixed signals affecting Dogecoin's price and the $Trump token overtaking Bonk, analysts are very optimistic about RTX’s price outlook, seeing it as a potential standout in this bull run. Drawing parallels with the early success of Solana, experts believe this token could surpass Dogecoin and Bonk, providing investors with substantial returns.

What makes Remittix particularly notable is the strong investor support for the token. The Remittix presale has already raised $6.2 million, selling over 320 million tokens in total.

This portends a 90-day restructuring plan into which the protocol appears to be entering. Those familiar with the situation say it has been catalyzed by fears of insolvency. While trading on the platform remains active, the associated token, $RUNE, has not been able to make headway and is down 30%. THORChain halts THORFi lending over insolvency fears, kicking off a 90-day restructuring plan. Trading stays active, but $RUNE is down 30%. This pause feels like a ‘bankruptcy freeze’ to avoid a liquidity crisis. Will they pull through? pic.twitter.com/GvDL01HGEn — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) January 24, 2025 THORFi Lending Halted: A Bankruptcy Freeze in Disguise? Numerous commentators have analogized the decision to stop THORFi lending with a “bankruptcy freeze,” a precautionary measure often taken to prevent a liquidity crisis. THORChain states that the pause allows it to deal with “some structural issues” within its THORFi lending services while it recalibrates the entirety of that operation. The lending service will not be available for three months, according to announcements made by THORChain and on the THORFi website. The financial health of the protocol has come under fire with the sudden suspension. Critics have even gone so far as to accuse it of insolvency. They have raised serious doubts about whether THORChain is able to meet its obligations and, if not, what that means for the growing number of users that rely on it. The situation is putting immense pressure on $RUNE, which has already lost nearly a third of its value over the past few days. Financial Troubles Cast a Shadow Over THORChain A decentralized liquidity protocol that enables cross-chain swaps, THORChain has for some time occupied a vital position within the DeFi sector. Recently, however, it has experienced some financial difficulties that have made some observers raise doubt about its future. A primary concern is whether the platform’s reserves are even sufficient to cover its obligations. Critics point to possible mismatches between the assets that the protocol holds and the liabilities tied to its lending services. If these gaps exist, they’re a ticking time bomb that could lead to significant, not to say catastrophic, liquidity issues. Compounding the problems is the steep drop in the value of $RUNE. As the protocol’s native token, $RUNE has a critical role in the THORChain ecosystem. It serves as a medium of exchange and collateral, underpinning the whole system. When a native token drops significantly in price, it impacts confidence in the system and the ability to attract and retain users. The trending cryptocurrencies getting the highest increases in discussion Friday include: Bitcoin $BTC : US President Trump has made an executive order regarding a national digital asset stockpile, which affects Bitcoin custody by banks. The order rescinds prior… pic.twitter.com/riWOR4400L — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 24, 2025 Market Reaction: $RUNE Takes a Hit The reaction of the market to the news has been quick and intense. The $RUNE price falling 30% clearly shows that investors are deeply concerned about THORChain’s financial stability. There is a clear decrease in both trading volume and confidence in the platform. When something like this happens, what we usually do in the writing community is pull back and look at the facts available to us before moving forward in the narrative. Even in this time of turmoil, THORChain trading proceeds apace. The platform has assured users that it will continue to operate core functions while it restructures. Increased activity on the RUNE token suggests that users are betting on RUNE’s replacement of asset pool balances to keep THORChain itself from stalling. Still, assurances and RUNE token activity haven’t quashed fears that pausing the lending feature signals deeper problems within the protocol. The 90-Day Restructuring Plan: A Path to Recovery? THORChain has announced a 90-day restructuring plan, and it’s a doozy. It’s probably the most significant step that THORChain could take for its platform and its users. Not much is known about the plan yet, but looking at the few details that are available—along with what we know about the impending hard fork—offers some insight into just what might be happening over the next three months. Although some see the restructuring as a necessary step toward recovery, others are skeptical. The platform’s financial position is so unclear that people are speculating up and down about the true extent of its problems. The next three months are going to be critical for THORChain—either it will establish itself as a functioning, sustainable platform, or it won’t. Implications for the Broader DeFi Ecosystem The problems that THORChain has encountered shine a light on the vulnerabilities that still exist in the DeFi ecosystem. Even though decentralized platforms are offering some new and innovative solutions to the kinds of problems that we face in the financial transaction space, they are not risk-free, particularly when it comes to liquidity management and other issues that are related to, or that fall under the umbrella of, market fluctuations. DeFi protocols should heed THORChain’s cautionary tale. They need to be well-planned and financially sound. They also need to be transparent so that users and investors—in this case, daring participants in decentralized finance—can make responsible decisions about the use of and investment in DeFi protocols. DeFi finance is real finance, with a real need for responsible participants. Conclusion: Uncertainty Ahead for THORChain The THORChain lending protocol has had to hit the brakes. It’s now not lending, but THORFi, in recent days, has been too uncertain for the team to go on with lending. And that’s obviously a turbulent situation for the team. It’s a challenge for the protocol and the team to navigate through allegations of insolvency. And when you walk into the allegations of insolvency, it certainly walks directly through user confidence and into the user experience. At this point, the main concentration is on $RUNE, which keeps taking the hits from the market’s uncertainty. As the plan to restructure the whole thing plays out, every set of eyes that can will be watching THORChain to see if it can pull off a restoration of trust and come up with a reaffirmation of its position as a key player in the DeFi space. Until then, the caution that it may have urged in the past is now, plainly, its better part. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While these big names have seen steady growth, this rising star promises even bigger gains, thanks to its innovative features and growing community. If you're looking for the best coin to invest today, this altcoin might just be your best bet for success! Solana (SOL) Shows Strength Despite Challenges Rising 34% already this year, Solana's native token, SOL, has been performing nicely in 2025. Though it still challenges to keep above the $260 support level, the token's price rose by 7% on January 22 to reach $263.54. Excitement about meme coin trading, particularly following the release of the Official Trump (Trump) token on January 18, accounts for a great portion of this increase. Although SOL might rise further, breaking beyond $280 could take some time. The token peaked at $295 on January 19, but certain signs point to difficulties for it currently. For instance, from $35.5 million on January 19 to $11.7 million on January 21 Solana's network fees dropped by 67%. Usually, lower fees translate into less trading activity on dispersed exchanges (DEXs) such as Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca. Solana's general activity stays better than last week even with these declines, indicating that the network is still robust. SOL's performance is under intense observation by analysts as it can potentially make another step toward record highs. For now, it reminds us that although Solana is developing, market conditions change fast. Cardano’s Journey to $4, What’s Next for ADA? With its price down 3.56% over the previous 24 hours and 7.65% over the past week, Cardano (ADA) is now trading at $0.9711. Still, it's not all bad news; ADA's last month's rise of 7.69% indicates that it is maintaining support at crucial levels. This might indicate, according to analysts, a future possible price breakout. Expert in cryptocurrencies Ali Martinez has seen a rise in daily active addresses of Cardano throughout January. More individuals are utilizing the network, a clear sign of expansion. Historically, when network activity rises like this, prices usually follow with rising motions. ADA might be laying the groundwork for a rise here. Still, there is not perfect sailing. On hourly charts, a ""death cross"" pattern points to ADA maybe suffering further temporary losses. This is the situation when two moving averages cross in typically declining fashion. Furthermore, a lot of futures market traders are predicting that ADA would decline much more, which would have further negative influence. Cardano's rapid expansion and high user engagement suggest better days ahead despite these obstacles. Is ADA still on course for $4? Time will prove. Remittix (RTX) Is The Best Coin to Invest Today Remittix (RTX) is grabbing attention as the best coin to invest today, standing out as a revolutionary project in the world of cryptocurrencies.

While these established cryptocurrencies have experienced consistent growth, this emerging contender promises even more impressive returns, driven by its cutting-edge features and expanding user base. If you're searching for the top cryptocurrency investment today, this altcoin could be your ideal choice for achieving financial success! Solana (SOL) Displays Resilience Amidst Obstacles Solana's native token, SOL, has already increased by 34% this year, showing solid performance in 2025. Although maintaining a position above the $260 support level remains challenging, the token's price saw a 7% rise on January 22, reaching $263.54. The surge in meme coin trading, especially after the launch of the Official Trump (Trump) token on January 18, significantly contributed to this growth. While SOL may continue to ascend, surpassing the $280 mark might require more time. The token hit a high of $295 on January 19, but several indicators suggest difficulties ahead. For example, Solana's network fees plummeted by 67%, from $35.5 million on January 19 to $11.7 million on January 21. Typically, lower fees indicate reduced trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca. Despite these declines, Solana's overall activity remains stronger than the previous week, reflecting the network's resilience. Analysts are closely monitoring SOL's progress as it could potentially break new records. For now, it serves as a reminder that while Solana is evolving, market dynamics can shift rapidly. Cardano's Path to $4: What Lies Ahead for ADA? Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.9711, with a decrease of 3.56% over the past 24 hours and 7.65% over the last week. However, there is a silver lining; ADA's 7.69% increase over the past month shows that it is maintaining its position at critical support levels. Analysts believe this could signal a potential price breakout in the future. Cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez has observed an increase in daily active addresses on Cardano's network throughout January. This uptick in user activity is a positive sign of growth. Historically, when network engagement rises, prices often follow suit. ADA might be setting the stage for an upward trend here. Nonetheless, the journey isn’t entirely smooth. A ""death cross"" pattern on hourly charts suggests ADA could face more short-term losses. This occurs when two moving averages cross in a typical downward pattern. Additionally, many futures market traders are betting on a further decline in ADA, which could exert additional downward pressure. Despite these hurdles, Cardano's rapid growth and high user engagement point to promising times ahead. Will ADA reach the $4 mark? Only time will tell.

39501712,https://nulltx.com/?p=141044,1737845619,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Analyzing TRUMP and MELANIA Token Metrics: Diverging Trends and Unique Behaviors,https://nulltx.com/analyzing-trump-and-melania-token-metrics-diverging-trends-and-unique-behaviors/,"The on-chain activity linked to the TRUMP ($TRUMP) and MELANIA ($MELANIA) tokens has piqued the interest of the crypto community. Named after two of today’s most visible public figures, these tokens have revealed some extremely distinct holder behaviors, with real and potential PNL (profit and loss) that have marked them as something of an asset. And while the world was watching last week, both the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens were making primetime headlines, with some developments that are horning in on the usually low-profile space of crypto asset custody. Wallet Creation Patterns: A Shared Origin A truly remarkable statistic is the considerable crossover between the creation of wallets and the acquisition of tokens. Almost half of the holders of $TRUMP and $MELANIA created their wallets on the same day they bought these tokens. This strange behavior indicates that a lot of really interested people were making their first purchases of crypto. We are clearly in the midst of a meme token moment, with these two tokens virally attracting a lot of new entrants to the ecosystem. Profitability Metrics: TRUMP Outpaces MELANIA In terms of profitability, $TRUMP traders appear to have done better than their $MELANIA counterparts. Most $TRUMP traders are at a net loss, but the number of traders making profits between $10,000 and $10 million exceeds the number of traders reporting losses of that same magnitude. This signals that while many $TRUMP traders have not succeeded in making profitable trades, a handful of them has managed to steer the token in a direction that allowed for some “cash in hand.” By contrast, reported $MELANIA traders had a significantly greater percentage of negative PNL outcomes. This difference highlights trading dynamics and market sentiment discrepancies between the two tokens. $MELANIA trading activities seem to have been more concentrated among a few participants, which may explain the heightened loss likelihood. Trading Behavior: A Tale of Two Sell-Offs The patterns of selling for $TRUMP and $MELANIA reveal further differences in trader behavior. For $TRUMP, the largest sell-offs seem to have happened on January 19, when the price was over $60. On this day alone, traders who sold $TRUMP (and only $TRUMP) sold tokens worth approximately $78 million. And this was on a day when the token was surging. So what were these traders up to? Well, if you ask the tokenomics team, they’ll say it was a wave of profit-taking among sellers who seemingly sought to capitalize on the surge. In contrast, $MELANIA’s sell-off was concentrated in time. The majority of $MELANIA tokens were sold within the first four hours after the token’s launch, with a total sell volume of around $98 million. This rapid liquidation suggests that many early buyers saw $MELANIA as an opportunity with a very short window for making gains, leading to quick profit-taking and a trading activity level that fell off a cliff after those first four hours. Token Distribution: A Concentration of Small Holders Another important factor is the distribution of token ownership among $TRUMP and $MELANIA holders. More than 80% of holders for both tokens own less than $1,000 worth of assets on Solana. This distribution highlights the pixels of these tokens, and it shows in really bold letters that the buy button is being pushed by main street—by retail investors, that is. And that’s not a bad thing; in fact, it’s seemingly a good thing for these Solana-based meme tokens. And it is certainly a much, much better thing than if these tokens were being owned and controlled by a handful of big players. TRUMP & MELANIA Onchain Metrics 1/6 Nearly half of $TRUMP and $MELANIA holders created their wallets on the same day they purchased the tokens. pic.twitter.com/7wtEOIM1W4 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) January 24, 2025 What These Metrics Tell Us On-chain data for $TRUMP and $MELANIA reveals the unique dynamics of meme-token markets. Both tokens drew much interest from newcomers to the space, as evidenced by a ton of new wallets created to trade the assets. But what happened after the wallets were created didn’t look too similar for $TRUMP and $MELANIA, with their trading patterns and profitability outcomes diverging significantly in a very short amount of time. The data for $TRUMP indicates a kind of activity that is a mix of speculation and strategic profit-taking. Some traders have been trying to catch $TRUMP’s volatility and have done so quite successfully to secure them some very nice gains. $MELANIA, however, is showing us an entirely different picture. The concentrated sell-off occurring in $MELANIA alongside a pretty pronounced negative PNL outcome trend has us believing that $MELANIA isn’t giving its traders the kinds of favorable long-term holding conditions that we occasionally see in $TRUMP. Looking Ahead The crypto market is still developing, and the tokens that are created in its meme image, like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, are sure to remain a hot-button issue. While the viral nature of these assets can easily generate huge levels of interest and trading volumes, their speculative nature makes them risky investments. Meme tokens are held mostly by small-scale holders, and because these tokens are so volatile, caution is warranted. If you’re contemplating trading in or investing in meme tokens, attempting to understand the metrics and behind-the-scene workings of the market can yield useful insights into the nature of the potential risks and rewards that are part and parcel of this very speculative asset class. In the end, both $TRUMP and $MELANIA, through their rise and downfall, remind us of the speculative charm of meme tokens and their almost child-like appeal to the crypto community. They may not last or hold any real value, but if they can get people talking, thinking, and imagining, then they’ve done what all good tokens are supposed to do.

39501882,https://nulltx.com/?p=141048,1737845914,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Fresh Wallet 0x977 Makes Major $OM Moves: A Whale is on the Hunt?,https://nulltx.com/fresh-wallet-0x977-makes-major-om-moves-a-whale-is-on-the-hunt/,"In a development that has caught the attention of the crypto community, an active cryptocurrency wallet , 0x977, is making a name for itself in the market. Just 15 hours ago, it withdrew a staggering amount of over 616,610 $OM tokens (worth $2.23 million) from the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. This withdrawal, mind you, was not an isolated event. In the past 36 hours, the wallet has amassed an aggressive total of $OM tokens, withdrawing a total of 1.859 million tokens from Binance. The average price for these tokens (according to the crypto news site Blockworks) was $3.627. That means the wallet has invested an estimated $6.74 million in those tokens. And as you might expect, lots of folks in the crypto community are now rightfully asking questions. A Coordinated Accumulation of $OM: Whale Behavior or a Bigger Play? The attention the crypto community has given the wallet’s latest activity is perhaps understandable. It is not every day, after all, that a newly active wallet makes such large-scale and obviously orchestrated withdrawals of such an obviously valuable asset—especially with the amount of $OM tokens involved. In fact, the sheer scale of these operations is more than enough to prompt a discussion about whether we are just looking at a single whale making a very profitable move or a part of some larger, whale-led scheme to depress token prices. What makes this specific whale behavior captivating is that it seems not to be a single occurrence. Other wallets have been seen not just being, well, wallet-ish, but also showing heightened activity and accumulating $OM tokens. Could this be a sign of something larger looming? Are these several wallets working together in some sort of financial choreography to raise the token’s price or, just maybe, to set the stage for a big, coordinated sell-off? This conduct is frequently observed among big market players who try to amass a position prior to making a significant move—usually either an upward price shift triggered by new developments or, conversely, a large-scale dumping operation. The fact that a single digital wallet has moved over $6 million worth of tokens in such a short time span is an ominous sign for the token’s price and could indicate that the price is about to go down. This activity has an outsized impact on the price of tokens. If other investors begin to note the substantial positions these wallets are establishing, we could see a real uptrend in interest and an uptick in buying pressure. Conversely, if the wallets doing all this aren’t doing it for fun and are looking to cash out, we could see a large sell-off that would have a dramatic effect on the price of $OM in the very near future. A Closer Look at $OM’s Recent Performance To completely grasp the influence of these latest whale moves, it’s necessary to assess the recent performance of $OM itself. This token has captured the attention of a lot of investors, and for a good reason. It has shown some serious price movement of late. Right now, the price of $OM sits at $3.627 per token, but the volume of those recent withdrawals suggests that a lot of people believe $OM has a lot more room to run. 0x977’s actions could indicate a belief in $OM’s possible upside. With $OM trading at about $3.627, this wallet’s buying signifies a heavy bet on the token. “Whales” like 0x977 usually don’t accumulate without a good reason. Given the kind of price volatility that $OM has already seen, not to mention the speculative nature of many meme coins and altcoins, these large-scale purchases could be setting up for a massive price movement in one direction or the other. Fresh Wallet 0x977 Goes Big on $OM A newly active wallet, 0x977, just made another significant move, withdrawing 616,610 #OM ($2.23M) from Binance 15 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/v8rfKLJQeM — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) January 25, 2025 Although no conclusive proof indicates that $OM will tread the same way as some of the more famous altcoins that have seen their prices explode, the recent attention and enthusiasm around it have traders watching closely. In recent days, and alongside the broader market uptick, $OM has seen a dramatic uptick in withdrawals and wallet activity. If this keeps up, pulls the price up with it, and fills back into the exchanges, it could trigger a nice little price rally. What’s Next for $OM? The main issue at hand is what’s next for $OM and the wallets that have been implicated. Historically, large holders, or whales, have bought up lots of crypto, made some big moves, and then our favorite tokens have moved in some kind of phase. Whether $OM and its wallets are going to make some kind of price phase next week remains a mystery. Investors in cryptocurrency will be observing attentively to determine if larger wallets enter the market and whether the price of $OM sees a remarkable uptick in the next few days. Given the level of activity around this token, it seems certain that $OM is poised to make a significant move in the near future—upwards, if demand continues to swell, and downwards, if the increased activity turns out to be the prelude to a substantial sell-off. To conclude, the activities of wallet 0x977 and others have infused fresh vigor into the $OM market. Although, whether this will amount to any significant price action or not will depend largely on the state of the macro markets, right now, with the macro being what it is, all eyes are on $OM and the whales playing a pivotal role in its price trajectory.

This new AI altcoin is generating whispers of unparalleled potential, and experts predict it could deliver a staggering 40,000% market edge. This coin’s unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology positions it as a game-changer, and its disruptive potential is drawing the attention of seasoned Ripple whales seeking the next exponential growth opportunity. What sets this AI altcoin, PCHAIN apart is its innovative use of AI, the Metaverse, and smart contracts to redefine the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. As Ripple whales quietly accumulate positions, their movements suggest confidence in this coin’s ability to redefine market dynamics. PCHAIN: The AI Altcoin In Question PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate tokenization platform. The token gives investors early access to the future of the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market. Unlike most traditional crypto assets that thrive on market sentiment, this innovative AI altcoin is backed by the number one asset class in the world. According to leading market experts, PCHAIN is positioned for a massive 40,000% rally, making it a potential top-gainer in the crypto space. Although an emerging AI altcoin, Ripple whales see huge potential in the asset, which is why these seasoned investors are quietly joining the ongoing PCHAIN presale. Why Ripple Whales Are Paying Attention Ripple whales , known for their strategic investments, are very good at spotting opportunities before they hit the mainstream. Their recent interest in this AI altcoin, PCHAIN, is based on several compelling factors: Unmatched Growth Potential A 40,000% market edge is not a figure to ignore.

Digitalization of Real World Assets This is a great revolution in the real estate sector As PropiChain plans to digitalize all real estate assets and transactions, ensuring trades on a secure blockchain network eradicating the need for physical documentations. In addition this further stretches to the fractional ownership of assets allowing small scale investors to buy, sell, own and manage properties in fractions rather than as a whole. Through this process, homeowners can access financing at lower interest rates, similar to traditional HELOCs, thereby providing a more accessible and affordable financing option for property owners. 3D Metaverse Property Exploration Metaverse implementation allows international investors to explore properties virtually from anywhere in the world creating more customized options of home, offices, and commercial spaces. Its immersive 3D environment creates a more dynamic and interactive experience that far surpasses traditional methods reducing uncertainty and enhancing confidence in purchase decisions. Its AR/VR capabilities also eradicate a geographical barrier that might be an hindrance during property exploration making real estate transactions more accessible and convenient, whether it’s discussing terms or even finalizing a deal.

This is a noticeable trend as the amount of BTC available on centralized exchanges (CEXs) continues to drop. HODLers are still HODLing, and we are seeing a shift to an even more favorable supply-and-demand picture for BTC, with long-term holders clearly becoming more and more reluctant to sell their coins. BTC recorded $800M in net outflows from exchanges this week, showing demand is still strong as supply available on CEXs continues to decrease pic.twitter.com/6raOgFV0Q1 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 25, 2025 Hodler Selling and the Rise of Bitcoin Dominance A large part of this story is the long-term holders of Bitcoin selling, especially after Donald Trump was elected in November 2024. Since then, they have moved an estimated 500,000 BTC, worth around $50 billion, from their addresses. The good part of this trend is that it seems to indicate a slowdown in selling activity. And what’s good about that is that it aligns with a growing sentiment that Bitcoin is once again primed for further upward momentum. Hodler selling accelerated since Trump's election, with 500k BTC (~$50B) leaving long-term holders' addresses since November pic.twitter.com/xcpmBFwSHe — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 24, 2025 The metric that tracks BTC’s share of the total cryptocurrency market, called Bitcoin dominance, is again on the upswing. After hitting an approximate low of 54% in December 2024, BTC dominance has surged back above 57% in January 2025, signaling a renewed interest in what is still the leading cryptocurrency. This behavior, in which BTC dominance casts a shadow well over $1 trillion, echoes what happened in the 2020 cycle, in which Bitcoin’s price also saw a wall-to-wall significant rally. Back then, BTC dominance bottomed out at around 60% in November 2020 before rallying to 69% in January 2021. #Bitcoin dominance is climbing again. After bottoming in December 2024 at ~54%, #BTC dominance has surged past 57% in January 2025. This mirrors the 2020 cycle, where $BTC dominance bottomed in Nov '20 (~60%), then rallied to 69% in Jan '21 before its decline:… pic.twitter.com/ekqfdoIach — glassnode (@glassnode) January 24, 2025 The current market dynamics are best understood in relation to the dominance of Bitcoin and its price. In the last cycle, as the price of BTC began to increase, dominance began to decrease. This decrease signaled not just a shift in the price of Bitcoin but also a shift in what investors were interested in purchasing. After the price of Bitcoin had reached new highs, investors appeared to have resumed moving toward riskier assets—the next-high-altcoin or whatever else promises strong returns when the market is believed to be bullish—after allegedly having crowdsourced the safety of the appearing-to-be stable, first-in-market asset. Key Support Level and the Spot ETF Inflows To keep its bullish price momentum, Bitcoin must hold above some key support levels. One of those is $97,877, where more than 101,000 BTC were amassed. Holding this level, the analysts say, is crucial for keeping the kind of “upward price pressure” on Bitcoin that has the potential to take it where it wants to go—up. The key support level for #Bitcoin is at $97,877, where more than 101,000 $BTC were accumulated. Holding above this level is crucial to sustaining the bullish momentum. pic.twitter.com/4kMR5ZtkWa — Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 On January 24, significant institutional interest was directed toward Bitcoin. For the seventh consecutive day, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw inflows, amassing a net total of $518 million over that time. One of the main drivers behind that surge in interest was Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), which alone saw a net inflow of $186 million. And by the time January 24 rolled around, the Bitcoin spot ETFs overall had a net asset value of an impressive $123.058 billion. The current state of affairs for the dominance of Bitcoin, along with the inflows of capital into Bitcoin ETFs, tells us that institutional investors are making some big bets on this leading digital asset. They’re betting on not just the sustained outperformance of Bitcoin but also its potential to become a go-to asset in times of crisis, which is what it looks set to become given the uncertain shape of international markets at the moment. On January 24, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was $518 million, with net inflow for 7 consecutive days. The inflow of Fidelity ETF FBTC was $186 million. The current total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETF is $123.058 billion. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/ykhS8zZR5p — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2025 What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s rising dominance, ongoing institutional inflows, and dwindling exchange supply leave the cryptocurrency’s current outlook hard to dispute: it’s bullish. But there’s another reason for optimism, one that takes us to the end of 2024 and beyond. In addition, this asset’s sustained growth in the popularity of Bitcoin ETFs provides yet another support layer. The price of Bitcoin may keep enjoying the continued benefit of a steady stream of institutional capital as more people invest in these vehicles. Most people seem to believe that the price of Bitcoin will keep going up, but few if any, prices are set without some sort of “support level” being in place. Markets seem to be eyeing the $97,877 mark as a support level, and if Bitcoin can hold above that price, it’s “probably” going to keep moving up. To sum up, Bitcoin is reiterating its vigor as a market leader. The mixture of a blow-up in its dominance, a growing interest from institutions, and a supply that is all but nonexistent on exchanges makes the prospect of further price appreciation seem quite likely. Should the crucial support levels hold and inflows from institutions continue, it seems quite probable that we will see a new all-time high in 2025.

Priced at $0.0199 initially but rising to $0.0311, Remittix (RTX) is now hailed as the fastest-growing presale around. But what sets it apart from countless other tokens? Below, we’ll explore why thousands are grabbing RTX right now, how it tackles everyday payments and how it could reshape crypto usage for both newcomers and veterans alike. Remittix's Meteoric Growth: The Figures Speak for Themselves Presales often lose momentum if there's nothing substantial behind the buzz. However, Remittix has demonstrated it's more than just hype. Surpassing the $5 million mark, the altcoin has accelerated from an initial $0.0199 to $0.0311 within weeks. This rapid ascent indicates that Remittix attracts investors seeking a practical solution rather than another temporary meme coin craze. Interest has surged among those who recognize its potential for cross-border payments, especially as the global financial system seeks to reduce fees and transaction durations. Observers have commented that this swift fundraising surpasses many older tokens that took months to reach similar amounts. This surge in interest suggests that mainstream or utility-focused investors find Remittix appealing. Amidst a landscape dominated by meme tokens that fluctuate with online buzz, RTX presents a use case centered around streamlining remittances, a top priority for many freelancers, international travelers, and businesses. Harnessing the Potential of PayFi: Why Remittix Matters What is fueling the allure of Remittix? At its core is PayFi, a model that merges cryptocurrency with traditional banking. Instead of pushing users into complex DeFi protocols or the latest meme frenzy, Remittix (RTX) emphasizes enabling users to convert crypto to fiat within a day. By eliminating hidden costs and simplifying the process, it makes crypto accessible to everyday individuals who might otherwise find the technology daunting. Furthermore, Remittix provides businesses with a straightforward way to accept crypto payments, converting transactions to conventional currencies automatically. This ready-to-use approach allows merchants to join in without the hassle of multi-step conversions. Essentially, Remittix manages the backend, sparing users from navigating multiple platforms or worrying about token stability. This direct utility is likely why thousands are participating in the presale, focusing on real outcomes rather than mere hype. Stepping Away from the Meme Coin Chaos While meme coins have captured attention, the initial thrill has faded for many. Projects like Shiba Inu experienced significant rises and falls, as excitement waned, leaving many retail investors in limbo. Despite their impressive peaks, people are increasingly drawn to altcoins with solid plans that transcend jokes. This is where Remittix distinguishes itself. It's not about dog mascots or humorous references; it's about seamlessly integrating finance and cryptocurrency so even those not familiar with crypto can benefit. Analysts also suggest that as interest in purely meme-based tokens dwindles, utility tokens might experience more steady growth. Remittix (RTX) could exemplify this shift, combining the thrill of a new altcoin with a practical function that caters to a global market. Even if other tokens falter during market declines, a project offering everyday solutions often weathers price fluctuations more effectively. Looking Forward: Will Remittix Sustain Its Growth? Raising over $6 million in a presale is an impressive start, but the question remains: can Remittix deliver on its promise to enhance cross-border transactions and alleviate the burden of costly remittances? Critics caution that no cryptocurrency is infallible, especially in a fluctuating environment. However, enthusiastic supporters emphasize PayFi’s potential to capture a significant market, particularly in regions where expensive remittance services are prevalent. Moreover, the team behind Remittix asserts that ongoing efforts are being made to integrate the token with major crypto wallets and payment gateways. If these milestones are achieved swiftly and early adopters’ trust is secured, Remittix (RTX) could experience a steady rise as opposed to the typical pump-and-dump cycle seen in the altcoin market. Conclusion: A Potential Rising Star? While frenzied presales often indicate short-term excitement, Remittix stands out by addressing a global challenge: costly, slow cross-border payments. With over $6 million raised at an unprecedented pace and a price increase from $0.0199 to $0.0311, it attracts thousands looking for genuine solutions rather than memes. Should PayFi become widely adopted and mainstream businesses embrace the simplicity of instant crypto-to-fiat conversions, Remittix (RTX) could transcend the crypto bubble, potentially emerging as a preferred altcoin for practical financial applications.

Priced at $0.0199 initially but rising to $0.0311, Remittix (RTX) is now hailed as the fastest-growing presale around. But what sets it apart from countless other tokens? Below, we’ll explore why thousands are grabbing RTX right now, how it tackles everyday payments and how it could reshape crypto usage for both newcomers and veterans alike. The Rapid Rise of Remittix: Numbers Don’t Lie Presales can fizzle out quickly if there’s no real substance behind the hype. So far, Remittix has proven it’s more than just talk. Surpassing $5 million raised, the altcoin soared past its early price of $0.0199 to $0.0311 all in a matter of weeks. This fast climb suggests Remittix appeals to investors craving a tangible solution, not another meme coin hype cycle. Demand has spiked among individuals who see real potential for cross-border payments, especially as global finance hunts for ways to cut down fees and transaction times. Some watchers note that this rapid fundraising outpaces many older tokens that took months to achieve similar figures. That jump in interest implies that mainstream or at least utility-minded backers find Remittix compelling. In a sea of meme-driven tokens that rise and fall with internet chatter, RTX offers a use case built around streamlining remittances, something high on the wish list of countless freelancers, global travelers and businesses. The Power of PayFi: Why Remittix Resonates So, what’s driving the Remittix appeal? The project revolves around PayFi, a model blending cryptocurrency with real-world banking. Rather than forcing users to navigate complicated DeFi protocols or chase meme mania, Remittix (RTX) focuses on letting people convert crypto to fiat within 24 hours. By removing hidden fees and complex steps, it opens crypto usage up to everyday folks who might otherwise find the technology baffling. Additionally, Remittix gives businesses an easier way to accept crypto payments, automatically settling transactions as traditional currencies. This plug-and-play approach allows merchants to hop on board without dealing with multi-step conversions. Essentially, Remittix handles the backend, sparing users from digging into multiple platforms or crossing their fingers for a stable token value. That direct utility may be what’s prompting thousands of people to join the presale, less hype, more tangible outcomes. A Welcome Break from Meme Overload While meme coins have commanded headlines, the novelty has worn thin for many. Projects like Shiba Inu soared, then tumbled, as hype drained away, leaving retail investors stuck or uncertain. Despite huge gains at their peak, people are now gravitating toward altcoins with a robust blueprint that goes beyond jokes. That’s where Remittix stands out. It’s not about dog mascots or comedic references; it’s about bridging finance and cryptocurrency so seamlessly that even non-crypto enthusiasts can benefit. Analysts also point out that as interest in purely meme-based tokens cools, utility tokens could see more stable growth. Remittix (RTX) may exemplify this trend, merging the excitement of a new altcoin with a real function that addresses a global market. Even if other tokens stumble during market downturns, a project offering everyday solutions often withstands price volatility better. The Road Ahead: Can Remittix Keep Momentum? Raising over $6 million in presale is a strong launchpad but the question remains: can Remittix fulfill its promise of driving cross-border transactions and dethroning the hassles of expensive remittances? Critics warn that no crypto is failproof, especially in an ever-changing landscape. That said, enthusiastic participants highlight PayFi’s potential to carve out a huge niche, especially in developing regions reliant on costly remittance services. Additionally, the team behind Remittix claims ongoing development to integrate the token with major crypto wallets and payment gateways. If it accomplishes those milestones quickly and fosters trust among early adopters Remittix (RTX) could see a steady climb rather than the pump-and-dump cycle so common in the altcoin scene. Conclusion: A Star in the Making? Frenzied presales often reflect short-lived excitement, but Remittix stands out by tackling a global issue: expensive, slow cross-border payments. With over $6 million raised at record pace and a price hike from $0.0199 to $0.0311, it’s drawing in thousands who’d rather invest in real solutions than memes. If PayFi takes hold and mainstream merchants latch onto the ease of instant crypto-to-fiat, Remittix (RTX) might prove itself beyond the crypto bubble potentially becoming a go-to altcoin for practical finance.

39505253,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=663195,1737846479,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39505253.jpeg,Meta’s Chief AI scientist shares his opinion about DeepSeek’s success,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/metas-chief-ai-scientist-shares-his-opinion-about-deepseeks-success/,"Meta’s Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun has given his assessment about the success that DeepSeek is enjoying in the artificial intelligence industry. According to LeCun, the biggest point to note in its rise is its vision to keep AI models open source so that everybody can benefit from it. The Chinese artificial intelligence company recently launched its DeepSeek-R1, which features better reasoning and problem-solving capacities, rivaling industry leaders like OpenAI. The AI, launched on January 20, possesses remarkable features, with tests showcasing its exceptional abilities. Aside from that, DeepSeek provides training parameters under an MIT license, allowing researchers globally to study and enhance the program. LeCun noted that the company’s success story is not about putting China ahead of the United States in the AI industry, but making sure open source models are still ahead. It’s not that China’s AI is “surpassing the US,” but rather that “open source models are surpassing proprietary ones,” LeCun said. Meta’s Chief AI scientist discusses DeepSeek’s success DeepSeek shares the same attribute with the Llama model created by Meta, with both being open source. Their rival, OpenAI, which was originally created as an open-source AI firm, has since tried to shift its mission to create technology that will benefit all humanity. The move has caused a lot of legal tussle, with Elon Musk, one of its former executives and contributors asking the court to block its transition to a for-profit. According to Meta’s Chief AI scientist, DeepSeek has enjoyed open source and open research, noting that it was the idea that some people made that they chose to build on. “They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it,” LeCun said. “That is the power of open research and open source.” During the unveiling of DeepSeek R1, the company mentioned that the system demonstrates remarkable reasoning capacity, something that has reportedly been put to the test. The company noted that it is trying to push the boundaries of open-source AI. In its paper, the company also highlighted that it made the system because it wanted to explore the potential of artificial intelligence to develop its reasoning abilities without the use of supervised data. According to Professor Ethan Mollick at Wharton, the responses gotten from the DeepSeek R1 is like a human thinking out loud. Meanwhile, there is the issue of the R1 providing issues to AI companies in the United States, seeing that both China and the US have been rivals for a while. With Trump in the White House again, the rivalry is expected to heat up. However, the rivalry is not the main concern, as the AI model shows that China will very much challenge the top AI companies in terms of development. Silicon Valley surprised by DeepSeek announcement The launch of the DeepSeek R1 model took Silicon Valley by surprise, taking center stage in tech discussions in a week that featured various events including Trump’s inauguration and his busy first few days in office, the World Economic Forum that took place in Davos, Switzerland, and TikTok cutting and restoring service to users in the United States. Days after DeepSeek unveiled its model, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to spend over $60 billion in 2025, as the firm prepares to invest big in artificial intelligence. The Meta boss has been a very outspoken proponent of open-source models, even going as far as backing his rival, Elon Musk, in his quest to block OpenAI’s for-profit move. In September 2024, the Meta CEO mentioned he wanted to build the next generation of open platforms. Zuckerberg noted that he hopes to achieve it in the next 10-15 years, stressing that open platforms must win. “I think that’s going to lead to a much more vibrant tech industry,” he added. Making a technology open source has been hailed as the way to go, since it allows anyone to modify and redistribute the codes, this way the technology develops rapidly in a democratic setting. However, proponents of a closed source system have also argued the merits of the models, noting that they are more secure because the codes are kept private. In his case, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has mentioned that taking the closed-source approach with the company provides them an easier way to hit the safety threshold. However, he mentioned in the AMA on Reddit that in the future, he might try to open-source more stuff.

A heavy hitter, World Liberty Financial, recently plunked down $20 million for 3,001 ETH and 95 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), in addition to its already sizable stash. Over the past five days, the fund has shelled out $210.9 million for Ethereum and WBTC. There seems to be no end to this whale activity, which is part of a larger trend that has seen Ethereum appreciating 107% over the past two years. As of January 2025, the asset had reached a value of $3,294.25. #Ethereum ’un Geleceği! Ethereum, son iki yılda %107’lik etkileyici bir artışla 2025 Ocak itibarıyla 3.294,25 dolara ulaşarak dijital varlık piyasasında önemli bir ivme kazandı. Bu yükseliş yalnızca Ethereum’un kendisiyle sınırlı kalmadı; Grayscale Ethereum Trust da aynı dönemde… pic.twitter.com/jQPHmU8YWq — Baykuş (@KriptoBaykusV2) January 24, 2025 Institutional Interest and the Growth of Ethereum ETFs Ethereum’s market is not just picking up the pace with whales and institutional investors; its assets are gaining traction across the board. For example, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust has rumbled up a cool 243% over the past two years—an impressive figure in such a turbulent market—which mirrors (and is slightly ahead of) the overall price performance of Ethereum itself. This means that not only is Ethereum being bought up, but also that investment vehicles built on top of Ethereum (like Grayscale’s Trust) are being increasingly seen as vehicles in which to place funds. At present, more than 3 million ETH are held by substantial institutional investors in Ethereum ETFs, a sign of their significant trust in the DeFi world. These really seem to be stable holdings, and not just because these investors are already underwater on their ETH positions (which is why they haven’t sold). It seems to indicate that Ethereum is developing “Federal Reserve Notes” for DeFi, so to speak, and that these large institutional investors expect it to be an increasingly “accepted asset” to hang on to in the long term. World Liberty Financial spent $20M to buy 3,001 $ETH and 95 $WBTC ~2 hours ago. In the past 5 days, the fund invested $210.9M, including $119.95M on 35,995 $ETH at ~$3,332 and $66.84M on 629.1 $WBTC at ~$106,249. Currently, it holds 77,818 $ETH ($257M), including 19,403 staked… https://t.co/Yg5pS4gY5O pic.twitter.com/K4BkKmZgWm — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 25, 2025 Yet, even though Ethereum’s fundamentals are solid, volatility continues to be the defining characteristic of the asset, as seen in the price of Grayscale Ethereum Trust. After reaching a high of $25.04 in February 2024, the price of Grayscale Ethereum Trust fell to a low of $21.27 in August 2024, only to recover again. These movements in the price of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust serve to remind investors that the market is a very volatile one and that short-term assets can see large price changes that are not reflective of their long-term value. Mixed Investor Sentiment Reflected in ETF Net Flows The spot ETFs for Ethereum, which give investors a way to get at the cryptocurrency without holding it directly, have seen some decent inflows. On January 24, two days after we first talked to Bitwise, these ETFs had recorded a total net inflow of just over $9 million. By far, the largest and leading the pack, inflow-wise, is the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. On top of that, it seems like these inflows are being led by institutions—big players who might be accumulating Ethereum for the long haul. On January 24, the total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETFs was $9.1772 million. There was only one day of net outflow in the past 8 days. The Ethereum spot ETF with the largest net inflow yesterday was Bitwise ETF ETHW, with a net inflow of $6.0096 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/DsUtQxQYtm — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2025 There are mixed signals, though, when it comes to net ETF flows. Large institutional players like BlackRock and Grayscale have seen significant outflows, while some other firms, like Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, have seen pretty consistent inflows. This divergence, I think, illustrates that different segments of the institutional market have different views on Ethereum’s future. Some are clearly concerned about volatility in the short term and have pulled back significantly. Others, though, continue to seem pretty committed and have invested in the asset. The withdrawal of 20,001.39 ETH from Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF on January 13, 2025, serves as a stark reminder of the market’s volatility. Large outflows like this one can signal a meaningful shift in investor sentiment, and they’re a good occasion to stop and think about not just what caused this large outflow, but also to consider the external factors and internal market dynamics that make the cryptocurrency market so prone to large, rapid changes in direction. A Strong Future, But Caution Is Key Although Ethereum has achieved exceptional results over the past couple of years and is now embraced in the DeFi space, it is still a very volatile investment. In our recent report on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, we discussed this volatility and the substantial movements in the ETF market that both highlight and contribute to the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. In this piece, we’ll delve deeper into the Ethereum Trust, what it means to be a holder of the trust, and how these factors correlate with the aforementioned volatility. Whales have bought over 1.14 million #Ethereum $ETH in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/7X1ibdE1IG — Ali (@ali_charts) January 24, 2025 Dominating the digital asset ecosystem, Ethereum has shown a clear trajectory of growth. The asset’s future appears bright, with more institutional investors adding Ethereum to their portfolios and Ethereum-based ETFs experiencing increasing inflows. Still, as Grayscale’s price fluctuations and the market’s short-term shifts show, it’s on all investors to manage risk and remain vigilant to changing market conditions when investing in the Ethereum asset. To sum up, although the price appreciation and ETF developments seem to suggest a bright future for Ethereum, investors must anticipate the volatility that accompanies this type of asset. As the network matures, both individual and institutional investors seem to be mounting a long-term bet on what is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Still, it’s a bet that looks riskier than ever—just a couple of weeks ago, the price fell nearly 30% in just 48 hours. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

With projects like Kaspa gaining momentum in scalability and Helium revolutionizing IoT, it’s clear that blockchain innovation isn’t slowing down anytime soon. These coins aren’t just about flashy updates—they’re laying the groundwork for real-world impact, solidifying their places in the rapidly evolving ecosystem. Amid these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves with its groundbreaking Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. As one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in today, Qubetics is closing in on the 19th stage of its presale, with a 10% price increase coming this Sunday. From tokenizing physical assets to offering seamless liquidity for businesses and investors, Qubetics is tackling the inefficiencies traditional systems couldn’t solve. It’s not just about catching up—it’s about redefining blockchain’s purpose. Transforming Blockchain with Qubetics’ Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is taking asset tokenization to an entirely new level. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it unites leading blockchains to create a seamless platform for tokenized assets. This game-changing application is designed for businesses and individuals looking to unlock new investment opportunities. Imagine a small business owner using the Qubetics marketplace to tokenize their real estate assets, enabling them to access a global pool of investors. Similarly, a budding artist could fractionalize ownership of their work, allowing fans worldwide to invest in their creativity. By offering a secondary market for tokenized assets, Qubetics facilitates hassle-free sales and exchanges. Its platform ensures smooth asset management, empowering investors with efficient liquidity and higher returns. Businesses can easily access funding, diversify investments, and create innovative products. Individuals, on the other hand, gain unprecedented access to previously exclusive opportunities. The Qubetics marketplace doesn’t just bridge gaps—it creates an ecosystem where tokenization thrives. TICSScan Revolutionizing Blockchain Exploration Adding more firepower to its offerings is TICSScan, Qubetics’ blockchain explorer. It’s built to provide unmatched transparency, real-time data, and intuitive insights into blockchain activity. Validators can assess performance metrics, businesses can track transactions, and developers can debug smart contracts—all through TICSScan’s sleek, user-friendly interface. From verifying blocks to monitoring transaction fees, TICSScan empowers the Qubetics community to make informed decisions, ensuring seamless interaction with the blockchain. Qubetics Presale Offering Unmatched ROI The Qubetics presale is creating waves, and for a good reason. Currently in its 18th stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0551, with over $10.6 million raised, 16,000 holders onboard, and 439 million tokens sold. What’s even more exciting? Each presale stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. This means the window to join the Qubetics presale at the current price closes soon. Analysts are forecasting explosive growth for $TICS. By the presale’s end, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, translating into a jaw-dropping ROI of 353.39%. But that’s not all—after the presale, $TICS could reach $1, delivering a staggering 1713.57% ROI. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, projections go as high as $10 to $15, boasting ROIs of 18,035.76% and 27,103.64%, respectively. For example, a $200 investment today would yield 3,627.15 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 after the mainnet launch, this investment could grow to $36,271.50, or $54,407.25 if it hits $15. The clock’s ticking on this opportunity, and missing out would mean passing on one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in today. Kaspa’s Growth Trajectory Holds Investor Attention Kaspa’s rise is making headlines, and the potential is hard to ignore. The coin operates on the GHOSTDAG protocol, a revolutionary approach that enhances blockchain speed and scalability without compromising decentralization. Recent reports highlight its growing adoption among whales, particularly through the emerging PlutoChain network. The focus is on its potential to achieve mainstream adoption, with price predictions indicating Kaspa could hit $1 by the end of 2025. Analysts attribute Kaspa’s upward trajectory to its growing use cases in decentralized finance and blockchain solutions. Unlike its peers, Kaspa offers near-instantaneous transaction speeds and high security, attracting businesses looking for robust blockchain infrastructure. Its compatibility with PlutoChain’s ecosystem further strengthens its position as a developer-friendly platform, making it a compelling choice for both investors and creators. With whales accumulating Kaspa tokens at unprecedented rates, the confidence in its growth potential is clear. This trust is backed by Kaspa’s impressive roadmap, which focuses on scaling its technology while maintaining its unique GHOSTDAG advantage. The future looks bright for Kaspa, solidifying its place among must-watch cryptocurrencies. Helium’s Push for IoT Dominance Helium (HNT) continues to redefine IoT connectivity through its decentralized wireless network. The platform’s innovative Proof-of-Coverage model incentivizes users to establish hotspots that power the network. This model has led to significant growth, with Helium now boasting a circulating supply of 176.96 million HNT and a market cap of $770.53 million. The past 24 hours have been promising for Helium, with a trading volume of $11.66 million—a 3.25% increase. Helium’s focus on IoT solutions positions it as a frontrunner in industries ranging from logistics to smart cities. With its forward-looking vision, the network has become a magnet for developers and enterprises aiming to capitalize on IoT growth. As Helium continues to scale, its potential for further adoption remains high. Its transparent approach and real-world use cases make it a valuable addition to any portfolio. Backed by its unique decentralized model, HNT offers a tangible connection between blockchain technology and everyday life. Conclusion Cryptocurrency investments demand careful evaluation, and Qubetics, Kaspa, and Helium showcase their unique strengths in today’s landscape. Qubetics leads as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest , offering unparalleled growth potential with its Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace and presale opportunities. Kaspa stands out for its innovative GHOSTDAG protocol, while Helium excels in bridging IoT and blockchain. Together, these projects highlight the vast possibilities in the crypto world, from tokenization and IoT to groundbreaking blockchain solutions.

39502496,https://nulltx.com/?p=141057,1737847103,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Aptos Sees Unprecedented Growth, But Bearish Signals Loom on the Horizon",https://nulltx.com/aptos-sees-unprecedented-growth-but-bearish-signals-loom-on-the-horizon/,"The Aptos ecosystem is witnessing a rapid embrace as fresh users come to the platform and activity reaches unprecedented heights. Just this week, Aptos welcomed 2.1 million new users, bringing its total user base to a staggering 47 million. The platform’s steep rise in popularity is mirrored in the almost laughable surge in weekly active wallets, which hit 5.7 million, up from 3 million just a month ago. The pace of transactions has also been remarkable, with more than 39 million transactions processed in just the last week. This surge in activity shows that many people are interested in the Aptos blockchain and what it has to offer. Given its beginnings with engineers who previously worked at Facebook, the Aptos project has surprised many in the cryptocurrency community with the speed at which it has cultivated a user base. In recent months, that community has moved a substantial amount of money through a growing number of decentralized applications running on the blockchain. The network’s participation in the ecosystem is happening at lightning speed compared to many other blockchain projects. Aptos Price Action and Technical Outlook Even though the user base and activity levels are showing a positive growth trend, Aptos’ native token, $APT, may have a challenging technical outlook. The price of $APT appears to be in the process of carving out a head-and-shoulders top, a bearish technical formation that indicates more downside could be on the way. If this formation plays out as expected, the price of $APT could drop to about $4.30. The head-and-shoulders pattern is a widely recognized technical indicator that frequently denotes a trend reversal, especially when it occurs after a sustained upward price movement. In the instance of $APT, the token’s price has not been able to sustain upward momentum above vital levels, and the head-and-shoulders formation indicates that if market sentiment turns bearish, further price declines could be imminent. Nevertheless, investors in Aptos do have a silver lining to look forward to. To refute this bearish outlook, Aptos (APT) needs to prove it can sustain a close above the $10.50 mark. That threshold amounts to a resistance point, and if Aptos can stay above that in the next few trading sessions, it would send up a signal, or a sign of strength really, that the head-and-shoulders pattern has been invalidated, and that the next probable move is a continuation of an upward trend. 𝙒𝙏𝙁 𝙙𝙞𝙙 𝙄 𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙨 𝙤𝙣 𝘼𝙥𝙩𝙤𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙬𝙚𝙚𝙠?! For starters, 2.1M new users joined the ecosystem this week—pushing all-time users over 47M+ 🪽Weekly active wallets soared to an ATH of 5.7M A staggering 39M+ transactions were processed More in your Aptos… — Aptos (@Aptos) January 25, 2025 The Growing Popularity of Aptos Although APT’s technical chart might raise some eyebrows, the underlying growth of the Aptos network is nothing short of impressive. Its addition of 2.1 million new users in just one week is a clear testament to the platform’s appeal. We can hardly call it a “fledgling project” with numbers like these. It puts speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness front and center, serving decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. The number of active wallets each week is up to 5.7 million, and this reflects a substantial and growing commitment from users. It’s not just that the network is attracting new users; it’s also attracting a kind of new user that’s very important to the long-term prospects of any platform: users who stick around and stay engaged. And stay engaged they do, as evidenced by the number of transactions. We’re now seeing upwards of 39 million+ transactions each week. Users interact with dApps, make transactions, and otherwise occupy the space that is the broader blockchain ecosystem. Aptos is also making strides in attracting developers, and its ecosystem is expanding rapidly with the appearance of more projects on the platform. Those projects are often decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives looking to scale. They are choosing Aptos because of its high throughput, low transaction costs, and stable infrastructure. In comparison with other protocols, Aptos has a generally favorable fee structure, and it has become a go-to developer choice in the DeFi space. A Mixed Picture for Investors The expansion of Aptos’ user base and the development of network activity are undoubtedly impressive. But what about the price of $APT? A bearish technical picture is emerging there, and on the surface, it looks like this is presenting a pretty mixed bag for investors. If you believe technical signals are worth anything, the appearance of a head-and-shoulders pattern comes off like a strong sell signal. That’s signaling a potential price decline. And a price decline is usually associated with a potential increase in network activity. But what if network activity is increasing? #Aptos $APT appears to be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, with a potential downside target of $4.30. A sustained close above $10.50 is needed to invalidate the bearish outlook. pic.twitter.com/4rHCGcOxyy — Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 When contemplating the future of Aptos, investors would do well to keep a close watch on some pivotal price points—most notably the $10.50 mark. Any sort of prolonged rally above that level would seem to suggest strength in what is otherwise a still very young and unproven asset. On the flip side, if Aptos were to drop and head back toward the $4.30 area, it might raise some eyebrows and give off the appearance of a potential bath that this asset is taking. To be fair, Aptos is a blockchain network; however, like any network, its value is contingent not only on what people are willing to pay for its native asset (in this case, APT) but also on its ability to attract users and developers. To conclude, Aptos continues to impress with its growth and adoption, but its technical outlook for $APT remains unclear. Investors should keep a close watch on price actions over the next few weeks to see if the head-and-shoulders pattern comes to fruition or if $APT can push through resistance levels and keep the upward trend going. With its burgeoning ecosystem and strong user base, Aptos is a project to keep on your radar in the next few months. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Panshibi (SHIBI) has drawn attention as one of the few meme coins making quick developments on the blockchain. With projections of a 1,200% price surge, analysts believe Panshibi could soon compete with Polkadot or Solana prices. In this overview, we'll explore why you should capitalize on this investment opportunity! Panshibi Introduces a New Theme of Meme Coins Panshibi is setting a new standard for meme coins by capturing the excitement and imagination of the real world. Inspired by the charm of pandas, Panshibi brings more than just a theme—it represents a comfortable blend of creativity and innovation. As a relatable project, Panshibi is already being hailed as the next big thing. Moreover, the Panda-themed coin has the potential of mammoth profits right from its ongoing presale. Over 15 stages, Panshibi’s price is expected to shoot up by 1,200%, with predictions of even greater growth upon listing. This combination of strategic pricing and calculated scarcity is driving interest from all corners of the crypto market. With its smart contract being fully audited, liquidity will remain locked for ten years and the ownership of the token will be renounced after the presale. These measures not only protect investors but also ensure that the project remains decentralized and community-driven. As SHIBI prepares for its debut on major exchanges, its combination of community appeal and sound strategy is paving the way for significant success. Panshibi functions on a MemeFi model that allows it to operate outside of market hype. Its platform stands out from the rest in the often volatile meme coin space. Solana Price Could Reach New Heights Shortly after assuming office, the Trump administration launched a new crypto task force aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Additionally, President Donald Trump introduced two Solana meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Over the week, coins on the Solana network have registered double-figured price increases. SOLitself reached a 38% price increase in the same period, with a $300 valuation in sight. As a result, its TVL rose to a $12.1 billion all-time high. However, traders are cautious of Solana’s 10.4% volatility and 11.8% supply inflation. While the short-term looks promising, price analysts like CoinCodex predict a Solana price decline after the first quarter of 2025. Polkadot Community Raise Alarm as Project Burns Through Millions Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading above $6.5 , reflecting a 0.08% decrease from the previous week. Once a top 10 crypto, DOT has been on a steady decline, with newer projects and initiatives taking its former positions. Recently, Polkadot has proposed RFC-0092 to reduce its unstaking period from 28 days to just 2 days. However, the project has faced scrutiny after revealing $37 million in marketing expenses, prompting discussions within the community regarding budget allocations. Despite partnering with Inter Miami FC to support educators at the Pride Academy, the DOTeconomy is tilting towards a bearish sentiment. With its supply inflation above 55%, it is unlikely for DOT to make headway soon. Conclusion Unlike Polkadot's struggles and Solana's volatility, Panshibi combines decentralized governance, transparency, and scalability to establish itself as a serious contender. With its tokens selling for $0.002 apiece, SHIBI is poised to perform well ahead of a strong market debut.

Panshibi (SHIBI) has emerged as a standout among meme coins, advancing rapidly on the blockchain. With expectations of a 1,200% increase in value, experts suggest that Panshibi could soon rival the price of Polkadot or Solana. In this discussion, we'll delve into why this could be a lucrative investment opportunity! Panshibi Unveils a Fresh Theme in Meme Coins Panshibi is redefining meme coins by tapping into the excitement and creativity of the real world. Drawing inspiration from pandas, Panshibi offers more than a theme—it embodies a harmonious mix of creativity and innovation. As a relatable initiative, Panshibi is already being praised as the next significant development. Furthermore, the Panda-themed coin promises substantial returns right from its ongoing presale. Over 15 stages, Panshibi’s price is projected to spike by 1,200%, with potential for even greater growth once listed. This strategic pricing combined with calculated scarcity is attracting interest from across the crypto landscape. With a fully audited smart contract, liquidity will be locked for a decade, and token ownership will be relinquished post-presale. These steps not only secure investor interests but also ensure the project remains decentralized and community-focused. As SHIBI gears up for its launch on major exchanges, its mix of community engagement and strategic planning sets the stage for notable success. Panshibi operates under a MemeFi model, allowing it to function independently of market hype. Its platform distinguishes itself in the often unpredictable meme coin market. Solana Price Poised for New Peaks Soon after taking office, the Trump administration introduced a new crypto task force aimed at creating a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Additionally, President Donald Trump launched two Solana meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Throughout the week, coins on the Solana network have seen double-digit price gains. SOL itself achieved a 38% price increase over the same timeframe, with a $300 valuation on the horizon. Consequently, its TVL reached a record high of $12.1 billion. Nevertheless, traders remain wary of Solana’s 10.4% volatility and 11.8% supply inflation. Although the short-term outlook is positive, analysts like CoinCodex forecast a Solana price drop after the first quarter of 2025. Polkadot Community Raises Concerns Over Project's Spending Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading above $6.5 , marking a 0.08% dip from the previous week. Once a top 10 cryptocurrency, DOT has been on a downward trend, with newer projects and initiatives taking its former positions. Recently, Polkadot has suggested RFC-0092 to shorten its unstaking period from 28 days to just 2 days. However, the project has come under scrutiny after disclosing $37 million in marketing costs, sparking discussions within the community about budget management. Despite collaborating with Inter Miami FC to support educators at the Pride Academy, the DOT economy is leaning towards a bearish outlook. With supply inflation exceeding 55%, it's unlikely that DOT will gain momentum soon.

The prominent altcoin currently trades around $3,290 as investors await the crypto bull run’s return to form. On the other hand, rising institutional adoption provides a positive development for the Ethereum community. Related Reading: Justin Sun’s Grand Strategy For Ethereum Price: $10,000 Target BlackRock’s ETHA Lead Spot ETF Market With 1.2 Million ETH According to a recent X post by Burak Kesmeci, Ethereum is currently experiencing a surge in institutional adoption as evidenced by developments in the Spot ETF Market. Kesmeci highlights that BlackRock’s ETHA accounts for the majority of this demand with net assets of 1.2009 ETH valued at over $3.19 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, this record is largely unsurprising as ETHA has experienced the highest net cumulative inflows of $3.97 billion in the Ethereum Spot ETF market. Fidelity’s FETH occupies second place with 432,750 ETH valued at around $1.46 billion. Bitwise’s ETHW and VanEck’s ETHV follow with holdings of 105,974 ETH and 45,766 ETH, respectively. Meanwhile, all other Ethereum Spot ETFs except the Grayscale ETHE have accumulated at least 7,000 ETH since their launch in July 2024. A rise in institutional demand of Ethereum as Indicated by the data above indicates strong confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. While Ethereum Spot ETFs may not replicate the performance of Bitcoin counterparts, the institutional demand these funds command could enhance ETH market stability and liquidity, paving the way for broader regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates But Open Interest Points to Potential Breakout Short Transactions Dominate Ethereum Market In other news, bearish sentiments currently prove dominant in the ETH market as dominated by a higher proportion of short-term transactions to long transactions. According to Kesmeci, short orders represent 57% of all Ethereum futures trades indicating that the majority of traders are betting the altcoin to experience a further price decline. This negative development is particularly observed on the Bitmex and Bitfinex exchanges. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,297 after 0.17% loss in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume has dipped by 24.24% and is now valued at $25.36 billion. Based on its daily trading chart, Ethereum appears to be consolidating despite recent losses. With any price rally, the altcoin could reach around $3,700, moving past which would spur a return to around $4,000. On the other hand, another fall in Ethereum’s price could result in a slump to around $3,100, which lies its next significant support level. With a market cap of $396.85 billion, ETH retains its position as the largest altcoin and second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Meme coins are more than just digital assets; they’re a community-driven movement, sparking massive enthusiasm and skyrocketing ROI for savvy investors. As the market continues to evolve, new meme coins are rising to the occasion, and among them, Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat are making waves. These tokens promise not just thrilling gains but an adventurous ride for anyone looking to dive into the meme coin scene. But how do you separate the hype from the true winners? That’s where Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat stand out. These meme coins aren’t just another flash in the pan—they’re backed by unique narratives, community engagement, and thrilling presale stages that make them the best new meme coins to invest in for short term profits. Let’s dive deeper into why these three meme coins are grabbing the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers to the crypto game. Arctic Pablo is leading the charge with its adventurous narrative and insane ROI potential. If you haven’t heard about it yet, you’re missing out on a journey unlike any other. Arctic Pablo: The Journey of a Lifetime Arctic Pablo is no ordinary meme coin. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about adventure. In an icy realm where myth and reality collide, Arctic Pablo embarks on a thrilling exploration, discovering hidden treasures with each step. Imagine a coin that doesn’t just grow in value but takes you on a journey to uncharted lands. The narrative of Arctic Pablo is as unique as it gets, and the best part? It’s built to deliver impressive ROI for those who jump in early. What sets Arctic Pablo apart is its presale model. Instead of sticking to a boring old stage system, Arctic Pablo’s presale is divided by locations, each representing a new chapter in Pablo’s exploration. From Metropolis to Snowy Shores, each location unlocks new tokens and opportunities for early investors. Right now, Arctic Pablo is at Stage 6, and over $430,000 has already been raised. But there’s a catch—each location comes with its own limited supply and burn mechanism, which only makes the coin more valuable. Why should you care about Arctic Pablo? Here’s the exciting part: if you join the presale now, you can get in at the current price of just $0.000038 per $APC. As the presale progresses, the price will gradually rise, and by the final presale stage, it’ll hit $0.0008. But the real magic happens when Arctic Pablo launches. At a launch price of $0.008, you could see a jaw-dropping ROI of over 20,000% from Stage 6 to launch price. This isn’t just a coin; it’s an adventure. So, if you’re looking for a meme coin with serious growth potential, Arctic Pablo is the best new meme coin to invest in for short term. And don’t forget about the staking opportunities—Arctic Pablo offers a staggering 66% APY, allowing you to grow your investment while embarking on this thrilling journey. Moo Deng: A Playful Coin with Serious Potential Moo Deng may not have the same adventurous narrative as Arctic Pablo, but don’t let that fool you—this meme coin is one to watch. Moo Deng’s charm lies in its community and the promise of a truly decentralized ecosystem. With a strong community-driven vision, Moo Deng has built a loyal following that’s eager to see the coin soar. As a meme coin with a unique twist, Moo Deng offers something different from the typical Doge and Shiba Inu clones. Moo Deng is more than just a fun name. With its deflationary tokenomics, it’s built to appreciate over time. And the more you hold, the more you stand to gain as the circulating supply decreases. Moo Deng has already proven its worth in its early stages, and the community’s enthusiasm is palpable. What makes this coin particularly attractive for short-term investment is the fact that it has an active roadmap with clear milestones ahead. As the project grows, Moo Deng plans to integrate more utility and features, including partnerships that could drive its price even higher. Popcat: A Meme Coin with Legendary Appeal Popcat needs no introduction—it’s a meme coin with a cult following that’s been a hit online for a while. As one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term, Popcat is riding a wave of popularity, thanks to its simple yet incredibly effective meme status. It’s funny, it’s viral, and it’s packed with potential. But Popcat isn’t just a meme—it’s a project that understands the value of community. The Popcat community is one of the most active in the meme coin space, and that’s one of the reasons why its value has skyrocketed in the past year. Like most meme coins, the key to Popcat’s success lies in its ability to capture the attention of internet culture and capitalize on the viral nature of memes. Conclusion: Jump on the Meme Coin Train Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is looking more promising than ever. Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Popcat each offer something unique for investors looking for short-term gains. However, if you want to be part of an epic journey with huge ROI potential, Arctic Pablo is the one to watch. With its adventurous narrative, presale opportunities, and insane 30,692% ROI potential, Arctic Pablo is undoubtedly the best new meme coin to invest in for short term profits. Don’t miss out—join the Arctic Pablo presale today and be part of a journey that could change your financial future. The clock is ticking, and each location brings new opportunities.

Web3Bay (3BAY) distinguishes itself with a novel e-commerce and decentralized governance model, marking it as a prudent selection in 2025. With an impressive $890,000 amassed in its presale and an anticipated 6,430% return on investment, Web3Bay transcends mere conjecture by providing both utility and expandability in a market poised for innovation. Ripple (XRP) on the Verge of $4 After Market Uptick Ripple (XRP) is nearing a $4 valuation after climbing past $3, a spike driven by fresh market enthusiasm following the latest presidential inauguration. Expert Ali Martinez notes that XRP’s ascension from a bullish flag pattern may push it toward $4.40 soon. Over the last week, XRP rose by 23.4% and 40.4% over the month, with technical indicators like a high relative strength index (RSI) hinting at sustained upward momentum. With significant buying from large-scale holders, a $4 target is becoming more feasible. Chainlink (LINK) Poised for Growth, Eyes $30.81 Mark Chainlink (LINK) exhibits strong upward trends, depicted in a progressing five-wave Elliott Wave pattern on daily and hourly charts. The RSI suggests there’s room for growth before hitting overbought levels, aiming to surpass the $30.81 high. The current third wave on the hourly chart follows a modest second-wave drop to $22.17, with goals set near $30.81. Stability above $22.74 is critical, however, as falling below this could prompt corrections, crucial for traders to watch. Web3Bay: A Prudent Choice for Tangible Utility and ROI The 3BAY token serves as the core of Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce framework, promising investors real advantages and substantial growth potential. At a current price of $0.004562625 in its fourth presale phase, the token is anticipated to debut at $0.1959—offering an impressive 6,430% ROI to early participants. In contrast, Ripple’s XRP is still trying to reach its previous highs, and Chainlink’s LINK largely depends on the DeFi sector’s performance. With its broad appeal and emphasis on viable solutions, Web3Bay stands out as an excellent investment choice. For instance, a $1,000 investment in 3BAY during the presale could potentially transform into over $42,900 at launch. This remarkable growth potential is not merely theoretical; it is underpinned by Web3Bay’s utility-oriented approach. As the platform gains users, the demand for 3BAY tokens is expected to surge, progressively boosting their value. Web3Bay: Built to Last in a Competitive Crypto Market Web3Bay’s allure extends beyond immediate financial returns. Its strategic roadmap is tailored for scalability and active user participation, aiming to maintain its pertinence over time. Essential developments include: NFT Marketplace : An arena for artists and collectors to effortlessly exchange digital items. Decentralized Governance : Allows token holders to shape the platform’s direction, fostering a community-led environment. Hybrid Payment System : Supports both crypto and conventional payments such as PayPal, broadening its accessibility worldwide. Layer-2 Scaling : Guarantees rapid and cost-effective transactions, even under heavy demand, ensuring a seamless user experience. These initiatives position Web3Bay as more than a mere cryptocurrency; it is an extensive platform tackling the inefficiencies plaguing the $5 trillion e-commerce sector. Unlike Chainlink’s focused application or Ripple’s exposure to regulatory hurdles, Web3Bay is crafting a functional solution for worldwide commerce. How Smart Investors Capitalize on Web3Bay Opportunities Smart investors recognize the significant advantages of utility tokens associated with platforms that address actual market needs. Ethereum and Binance Coin, initially viewed as speculative bets, have ultimately validated their substantial market value. In a similar vein, Web3Bay is currently navigating the initial phase of what promises to be a groundbreaking evolution. To illustrate: Web3Bay has successfully amassed over $890,000 in its presale so far, with the token price escalating at each phase. This tiered pricing model incentivizes early investors, encouraging swift action to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Participants from the early rounds of the presale are now enjoying considerable gains, with the token’s projected launch price of $0.1959 hinting at even more lucrative prospects ahead. Unlike Chainlink and Ripple, which have established themselves in specific areas like blockchain oracles and international payments, Web3Bay is introducing a fundamentally novel concept—a decentralized platform for e-commerce poised for exponential growth. The successful presale, a model grounded in utility, and a vision for long-term growth position Web3Bay as a smart investment choice for 2025 .

It stands out with its innovative architecture and a clear mission to revolutionize decentralized systems. BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a hot topic in the cryptocurrency discussions. Let’s examine the key selling points and breakthrough technology that make BlockDAG a focal point for both developers and buyers. Introducing BlockDAG BlockDAG is at the forefront of blockchain evolution, tackling the inherent limitations of traditional blockchain architectures. Rather than sticking to the linear block processing of older blockchains, BlockDAG employs Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to process multiple blocks simultaneously. This method not only boosts transaction speed but also enhances scalability. The moniker “BlockDAG” captures this blend of blockchain resilience and DAG efficiency, forming a robust platform suited for high-volume applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and supply chain management. The Core Technology Powering BlockDAG The innovation at the core of BlockDAG is its capability to process several blocks in parallel, a significant shift from the traditional sequential blockchain operations. This linear method can lead to congestion as the network expands, slowing down transactions and inflating fees. BlockDAG revolutionizes this setup by allowing multiple blocks to exist and validate transactions together, which speeds up processing times and greatly expands network capacity. Whether it’s handling numerous small transactions or complex decentralized apps (dApps), BlockDAG offers a performance that traditional blockchains can hardly match. Furthermore, BlockDAG supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), enabling developers to utilize familiar tools for development, testing, and deployment, thus lowering the barriers to innovation and diversifying the ecosystem. Why BlockDAG Stands Out Unparalleled Speed & Scalability Thanks to its ability to handle multiple blocks concurrently, BlockDAG ensures swift and efficient network functionality, even under strain. This scalability makes it a robust choice for large-scale applications, future-proofing it in a rapidly advancing industry. Enhanced Security The unique structure of BlockDAG also augments its security. The interconnected DAG framework increases resilience against certain attacks, where altering any transaction demands substantial computational resources, thus ensuring the integrity of the network. Seamless Interoperability BlockDAG’s support for EVM and WASM facilitates an easier transition for developers looking to migrate existing projects or kick-start new ones. This adaptability is crucial in attracting a diverse developer base to the platform. A Developer-Centric Ecosystem BlockDAG is not just focused on technology; it aims to cultivate a thriving community of innovators. Partnering with HackerEarth, a global developer network, BlockDAG is committed to encouraging innovation through upcoming hackathons designed to stimulate over 200 Web3 projects, demonstrating its capacity as a developer-friendly ecosystem. A Record-Breaking Presale BlockDAG’s presale is turning heads, raising a whopping $184.5 million so far. Currently in its 27th batch, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0248, offering an attractive opportunity for anyone looking to buy early. Early adopters are already reaping rewards. Those who joined in the first batch have seen their holdings grow by 2380%. And there’s more to come—analysts predict BDAG could hit $1 by 2025. For those jumping in now, that means a potential 3932% return. What makes BlockDAG stand out is its practical potential. The platform’s speed and scalability make it a perfect fit for industries like finance and logistics. Think of a supply chain where transactions are processed instantly, or a DeFi platform that effortlessly handles millions of users without delays. This practicality is why developers and businesses are gravitating toward BlockDAG. By solving key blockchain issues like slow speeds, high costs, and scalability limits, it’s emerging as a solution not just for today’s problems, but for the innovations of tomorrow. The Ideal Time to Buy With the presale price at $0.0248, now is an exceptional time to buy. The mainnet launch is set for early 2025, and as the launch approaches, the opportunity to purchase at this level will diminish. As BlockDAG continues to attract more developers and expand its ecosystem, the demand for BDAG coins is likely to surge, potentially increasing their market value.

These factors appear to be shifting the market sentiment that DOGE has been witnessing. Elon Musk and Blockchain Technology Recently, Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX and Tesla, revealed that he is exploring blockchain technology to make the DOGE department more efficient and to track government performance. Musk’s thoughts have gained significant attention from crypto experts and analysts. Looking at this, Cardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson posted on X (formerly Twitter) and stressed, “I’m thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, Dogemaster Elon Musk, give us a call. We’ll do it for free.” Well, I'm thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, dogemaster @elonmusk , give us a call.

Current Price Momentum Despite these positive developments, DOGE is currently trading near $0.354 and has witnessed a price surge of 1.35% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bullish, as it is currently at a crucial support level provided by the trendline and is also poised for an inclined trendline breakout on the four-hour time frame. Since December 2024, DOGE has taken support from this trendline four times, and each time, it has witnessed impressive upside momentum. Source: Trading View Looking at the historical price momentum, experts are expecting a similar kind of upside momentum. Based on the recent price action, if DOGE breaches the trendline and closes a four-hour candle above the $0.365 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 20% to reach the $0.43 level in the future.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-26 00:30:11

Now, picture missing the boat because you hesitated when the market offered dips. In the volatile yet thrilling world of cryptocurrency, timing isn’t just everything—it’s your golden ticket. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Brett (BRETT) have solidified their spots among meme coin enthusiasts, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is grabbing attention with its amazing presale performance and innovative Bulls Squad. The 14th stage of BTFD’s presale has already raised over $5.6 million, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. So, what makes BTFD Coin the must-watch contender for 2025? Here’s the deal: the BTFD presale has thrown a 100% bonus offer into the mix—a tantalizing reward for investors who act now. With the LAUNCH100 bonus code, buyers can double their coins. Intrigued yet? Let’s dive deeper into how BTFD is shaping up to be the best new meme coin to join for the long term. BTFD Coin: More Than a Meme, It’s a Movement At the heart of BTFD Coin lies a rallying cry: “ Buy The Dip .” This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a call to action for savvy investors who understand the value of seizing opportunities hidden in market chaos. Built on Ethereum for enhanced security and scalability, BTFD isn’t merely a token—it’s a thriving ecosystem powered by a dedicated community and a bold vision. With over 9,500 coin holders and 67 billion coins sold, BTFD is on track to become a game-changer in the meme coin space. The Bulls Squad: Meet the Guardians of the Dip At the heart of BTFD is the Bulls Squad, a dynamic team of mascots that encapsulates the project’s spirit of resilience and community. Baby Bull : The visionary face of BTFD, Baby Bull represents the optimism of buying the dip and inspires the community to hold strong. Raging Bull : This creative powerhouse ensures BTFD’s visuals and branding stay bold and exciting. Nerdy Bull : The brains behind the operation, Nerdy Bull guarantees that BTFD’s infrastructure runs smoothly. Peoples Bull : As the community’s voice, Peoples Bull keeps everyone engaged and informed, fostering a sense of belonging among investors. Together, the Bulls Squad fuels the BTFD movement, creating a robust community that thrives on market downturns and positions itself for massive gains during bull cycles. Staking and P2E Game: More Reasons to Join BTFD doesn’t stop at just meme coin hype—it brings real utility to the table. Its staking program offers an impressive 90% APY, letting investors earn substantial passive income. Plus, the full version of its P2E game is now live, allowing players to earn rewards while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. And let’s not forget the referral program: top referrers can earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens . With these features, BTFD is setting a new standard for meme coins, offering multiple ways for investors to profit while being part of a thriving community. Pepe Coin: A Meme Coin OG Pepe Coin has been a household name among crypto enthusiasts, celebrated for its nostalgic appeal and strong community backing. While it’s not currently offering any presale bonuses or new features, its longevity in the market showcases its resilience. Pepe Coin thrives as a reminder of how memes and community-driven projects can hold their ground in the volatile crypto world. With a massive following and its position as a cultural phenomenon, Pepe continues to serve as a reliable investment for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. However, with no ongoing incentives comparable to BTFD’s presale, it’s clear which project offers more excitement for new investors. Brett: The New Kid on the Block Brett is another meme coin gaining traction, known for its irreverent humor and unique branding. While still relatively new, Brett has carved out a niche among younger crypto enthusiasts who appreciate its playful approach. With no P2E games or staking programs currently available, Brett’s primary appeal lies in its potential to grow as a cultural icon. Despite its limitations, Brett’s ability to rally a loyal fanbase has ensured its spot in the meme coin conversation. Yet, when compared to BTFD’s robust ecosystem, Brett feels more like a side hustle than a main event. A Few Reasons Why BTFD Stands Out What sets BTFD Coin apart is its ability to combine innovation with community. With features like the Bulls Squad, the 100% bonus offer, and real utility through its P2E game and staking rewards, BTFD offers a comprehensive package for investors. The presale’s strategic structure—with escalating prices and token burns—ensures scarcity and value growth for early adopters. Investors who understand the importance of buying the dip will find BTFD’s presale an irresistible opportunity. With over $5.6 million raised and a price trajectory aiming for $0.0006 post-presale, now is the time to act. Don’t Miss Out on the 100% Bonus With the presale currently in Stage 14 , BTFD is offering a limited-time 100% bonus for investors who use the LAUNCH100 code. Here’s how it works: Visit the BTFD Presale . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code “LAUNCH100” in all caps. Input your desired investment amount and confirm the transaction. Every $4500 invested at $0.00016 per BTFD coin results in 28,125,000 tokens, which doubles to 56,250,000 tokens with the bonus code. At the end of the presale, when BTFD hits $0.0006, this investment could skyrocket to $33,750 in value—a stunning 650% ROI. Conclusion: Seize the Moment with BTFD Coin Meme coins are no longer just about laughs; they’re serious business. While Pepe Coin and Brett offer nostalgic and fun alternatives, BTFD Coin is the best new meme coin to join for long term growth. With its thriving community, innovative features, and irresistible presale incentives, BTFD is setting the stage for massive returns. The choice is yours: Watch from the sidelines or join the Bulls Squad today. With the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubling your investment, this is your chance to turn every dip into a golden opportunity. Don’t miss out— head to the BTFD presale now and ride the wave to the next bull run!

The post, co-authored by executives at the crypto-focused VC firm, has once again shed light on the current issues surrounding Ethereum’s leadership and future. The post was co-authored by Paradigm’s CTO Georgios Konstantopoulos, the firm’s co-founder Matt Huang, and its general partners Dan Robinson and Charlie Noyes. In the post, the authors highlighted Ethereum’s prowess as a driving force in the crypto sector, highlighting several aspects including smart contracts, decentralized finance, and decentralized autonomous organizations, among others that have been developed in the ecosystem. The post highlighted the great work that community developers and engineers have done, building a strong foundation for decentralized applications in the future. Paradigm calls for accelerated development on Ethereum The paradigm executives highlighted that the first version of the Ethereum protocol was launched about two years ago, the first project that drew the attention of Paradigm and the entire crypto industry. However, the ecosystem’s core protocol should be improving at a faster pace. The post highlights that Ethereum can make some integral improvements that will help it reach this goal without sacrificing its values. ETHEREUM ACCELERATION . With @matthuang , @danrobinson & @_charlienoyes . pic.twitter.com/5TJq3G7HhX — Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) January 25, 2025 According to the post, the executives are calling on Ethereum to increase its development pace, shipping more than a major update every year. The authors argue against the notion that the best way to protect the decentralization of Ethereum is to slow down the development of the core protocol. “The core development process is one of the main mechanisms for off-chain governance by Ethereum’s social layer, and reflects input from engineers, researchers, validators, and institutions,” the post states. “Ossifying the core protocol would mean abandoning that governance mechanism and Ethereum’s ability to evolve in response to changes in the market structures of areas like L2s and MEV,” the authors added. The authors highlight areas of improvement Paradigm executives highlighted several areas that Ethereum needs to make improvements. According to the authors, there are some improvements that the network can ship quickly instead of holding it off and fitting it in one big annual upgrade. The post mentioned that these improvements are non-controversial but are not done under the perception that only a few changes can be made annually. It mentioned that instead of trying to limit ambitions, Ethereum should do more faster. According to the post, changes like repricing L1’s opcodes to scale Ethereum without making changes to the gas limit. Other changes the authors suggested include improving the UX of batched transactions through further development of the account abstraction framework and developing rollups to meet the increasing demand. The post also shed light on Paradigm’s work on the Reth Ethereum client, which it says holds about 2% of Ethereum’s execution clients. According to Client Diversity, the leading client, Geth, currently holds a 43% market share, with Nethermind coming in second place, claiming around 36% of the market. “We built Reth intentionally as an SDK for building “EVM-core” nodes to enable experimentation and innovation by researchers and engineers,” the post states. “We invite the research community to collaborate with us in prototyping new features towards improving Ethereum’s performance, censorship resistance, and future-proofing, with Reth,” the post reads. The authors finalized the post by mentioning that shipping faster is the only important thing that Ethereum can do to expand what it can do, noting that it will help the protocol deliver the visions in its roadmap. The post highlighted that if it is achieved, then it will pave the way for a global and trust-minimized financial system.

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 118,700 followers on the social media platform X that the RWA project Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) “appears to be breaking out of a bull flag.” A bull flag is typically viewed as a bullish pattern, suggesting that an asset is consolidating before kicking off on a new rally.

At the time of writing, XRP is the third-largest crypto by market cap, and current buying trends suggest it might stay there for a while. As of January 25, 2025, the altcoin has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, with approximately 57.64 billion currently in circulation. Notably, a significant portion of this circulating supply is concentrated among a small number of wallets. Specifically, the top 10 addresses hold about 20.99% of the circulating supply, while the top 50 addresses control approximately 53.3%, which raises the question about the distribution of wealth in the ecosystem and who stands to benefit the most from the price rally. Top 20 Wallets And Their Dominance Over XRP Supply The largest XRP holdings are primarily associated with Ripple Labs, its founders, and major cryptocurrency exchanges. In terms of numbers, data from Coincarp shows that out of the 4,840,747 addresses, the top 20 holders, the top 50 holders, and the top 100 holders hold 50.31%, 63.74%, and 71.76% of the circulating supply, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies To ATH At $3.4, Here’s What’s Driving It And Why The Pump Will Continue According to distribution data, Ripple Labs currently owns around 46 billion XRP tokens, although most are locked in escrow. These tokens are released periodically in pre-set amounts, limiting Ripple’s ability to freely access or manipulate the escrowed funds. Even with these restrictions, Ripple Labs holds a considerable amount of liquid XRP. Data from blockchain explorer Bithomp indicates that one of Ripple’s wallet addresses alone contains over 1.3 billion XRP. Also, Ripple Labs co-founder Chris Larsen is the largest individual holder of XRP, holding over 5 billion tokens, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in the ecosystem. Major exchanges like Binance and Uphold also manage significant reserves. For instance, one of Binance’s wallets holds over 1.3 billion XRP, accounting for approximately 1.33% of the circulating supply. South Korean-based crypto exchange Upbit also holds about 4.38% of the total supply, among a few other exchanges. Holding Distribution: Anything To Fear? These large-scale holdings by exchanges and Ripple-related entities paint a picture of an XRP ecosystem dominated by a relatively small group of stakeholders. However, when you think about it, these large holdings are not in the hands of any private company or individual that would potentially be at risk of manipulating the price for their benefit. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Furthermore, the bulk held by exchanges represents aggregated assets belonging to thousands, if not millions, of individual users. As such, their concentration in exchanges does not pose any unnatural risk to the natural price dynamics for XRP. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.10, having recently reached a seven-year high of $3.38.

Key market indicators suggest SOL could witness further downsizing as Ethereum’s makes a gradual resurgence after Vitalik Buterin announced the team’s intent to stop selling ETH. With SOL recently struggling to hold momentum as selling pressure builds, Ethereum (ETH) stabilizes above the $3,100-$3,300 support zone. This contrasting price action highlights the growing divergence between the two major Layer-1 competitors, as Ethereum’s looks poised to regain market dominance. Solana Price Weakens as Ethereum Stabilizes Solana (SOL) continues to show bearish price action as Ethereum’s (ETH) stability amid volatile market trends suggests traders are selectively navigating the markets. Analyzing the Ethereum price forecast chart , ETH price is consolidating above a key support zone between $3,050 and $3,208. This support is reinforced by the 200-day Moving Average (MA), a critical technical indicator for gauging long-term trends. Solana Price Technical Analysis vs. Ethereum (ETH) According to the TradingView chart above, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 47.57, signaling neutral momentum and potential for accumulation. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram shows mild bearish divergence but suggests weakening downside pressure, as recent bars narrow toward the zero line. These factors point to ETH price stabilizing, creating a subdued environment for correlated altcoins like Solana. SOL, by contrast, lacks strong institutional interest evident in Ethereum’s support zones. With ETH finding buyers near its 200-day MA and key horizontal levels, SOL’s price weakness could signal a flight to safety toward larger-cap assets. If Ethereum continues to consolidate above $3,200, it could exert indirect resistance on SOL, limiting its ability to recover in the short term. Solana bulls must reclaim lost support zones to shift sentiment to the next bullish phase. Solana Price Forecast: SOL To Crash 20% As Selling Pressure Builds Looking at the near-term Solana price forecast , current market dynamics indicate a bearish outlook, with a potential 20% decline as selling pressure intensifies. As seen in the chart below, SOL price has recently breached key support levels, including the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $232.51 and the 200-day SMA at $168.88, signaling weakening demand. The Swing Failure Pattern (SFP) due to excessive selling further confirms the bearish sentiment, as buyers failed to sustain upward momentum, leading to a breakdown. Solana Price Forecast The price is currently testing the range midpoint at $232.51, which now acts as resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other momentum indicators are likely in oversold territory, but without significant buying interest, a rebound seems unlikely. The demand zone around $168.88, aligned with the 200-day SMA, is the next critical support level.

As 2025 unfolds, the focus is on projects that have demonstrated resilience, innovation, and the potential for significant returns. From digital currencies aiming to revolutionize cross-border transactions to tokens driving blockchain scalability, these altcoins are reshaping the investment landscape. Qubetics , Terra Classic, and SEI have emerged as standout projects, making a compelling case for why they are the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. Qubetics, in particular, is capturing attention with its presale performance and groundbreaking Web3 solutions. It’s a name that’s becoming synonymous with innovation and accessibility in the blockchain world. With milestones like over $10.6 million raised during its presale and advanced tools designed for developers and businesses, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the Web3 era. Meanwhile, Terra Classic and SEI continue to build their reputations within the crypto space. Terra Classic, known for its ongoing commitment to reducing token supply, remains a favorite among value-seeking investors. SEI, on the other hand, focuses on speed and scalability, attracting developers and strategic partners alike. Each project has carved out a niche, serving diverse investor interests. Here’s why they’re among the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. Qubetics: The World’s First Web3 Aggregator Redefining Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is making waves, and it’s easy to see why. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator , this project is designed to simplify blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps) for everyone, from tech-savvy professionals to everyday users. With over $10.6 million raised during its presale, more than 439 million $TICS tokens sold, and a growing community of over 16,000 token holders, Qubetics is quickly becoming a household name in the crypto space. Priced at $0.0551 in its 18th presale stage, analysts are forecasting remarkable returns for $TICS holders. By the end of the presale, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, a staggering 353.39% return. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. Post-presale predictions suggest $TICS could soar to $5 or even $15 after the Mainnet launch, offering unparalleled investment potential. The buzz around Qubetics isn’t just about the numbers. Its innovative focus on cross-border transactions is a game-changer. Picture a small e-commerce business in Buenos Aires trying to pay suppliers in another country. Traditional banking methods are slow, expensive, and often riddled with hidden fees. Qubetics streamlines the process, enabling fast, cost-effective, and secure payments that eliminate middlemen. Imagine a freelance designer in Mexico City receiving instant payments from clients worldwide—that’s the future Qubetics is building.

Whether it’s a blockchain-based supply chain solution or a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, the possibilities are endless.

Terra Classic: The Token That Keeps Evolving Terra Classic has weathered its share of challenges, but its resilience has solidified its place as a staple in the crypto market. With a current price of $0.0000815, Terra Classic continues to attract investors drawn to its innovative approach to reducing token supply. Earlier this month, Finance executed a burn of 1.7 billion LUNC tokens, aiming to lower the circulating supply and enhance its long-term value. What makes Terra Classic stand out is its community-driven approach. Investors and developers alike have rallied behind the project, ensuring its survival and growth even in turbulent times. Terra Classic’s unique position as a deflationary token has captured the imagination of those looking for long-term growth potential. The consistent token burns demonstrate the project’s commitment to value creation, offering a solid alternative to traditional investments. Think about an investor in Rio de Janeiro exploring ways to diversify their portfolio. Terra Classic provides an affordable entry point into crypto, with the potential for exponential growth. As the token supply decreases over time, the value proposition becomes even more attractive. It’s this deflationary model that sets Terra Classic apart as one of the best altcoins to buy in January 2025. SEI: Speed, Scalability, and a Growing Ecosystem SEI has carved out a reputation as a high-performance blockchain platform focused on scalability and speed. With a current trading price of $0.339, SEI has seen a recent dip, but that hasn’t deterred analysts from predicting a bright future. Many believe SEI could reach $1 by the end of 2025, driven by increased adoption and its expanding ecosystem. What makes SEI unique is its dedication to creating a blockchain that can handle large-scale applications without compromising efficiency. This focus has attracted a strong developer community and strategic partnerships, making it a go-to platform for building scalable dApps. Picture a tech startup in Colombia leveraging SEI’s ecosystem to create a high-speed payment platform. The blockchain’s performance ensures seamless transactions, making it a preferred choice for developers worldwide. SEI’s commitment to innovation doesn’t stop at speed.

With success stories like Dogecoin paving the way, the new year introduces Arctic Pablo, a meme coin with an adventurous twist. The crypto landscape is buzzing with opportunities, and if you missed Dogecoin’s early days, this could be your shot at a high-potential investment. Arctic Pablo is creating waves with its presale, unique narrative, and massive ROI potential, while Dogecoin continues to prove its staying power. Let’s dive into these two captivating projects and uncover why they’re the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo: A Mystical Journey to Riches Imagine a daring explorer named Arctic Pablo braving icy tundras, his snowmobile blazing trails through frostbitten terrains. This isn’t just a story—it’s the heart of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC). As Arctic Pablo discovers mystical tokens hidden in icy realms, he invites the world to join him on a journey that blends myth with reality. With each location in the presale, Arctic Pablo uncovers new treasures, and early investors are reaping the rewards. The Arctic Pablo presale has already raised over $430,000 in just 15 days, and the momentum is growing fast. With a current price of $0.000038, $APC offers early adopters an unmatched chance for exponential gains. By the time it hits its final presale price of $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008, investors could see returns of over 30,692%. Arctic Pablo’s weekly token burns during the presale ensure scarcity, driving up value. Every unsold token is permanently removed, creating a deflationary environment that benefits holders. Combined with a 66% APY staking program, $APC is designed to reward long-term investors. Picture this: by staking your tokens, you’re not only earning rewards but also participating in Arctic Pablo’s legendary journey. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo’s is location-based. Currently, he’s in Metropolis, a realm filled with untapped treasures, and his next destination is Snowy Shores. But here’s the twist: if he discovers the treasure earlier than expected, the presale will move on—leaving latecomers behind. This unique approach adds urgency and excitement, making $APC one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo isn’t just about financial returns; it’s a narrative-driven adventure that brings investors into a story of exploration and discovery. Don’t wait until the final presale location—join the journey now and secure your stake in Arctic Pablo’s mystical legacy. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Started It All No discussion of meme coins is complete without mentioning Dogecoin. What began as a playful jab at Bitcoin has now become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies globally. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged by over 15,000%, making millionaires out of early adopters. Its mascot, the Shiba Inu dog, has become a cultural icon, symbolizing the fun and community-driven nature of crypto. Dogecoin operates on simplicity. It doesn’t promise elaborate narratives or cutting-edge features; instead, it thrives on its loyal fanbase and massive adoption. From tipping content creators to facilitating microtransactions, Dogecoin has cemented its utility. But with its current price hovering around $0.07, many investors wonder if it can replicate its past performance. Here’s where Arctic Pablo shines as a complementary investment. While Dogecoin offers stability and brand recognition, Arctic Pablo delivers innovation and high ROI potential. Imagine owning Dogecoin back in 2013—that’s the kind of opportunity Arctic Pablo presents today. And with its presale still in early phases, now’s the time to act. Dogecoin’s journey also underscores the importance of timing. Early adopters saw exponential gains, but those who joined late missed out on the windfall. Don’t let history repeat itself. Arctic Pablo’s adventurous narrative and deflationary tokenomics could make it the next big thing in the meme coin space. If you’ve been on the sidelines, it’s time to take the plunge and be part of Arctic Pablo’s journey. Conclusion: The Time to Act Is Now Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo and Dogecoin are the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo’s presale is a golden opportunity to join a thrilling adventure with unmatched ROI potential, while Dogecoin’s legacy continues to provide value and stability. Whether you’re an experienced investor or a curious newcomer, now is the time to act. Don’t let these opportunities pass you by. Join the Arctic Pablo presale today and secure your place in a story of wealth and discovery.

Trump Buys XRP (TRUMPXRP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPXRP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Buys XRP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys XRP could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys XRP launched with over $32,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys XRP on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys XRP by entering its contract address (CA) – HjQUfYDa2vgcG3AYb8z5Sernxm1ttRfhjL4N7A65BY7x – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPXRP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|XRP|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 02:48:20

While these coins make headlines for their viral appeal, their reliance on hype often overshadows a lack of real-world utility. In contrast, Lightchain AI is emerging as a project with substance, combining blockchain and artificial intelligence to address tangible challenges. Currently priced at $0.005625 during its presale and having raised over $12.8 million, Lightchain AI offers a long-term alternative for investors seeking more than speculative gains. Rise (and Limits) of $TRUMP and $MELANIA Coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA coins have drawn significant attention by leveraging their ties to high-profile figures. Their launches created a frenzy among meme coin enthusiasts, leading to sharp price increases fueled by social media and retail hype. These coins have become cultural symbols for supporters of Donald and Melania Trump, with their political branding serving as the primary driver of interest. However, the volatility of these meme coins highlights their biggest drawback – a lack of utility. Once the hype subsides, these tokens often struggle to maintain value, leaving investors exposed to significant risks. This has led many to seek alternatives with sustainable growth potential and real-world applications—such as Lightchain AI . Lightchain AI – Beyond the Hype Unlike $TRUMP and $MELANIA, Lightchain AI is grounded in innovation and utility. One of its key features is its AI-Driven Decentralized Data Solutions, which enable businesses to securely store, process, and analyze data using blockchain technology. This innovation appeals to enterprises that require efficient and scalable systems for managing sensitive information. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s Presale Structure demonstrates its commitment to fostering an engaged community. By raising over $12.8 million during its presale, the platform has shown strong early-stage adoption, with investors confident in its ability to deliver on its promises. Lightchain AI’s roadmap, including its testnet launch in January 2025 and mainnet rollout in March, provides clear milestones for growth. Why Investors Are Choosing Lightchain AI For investors, the choice between meme coins and utility-driven projects like Lightchain AI is becoming increasingly clear. While $TRUMP and $MELANIA offer short-term excitement, their speculative nature makes them inherently unstable. Lightchain AI , on the other hand, provides a sustainable investment opportunity by addressing real-world challenges with advanced technology. Lightchain AI’s focus on empowering developers with tools to build decentralized applications (dApps) further cements its position as a leader in blockchain innovation. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, the platform ensures its relevance in a rapidly evolving market. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-26 03:00:00

According to a Jan. 25 repo rt by Bloomberg, Elon wa nts blockchain to track federal spending, secure sensitive data, process payments, and even manage government buildings. The D.O.G.E, established by ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump, is tasked with making government tech leaner, meaner, and cheaper. The report says D.O.G.E has already met with representatives from public blockchain networks to evaluate what works and what doesn’t. Trump’s executive order kicks things off The Department of Government Efficiency was made official with an executive order signed by Trump on January 20. D.O.G.E has to deliver recommendations for spending cuts by July 4, 2026. Bloomberg’s report said Elon wasted no time, recruiting 100 volunteers before Trump even stepped into the Oval to start coding for D.O.G.E-related projects. In December, a person reportedly pitched Trump’s transition team in Palm Beach, Florida, on how blockchain could protect critical government data and track federal dollars. The pitch landed with Elon’s team, who believe a decentralized ledger could slash fraud, abuse, and unnecessary spending in federal programs. Using blockchain to run an operation as massive as the U.S. government is uncharted territory, though. Blockchain efforts in corporate America—like Walmart’s private blockchain for tracking supply chains—have been hit or miss. Many private blockchain experiments failed due to governance issues, high costs, or inefficiency compared to traditional databases. Public blockchains, on the other hand, offer transparency but come with their own baggage. Bitcoin and Solana, for instance, operate on decentralized networks of computers, which the Trump administration has used to launch meme coins TRUMP and MELANIA. Still, giants like BlackRock have started using public blockchains for business. BlackRock issued a money-market fund on crypto ledgers, and California’s Department of Motor Vehicles digitized millions of car titles on Avalanche. If D.O.G.E does move forward with blockchain, the scale of the project would dwarf anything attempted in the private sector. And crypto elites are already so excited about the prospects. Binance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao pointed out : “All governments should track all their spending on the blockchain, an immutable public ledger. It’s called ‘public spending’ for a reason.” And Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said , “Well, I’m thinking this is a job for a triumvirate of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Midnight. Yo, Doge Master Elon Musk, give us a call. We’ll do it for free.” Elon’s White House takeover Elon’s D.O.G.E department is already embedded in the White House. The team has office space in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and plans to deploy four-person D.O.G.E teams to every federal agency. Elon’s close friendship with Trump plays a huge role in all of this. Elon poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign and has become his closest adviser. Trump even knighted him as the nation’s ‘First Buddy.’ But Elon’s deep ties to government contracts, including those of his companies Tesla and SpaceX, are bringing questions about conflicts of interest. Critics say Elon’s recommendations for budget cuts could clash with his personal business dealings. Elon, for his part, says he’s not taking a salary for leading D.O.G.E. But this guy has had a love-hate relationship with crypto for years. Also, a union representing hundreds of thousands of federal employees has already sued the Trump administration over D.O.G.E. The lawsuit said the initiative puts workers’ jobs at risk and doesn’t address systemic issues within federal agencies.

Kamala Sucks (KAMASUCK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because KAMASUCK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Kamala Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Kamala Sucks could become the next viral memecoin. Kamala Sucks launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Kamala Sucks on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kamala Sucks by entering its contract address (CA) – KFywQqjGH3WdEQ4hR42oYQ17v4nSePom6AjyJc8TNfU – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like KAMASUCK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 03:59:15

With its innovative strategies in e-commerce and decentralized decision-making, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a top investment pick for 2025. By raising $900,000 in its presale phase and boasting a potential 6,430% ROI, Web3Bay transcends mere speculation to provide real utility and scalability in a market poised for transformation. Ripple (XRP) Targets $4 After Strong Market Uptrend Ripple (XRP) is poised to reach $4 following its recent jump to $3, sparked by increased crypto market interest after President Trump’s latest inauguration. Noted analyst Ali Martinez points out that XRP has emerged from a bullish flag pattern, suggesting a rise to $4.40 soon. Over the last week, XRP has seen a 23.4% increase and 40.4% over the month. Positive signs from technical tools like the relative strength index (RSI) above its mid-point indicate strong bullish momentum. Supported by significant buyer interest, XRP’s journey to $4 looks promising. Chainlink (LINK) Price Trend: Bullish Trajectory Aims for $30.81 Chainlink (LINK) exhibits strong upward trends, moving through a five-wave Elliott Wave pattern on daily and hourly charts. The daily RSI indicates more room for growth before reaching overbought territory, with Wave (v) aiming to surpass the prior high of $30.81. Supportive Fibonacci levels hint at sustained upward movement. On the hourly chart, Wave (iii) progresses after a slight retreat in Wave (ii) to $22.17. With targets set near $30.81, Chainlink’s outlook is positive. However, a drop below $22.74 could trigger corrections, making these levels critical for traders. Web3Bay: A Wise Choice for Tangible Benefits and High ROI Web3Bay’s 3BAY token underpins its decentralized e-commerce framework, providing real benefits and growth potential. At $0.004562625 in its fourth presale stage and expected to launch at $0.1959, it offers a massive 6,430% ROI. In contrast, Ripple’s XRP has yet to reach past highs, and Chainlink’s LINK depends on the DeFi sector’s fortunes. Web3Bay’s broad appeal and practical approach set it apart as an investment choice. Investing $1,000 in 3BAY now could return over $42,900 at launch. This projection is backed by Web3Bay’s practical model. As the platform gains users, demand for 3BAY tokens will likely increase, boosting their value over time. Why Web3Bay Promises Long-Term Gains Web3Bay’s strategy extends beyond immediate profits. Its roadmap is geared toward growth and engaging users, ensuring its relevance for the future. Essential features include: NFT Marketplace: A venue for artists and collectors to trade digital items smoothly. Decentralized Governance: Token holders have a say in platform decisions, fostering a community-led environment. Hybrid Payment System: Accepts both crypto and traditional payments like PayPal, broadening its user base. Layer-2 Scaling: Keeps transactions fast and cheap even at high-demand times, enhancing user experience. These initiatives position Web3Bay as more than just a token; it’s a well-rounded solution tackling the $5 trillion e-commerce market’s inefficiencies. Unlike Chainlink’s limited focus and Ripple’s regulatory hurdles, Web3Bay is crafting a viable global commerce solution. Long Stroy, Short! Smart investors recognize the importance of utility tokens linked to platforms that address real challenges. Like Ethereum and Binance Coin, which moved past speculative phases to prove their value, Web3Bay is on a path to significant impact. Already with $900,000 from its presale and a token price that rises each round, Web3Bay’s structured pricing model rewards early backers, urging quick action. Those who joined early are already seeing substantial gains, and the forecasted launch price of $0.1959 presents even more potential. While Chainlink and Ripple excel in their specific blockchain and payment niches, Web3Bay introduces a unique decentralized e-commerce platform, making it a top investment in 2025 .

His remarks focus on identifying which projects qualify for the proposed zero capital gains tax and the implications for companies with global affiliations. Crypto Lawyer John Deaton Raises Concerns Over U.S. Tax Policies In a recent tweet , John Deaton discussed the ambiguity surrounding U.S.-based cryptocurrency projects. He questioned whether projects with operations or foundations abroad, such as Solana and Tezos, would meet the requirements for tax exemptions. Solana Labs, headquartered in San Francisco, operates under the Solana Foundation based in Switzerland, while Tezos was developed by U.S.-based Arthur and Kathleen Breitman but is governed by the Switzerland-based Tezos Foundation. Deaton’s inquiry centers on whether such hybrid structures qualify as U.S.-based entities under the proposed tax policies. John Deaton also pointed to cryptocurrencies like XRP, XLM, HBAR, AVAX, and XCH, which may face fewer jurisdictional hurdles. These projects meet the criteria on the surface, potentially positioning them to benefit from the zero capital gains tax. Moreover, Deaton emphasized the potential for tax incentives to drive broader adoption of cryptocurrencies as corporate treasury assets. He questioned whether companies adopting digital assets like XRP, XLM, and HBAR would gain a competitive edge under the proposed zero capital gains tax policy. He also raised concerns about the treatment of foreign entities with U.S. operations, such as Hut 8, and their eligibility for tax benefits. More so, recently the pro-XRP lawyer highlighted four key objectives for the White House Crypto Council. He urged its members to focus on critical areas like SAB 121, the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, crypto tax payments, and overarching crypto taxation policies. U.S. Crypto Companies and Mining Firms Could Reap Benefits John Deaton further explored how U.S.-based companies, including Ripple, Gemini, and ConsenSys, might benefit from the tax exemption if it applies to corporations. The tax breaks could incentivize these firms to expand their crypto holdings and encourage other companies to adopt cryptocurrency as a reserve asset. Deaton also addressed the status of Bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital Holdings. These U.S.-based miners might qualify for the exemption, but questions remain about companies like Hut 8 Corp, a Canadian entity with expanding operations in the U.S. John Deaton highlighted the need for clarity on whether international companies with significant U.S. activities could also benefit. Treasury Reserve Strategies and Corporate Crypto Adoption Another key issue raised by Deaton involves corporations adopting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP, and HBAR as part of their treasury reserves. He questioned whether such strategies would qualify these companies for tax benefits under the new policies. Prominent firms like MicroStrategy, known for its Bitcoin holdings, could stand to gain from the tax exemption if their crypto reserve strategies align with the proposed framework. The policy might also encourage other companies to include crypto in their balance sheets. More so, recently, Deaton also emphasized the broader challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry. He criticized past regulatory actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he described as resource-draining and counterproductive. John Deaton called for an end to what he referred to as “crypto wars,” urging a shift toward clearer regulations to support innovation.

This new token provides a straightforward opportunity for traders and analysts to participate in its presale. With its utility-based tokens, this project aims to transform the landscape of meme coins. Let’s explore why investors are shifting their attention to this innovative offering. High Expectations from Solana Investors and Newer Options Solana(SOL) has long been celebrated for its high-throughput blockchain capabilities. It is a good alternative among developers and investors looking for scalability beyond Ethereum. The sol price has seen remarkable fluctuations, reflecting its volatile yet promising nature. However, as the market evolves, the quest for the next big opportunity leads many to explore emerging tokens like Panshibi . Solana investors, accustomed to the thrill of rapid price movements and the promise of blockchain innovation, enjoy the blend of entertainment and financial gain in Panshibi. The meme coin market offers a different kind of investment narrative than what Solana has traditionally provided. As the sol price stabilizes or faces resistance at higher levels, the allure of a project like Panshibi simply increases. Luckily, Panshibi offers a community-driven approach with its governance model that involves all token holders. This has pushed most Solana investors to diversify their Solana portfolios into what could be the next big meme coin phenomenon. The SUI Scenario Sui (SUI), with its focus on high performance and a developer-friendly environment, has attracted a different segment of the crypto community. However, even with impressive tech capabilities in Sui, the meme coin craze of 2025 has not spared its investors from looking elsewhere. The appeal of Panshibi lies not just in its potential for high returns but also in its unique positioning in the market. Sui holders are drawn to Panshibi for its novelty – merging the cultural significance of Asia, the universal appeal of pandas, and the vibrant world of meme coins. This shift is partly driven by the search for assets that can offer both entertainment and utility, something Sui does not directly cater to. With the meme coin market’s valuation hitting $115 billion in January 2025, the opportunity for growth in Panshibi seems vast. This means Sui investors have the opportunity to allocate portions of their holdings into what could be the best financial decision of 2025. Panshibi: The Meme Coin That’s Redefining Community and Investment Panshibi stands out in the crowded meme coin market with its unique tokenomics. At its core, Panshibi aims to unite three significant communities: those in Asia, panda lovers, and meme coin enthusiasts. This combination allows Panshibi to incorporate social finance and AI elements, actively engaging its community. Holders of SHIBI, Panshibi’s native token, are not just passive investors; they are active participants in a vibrant ecosystem. They have a say in project decisions and enjoy exclusive member perks through the Bamboo Private VIP Club. The Panshibi presale exemplifies its potential. It has a cap of $10 million and is structured across 15 stages, with the token price set to increase by 1,200% during the presale. Additionally, there is an ambitious projection of 145,000% growth after the launch. This strategy aims to reward early supporters and create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors. Panshibi also emphasizes security and transparency, backed by a complete smart contract audit by Coinsult. As we look ahead to 2025, the meme coin market is expected to continue expanding as more traders and investors seek significant returns. For investors from Solana and Sui, Panshibi is more than just another token to add to their portfolios; it offers the chance to engage with a community that promises profits and rewards regardless of the price of Sui or Sol. Given that the token’s liquidity is locked for ten years and team tokens for two years, the future of Panshibi looks promising. For Sol and Sui enthusiasts searching for something to believe in, Panshibi represents hope for the meme coin market and cryptocurrency as a whole.

39513358,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=663210,1737866733,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39513358.jpeg,Wall Street CEOs support all of Trump’s pro-crypto plans,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-ceos-trump-pro-crypto-plans/,"Wall Street is finally warming up to crypto, thanks to President Donald Trump’s aggressive push to boost the industry, especially after Jan. 23rd’s executive order for the National Digital Asset Stockpile. Barely a week into Trump’s second term, a Jan. 25 report by CNBC says top financial executives are falling in line with his pro-crypto policies in a major pivot for an industry that previously kept Bitcoin at arm’s length. Trump’s executive order emphasizes “protecting and promoting” the use and development of cryptocurrencies. Wall Street CEOs jump in In Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said, “We’ll be working with Treasury and the other regulators to figure out how we can offer that in a safe way.” The bank is known for pushing boundaries in crypto before most of its peers. In 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first major U.S. institution to give wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds. By 2024, it had authorized its advisors to pitch bitcoin ETFs to clients. ‘Crypto president’ Trump is surrounding himself with pro-crypto allies to make sure his agenda sticks. Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner under George W. Bush, has been nominated to lead the SEC. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, has been tapped as Commerce Secretary. Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager with a Bitcoin obsession, is Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary. If confirmed, Scott will oversee the IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network—two agencies critical to creating clear tax and compliance policies for crypto. Trump’s policies are addressing longstanding frustrations from Wall Street. One major complaint has been the SEC’s 2022 accounting rule, known as SAB 121, which forced banks to classify cryptocurrencies as liabilities on their balance sheets. This rule discouraged banks from offering crypto custody services by imposing strict capital requirements. But as Cryptopolitan reported on Jan. 23rd, the SEC rescinded SAB 121, removing one of the biggest roadblocks for financial institutions looking to engage with digital assets. “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun,” said SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who was tapped on Tuesday to lead a new “crypto task force.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, also speaking in Davos, welcomed the changes. “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,” he said. He pointed to crypto’s potential as a payment system, comparing it to Visa or Apple Pay. However, Moynihan steered clear of endorsing cryptos as investment assets, calling that “a separate question.” Bitcoin’s price has of course responded to the optimism. On Monday, it surged to nearly $110,000—its highest price ever—before settling at around $106,000 as of press time. Banks lobby for clear rules as adoption grows While the SEC’s actions have brought a lot of excitement, Wall Street is still grappling with other regulatory issues. Anti-money laundering (AML) rules remain a sticking point, as inconsistent guidelines make it difficult for banks to serve certain industries. Jamie Dimon, the anti-crypto CEO of JPMorgan Chase, summed up the frustration on a podcast earlier this week: “There should be far cleaner lines about what we have to do and what we don’t have to do. We’ve been complaining about this for years. We need to fix it.” Wall Street CEOs are also lobbying for a unified federal standard to replace the patchwork of state laws that complicate compliance. Trump’s administration is being pressured to address these challenges as part of its broader effort to streamline crypto regulation. Though on Thursday, Trump criticized JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, accusing them of denying services to conservative customers. The issue, known as “debanking,” has long been a Republican talking point. “We take this issue very seriously,” Bank of America said on Friday. “We will be engaging with the administration and Congress regarding the extensive government regulations that sometimes result in requirements to exit relationships.” The renewed focus on AML rules comes after a 2020 law aimed at overhauling these regulations fell short of its goals. Banks continue to push for clearer guidelines, arguing that inconsistent rules force them to walk away from certain clients and industries out of fear of penalties.

Speculation about Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and its potential role in the financial framework has gained momentum, fueled by crypto commentators like Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy. Ripple’s RLUSD and Federal Oversight Speculations Farina recently shared his views on X, proposing that the U.S. government could transfer Ripple’s escrowed XRP into federal reserves, effectively taking control of the asset. He argued that RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin launched in December 2024 , might serve as a central currency while adhering to regulatory standards. I speculate the Escrow is transferred to the U.S. stockpile, with the Gov. effectively taking control of $XRP while maintaining regulatory oversight. RLUSD becomes the CBDC. Chess, not checkers. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) January 23, 2025 One commenter echoed this speculation, stating , “Your speculation looks pretty good to me… Australia has had its CBDC set up for at least a couple of years, but has gone totally under the radar.” This highlights how other nations have approached digital currencies differently, creating a point of comparison for the U.S. financial strategy. However, considering Trump’s recent ban on CBDCs, he might have different plans for the U.S. crypto industry. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Ban on CBDCs and RLUSD’s Unique Position Trump’s executive order banning CBDCs leaves room for stablecoins like RLUSD to act as alternatives. One commenter noted , “RLUSD will act as a central currency.” This perspective suggests that RLUSD could fulfill functions similar to a CBDC while operating within private-sector boundaries. This explanation also aligns with a recent analysis from Austin King, a former Ripple employee, who believes Trump will empower the private sector and companies like Ripple through his crypto initiatives. By leveraging its stablecoin, Ripple could bridge the gap between private innovation and government oversight. Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure, known for its speed and efficiency, may position RLUSD as a practical solution for governments seeking digital currency innovation without creating centralized government-issued digital currencies. This approach could align with the U.S. government’s objectives under the new executive order. Ripple’s emphasis on regulatory compliance, like RLUSD’s NYDFS certification, also serves as a strong foundation for the asset. Ripple’s partnerships with international financial institutions XRP and RLUSD and Ripple’s technology could potentially become critical components in the U.S. financial ecosystem.

Hitler Musk (HITMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HITMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Hitler Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Hitler Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Hitler Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Hitler Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Hitler Musk by entering its contract address (CA) – GB5uSMr95szepTSfj6sbJHFxMaBHwwyBzUY6dPAWZCCH – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HITMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 05:00:32

Some Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are growing weary of the asset’s inherent volatility and are now seeking projects that might bring more stability. Among these sits Remittix (RTX), a powerful PayFi solution currently gaining traction in its presale for its modern approach to cross-border payments. So can Dogecoin (DOGE) bounce back and what is all the fuss about Remittix (RTX) ? Dogecoin Sees 8.4% Price Drop Dogecoin is down 6.58% in 24hrs and currently trades at $0.3713. Dogecoin (DOGE) is now trading near a key support level at $0.39 The RSI suggests that Dogecoin may be approaching oversold territory, which could precede a possible short term recovery. Conversely, the MACD dropped below the signal line indicating bearish sentiments for Dogecoin (DOGE) in the coming days. Interestingly, activity on the Dogecoin network has spiked recently. Address activity has hit a seven month high and whale transactions have peaked. Much like with other meme coins, Dogecoin’s current volatility makes it hard to predict what might happen next. Remittix Changes the Game for Cross-Border Payments The Remittix (RTX) platform lets you convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and send money directly to bank accounts worldwide. Unlike traditional systems with unpredictable fees, Remittix uses a flat fee model, ensuring recipients know the exact amount being sent. Such a simple operational model and the low costs associated with Remittix make it a solid choice for both individuals and businesses. Another key feature contributing to Remittix’s (RTX) broad adoption is its ability to integrate with traditional financial infrastructures. Unlike many blockchain based solutions demanding technical expertise, Remittix ensures recipients experience benefit from crypto payments while enjoying the simplicity of traditional bank transfers and without needing a deep understanding of the crypto space. The straightforwardness of this system removes barriers to access, bridging the gap between digital assets and mainstream financial networks. Remittix (RTX) is also setting an example with its commitment to financial inclusion. RTX offers round the clock access to a global payment system that eliminates the limitations of traditional banking systems; the platform lets users in underbanked regions participate in global commerce. This accessibility, its instant settlement capabilities and transparent fee model, position Remittix as a major player in bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Remittix Powers Through Presale, Passing $7 Million Remittix (RTX) is currently seeing dominance in its presale, which has already raised over $7 million with tokens on offer for an enticing price of just $0.0350. As utility focused projects are becoming more of a priority in the crypto space, Remittix shines above others for its ability to solve real world problems and analysts anticipate a steep price gain of 800% in the presale alone. As it positions itself to dominate the prosperous cross-border payments space, Remittix is not a project to miss out on in 2025.

The SHIB token peaked at $0.00003340 in December and has plunged by about 40% to the current $0.00002. So, is the SHIB coin a good buy as a death cross approaches? Shiba Inu coin price technical analysis: death cross pattern nears The daily chart shows that the SHIB price peaked at $0.00003340 and then retreated to the psychological point at $0.000020. Technicals suggest that the SHIB coin has more downside. It has formed what looks like a head-and-shoulders pattern, which often leads to more downside in the longer term. The coin is also about to form a death cross pattern, which happens when the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) cross each other. The spread between the two averages has continued to narrow, and currently stands at just 3.1%, down from over 10% a few days ago. A death cross is often seen as being one of the riskiest chart patterns in the financial market. That’s because it is a sign that bears have overcome the bulls, which leads to more downside. The coin has also formed a double-top chart pattern at $0.00002490. Like the death cross, this is also a highly popular bearish chart patterns. The Shiba Inu price has also moved to the closely watched 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, there is a risk that the coin will have a strong bearish breakdown in the next few weeks. If this happens, the next price to watch will be $0.00001850, its lowest swing on December 20. A drop below that support level will point to more downside, potentially to the 78.6% point at $0.00001568, down by 23% below the current point. Shiba Inu’s bearish outlook will remain as long as it is below the double-top point at $0.00002490. Why has SHIB coin crashed? There are two main reasons why the Shiba Inu price has crashed in the past few months. First, it has plunged as investors have rotated to newer and shinier meme coins. Most recently, they moved to the Official Trump and Melania meme coins that surged before the inauguration. Some cash moved from old meme tokens to these ones as investors looked for strong gains. A good example is the daily volume figures . SHIB had a 24-hour volume of $163 million, much lower than Official Trump’s $4.45 billion and Pudgy Penguins’ $169 million. Melania Trump’s meme coin had a daily volume of $215 million. Second, while the Shibarium is growing, data shows that the fees collected have continued falling. Shibarium’s completed transactions jumped to over 847 million, an impressive figure for a recently launched network. The average transaction fee has dropped 0.000064 BONE from 0.0003 BONE a month earlier. At the same time, the total sum of BONE fees collected by the network has continued to fall thos year and stands at less than 400 BONE per day. These fees are important because they signal whether the layer-2 network is growing or not. They are also crucial because their impact on Shibarium’s burn rate has dropped.

Many of them provide safe trends for traders to invest in. Certain coins have been tipped to increase by 1000x in 2025. PEPE’s price prediction shows it is on course to achieve this feat. Other new projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) have also been tipped to achieve this feat. Let’s find out why! PEPE price prediction: whale accumulation suggests future gains amidst a price decrease PEPE is on course for an explosive price gain in 2025. Although its price at the moment may not depict this prediction, experts believe accumulation by whales could propel it to a new ATH. It is reduced by 4.02% today with a price of $0.00001512. Recent blockchain data shows that major investors have strategically bought PEPE during this dip. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently bought 508.6 million PEPE tokens. This action by a major investor in the crypto world has further fueled market speculations that PEPE could experience a 1000x increase in 2025. Vitalik Buterin’s endorsement, the increasing social media presence, and active addresses also reinforce PEPE’s price prediction. Experts also believe that PEPE’s double bottom formation at a critical support level and its bullish falling wedge are major signs of an incoming sustained increase.

The Russian president said that he is optimistic direct talks with Trump could lead to mutually beneficial outcomes, emphasizing the need for “calm and realistic discussions.” Putin then criticized Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pointing to a decree Zelenskiy signed that prohibits Ukraine from negotiating with him. This, according to Putin, complicates the possibility of peace talks. “We are ready to talk,” he said in the interview, but added that progress depends heavily on the choices made by the current US administration. NATO praises Trump’s push for sanctions NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was also quick to applaud Trump’s call for tougher sanctions and tariffs on Russia. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Rutte said, “I was very, very happy with Trump’s position to put more sanctions on Russia. The Russian economy is in terrible shape, and these measures will help squeeze it further.” He also urged European nations to follow Trump’s lead, encouraging them to increase their economic pressure on Moscow to deplete Russia’s war funds. Rutte pointed out the importance of a sustainable resolution to the war, adding that any peace deal should prevent Russia from regaining its territorial ambitions. He warned that Russia’s allies, including China and North Korea, would celebrate a weak settlement, which would embolden Moscow to attempt even more land grabs. “We must reach a position where Russia will never again dare to take even one square kilometer of Ukraine,” Rutte said. On Jan. 22nd, president Trump issued a warning through his Truth Social platform: “If no deal is reached to end the war, we’ll have no choice but to impose high tariffs, taxes, and sanctions on anything Russia sells to the US or our allies.” He added , “Let’s get this war—one that never would’ve started if I were president—over with. We can do it the easy way or the hard way.” Financial giants weigh in on Trump’s tariff strategy Wall Street leaders have chimed in on Trump’s escalating trade threats, offering varied perspectives. At the Davos event, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged concerns about inflation and trade wars but said tariffs could be effective if used strategically. “If it’s a little inflationary but good for national security, so be it,” he said. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon suggested in an interview with CNBC that Trump’s tariffs might serve as leverage to renegotiate global trade agreements. He added that how quickly and thoughtfully these measures are implemented would determine their effectiveness. Trump’s tariff threats extend beyond Russia. He has promised to impose a 10% levy on Chinese goods and a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico. The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a key deal negotiated during Trump’s first term, is up for review in 2026. Trump has also accused the European Union of unfair trade practices, pointing to the $214 billion trade deficit the US recorded with the EU in 2024.

Dogecoin News: Key Factors That Could Drive the DOGE Price Dogecoin has started 2025 on a positive note, showing strong growth in January.

Currently, the Dogecoin price is at $0.356 and if it continues its uptrend, DOGE could get near its ATH from May 2021. For Dogecoin to reach one dollar by March, three key factors could drive this price surge. First, wider adoption by retailers would boost demand, helping to increase its value. Second, a continued positive market outlook and more activity from whales could generate enough momentum to push the price higher. Also, if Dogecoin can break through important resistance levels, it could signal a stronger bullish trend, which would bring it closer to the one-dollar target. Join the $SHIBI Presale Today!

Bitcoin (BTC) and leading cryptocurrencies have consolidated over the past week, sparking speculations despite pro-cryptocurrency Donald Trump’s inauguration. Whereas, meme coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and VINE have emerged as the talk of the cryptocurrency town over the week, gaining significant traction in light of broader trends and developments. Here’s a brief report on some of the top cryptocurrency market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. BTC & Top Crypto Mainly Consolidate Notably, BTC price chart has shown a period of sideways trading despite the broader market eagerly anticipating gains following Trump’s inauguration. Bitcoin price closed the week near the $105K level, up marginally by 0.1% in the past seven days. The flagship crypto’s current price trajectory comes despite bullish news for the asset surfacing across the industry. With the recent rescinding of SAB 121 , market participants have been highly positive on Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Further, Semler Scientific announced that it would raise $85 million in convertible notes to invest in BTC this week. This mover has sparked investor interest, paving a bullish road for the flagship coin in the light of heightened buying. Meanwhile, investment management company BlackRock sought U.S. SEC approval for its new redemption model for the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Overall, these events have emerged as highly optimistic news for the broader BTC market. Nevertheless, the asset continues to consolidate, raising investor speculation and uncertainty. CoinGape reported that China likely dumped a whopping 194K BTC recently, which falls in line with the current consolidation despite broader bullish developments. ETH & XRP Market Uncertain On the other hand, top crypto such as Ethereum (ETH) and XRP have also shown similar price actions. Notably, ETH closes the week at the $3,300 level, up by 0.5% over the week. Further, XRP also illustrated a sideways trading session, although the coin holds above $3. Ethereum’s consolidation raises severe uncertainty as ETH OI conversely rose to high levels recently, signaling a price breakout awaits the asset. Simultaneously, despite new XRP ETF filings reported this week, even the Ripple-backed asset consolidates, raising investor speculations. Meme Crypto SHIB & VINE Spark Buzz Meanwhile, the meme coins SHIB and VINE have stolen the spotlight, with the dog-themed crypto witnessing ecosystem developments and VINE seeing major listings amid heightened market interest. Notably, the Shiba Inu coin’s community introduced the revolutionary ShibOS (Shib Operating System) this week, offering users various use cases for a seamless Web2 to Web3 transition. On the other hand, with speculations of Vine social media app’s revival soaring, the Vine meme coin has gained substantial traction. Intriguingly, the token enjoys a bullish trend, securing major listings, witnessing an OI surge, and aiding traders in making massive profits. As a result, CoinGape reported that the Vine meme coin price could hit $1 shortly ahead. Overall, the abovementioned news emerged as some of the most buzzworthy topics reported by CoinGape over the past week.

Navigating the Meme Coin Mania Amid Market Uncertainties",https://nulltx.com/bonk-bonk-boom-or-bust-navigating-the-meme-coin-mania-amid-market-uncertainties/,"The crypto market consistently manages to astonish, and the recent fervor surrounding meme coins has infused yet another layer of interest. As of the most recent information available, the price of meme coins like Bonk has experienced a 24-hour change of -1.37%, with a market cap of $2.24 billion and a trading volume of $0.14 billion, placing it at #65 in the market [Source: coinmarketcap.com ]. Market Overview In recent weeks, the meme coin market has taken Bonk for a rollercoaster ride. Right now, though, the meme coin for dogs is worth nothing—literally $0, which is a change of -1.37% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the past week, trading has been just as equally wild, with the last 30 days highlighting Bonk’s performance unpredictability. If we can glean any insights from the last few months, it’s that coin flipping is a better way to determine price movement than any kind of technical analysis. Given its position at number 65, Bonk doesn’t really have a place in the market; it’s just kind of floating around out there in space. No key support levels have been established yet. When you look at a chart of Bonk, the resistances and supports are the first thing that pops out, considering how close resistance is to current price levels and how significant support is to investors who were lucky enough to snag Bonk at 4.8 cents or below. Recent News & Developments Investors and analysts have been paying close attention to a few key happenings. The filing for a $BONK ETF, now alongside the $DOGE and $TRUMP ETFs, suggests another potential access point for institutional investors to meme coins [ Source: coindesk.com ]. This development could provide a much-needed structure for investing in the meme coin space and thus could impact the market in a substantial way. The meme coin race is not going away. Indeed, we now have the first meme coin from Pi Network, PIDOG, which adds to the sheer absurdity of it all [ Source: minepi.com ]. Inside Bitcoins pointed out the potential of meme coins like $TRUMP, $DOGE, $BONK, and $WEPE ahead of ETF approvals, asserting that ‘Trump’s crypto-friendly stance signals big changes ahead.’ [ Source: insidebitcoins.com ] This political endorsement could instill a shot of investor confidence in these somewhat silly ‘meme’ coins, bringing them to heights we can’t even fathom, which is kind of the point. Technical Analysis Bonk and other meme coins have technical charts that show a mix of bullish and bearish patterns. The recent price movement has generated a symmetrical triangle, which could go either way depending on what the market thinks. If we look at the key indicators (such as the Relative Strength Index or the Moving Average Convergence Divergence), they are not offering much help since they seem to be in wait-and-see mode, neither catechizing bulls to charge forth nor calling bears to maul [ Source: tradingview.com ]. Analyzing volume shows trading activity that is balanced but not abundant. This is evident in the spikes related to major news events. The recent price levels that need to be watched are the recent highs and lows, which will function as the resistance and support that all prices must traverse. The trading activity itself has been a kind of short-term speculative hustle, without yet any long-term trend to speak of. Social & On-Chain Analysis Metrics assessing social sentiment indicate a bifurcated community. On the one hand, some users exude an almost naive optimism, seeing so much potential in the current market that they believe Bitcoin (BTC) is on an express train to $150,000 and that Dogecoin (DOGE) is poised to reach $1 [ Source: santiment.net ]. Yet, there are also many market participants expressing the exact opposite kind of sentiment. They see the current meme coin market and its broader crypto context as ‘doomer’ prone and in a dangerous vulnerable state. Indeed, the meme coin market is such an exciting flashpoint that institutional access to this segment of the crypto market has become a topic of conversation, especially in light of the $BONK ETF filing [ Source: coindesk.com ]. The actions of whales are well known, and any large transactions could potentially be influencing price action. Those most likely to spend a lot of money on meme coins are now doing so, which might be driving the uptick in network activity. And what about developer activity? It’s not quite what we see in other sectors, but there is some level of innovation really taking place in the meme coin space. Market Context & Future Outlook The correlation between the meme coin market and the broader cryptocurrency market is clear. Investors in meme coins look first to Bitcoin and Ethereum for guidance. These two coins are the performance leaders for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Notably, regulatory developments could soon provide a much clearer framework for the entire crypto market, including meme coins, which could serve to either legitimize or delegitimize this market sector. Projected prices are all over the place, with some analysts forecasting this year’s total meme coin market cap at between $300 billion to $500 billion [ Source: santiment.net ]. The meme coin market’s wild price swings make anything close to a sure bet very, very risky. Investors should stick to what is likely sensible and invest in meme coins with cash that can stand the loss of going to zero. In summation , the meme coin mania as seen with Bonk, remains quite en vogue within the crypto community. Although the market has not been favorable, recent developments infused with a healthy dose of social sentiment indicate a crypto space that is simultaneously chock-full of optimism yet also displaying caution. On a technical basis, the market is in a neutral formation and is best watched for the potential breakout or breakdown that is sure to happen soon. Verdict: future potentially bright—but investors must watch for the market’s next move, given its current unpredictability. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Trump Buys XRP (TRUMPXRP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPXRP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Buys XRP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys XRP could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys XRP launched with over $32,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys XRP on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys XRP by entering its contract address (CA) – HjQUfYDa2vgcG3AYb8z5Sernxm1ttRfhjL4N7A65BY7x – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPXRP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 05:42:00

These models are fifty times more efficient than even top U.S. offerings. The announcement has thrown American tech giants like OpenAI, Google, and Meta into a full-blown crisis, as their closed-door strategies suddenly stop cutting it. Now everyone on X is mocking them. For those confused why the US state and Silicon Valley are having a meltdown on twitter today. China released multiple AI models that are 50x more efficient than the best American AI models and made them open source, ruining the AI market — ashok kumar 🇵🇸 (@broseph_stalin) January 25, 2025 The man behind this shockwave is Liang Wenfeng, a hedge fund manager who turned a side project into one of the most disruptive AI advancements in history. DeepSeek’s R1 model is a self-learning system that can improve on its own without human oversight. And here’s what’s making Silicon Valley sweat: Liang is leveling the playing field for anyone—whether in China or anywhere else—looking to jump into AI development. Liang Wenfeng’s long game In 2021, while everyone else in China’s AI scene was focused on big tech, Liang quietly bought thousands of Nvidia graphic processing units (GPUs) and started experimenting with AI. People in the industry thought he was just another billionaire chasing a hobby. According to a business partner who reportedly spoke to the Financial Times, “When he told us he wanted to build a 10,000-chip cluster, we thought he was crazy. He didn’t even explain why, just said, ‘This will change everything.’” Fast forward to 2023, and Liang launched DeepSeek, hiring top AI engineers straight from his hedge fund. Using profits from the hedge fund High-Flyer, he built a team that not only understood AI but also mastered the infrastructure behind it. By 2024, DeepSeek had developed R1, a language model that industry insiders describe as a direct challenge to every major AI player in the U.S. Unlike its American competitors, DeepSeek wasn’t interested in commercialization. It focused entirely on research, with Liang using his own money to fund the operation. “DeepSeek’s offices feel like a university lab,” said the Financial Times. Based in Beijing and Hangzhou, the lab employs some of the best AI minds in China, offering salaries that rival TikTok-owner ByteDance. Liang’s singular goal, according to the report, was to prove that China could innovate on the same level as the U.S., and now he has done it. The timing couldn’t have been more deliberate either. Liang’s release of the R1 model coincided with his appearance at a high-profile meeting in Beijing led by Li Qiang, China’s second most powerful politician. Liang was the only AI leader invited. Li told the entrepreneurs present to focus on breaking through key technologies — a clear nod to China’s ambition to outpace the U.S. in AI development. Something tells us US president Donald Trump is not too happy about that. Silicon Valley’s scramble to catch up American tech giants, caught off guard, are now scrambling to respond. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a $100 billion joint venture with Japan’s SoftBank, dubbed Stargate, aimed at building new AI infrastructure in the U.S. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s xAI is expanding its Colossus supercomputer, planning to deploy over one million GPUs to train its Grok AI models. Google, Meta, and Anthropic are also throwing billions into upgrading their computing clusters with Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips. But the U.S. companies have one major disadvantage: secrecy. For years, Silicon Valley has operated on a closed-door model, keeping AI breakthroughs locked behind proprietary systems. DeepSeek’s decision to make R1 open source has flipped that narrative. This has triggered a wave of panic in the U.S., where companies now face pressure to decide whether to follow DeepSeek’s lead. But there are also concerns about whether DeepSeek can maintain its momentum. Despite its success, the company’s resources are admittedly limited compared to U.S. giants. “They’ve built one of the largest computing clusters in China,” said a source familiar with the company. “But compared to what OpenAI and Google are building, it’s not enough. They’ll need to scale up if they want to keep up.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",AI|DeepSeek|OpenAI,EN,0,0,ASIA|ZRX|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-26 05:52:50

Ripple CEO Weighs In,https://timestabloid.com/will-xrp-be-in-the-u-s-crypto-reserve-ripple-ceo-weighs-in/,"Discussions surrounding the inclusion of XRP in a potential U.S. strategic digital asset reserve have gained momentum following an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump. This order, introduced just days into his presidency, seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation while exploring the concept of a national digital asset stockpile . Executive Order Sparks Debate The executive order directs the formation of a Presidential Working Group dedicated to assessing the future of digital assets within the United States. According to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the group’s focus extends beyond regulatory clarity to include the potential establishment of a strategic digital asset reserve. Initial speculation suggested that such a reserve would primarily feature Bitcoin. However, recent discussions have expanded the scope to consider other assets, including XRP. Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets Podcast, also hinted at this development. Reports indicate that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was among the crypto executives who recently met with President Trump. This interaction has further fueled speculation about XRP’s potential role in the proposed reserve. Criticism from Bitcoin Maximalists The idea of diversifying the reserve has not been universally accepted. Pierre Rochard, Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, opposed XRP’s inclusion. He claimed Ripple and XRP pose the biggest threat to a Bitcoin-based reserve, accusing Ripple of lobbying to block a Bitcoin-exclusive reserve while advancing its CBDC initiatives. Rochard argued the administration initially aimed to make Bitcoin the foundation of a national reserve, but Ripple’s lobbying undermines this goal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Stance on Digital Asset Diversification Replying to Rochard, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse dismissed claims that the company lobbying is at odds with the administration’s goals. Instead, Ripple’s engagement with policymakers is to foster innovation and support American companies. Unless you are choosing to ignore the core tenants of the POTUS campaign (which aggressively supports American companies and technologies), our efforts are actually INCREASING the likelihood of a crypto strategic reserve (which includes bitcoin) happening. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 23, 2025 One community member shared a video where Garlinghouse suggested that a digital asset reserve should not be limited to Bitcoin but adopt a diversified approach. Other Experts Weigh In Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRP Ledger, also weighed in, stating that Rochard and people like him are the true obstacles to the crypto reserve, as they fail to see the benefits of the broader crypto industry for society. A report from the New York Post supported this perspective, suggesting that the administration might prioritize American-developed assets such as XRP, Solana, and USDC in its plans. Meanwhile, criticisms from the Bitcoin community continue to emerge, with some alleging that Ripple’s financial contributions to political initiatives have influenced policy decisions. However, this view was recently debunked by a former Ripple employee, who explained the reasons for Ripple’s financial involvement in politics.

With trends like Arctic Pablo’s mystical adventures and innovative projects like Notcoin and Dogs, the crypto space is buzzing with excitement. Arctic Pablo’s presale, in particular, is already making waves, boasting an impressive ROI and a narrative-driven investment approach that has captured the hearts of Gen Z and Millennials alike. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the top crypto that’s redefining the meme coin space. From Arctic Pablo’s mythological journey to Notcoin’s tech-driven tokenomics and Dogs’ community-first approach, we’ll uncover why these projects deserve your attention. Let’s explore how Arctic Pablo, the star of the current presale, brings adventure and ROI together like never before. Arctic Pablo: The Mystical Explorer Redefining the Top Crypto Presale In the frozen expanse of the Arctic, Arctic Pablo isn’t just any adventurer; he’s a legend in the making. Guided by a mythical map, Pablo embarks on a journey across hidden locations, uncovering treasures that promise wealth and wonder. The $APC coin isn’t just a currency—it’s a ticket to join this epic adventure. What makes Arctic Pablo unique is its location-based presale model. Instead of traditional stages, the presale moves with Pablo as he ventures to new realms. Currently, Arctic Pablo is in the El Dorado location, where $APC is priced at just $0.000038. With a final presale price of $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008, early investors stand to gain an ROI of 20,000% by the time the token lists. The presale has already raised over $440,000 in just 15 days. This pace, coupled with the weekly token burns, ensures that $APC remains a hot commodity. Investors who act now can secure their share before Pablo’s next stop, the Glacier Grove. With no fixed timeline for each location, Pablo’s journey is unpredictable, adding an element of excitement to the presale. Combine this with a 66% APY staking program, and the rewards are undeniable. Staking allows investors to grow their holdings while becoming active participants in Arctic Pablo’s journey, fostering community engagement and long-term value. Arctic Pablo isn’t just a coin; it’s an experience. Its deflationary model, driven by weekly burns, ensures scarcity and value growth. The ecosystem is built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering low fees and high scalability. The presale’s unique storytelling, combined with its ROI potential, makes Arctic Pablo a standout in the top crypto presale landscape. Notcoin: The Tech-Powered Challenger While Arctic Pablo captivates with its narrative-driven approach, Notcoin takes a different route—it’s all about tech and utility. Positioned as the “anti-meme” coin, Notcoin appeals to those looking for a serious, tech-focused project in the crypto space. At its core, Notcoin aims to provide real-world solutions through blockchain technology. Unlike many meme coins, it emphasizes transparency and functionality. Built on Ethereum, Notcoin boasts an advanced smart contract system that facilitates secure, fast, and cost-effective transactions. Its primary goal is to simplify blockchain adoption for businesses and individuals, making it a go-to choice for those seeking practicality. Notcoin’s tokenomics further set it apart. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, its distribution ensures sustainability and fairness. Fifty percent of the supply is allocated to community rewards, fostering long-term engagement. The remaining tokens are divided between liquidity pools, development, and marketing, ensuring the project’s growth and stability. Dogs: The Community-Driven Meme Coin Rounding out this trio is Dogs, a meme coin that takes community engagement to the next level. Inspired by the internet’s love for dog memes, Dogs leverages this universal appeal to create a token that’s fun, relatable, and highly engaging. Dogs’ strength lies in its community-first approach. From the outset, the project has prioritized transparency and inclusivity. Its development team frequently interacts with the community, hosting AMAs and voting sessions to ensure that every voice is heard. This level of engagement fosters trust and loyalty, making Dogs a standout in the crowded meme coin market. The tokenomics of Dogs are designed to reward holders and encourage long-term commitment. With a total supply of 500 billion tokens, the project employs a deflationary model similar to Arctic Pablo’s. Weekly token burns reduce the circulating supply, increasing scarcity and boosting value. Additionally, Dogs offers a staking program with an impressive APY, allowing investors to grow their holdings while supporting the ecosystem. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo, Notcoin, and Dogs represent unique opportunities in the ever-expanding crypto market. While each project has its strengths, Arctic Pablo stands out as the top crypto presale. Its adventurous narrative, location-based presale model, and staggering ROI potential make it a must-watch for investors. If you’re ready to join the journey, there’s no better time than now. With Arctic Pablo’s current location offering $APC at $0.000038, the window to secure life-changing gains is closing fast. Don’t miss out on the chance to turn a modest investment into a fortune. Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and be part of an epic adventure that bridges myth and reality.

Remittix (RTX) , an under-the-radar altcoin , is now attracting a lot of attention. Early investors are already getting notable returns as they have seen over 80% ROIs in just three weeks. Is it the creative approach to cross-border payments, the modern technology, or something far more promising that is resulting in the quick growth? Read on to discover how Remittix is quickly rising to be a major rival in the crypto market, surpassing Ethereum and Cardano. Ethereum (ETH) Displays Resilience Amid Market Swings Over the past week, the Ethereum price has exhibited notable growth, climbing by more than 2% despite some very noticeable swings. The Ethereum price chart shows that the altcoin has been facing a struggle between buyers and sellers by consolidating between $3,540 and $3,120. Although the week closed on a good note, the last month showed a somewhat bearish trend as the Ethereum price dropped by less than 1% among notable volatility. After a resistance level of $3,700, the Ethereum price fell to the $3,000 support zone; nevertheless, it quickly recovered ground and exceeded $3,200. Ethereum (ETH) is among the top altcoins traders looking for good prospects in the crypto market. Moreover, Ethereum (ETH) still has a strong bullish mood among its community even though it is almost 32% below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,891. Driven by the altcoin’s strong foundations and technical strength, analysts remain confident about a probable retest of its ATH this year. Though the Momentum Oscillator displays warnings with sell signals , indicators like the MACD and Moving Averages are pointing to buy chances on the Ethereum price chart . Cardano (ADA) Prepares For a Notable Growth Though the Cardano price has slightly dropped over 3% this past week, the swings reveal a more complex picture. The Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has been between $1.18 to $0.95, exhibiting a period of volatility and possible buildup. The preceding month showed a more bullish trend despite this temporary fall as the Cardano price jumped over 10%, showing 8.52% price volatility and 18 green days out of 30. Cardano (ADA) is one of the promising altcoins to watch for traders and investors given its solid performance and the very positive attitude of the community. Looking forward, a convincing Cardano price prediction supports hope about its near-term direction. Analysts think the altcoin might revisit its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10 within this year, a possible milestone that has sparked ADA interest once more. Moreover, a 2025 Cardano price prediction points to the altcoin perhaps trading within a broad range between $0.99 and $5.10. Cardano (ADA) is still a promising asset with technical indicators showing the potential for long-term growth.

XRP is approaching the end of a triangle pattern, which typically indicates that a decision point is near. The market must now decide which direction to take as XRP is currently stuck in the range of $3.08-$3.14. The price is also down by more than 2 percent on the weekly chart. Elliott Wave Analysis for XRP Using Elliott Wave analysis, a popular sentiment-based method for predicting market movements, analysts anticipate higher prices for XRP in the near future . However, this does not guarantee that the breakout will be upwards right away. There could be a small dip before a rise, but as long as any pullbacks are corrective in nature (slow, overlapping movements), the longer-term trend remains bullish. These corrections are expected to hold above key support levels, particularly the $2.52 level. Key Support and Resistance Levels The triangle pattern on XRP’s chart completed on January 13th, marking the end of the current consolidation phase. From an Elliot Wave perspective, this could signal the beginning of a larger five-wave move to the upside. The critical support level to watch is $2.52; a break below this could signal a shift in the market’s direction, introducing more uncertainty. A decisive break below this support would suggest a potential deeper correction. On the upside, if XRP successfully breaks through resistance, the next target levels to watch are around $4.20 and eventually the $5 mark. These Fibonacci extension levels will give us an indication of the price movement in the coming weeks. With the triangle formation nearing completion, a breakout is expected soon, but it might take some time to materialize. Volume tends to be lower on weekends, so it’s possible the price could dance around key support levels until more decisive moves occur early next week.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-26 06:19:16

Kamala Sucks (KAMASUCK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because KAMASUCK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Kamala Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Kamala Sucks could become the next viral memecoin. Kamala Sucks launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Kamala Sucks on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kamala Sucks by entering its contract address (CA) – KFywQqjGH3WdEQ4hR42oYQ17v4nSePom6AjyJc8TNfU – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like KAMASUCK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 06:24:00

This follows a consistent bullish trend and the anticipation of unlocking 2% of its total supply in February. But while SUI impresses, another contender, Nebula Stride (NST), is emerging as a game-changer poised to revolutionize how we think about crypto and real-world assets. SUI’s Recent Price Performance and Developments SUI is at the forefront with the introduction of Mystceti V2 consensus and Remora scaling, innovations set to revolutionize blockchain efficiency by 2025. These developments aim to process up to 120,000 transactions per second, positioning SUI as a direct competitor to Solana. Additionally, privacy enhancements through zero-knowledge proofs are on the horizon, promising a more secure user experience. The market has responded positively, with SUI hitting a new all-time high in stablecoins, up 25.78% within the last 30 days. SUI’s upward trajectory is hard to ignore. Source: @x0mario Additionally, from $0.90 in August 2024 to an all-time high of $5.35 on Jan 06, 2025, the token has grown exponentially. SUI has also achieved a significant milestone with 50 million accounts, solidifying its position as a leading Layer-1 blockchain. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in Sui’s ecosystem soared to $1.75 billion by December 2024, showcasing increased investor confidence and activity. Despite retracing slightly to the current value of $4.17, recent charts show SUI printing a Hidden Bullish Divergence on the RSI, suggesting potential for continued upward movement. Analysts on X have noted SUI’s price movement mirroring Bitcoin’s during the 2017 bull market, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, while SUI celebrates its achievements, another cryptocurrency, Nebula Stride (NST), is poised to potentially eclipse these gains with its unique proposition: Nebula Stride (NST): Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and Real-World Assets Nebula Stride (NST) is transforming the blockchain landscape by allowing fractional ownership of tangible assets like real estate, art, and commodities. This opens up a market previously inaccessible to the average investor, potentially fueling massive adoption and price surges for NST. Emerging as one of the top RWA tokens and early-stage cryptocurrencies , NST is priced at a mere $0.02, offering a low entry barrier with significant upside potential as the tokenization of real-world assets gains traction. The platform’s focus on user-friendly infrastructure and tangible asset investment could lead to high returns for early investors. NST supports both institutional and individual investors through a robust ecosystem that includes asset management tools, educational platforms, and microloans. This inclusivity broadens its appeal, aiming to create one of the pioneers in the RWA sector. Nebula Stride (NST) Tokenomics Why NST Could Outshine SUI While SUI excels in blockchain performance, NST’s focus on RWAs gives it a unique edge. Here’s why: Broader appeal : NST’s integration with real-world assets attracts a diverse audience, including traditional investors seeking exposure to tokenized assets. Mass adoption potential: By simplifying access to high-value investments, NST can drive widespread adoption beyond the crypto community. Market disruption: Tokenizing RWAs could disrupt traditional investment sectors, unlocking new opportunities for both individual and institutional investors. Tangible utility: Unlike SUI, which primarily enhances blockchain efficiency, NST offers a direct connection to the physical economy, fostering stability and long-term growth, as one of the best new cryptocurrencies to invest in . Final Thoughts: The Road Ahead for SUI and Nebula Strides SUI’s developments in technology and expanding ecosystem, position it as a strong contender in the blockchain arena. Nevertheless, Nebula Stride’s pioneering approach of tokenizing real-world assets makes it a significant competitor for future leadership. Thanks to its affordable entry cost, adaptable infrastructure, and practical uses, NST is set to not only support but possibly surpass SUI in the cryptocurrency arena. As the industry evolves, both SUI and NST demonstrate the immense potential of blockchain technology. While SUI sets new standards for performance and scalability, NST’s focus on bridging digital and physical assets could redefine the crypto space. Investors should keep a close eye on both projects as they navigate the exciting and rapidly changing world of blockchain innovation.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/software-engineer-to-xrp-holders-things-about-to-happen-heres-why/,"The XRP community recently took note of an unusual market trend highlighted by Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode), a crypto expert active on X. Van Code shared an image of the XRP/USDT order book, emphasizing the minimal sell-side activity. He described this situation as “calm before the storm” and expressed confidence in significant developments for XRP holders. In all my years follow #XRP I have never seen an order book with so little sellers. I see this as calm before the storm. Things about to happen in my opinion. Exiting times my fellow HODLERS pic.twitter.com/gy0Ypr7jnh — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) January 23, 2025 Observations on the Order Book The shared order book reveals a striking imbalance between buy and sell orders, with 57.92% representing bids and only 42.08% attributed to asks. Notably, the sell orders are concentrated at higher price points, such as $3.2, $3.3, and $3.4. This scarcity of active sellers is unusual within the XRP market, which typically experiences greater activity on both sides. The absence of substantial sell pressure suggests that current holders are optimistic and potentially expecting higher prices soon. The bid side, however, appears robust, with significant buy interest at key levels like $3.1 and $3.0. This demand indicates market participants are eager to accumulate XRP, possibly reinforcing the sentiment that the asset may soon experience volatility or a directional breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Dynamics and Community Reactions Van Code’s observation quickly drew engagement from the XRP community. XRP currently shows many bullish signals, as another well-known analyst recently described a “ calm before the storm ” through technical analysis patterns. However, one commenter cautioned that exchanges could exploit the situation if traders rely heavily on leveraged positions. “If too many traders are long and using leverage, exchanges may capitalize on the volatility,” he wrote, alluding to the potential for sudden market reversals. In response, Van Code highlighted the profit model of exchanges, stating, “Exchanges don’t make money on price action.” He noted that exchanges make money based on the transaction volume. His remarks emphasized the role of market activity, rather than direction, in generating revenue for both exchanges and asset managers. He advised participants to focus on accumulating and holding chosen cryptocurrencies rather than reacting to market speculation. The reduced sell-side activity, as evidenced in the order book, could indicate broader market confidence in XRP. It may also reflect a wait-and-see approach among sellers, who are potentially anticipating more favorable conditions before exiting their positions. XRP is currently trading at $3.1. This trend aligns with heightened optimism from analysts and the broader community surrounding XRP’s long-term prospects.

President Donald Tru mp. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Inde x took a heavy hit, dropping 1.7% since last Friday. This is its sharpest weekly fall since July 2023, when the Federal Reserve ended a prolonged period of monetary tightening. While the president has consistently threatened major trade partners like Canada and Mexico, actual executive orders to enforce tariffs remain nonexistent. Instead, Trump has instructed the Treasury and Commerce departments to assess trade relations and provide a report by April 1. Investors brace for a dollar sell-off Currency traders are now starting to act on what they’ve been predicting for months: the dollar is overvalued and set for a correction. Matthew Hornbach, Morgan Stanley’s head of macro strategy, said investors were cautious about selling the dollar so early in Trump’s term, unsure whether he would push through tariffs immediately. Now that Trump has held back on action, traders feel freer to move. “The further we get into President Trump’s second term, the more comfortable investors are becoming with expressing their views. The dollar is rich, interest rates are high, and both are ripe for a correction,” Hornbach said. The correction has already benefited other major currencies. The British pound surged more than 2.5% against the dollar this week, buoyed by strong manufacturing and services data out of the UK. The euro also had a strong showing, recording its best weekly performance since 2023. Much of Trump’s trade rhetoric has focused on North American trading partners like Canada and Mexico, leaving the eurozone out of his direct crosshairs — for now. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley strategists warn that the tide against the dollar is building. The bank has one of the most bearish outlooks on the greenback among those surveyed by Bloomberg. “While dollar bulls are loud and active, there’s a quieter but substantial group of investors ready to bet against the currency,” they said. The data backs up this sentiment. Futures data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) shows traders holding $34.6 billion worth of bullish dollar positions, the highest since 2019. But with the dollar gauge up just 3% since Trump’s November victory, there are risks of a major reversal. But the dollar has gained over 2% in the past quarter against currencies like the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, and Chinese yuan. However, many traders have opted to focus more on Trump’s actions—or lack thereof—rather than his words.

AI Predicts Steep Rally for EcoChain Crypto Price in 2025,https://timestabloid.com/from-0-006-to-5-ai-predicts-steep-rally-for-ecochain-crypto/,"EcoChain ($ECO) has emerged as one of the most promising crypto platforms due to its focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and sustainability. Experts and AI-driven projections anticipate the $ECO token value rising dramatically from its presale price of $0.01 to $5 by 2025. EcoChain Presale Success Raises $1.8 Million The EcoChain presale has already made waves, raising $1.8 million within its early stages. The $ECO presale price increases by 2% daily, allowing investors to earn up to 500% before the public listing. This innovative approach has attracted widespread attention from the crypto community, positioning EcoChain as a leader in combining blockchain technology with environmental impact. The platform enables tokenization of tangible assets such as real estate, commodities, and renewable energy projects, offering fractional ownership opportunities to investors. EcoChain’s mission to merge financial growth with ecological responsibility has drawn interest from retail and institutional investors alike, making it a standout in the competitive RWA space. AI Projections: $5 Price Target by 2025 Artificial intelligence analysis predicts a meteoric rise in $ECO’s value, with the token potentially reaching $5 by 2025. This anticipated growth aligns with the exponential expansion of the RWA sector, as tokenization of real-world assets gains momentum. EcoChain’s focus on sustainability and tokenization positions it as a trailblazer, capturing both first-mover advantages and long-term growth potential. Post-presale, $ECO is expected to be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, boosting liquidity and attracting global investors. The platform has also seen increased whale activity, with on-chain data showing significant investments—a clear indicator of confidence in EcoChain’s long-term vision. Engaging Community and Transparent Tokenomics EcoChain has cultivated a passionate community driven by its sustainability mission and transparent tokenomics. The platform’s $ECO token supply of 8.1 billion is allocated to ensure accessibility and long-term growth. EcoChain is transforming the crypto landscape by combining sustainability with the tokenization of real-world assets. With a successful presale, innovative features, and AI-driven growth projections, $ECO is poised to become a top-performing token by 2025. As the RWA market grows and investors seek platforms that combine financial rewards with ecological impact, EcoChain is leading the charge toward a greener, wealthier future.

If You’re Looking for Top Cryptos for Significant Returns, Qubetics Could Your Answer!",https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-bitcoin-boom-if-youre-looking-for-top-cryptos-for-significant-returns-qubetics-could-your-answer/,"Let’s be real for a second: if you’re just diving into the world of cryptocurrency now, you might feel like you’ve missed out on Bitcoin. For years, Bitcoin has been the heavyweight champion of the crypto world, with early adopters raking in massive returns. Remember when Bitcoin was trading for under $1,000? Those were the days when if you’d just put a couple hundred bucks in, you’d be sitting on a small fortune today. But now, Bitcoin’s price is hovering in the $30,000 range, and while it’s still a solid investment, the chances of seeing those jaw-dropping, multi-thousand percent returns are looking pretty slim. So, what’s a crypto enthusiast to do now? Is the ship sailed on making big crypto gains? Absolutely not. There’s a fresh new project that could be your ticket to the next big wave in the crypto space: Qubetics . Qubetics ($TICS) is positioning itself as one of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns , and it’s offering something that Bitcoin, despite all its glory, doesn’t: real-world utility. While Bitcoin helped introduce the world to the power of blockchain, Qubetics is taking it to the next level by enabling the tokenization of real-world assets. This means that everything from real estate to luxury goods can be represented as digital tokens on the blockchain—creating an entirely new marketplace for these assets. So, if you’re looking for that next big opportunity to take advantage of crypto’s potential, keep reading. Qubetics is offering something new, and the timing couldn’t be better. Bitcoin: The OG Crypto – But Has Its Time Passed? Ah, Bitcoin. The pioneer of the entire crypto movement. If you were one of the lucky ones who bought Bitcoin early, you’re probably sitting pretty by now. It’s often referred to as “digital gold,” and for good reason. Bitcoin’s rise from a few bucks to over $68,000 at its peak in 2021 cemented its status as a revolutionary asset. The problem? If you’re trying to get in now, the insane gains of yesteryear are pretty much out of reach. Sure, Bitcoin’s a solid bet for long-term investment, and it’s a great way to hedge against inflation or economic instability, but the wild, exponential growth we saw early on is harder to come by in 2025. Analysts expect Bitcoin’s price to continue rising, with some predicting it could hit $70,000 or more by the end of 2025, depending on how the market plays out. But let’s be honest here—if you’re looking to make quick, life-changing returns, Bitcoin’s no longer the low-risk, high-reward play it once was. It’s established. It’s stable. And in the world of crypto, that can be a bit of a double-edged sword. While Bitcoin will always have its place as the “king of crypto,” the high-flying days of sky-high percentage gains seem to be behind it. So, what does that mean for you as an investor? Don’t give up on crypto just yet. The next big opportunity might already be here, and its name is Qubetics. Qubetics: Tokenizing Real-World Assets for the Win This is where Qubetics comes into play. While Bitcoin has been great for what it is—primarily a store of value—Qubetics is doing something entirely different. It’s setting out to revolutionize the way real-world assets are bought, sold, and traded, with a focus on asset tokenization. Simply put, Qubetics is turning tangible, real-world assets like real estate, fine art, collectibles, and even business shares into digital tokens that can be traded on the blockchain. Imagine you’re a real estate investor looking to diversify your portfolio. Traditionally, this would involve buying entire properties, dealing with banks, handling paperwork, and all the red tape that comes with it. With Qubetics , you can tokenize your property and sell fractionalized ownership on the blockchain. This means you could own a part of a luxury home or office building without having to shell out millions upfront. You could buy a fraction of a Picasso or share in a rare vintage car. It opens up new investment opportunities for people who traditionally couldn’t afford high-value assets, democratizing access to wealth-building opportunities. Qubetics doesn’t just make it easier to invest in real-world assets; it also makes the process more efficient and secure. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for middlemen and offers unparalleled transparency. Everything is traceable, secure, and fast—no more waiting weeks or months for paperwork or dealing with unreliable third parties. Whether you’re a small business owner looking to unlock capital by tokenizing your intellectual property or an individual looking to invest in a new asset class, Qubetics provides the tools to make it happen. So, why should you care? Well, the Qubetics presale has been a huge success. Over $435 million $TICS tokens have been sold so far to more than 15,700 holders, raising over $10.4 million. And it’s still going. In the 18th stage of its presale, $TICS is priced at just $0.0551 per token, but experts believe the price could skyrocket once the mainnet launches. Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Crypto Opportunity Here’s the thing: Bitcoin has done its job in terms of proving the concept of digital currency, but it’s not the next big opportunity if you’re looking for mind-blowing returns. Qubetics is where the real action is right now. Why? Because it’s addressing real-world problems that Bitcoin simply can’t solve. Tokenizing assets gives everyday investors the chance to own parts of high-value goods that were previously inaccessible. For example, let’s say you’re a fan of luxury watches, and you want to invest in a rare timepiece. In the traditional world, that could cost you tens of thousands of dollars. But with Qubetics , you could own a fraction of that luxury watch by buying a token, giving you exposure to the high-end watch market without needing to break the bank. The truth is, Qubetics is offering a whole new level of financial inclusion. If you’re tired of watching the rich get richer by investing in things like real estate, rare art, or exclusive collectibles, Qubetics gives you the opportunity to get in on the action. The ability to tokenize assets opens up countless investment avenues for people from all walks of life. And let’s not forget the presale—if you can get in now while $TICS is still at a low price, the potential return on investment could be massive. Conclusion: The Future is Here with Qubetics If you’ve been holding off on jumping into the crypto space because you missed Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, don’t sweat it. Bitcoin will always have its place, but the real opportunity now lies with projects like Qubetics that are setting the stage for the next wave of innovation. By tokenizing real-world assets, Qubetics is solving a problem that Bitcoin didn’t address—and offering massive upside potential for investors in the process. The presale for Qubetics is still ongoing, and with predictions of $TICS reaching $5, $10, or even $15 after the mainnet launch, now is the time to get in. If you want to be part of one of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns in 2025 , Qubetics is your best bet. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers—invest in the future of tokenized assets today.

Solana’s SOL: The High-Speed Crypto Powering Tomorrow’s Apps Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed and scalability. It offers a solid foundation for decentralized applications, or dapps, placing it alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. What sets Solana apart is its design focused on faster transactions and flexible development options. Developers can use multiple programming languages, making it more accessible. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL is essential for transactions, running special programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana’s unique technology. Unlike some platforms, Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or extra layers to handle more transactions. Instead, it uses its powerful network to scale naturally. This makes it attractive to developers and investors who need a platform that can handle high activity. In the current market, where speed and capacity matter, SOL stands out. It offers an alternative to coins like Ethereum, which can be slower due to heavy use. With more projects looking for fast and scalable solutions, SOL could become more valuable and see significant growth. Trump’s Meme Coin Surges to $15 Billion: A New Chapter in Crypto? Donald Trump’s latest venture into cryptocurrency has taken the market by storm with the launch of his new meme coin, $TRUMP. Released on Friday, the coin’s market capitalization soared to $9 billion, peaking at over $15 billion early Sunday. Hosted on the Solana blockchain, $TRUMP saw its price jump by more than 300% within a day. At its peak, the coin briefly surpassed $75, marking a significant moment as Trump prepares for his upcoming inauguration. The rapid rise of $TRUMP reflects the growing interest in meme coins and their potential in today’s market. With an initial supply of 200 million coins, developers plan to expand the total supply to 1 billion over the next three years. This strategy mirrors the approaches of other successful cryptocurrencies. While the coin is affiliated with the Trump Organization, its website notes that $TRUMP is “not intended to be” an investment opportunity or a security, and it distances itself from political ties. In a market where meme coins like Dogecoin have captured the imagination of investors, $TRUMP could ride the wave of popularity. Its association with a well-known figure might make it attractive, but as always, potential buyers should be cautious and stay informed. MELANIA Coin Soars 53%: A New Crypto Sensation Emerges MELANIA Coin burst onto the crypto scene with a 53% surge just hours after launch. Starting at $11.36, it quickly reached a market cap over $1.6 billion, entering the top 100 cryptocurrencies. With a total supply of 1 billion coins, MELANIA emphasizes that it has no ties to politics or governments. The coin’s distribution involves the team (35%), community (20%), reserves (20%), public sales (15%), and liquidity (10%). Committed to transparency, the project has a 13-month full vesting period. Investors are seeing huge returns. According to Lookonchain, one investor used two wallets and earned $47.5 million from MELANIA Coin. The first wallet spent 2,100 SOL ($560,000) to buy 1.52 million MELANIA, then sold them for 46,453 SOL ($11.5 million), making an $11 million profit. The second wallet bought 3.84 million MELANIA with 800,000 USDC, sold half for 16.45 million USDC, and kept the rest worth over $20 million, totaling a profit of $36.5 million. In a market eager for new opportunities, MELANIA Coin’s rapid rise and focus on transparency might attract investors looking for the next big thing. Conclusion While SOL, TRUMP, and MELANIA coins show promise, XYZVerse stands out as the pioneering sports memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth in the current bull run.

Binance Coin, Ripple Or Remittix?",https://timestabloid.com/which-of-these-crypto-assets-will-make-you-rich-in-2025-and-why/,"Finding the top crypto investments 2025 is crucial for many traders, and three names often come up: Binance Coin, Ripple, and Remittix. Each token has die-hard fans and unique perks, but which is set for the biggest returns? Some say Binance Coin benefits from exchange backing, while others praise Ripple for streamlining global finance. Meanwhile, a rising contender called Remittix aims to beat them both by solving everyday money-transfer problems. Below, we see how they compare and why Remittix might be the top performer. Binance Coin: Exchange Powerhouse Launched by the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance Coin (BNB) has grown popular for trading discounts and DeFi access. Recently, Binance Coin completed its 30th quarterly burn, removing 1.6 million tokens from circulation. This scarcity could drive future value, though daily moves show it’s up +0.63% over 24 hours but down -5.06% for the week and -2.76% for the month. Some traders label Binance Coin a staple holding. Its ties to a high-traffic exchange keep volume steady, and many still consider it among the top crypto investments 2025. Yet new projects, like Remittix, offer unique features that might lure investors away if they promise faster gains. While BNB remains a household name, innovation in other tokens means it won’t be an uncontested king forever. Ripple: Banking Connections Praised for quick cross-border transactions, Ripple (XRP) boasts partnerships with major financial institutions. Over the last month, Ripple rose +39.77%, though it dipped -2.36% this week. Daily changes show a +4.25% uptick, hinting at ongoing market interest. Many supporters see it as a prime choice for DeFi growth, securing a spot among the top crypto investments by 2025. Yet tokens like Remittix could offer a strong alternative if they cater more effectively to everyday users. Ripple does well at targeting banks, but smaller businesses and freelancers might prefer simpler, cheaper solutions. If these groups flock to upstart projects, Ripple (XRP) might face stiffer competition. Still, it remains a heavyweight, thanks to strong brand recognition and a well-established network. Remittix: Poised To Outperform While Binance Coin and Ripple focus on large-scale adoption, Remittix zeroes in on affordable transfers for regular people and small businesses. Investors note that Remittix (RTX) could disrupt the sector by cutting remittance fees and wait times. This real-world utility might push Remittix above older coins tied to corporate deals. Many now rank it among the top crypto investments 2025 for its ease of use. Because Remittix offers fast, low-cost services, it’s quickly becoming a favorite. Observers say Remittix (RTX) could surpass even big names if mass adoption keeps rising. Unlike other tokens that depend on hype, Remittix fixes real user problems. This practical angle fuels hopes it will claim the spotlight soon, potentially outdoing both Binance Coin and Ripple in daily usage. Conclusion Whether you’re drawn to the exchange clout of Binance Coin (BNB) or the financial links of Ripple (XRP), it’s clear fresh projects like Remittix (RTX) can shake up the field. Each one promises major returns, but many investors see Remittix as a real standout. By slashing fees and simplifying cross-border transactions, it could deliver bigger gains than established tokens. For those seeking the top crypto investments 2025, Remittix may well be the one to watch. Ready to explore Remittix further?

Hitler Musk (HITMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HITMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Hitler Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Hitler Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Hitler Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Hitler Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Hitler Musk by entering its contract address (CA) – GB5uSMr95szepTSfj6sbJHFxMaBHwwyBzUY6dPAWZCCH – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HITMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 07:04:00

The cryptocurrency currently appears to be in a ranging phase, with no decisive movements above or below key resistance and support levels. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, “XRP is simply ranging, and it’s best to wait for the yellow 21 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) to align with the price” This indicates a period of market consolidation, where traders are waiting for more clarity before committing to major positions. #XRP – Daily Time Frame Analysis – Noise Time: #XRP is simply ranging, and it's best to wait for the yellow 21 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) to align with the price.

Invalidation… pic.twitter.com/kcBBC97roH — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 24, 2025 Critical Levels to Monitor EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis highlights several important price levels for XRP. The key resistance level lies at $3.40, with the analyst noting that a daily close above this price would serve as an “invalidation point,” shifting the overall market outlook toward a bullish trend. On the downside, the analyst identified potential support levels at $2.83 and $2.50, where a temporary price dip could occur before buyers step in. The analyst emphasizes that a wick down to $2.50 is “normal” during this market behavior, especially as XRP seeks equilibrium. Furthermore, the current price action suggests a close interaction with the 21-day EMA, a dynamic support and resistance indicator. Once this moving average aligns with the price, it could kickstart a price rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Where is XRP Going Next? The analysis reflects the uncertainty in the market as XRP attempts to stabilize following a period of volatility. Multiple analysts expect a massive breakout from the current market position, with one notable analyst recently setting an $8 target . XRP is currently trading at $3.1, and although it has fallen over 2.5% from yesterday, it is still up over 42% from last month. The digital asset recently rose to $3.39, a multi-year high reached on January 16. Another well-known analyst shared a detailed analysis that could send XRP to $4 . Reaching this target would decisively confirm the breakout above $3.4 that EGRAG CRYPTO outlined, and also breach its all-time high of $3.84. The importance of the $3.40 resistance level cannot be overstated, as surpassing it would likely bring renewed bullish momentum and attract increased investor interest. This breakout would confirm the asset’s momentum and pave the way for a further climb. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

However, it lacks the structured growth trajectory and clear utility that BTFD showcases, which could be a deciding factor for serious investors. The core appeal of Dogwifhat lies in its vibrant and active community. This coin thrives on social media engagement and grassroots marketing campaigns, which have helped it gain traction in a crowded market. Its followers are known for their enthusiasm and collective efforts in promoting WIF across various platforms, creating a sense of camaraderie and belonging among holders. Dogwifhat’s development team has also been key in fostering this strong community bond. They regularly engage with users, provide updates, and host events that encourage participation and investment. While Dogwifhat may not yet offer the extensive utility or high-profile partnerships seen in some other meme coins, its community-focused approach provides a solid foundation for potential growth and sustainability in the volatile crypto market. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogwifhat made it to this list for its community-driven approach and the sheer enthusiasm of its followers. Yet, when stacked against BTFD’s structured economic strategies and higher earning potential, it’s clear why discerning investors might lean towards BTFD for long-term gains. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends , it’s evident that BTFD Coin not only leads the pack with its innovative features and solid investment potential but also sets a new standard for what meme coins can achieve. As BTFD prepares for its listing, the window for getting in on this presale is closing fast. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity; don’t let this chance to be part of something revolutionary slip away.

Ripple (XRP), which has been accused of similar allegations, stands out. Following US President Donald Trump’s speeches implying that US-based cryptocurrencies are in an advantageous position, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, according to unproven claims, advocates the idea of a reserve in the US that includes many altcoins instead of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and opposes the idea of a reserve consisting of a single BTC. Related News: Big Whale Sells Big on This Altcoin, Making Huge Profits However, the White House recently announced the creation of a working group on this issue and used the term “Digital Asset Stock” instead of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. In an interesting development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino also released a statement on the subject. Ardoino claimed that the same companies that attacked Bitcoin (there is also an allusion to Ripple here) also attacked Tether. The Tether CEO said that the companies behind these attacks are becoming more apparent these days. He added that there are more companies than those accused so far. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, Mickle (@xrpmickle), a respected voice in the XRP community, addressed these claims with facts. His statements highlight key aspects of XRP that are frequently misunderstood or misrepresented. Bitcoin maxis love spreading FUD about XRP. Let’s debunk some lies with FACTS: • XRP is deflationary—no more can ever be created. • The XRP Ledger is decentralized. • Brad Garlinghouse didn’t create XRP. • XRP isn’t a company—Ripple is. • Ripple isn’t anti-Bitcoin (Brad… — mickle (@xrpmickle) January 25, 2025 XRP’s Deflationary Nature and Decentralization Contrary to claims that XRP can be manipulated through new token issuance, Mickle clarified that XRP is deflationary, meaning no additional tokens can ever be created. This provides certainty about the token supply, unlike inflationary cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) operates as a decentralized blockchain. It relies on independent validators worldwide to secure the network. This dispels the narrative that it is controlled by Ripple. Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has debunked these decentralization claims multiple times, calling the argument incredibly stupid . Clarifying Ripple’s Role Another common misconception is the difference between XRP and Ripple. However, as Mickle pointed out, “XRP isn’t a company—Ripple is.” Ripple’s efforts focus on leveraging XRP for practical use cases, particularly in cross-border payments. Furthermore, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse did not create XRP, which was launched by developers with deep roots in the Bitcoin community. Mickle also noted that Ripple is not anti-Bitcoin, with Garlinghouse himself holding Bitcoin, countering claims of hostility toward the leading cryptocurrency. XRP Use Cases and Adoption XRP’s use cases are another area where misinformation persists. Mickle emphasized that XRP has “significant use cases,” particularly in banking and payment systems. Financial institutions worldwide have adopted Ripple’s payment solutions. They often utilize XRP to improve transaction efficiency. This real-world utility demonstrates XRP’s value beyond speculative trading.

Critics argue that Ripple’s control over escrowed XRP makes the network centralized. However, Ripple has been reducing its control by releasing XRP from escrow based on a fixed schedule, contributing to decentralization over time. As another community member pointed out , Bitcoin faces increasing centralization concerns. He noted that “companies like MicroStrategy and BlackRock keep buying Bitcoin, making it more centralized.” Moreover, Bitcoin mining is now concentrated among a small group of entities with access to specialized hardware and resources. This shift contrasts with Bitcoin’s original vision of decentralization. Meanwhile, Ripple’s efforts to reduce its influence over XRP strengthen the case for its decentralized ecosystem. Satoshi’s Acknowledgment Mickle also reminded the community that XRP’s origins are intertwined with Bitcoin’s history. XRP was created by early Bitcoin developers who sought to improve its design. Mickle also reminded the community that Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, previously acknowledged Ripple. Mickle urged readers not to fall for echo chambers and instead explore the facts about XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

39518663,https://nulltx.com/?p=141066,1737878087,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Uniswap’s UNI Token Holds Steady Amidst Market Volatility and Mixed Sentiment,https://nulltx.com/uniswaps-uni-token-holds-steady-amidst-market-volatility-and-mixed-sentiment/,"Uniswap’s UNI token has remained remarkably steady over the past 24 hours, holding at a stable price of $12.17. This price reflects an almost zen moment of calm in what is otherwise a tumbling crypto market. In recent days, the broader crypto space has taken a beating. The BTC price dropped 4.08% in the past week, and ether (ETH) decreased by 7.47%. Yet, despite this clear downward trend in the overall crypto market, the Uniswap token continues to seemingly hold its own, with relatively little price movement over the past few days. The recent progress surrounding Uniswap has brought a mix of upbeat and worrisome tidings. Uniswap was in the spotlight when it went for a $35 million airdrop of its governance token, UNI , ahead of what should have been a low-key announcement about the protocol’s next (fourth) major version [Source: manilatimes.net ]. Uniswap had said that the new version would be launching on something called “X,” which turned out to be the not-so-undisclosed platform formerly known as Twitter, but also serves as a public billboard in the event of a major protocol overhaul. This moment of excitement for early participants and potential new users of Uniswap was then marred by an analysis that (presumably) Uniswap didn’t want to be associated with: AMBCrypto published a piece suggesting that bad price action meant that UNI was forming “bearish patterns” on the daily charts, and could suffer a 20% drop “in the near future” [Source: AMBCrypto.com ]. Market Analysis An in-depth analysis of UNI from a technical perspective reveals that the token’s price has been spinning within a narrow range and forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. This pattern usually indicates a disagreement between buyers and sellers, with the possible price breakout in either direction. Our analysis of trading volume suggests that trader indecision is at an all-time high for this token, as volume has been steadily declining since the end of May. Two key price levels to watch in the next few days: support at $11.50 and resistance at $13.00. A clear breakout (up or down) is needed before any new trades can be taken. Until then, the price is likely to continue this pattern of low volatility. Social and on-chain analysis further refine our understanding of UNI’s market dynamics. The social sentiment metrics suggest a community full of mixed emotions. It is certainly not a boring time for the Uniswap community, given the wild range of feelings members express about it. Some definitely express frustration about the platform’s listing policies, with a not insignificant number complaining to and about a variety of entities associated with the platform. Directly above their heads are Layer 2 projects (ZKSync, StarkWare, etc.), which users are incredibly excited about. Network activity has been at all-time highs, comprised mainly of direct user interactions with the Uniswap platform and Layer 2 project testnets. Meanwhile, the core development team has been grinding away during the intense bear market, pushing through an incredible number of protocol upgrades and just overall goodness. The price is rising, and there are a number of reasons that we feel compelled to get into those next. Market Outlook In the larger market context, UNI’s performance is closely linked to the overall sentiment in the DeFi sector. The next catalysts, like the V4 rollout and the official X announcement, could be what tips things over into a bullish breakout. However, there are clouds on the horizon—a couple of regulatory issues seem to be brewing, of a kind that seems to happen every couple of months. Could this be another opportunity to buy UNI at a lower price? Projections for future UNI price seem cautiously optimistic—more a sentiment of “We should be okay, as long as things stay like this.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to his recent analysis , XRP has successfully eliminated a seven-year resistance level, signaling a strong upward trajectory. Dark Defender believes this achievement has set the stage for further price expansion, with a mid-term target of $77.7. On 15 January, we discussed a fascinating Fibonacci Level. After 7 years of consolidation, XRP is now winking at $77.7, my mid-term target. (NFA) Four of a kind! pic.twitter.com/hu5VADeGam — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) January 24, 2025 XRP’s Path to $77.7 The attached chart emphasizes that XRP’s consolidation has built a solid foundation for its next potential rally. Fibonacci levels are central to this analysis, focusing on the 261.8% and 361.8% extensions, which indicate strong upward targets. In early January, XRP broke above the 50% Fibonacci retracement, a critical level at $2.8160. It has held above this level since the breakout, further solidifying its bullish outlook. Key Observations From the Chart XRP’s breakout from its prolonged resistance has shifted the market dynamics. This move suggests long-term holders and institutions could drive the asset’s price. XRP is also firmly positioned above the Ichimoku Cloud , indicating robust support and bullish sentiment. This level has historically acted as a key indicator of price direction. If XRP maintains its current trajectory, achieving the $77.7 target is feasible. However, this requires sustained buying pressure and a favorable macroeconomic environment.

These levels are a key indicator of where XRP could face resistance or aim for new highs. Notably, the 261.8% level aligns with $5.85, marking a significant point of interest in the short term. Beyond this, the 361.8% extension places another milestone at $18.22, showing the scope for a broader rally. Dark Defender has previously set these targets , adding credence to his new prediction. The standout target remains $77.7, a level that reflects a strong mid-term ambition. According to the analyst, this figure represents XRP’s next major move if the bullish momentum continues. XRP is currently trading at $3.13, and the $77.7 target would require a significant 2,382.43% increase for the digital asset. While such targets are speculative, the technical setup provides a basis for these projections. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Kamala Sucks (KAMASUCK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because KAMASUCK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Kamala Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Kamala Sucks could become the next viral memecoin. Kamala Sucks launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Kamala Sucks on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kamala Sucks by entering its contract address (CA) – KFywQqjGH3WdEQ4hR42oYQ17v4nSePom6AjyJc8TNfU – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like KAMASUCK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 07:57:34

Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume is extremely lively, sitting at $2.27 billion.

On the day of Trump’s inauguration, World Liberty Financial bought $47 million worth of ETH, $47 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ), $4.7 million worth of Aave ( AAVE ), $4.7 million worth of Chainlink ( LINK ), $4.7 million worth of Tron ( TRX ) and $4.7 million worth of Ethena ( ENA ). While accumulating crypto assets, President Trump has been working on legislation to accommodate the industry and reverse the hostile regulatory climate created by the previous presidential administration.

Known for his staunch support of Bitcoin, Mow has often opposed other cryptocurrencies, and his recent remarks on social media have rallied similar Bitcoin maximalists and intensified scrutiny of Ripple and the role XRP could play in a potential U.S. crypto reserve. Mow Challenges XRP’s Inclusion U.S. President Donald Trump recently ordered the evaluation of a national digital asset reserve . The debate within the cryptocurrency community now centers on whether the U.S. should diversify a potential digital asset reserve beyond Bitcoin. Mow strongly opposes this idea, asserting that Bitcoin alone holds value as a national crypto reserve. He argues that adding other cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, would effectively reward companies that created tokens without inherent value. He highlighted Ripple’s issuance of 100 billion XRP tokens as an example of this practice, stating that such actions are akin to generating wealth “out of thin air.” According to Mow, including XRP in a government-controlled reserve would misuse taxpayer funds, ultimately benefiting Ripple and its founders. Calls For Increased Criticism of Ripple and XRP Beyond the debate over crypto reserves, Mow expanded his critique of Ripple and XRP. Referring to a surge in posts criticizing the company and its cryptocurrency, Mow argued that existing negative opinions did not go far enough. In his recent post on X, he commented, “I see a lot of posts hating on or listing out reasons why you should hate Ripple/XRP, and I just want to add some perspective. You still don’t hate them enough, and there are still way more reasons why you should hate them.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Mow’s remarks underline his belief that XRP’s creation process and its association with Ripple contradict the principles of decentralization and scarcity that Bitcoin embodies. His outspoken criticism has positioned him as a key opponent of Ripple’s ambitions within the cryptocurrency space. However, not all his criticisms hold water. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has consistently debunked centralization claims . While many Bitcoin maximalists share Mow’s views, others remain open to exploring the potential of altcoins like XRP. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, recently weighed in on the debate, asserting that only Bitcoin is likely to be included in a U.S. digital asset reserve. However, unlike Mow, Hoskinson did not criticize Ripple or XRP but has worked with Ripple on RLUSD, showing that past personal problems should be put aside for the advancement of the crypto world.

According to the entrepreneur’s post on X, the idea is powerful and thoughtful, one that is in-line with the growing trends globally. The bill, known as House Bill 18 , was introduced by Steve Demetriou, a State Representative alongside six other co-sponsors backing it. The bill will mandate the state treasurer to invest about 10% of the state’s general fund, prizes trust fund, and budget stabilization fund into a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, which will include Bitcoin. According to Demetriou, the bill was necessary to hedge the state’s funds from the biting effects of inflation. Vivek Ramaswamy backs Ohio’s Bitcoin reserve bill Investing in cryptocurrencies via a strategic cryptocurrency reserve bill is one trend that has gotten attention over the last few months. The trend started with United States President Donald Trump leaning over and showing support for the crypto industry during his campaign. With Ohio now leaning towards that area, it is something that Ramaswamy is backing wholeheartedly. According to Ramaswamy, aside from the bill being thoughtful and powerful, it provides a way to hedge inflation risks provided by the government. He also hailed Steve Demetriou for proposing the bill. “A thoughtful & powerful bill here in Ohio. We need to think creatively about hedging against government-created inflation risks & keeping our state at the cutting edge of innovation, rather than playing from behind. Kudos to @steve4ohiohouse for thinking outside the box,” he said. A thoughtful & powerful bill here in Ohio. We need to think creatively about hedging against government-created inflation risks & keeping our state at the cutting edge of innovation, rather than playing from behind. Kudos to @steve4ohiohouse for thinking outside the box. https://t.co/gBg4IuqO8O — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) January 25, 2025 According to Demetriou on X, he proposed the bill because he wants to hedge against inflation while making sure Ohio is at the front when it comes to cutting-edge monetary and technological innovation. In a post by co-founder and CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, Dennis Porter, the new proposed strategic reserve bill uses ‘digital assets’, instead of explicitly mentioning Bitcoin. Porter noted that the approach will help Ohio maintain neutrality and avoid potential political friction in the future. Ohio’s strategic reserve bill features strict investment requirements Ohio’s strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill sets out very strict investment criteria for digital assets. One of the requirements is that the asset of choice should be an exchange-traded product with an average market capitalization of around $750 billion 12 months before the asset is picked. Bitcoin easily makes the cut, seeing that it presently has a market cap of about $2 trillion. However, the bill explicitly mentions that other digital assets could well be considered if they can achieve this feat. “The average market capitalization of the digital assets over the preceding twelve months is at least seven hundred fifty billion dollars, as determined by the treasurer of state using a commercially reasonable method,” the bill read. The bill also sets strict conditions for secure custody solutions, provided the state decides to hold the digital assets directly. If the opposite is the case, then the state can consider the services of banks, trust companies, or other regulated investment services in providing custody. If the bill is officially passed, it will be a major milestone in the state, allowing Ohio to use digital assets as potential investment vehicles for state funds and retirement systems. The bill is Ohio’s second attempt at a strategic Bitcoin Reserve, with the first bill, House Bill 703, submitted last month by Derek Martin, the House Republican leader. The bill is seeking to outrightly establish a Bitcoin Reserve for Ohio, with Porter noting that about 11 States are presently in the Bitcoin reserve race. The current bill came after United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a working group that will look into the development of a federal regulatory framework for digital assets, which will include stablecoins. The group is also tasked with looking into the establishment of a national digital asset reserve.

Community Debates,https://cryptopotato.com/should-ripples-xrp-be-part-of-the-us-digital-asset-reserve-community-debates/,"President Donald Trump splashed the crypto waters earlier this week when he signed an executive order focused on digital assets to be potentially included in the US reserves. Although it’s not officially approved yet, the decision has sparked substantial debates within the community on which cryptocurrencies should be included or whether it should just be bitcoin. The Debate Ever since Trump changed his tune on the crypto industry last year and made dozens of optimistic promises during his election campaign, the talk of the town has been whether he will stay true to his word and establish a US BTC reserve. The first portion of that plan would be for the US government to stop selling the seized BTC from illegal operations. However, Trump went further on Thursday by signing an executive order titled ‘Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technologies’ to explore the inclusion of various cryptocurrencies into the US reserve. This sent shockwaves throughout the community, especially those favoring many US-based projects and their underlying assets, such as SOL, XRP, and ADA. Many believe that companies like Ripple are actually working against BTC in this manner by ‘throwing around millions at politicians, desperately trying to derail it.’ Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, refuted the accusations, saying their efforts ‘are actually increasing the likelihood of a crypto strategic reserve (which includes bitcoin) happening.’ Unless you are choosing to ignore the core tenants of the POTUS campaign (which aggressively supports American companies and technologies), our efforts are actually INCREASING the likelihood of a crypto strategic reserve (which includes bitcoin) happening. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 23, 2025 No XRP, Please Messari’s founder, Ryan Selkis, joined the anti-XRP front, indicating that the Ripple incentive is ‘toxic.’ He went further, described the project’s native token as a ‘piece of s**t,’ and said it would be better to have no crypto strategic reserve than to put XRP in it. Selkis concluded that BTC is the only exception and that it makes sense to be the sole crypto rep in that reserve. America-First is not “American-Shitcoin First” We’d be better off having no strategic reserve than one with a “endorsed” pieces of shit like XRP. Still, I think Bitcoin is an exception. 1. Build different (with energy) 2. Lindy, mcap dominance, no insiders 3. Global traction https://t.co/eCNhKjpgSL — Ryan Selkis (d/acc) (@twobitidiot) January 23, 2025 In contrast, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, who has been collaborating with the Ripple team for a while now, said there’s no need to ‘base XRP’ and claimed that the strategic reserve will start as bitcoin-only.

FXGuys , a standout in the altcoin ecosystem, is catching their attention with its groundbreaking Trade2Earn program, high-value staking rewards, and unparalleled prop trading funding program. Here’s why FXGuys is stealing the spotlight as the Top PropFi Project of 2025. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The $FXG Token: A Game-Changer in Decentralized Finance At the heart of FXGuys’ appeal lies the $FXG token, hailed as one of the best defi tokens for 2025. Unlike many other tokens in the market, $FXG comes with tangible benefits: Staking Rewards: Investors can stake $FXG to earn a 20% profit and revenue share from broker trading volume. This feature ensures passive income, making it highly attractive for those seeking consistent returns. No Buy or Sell Tax: FXGuys eliminates hidden trading fees, providing transparency and efficiency for traders. Trade2Earn Opportunities: Every trade executed within the FXGuys ecosystem earns users $FXG tokens, creating a unique incentive for high trading activity. Why Cardano Investors Are Pivoting While Cardano has been a leader in scalability and energy efficiency, FXGuys offers a unique approach that Cardano currently lacks. The high-potential altcoins sector is dominated by projects providing innovative solutions, and FXGuys fits the bill perfectly. Cardano investors are particularly drawn to: Instant Funding Prop Firm Access: FXGuys’ prop trading funding program allows traders to gain access to up to $500,000 in trading capital. This makes it one of the best proprietary trading firms for ambitious traders. Same-Day Fiat and Crypto Withdrawals: Flexibility in withdrawals, available in over 100 local currencies and cryptocurrencies, is a significant advantage. Custom Trading Platforms: With access to FXGuys Trader, MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, and DXtrade, users can select the platform that best fits their geographic location and trading style. The Rise of the Trade2Earn Model The Trade2Earn program is a groundbreaking feature that incentivizes traders by rewarding them with $FXG tokens for every trade they make. This model not only boosts trading activity but also ensures a continuous cycle of growth and token demand. Analysts have highlighted this as a key driver for the FXguys’ current success, as it fosters an ecosystem where users directly benefit from their engagement. Additionally, FXGuys has raised over $2.6 million in its Stage 2 presale, showcasing strong investor confidence. With its current price at $0.04, the project’s growth trajectory points toward substantial gains. FXGuys’ Trader Funding Program: Empowering Smart Prop Traders FXGuys’ prop trading funding program stands out as a beacon for retail traders aiming to scale their operations. The program offers: $500,000 Trading Capital: Retail traders who pass the trading evaluations gain access to significant funding, with profit splits favoring the trader at 80/20. Trader Development Ecosystem: FXGuys goes beyond funding, offering tools and training to develop traders into industry leaders. No KYC Requirements: The platform’s decentralized nature ensures that traders can participate without cumbersome verification processes. These features position FXGuys as a haven for smart prop traders , setting it apart from competitors in the best proprietary trading firms category. Analysts Back FXGuys Over Cardano and Others While Cardano continues to maintain its reputation as a blockchain powerhouse, analysts are increasingly recommending the FX Guys for its innovative solutions and investor-friendly features. The $FXG token’s combination of staking rewards, zero-tax trading, and a robust Trade2Earn model is unmatched, making it a top contender among top defi coins and high potential altcoins . >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Conclusion: A Bright Future for FXGuys As Bonk and Cardano slow down, FXGuys is becoming the go-to choice for savvy investors. With its Trade2Earn program , prop trading funding program , and $FXG token staking benefits, FXGuys is carving out its place as the Top PropFi Project of 2025. At just $0.04 per token in its Stage 2 presale, it’s no wonder investors are doubling down on this high-potential altcoin.

With their groundbreaking ecosystems and loyal investor bases, these projects have consistently ranked among the best altcoins to buy. But things are shifting, and a new player, FXGuys ($FXG) , is making big moves with a presale success that has made the project impossible to ignore. Raising over $3 million and it’s still in its second stage, FXGuys has quickly positioned itself as one of the trending altcoins that are related to decentralized fìnance. Investors have started to notìce, and for good reason. The question is whether the rise of FXGuys could mean the end of Polkadot and Cardano’s dominance or at least loosen their grip on the market. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano (ADA) Ecosystem Challenges Expose It To Newer Options Cardano is now facing challenges in maintaining its dominance as newer projects gain more ground. Thanks to its impressive method of development, Cardano quickly became positioned as a top blockchain. Despite multìple positive reception, Cardano’s slow rollout of features and upgrades has frustrated many in the crypto community. While competitors are innovating at a rapid pace, Cardano feels like it’s lagging, leaving room for other projects to become trending altcoins. Cardano’s ADA token has also struggled to deliver returns over the past year. While the network’s ecosystem contìnues to grow, the pace hasn’t been fast enough to compete with fast-rising projects that offer more benefìts, risking getting overshadowed by them. Polkadot’s (DOT) Recent Performance Pushes Holders To Alternative Options Polkadot has started showing cracks in its foundation. The network’s ability to connect multiple blockchains through its parachain system made it a key option in the crypto space. As new projects come up with innovative offerings made to fìt the demands of investors, Polkadot’s relevance has come into question. While its parachains remain a unique feature, other platforms now offer similar features with faster deployment and more effìcient processes. The DOT token itself has also been tanking since December last year despite being a top-20 cryptocurrency by market cap. Its price performance in recent months is pushing holders to consider whether it can keep up with stronger competitors. FXGuys ($FXG) Showcases Impressive Potential To Be Among The Best Altcoins To Buy FXGuys is an impressive reimagination of what decentralized fìnance can achieve when paired with new investment solutions. The FX Guys platform delivers innovation with tangible benefìts, startìng with the groundbreaking Trader Funding Program. This feature grants traders up to $500,000 in trading capital, removing the need to risk their own funds and creating a better way to trade without any stress. But FXGuys goes even further. It has a Trade2Earn system that flips the everyday trading model by rewarding users with $FXG tokens for every trade they make—even if it’s a win or a loss. This approach builds wealth for traders, making it one of the best altcoins to buy if you prefer to be highly rewarded for your participation. Then there’s the platform’s staking program, which offers token holders passive income with APY and a share of the platform’s revenue. Combine this with a no-KYC policy, and it’s no surprise that the ongoing presale has raked in millions in such little tìme. Investors still have the opportunity to earn over 150% profìts by the tìme the presale tokens launch, but they have to buy in at the current discount of just $0.04. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Conclusion Projects like Cardano and Polkadot are beginning to feel the heat from newer projects like FXGuys . While these projects face challenges in keeping up, FXGuys has emerged as an alternative with more benefìts for investors. As the presale tokens contìnue to attract millions, the FXGuys is proving that it’s not like every other altcoin—it’s a project that can help you gain fìnancial freedom in no time.

Hitler Musk (HITMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HITMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Hitler Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Hitler Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Hitler Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Hitler Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Hitler Musk by entering its contract address (CA) – GB5uSMr95szepTSfj6sbJHFxMaBHwwyBzUY6dPAWZCCH – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HITMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-26 08:50:54

While Pepe (PEPE) grapples to find its feet after a 19.5% loss in the last week, Remittix (RTX) is experiencing similarly explosive growth to what Pepe (PEPE) achieved upon its launch. It has done this by targeting one of the largest financial sectors: a $190 trillion cross-border payments market expected to reach $290 trillion by the end of the decade. This PayFi project has captured attention rapidly, raising over $7 million in its presale. With its bold approach and powerful platform, Remittix is shaking up the financial industry. So, how will these two projects fare in 2025? What’s Happening with Pepe? Pepe (PEPE) is confusing crypto spectators right now, as it has a habit of doing. It can’t seem to make up its mind which way to go. Following a major 19.5% dip in the last 7 days, Pepe (PEPE) is now down 5% in the last 24 hours, suggesting a possible resurgence. Pepe’s price charts hint at potential growth. On-chain data shows an uptick in active wallets holding Pepe, suggesting that new investors are joining the fold. While meme coins are known for their volatility, Pepe has proven its staying power and many speculate it could deliver gains in 2025. Disrupting the Global Payments System Expenses, hidden charges and delays have long hampered the global payments market. Remittix tackles these issues head on by making transactions easier for individuals and businesses. Its advanced platform connects fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, facilitating simple but effective international transfers. Using Remittix (RTX), users can change more than 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and send money worldwide within 24 hours. Its flat-rate pricing structure eliminates hidden fees, offering a straightforward alternative to traditional banking systems. One of the most attractive features of Remittix is its Pay API, which simplifies international operations for businesses. This tool supports over 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs allowing companies to take payments in cryptocurrency and settle in fiat. This API lets businesses expand across borders without the usual cross-border payment headaches. Remittix places strong emphasis on accessibility and security. Transactions are processed as standard bank transfers, but without exposing their cryptocurrency origins. This feature makes the platform approachable for crypto-savvy users and those new to digital assets, forming a bridge between blockchain technology and traditional finance. One of Remittix’s defining missions is to expand access to financial services. By operating 24/7 and eliminating reliance on traditional banking infrastructure, the platform reaches underbanked populations worldwide. This effort to democratize financial tools opens up new opportunities for communities often excluded from global finance. The Rush for RTX Tokens The Remittix (RTX) presale is making waves, having yielded over $7 million in investment in just a few weeks. The $RTX token plays a central role in the ecosystem, offering both functionality and potential for investors. The project’s broad utility has led analysts to predict an 800% price surge during the presale with further growth anticipated post-launch. As Remittix (RTX) continues to address real-world financial problems, it is poised to disrupt the PayFi space in 2025.

Thanks to strong investor support, the platform has already raised over $7 million just weeks into its presale period. More crucially, one of the best altcoins to buy now is the RTX token, which leading crypto analysts project a possible 50x rise for in 2025. Remittix is surely one of the best crypto investment prospects right now as a result of many unique and promising offerings. Remittix: Revolutionizing Global Payments Remittix is transforming cross-border payments by reducing the friction and expenses long afflicting conventional financial systems. Moreover, Remittix provides a flawless solution since it lets users transmit cryptos that are immediately converted into fiat and sent straight into any bank account all around the world. Usually found in services like Stripe, Wise, and even Coinbase, which are known for their hefty fees and lengthy processing times, this procedure removes the intermediaries. The blockchain-powered Remittix PayFi system blends the best of both worlds—cryptocurrency speed and transparency, along with the simplicity of fiat currency transfers. Faster, more reasonably priced worldwide transactions guarantee that both individuals and companies gain from this creative approach, which removes expensive delays and costs. With cross-border payments expected to be worth a whopping $250 trillion by 2027, Remittix is positioned to take a sizable chunk of this growing sector especially as it presents a better substitute to conventional banking services. Growing Demand and a Promising Future for Remittix Selling over 281 million RTX tokens, the platform has now raised more than $7 million as the Remittix presale keeps acquiring popularity. Early investors are being given the unusual chance to buy tokens at a presale price of just $0.0334 per RTX , which is projected to skyrocket upon token debuts on tier-1 exchanges. Remittix is generating such tremendous excitement that analysts estimate a 700% price rise during the presale period and some even foresee a possible 50x gain in 2025. Meanwhile, Remittix’s creative approach to crypto-to-fiat conversion supports this potential with worldwide payments backed by low fees and an outstanding user experience. With full transparency free of hidden costs, Remittix supports over 50 crypto pairs and 30 fiat currencies, enabling users to send money anywhere in the globe immediately. RTX is becoming among the best cryptos to invest in today for long-term returns. For companies trying to simplify their worldwide transactions as well as for crypto aficionados, Remittix’s simplicity and efficiency cause great appeal. The Best Crypto Investment : Remittix vs. Other Altcoins Though there are many opportunities in the forthcoming altcoin season , few like Remittix stand out. Its twin concentration on the profitable remittance industry and crypto-to-fiat payments sets it in a special position to profit from the growing worldwide need for quicker, less expensive, more secure money transfers. Remittix offers a real-world solution to a worldwide issue—cross-border payments—while many top altcoins mostly focus on speculative price movements or limited use cases. Moreover, Remittix distinguishes itself from other top crypto coins by emphasizing scalable, pragmatic answers to long-standing problems in the financial sector. Although other altcoins could show brief price swings, Remittix’s principles are designed for long-term, steady increases. Another important difference is Remittix’s capacity to let companies take crypto payments and immediately convert them into fiat for flawless cash flow control. As the platform keeps extending its reach, this function is predicted to be quite appealing to companies functioning in a worldwide market and inspire broad acceptance. A Reliable Investment with Passive Income Potential Apart from its amazing growth potential, Remittix presents investors with the opportunity to generate passive income from its RTX utility token. RTX token staking let’s holders get yearly staking bonuses between 4% and 8%. Remittix is much more promising to investors who search for both capital appreciation and consistent income generation since this offers a consistent stream of passive income. Moreover, the Remittix platform is dedicated to security and openness, which BlockSAFU has personally confirmed rather thoroughly. This guarantees that knowing the platform is safe, dependable, and future-proof, investors may feel confident in their investment. Why RTX is One of the Best Cryptos to Buy Now RTX is one of the best cryptos to buy right now as we enter the altcoin season since its mix of blockchain technology and practical use is outstanding. The Remittix (RTX) coin is clearly a top candidate for exponential gains in 2025 with the platform’s creative ideas for cross-border payments, expanding community, and great potential for development. Remittix is positioned to lead in the crypto scene by fixing inefficiencies in the worldwide remittance sector and providing an easily available platform for companies and individuals. Now is the time for investors wishing to guarantee their place in the future of global payments to engage with Remittix.

The move comes amid Donald Trump’s decision to make crypto a national priority regarding crypto policy and regulations, starting with signing an executive order to develop the national digital asset stockpile . However, experts claim cryptocurrencies and crypto projects developed in the United States may not see zero tax benefits. Why Is Zero Capital Gains Tax on Crypto May Not Be Possible Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, in an X post on January 26 said removing capital gains on crypto entirely depends on US Congress. He asserts it is highly unlikely that the US Congress will include such a proposal in a tax bill in the near term. He added that the primary obstacle is the significant loss in government tax revenue, making the proposal look difficult to approve currently. The primary agenda for the Trump administration is tax cuts and any policy that threatens those cuts will be sidelined. The zero income tax on crypto presents significant practical, legal, and economic challenges. The Trump administration will review the anticipated reduction in tax on US-based crypto but not vice-versa, which could be detrimental to equities, bonds, and other financial instruments. Eric Peterson, policy director at Satoshi Action Fund, said: Capital gain taxes on crypto is not going to 0% folks. Congress makes tax policy, not the president. Work towards attainable goals like the de minimis exemption. Recently, John Deaton discussed the ambiguity surrounding U.S.-based cryptocurrency projects . He questioned whether projects with operations or foundations abroad, such as Solana and Tezos, would meet the requirements for tax exemptions. The Crypto Industry Must Lobby for Meaningful Steps Forward Dennis Porter believes the crypto industry can take meaningful steps forward to reduce tax obligations. He suggests securing a de minimis exemption of $200 for Bitcoin and other digital asset transactions. “This proposal aligns with the existing $200 exemption for foreign currency transactions. It’s a far more attainable and reasonable goal, with minimal impact on Trump’s ability to renew his tax cuts,” he added. Americans who live off of Bitcoin and digital assets should not have to report every small transaction, such as buying coffee, meals, or groceries, for tax purposes. This is an overly burdensome task and it’s time we pursue this simplification of the tax code. Porter reveals that the U.S. Congress has bipartisan support for this idea and it could become a reality with de minimis exemption. In order to be successful, it must be tied to inflation and bipartisan support that balances innovation and fairness. Crypto Market Bullish on Zero Crypto Gains Tax Proposal The crypto market participants are bullish on the US-based crypto and likely zero tax on these crypto as the Trump administration introduces pro-crypto policy and regulations. Eric Trump confirmed advocating for zero capital gains tax for the U.S.-based crypto projects. ‘Made In USA’ crypto such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR) and others will benefit from tax cuts.

The altcoins are with minor gains on a daily scale but the weekend charts show a different picture for many of them. BTC Holds Steady at $105K The largest cryptocurrency went through a spectacular ride at the beginning of the business week. It began with a nosedive on Monday morning from $106,000 to under $100,000 before it exploded to a new all-time high of over $109,000. More volatility ensued before, during, and after Donald Trump’s inauguration speech as he failed to mention crypto. Following a price slump to $101,000, the bulls stepped up and didn’t allow a price slump into five-digit territory. In fact, BTC started to recover some ground and spiked to $107,000 a few days later. It failed there and was pushed south by three grand on Saturday morning but has recovered from that decline and now sits about a grand higher with little to no movement over the past 12 hours. Its market capitalization has climbed to $2.080 trillion on CoinGecko, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 55.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView AVAX on the Rise The largest altcoins have recovered some of the losses charted yesterday. Ethereum has bounced above $3,300 after a 1.3% daily increase, while XRP is above $3.1 following a similar increase. BNB, DOGE, and ADA stand in the same bracket. Solana and Chainlink have gained around 3% each and now trade at $255 and $25, respectively. Avalanche has emerged as the top performer from the larger-cap alts, surging by 6% to $37.5. The biggest gainers from the top 100 alts are XCN (91%), OM (30%), TAO (13%), and TRUMP (10%). The total crypto market cap has recovered over $60 billion overnight and is up to $3.750 trillion on CG.

From the iconic Dogecoin to the more recent Shiba Inu, these quirky tokens have turned casual investors into overnight success stories. But the game keeps changing, and if you missed the Just a Chill Guy opportunity, don’t fret! BTFD Coin is stepping in, offering an exciting chance for those looking to capitalize on the latest trends in the meme coin market. What’s got everyone buzzing about BTFD Coin? For starters, it’s not just another meme coin; it’s a full-fledged investment opportunity with a slew of innovative features. With its recently launched Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , a lucrative referral program, and a staggering 90% annual percentage yield (APY) on staking, BTFD Coin is set to take the meme coin popularity to a whole new level. The ongoing presale has already raised over $5.6 million, and analysts are predicting even bigger things on the horizon. If you’re on the lookout for the best new meme coins to invest in for short term gains, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. As we dive deeper, let’s explore what makes BTFD Coin so special and how it stacks up against Just a Chill Guy. One thing’s for sure: if you’re serious about crypto, you won’t want to miss this opportunity. BTFD Coin: Your Ticket to a Bright Future BTFD Coin is currently in its 14th stage of presale, with the price sitting at $0.00016—up from an astounding $0.000004 when it first launched. That’s a massive leap, and it shows that investors are taking notice. With over 66 billion BTFD coins sold and more than 9,300 holders, affectionately known as “Bulls,” this coin is gaining traction at an impressive rate. Now let’s talk about the exciting features that really set BTFD Coin apart. First off, the P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, and it’s already creating quite a buzz. Players can earn BTFD coins while having fun, making it an engaging way to invest. This gamified approach not only brings in gamers but also crypto enthusiasts who want to be actively involved in their investments. The staking rewards are another major draw. Starting on December 2, 2024, holders can stake their BTFD coins for an unbelievable 90% APY. To put it into perspective, if you invest $10,000 at the current price of $0.00016, and the price hits $0.0006 by the end of the presale, you’d see your investment skyrocket to a jaw-dropping $37,500! That’s the kind of return that turns heads and gets people excited. And don’t forget about the referral program. For every friend you bring into the BTFD community, you both earn extra BTFD coins. It’s a win-win situation that encourages community growth. With analysts buzzing about the potential for BTFD’s price to soar, this is the time to act if you want to be part of something big. Just a Chill Guy: Fun but Lacks Substance Now that we’ve covered the exciting aspects of BTFD Coin, let’s turn our attention to Just a Chill Guy. This meme coin has garnered some attention, largely due to its lighthearted branding and community vibe. But can it compete with the groundbreaking features that BTFD Coin is offering? Just a Chill Guy has built a loyal following, but it primarily relies on its meme culture and community engagement. While that’s great for building a fan base, it doesn’t offer the same level of innovative features that BTFD brings to the table. There’s no P2E game or enticing staking rewards that can really boost your investment. Sure, Just a Chill Guy can give you a chuckle, but can it deliver the financial gains that savvy investors are looking for? Analysts have mixed feelings. Some believe it still has potential, but others warn that it may struggle to keep up in an ever-changing market. As the meme coin space evolves, sticking with a coin that lacks fresh features might not be the best strategy. If you’re in the market for the best new meme coins to invest in for short term gains, Just a Chill Guy might be entertaining, but it doesn’t hold a candle to the excitement and potential of BTFD Coin. Conclusion: Seize Your Chance with BTFD Coin In a world where meme coins are capturing headlines and transforming investments, BTFD Coin shines as a beacon of opportunity. With its innovative P2E game, staggering staking rewards, and an engaging referral program, BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a legitimate investment opportunity. As the presale heats up, analysts are predicting that BTFD’s price could skyrocket as we near the finish line. Don’t let the chance to invest in BTFD Coin slip through your fingers. If you’re serious about maximizing your investments this weekend, now’s the time to jump on board. Don’t just sit on the sidelines while others celebrate their gains—become a part of the Bulls and join this thrilling journey. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with the BTFD Coin presale . Your future self will thank you!

The pl atform’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, sounded the alarm on X (formerly Twitter) today. He said , “There are ~1m tokens a week being created now, and growing. He called it a “high-quality problem” but admitted that the company’s traditional approach to token evaluation is no longer sustainable. Coinbase has long reviewed new tokens individually, but Armstrong said that the process is simply unworkable in this environment. He said: “And regulators need to understand that applying for approval for each one is totally infeasible at this point as well (they can’t do 1m a week). It needs to move from an allow list to a block list, and utilize customer reviews/automated scans of on-chain data etc to help customers sift through.” Additionally, Coinbase will continue integrating native decentralized exchange support more deeply. “Customers shouldn’t need to know or care whether the trade is happening on a DEX or CEX,” Brian added. The crypto market is exploding in the wake of Donald Trump’s re-election. Bitcoin surged past $109,000 last week, gaining over 50% since November. Trump fuels crypto frenzy with new policies Just days into his new term, Trump signed an executive order designed to promote the adoption of digital assets in the US. The order outlined key priorities, including protections for bitcoin miners and developers, the promotion of dollar-pegged stablecoins, and a ban on any Federal Reserve-issued digital dollar. In the weekend leading up to his Monday inauguration, both he and First Lady Melania Trump launched meme coins — a first for any president ever. While the decision delighted some investors, others worried that it might reinforce the perception of crypto as speculative and unstable. Trump has since doubled down on his support, floating the idea of establishing a US Bitcoin reserve. Critics argue that such a reserve would be risky, given bitcoin’s infamous price volatility, but Trump appears undeterred. “Trump’s presidency is a dream come true for the crypto industry,” Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist, said in a recent interview. He described the past few days as transformative, saying, “I don’t think they could have imagined a better outcome than they just got in the past 48 hours.” Brian Armstrong, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said, “The last four years, we really felt like we were being attacked by this administration,” referring to Biden’s tenure. Meanwhile, Trump’s executive order has directed agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Treasury, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to form a working group on digital assets. David Sacks, a venture capitalist and close Trump ally, has been tapped as the White House’s AI and crypto czar. He joined Trump in the Oval last week for the signing of the executive order. It was all pretty cool. The order also includes provisions to withdraw an accounting rule that previously forced banks to treat crypto holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets. The SEC announced the change shortly after the order was signed, calling it a “landmark decision” for encouraging institutional crypto adoption.

With Trump signing several executive orders that support the cryptocurrency market, more people are interested in trading. The next week is important for the market because the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and decisions about interest rates, along with other major economic news, will likely influence future trends in the market. Markets Stay Steady and Bullish Under Trump’s New Policies This week, everyone’s been focusing on US President Trump’s policies after he took office, and it looks like the markets are handling it pretty well so far. Instead of causing worry, his announcements are actually making people more bullish. He’s talked about big investments in artificial intelligence (AI), making significant changes in crypto policy, keeping interest rates low, and controlling inflation by reducing oil prices. This has encouraged investors to take more risks, leading to the S&P 500 reaching a new record high. Also read: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Will BTC Break $109K and Hit a New All-Time High? As we head into a new week, several important events could shape the future trends of the cryptocurrency market. US 4Q earnings season Next week, big tech companies like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Apple are set to report their earnings. Analysts predict that these major players, along with three other large companies, will see their earnings grow by more than 17% over the next year, which is almost double the 9% growth expected from the other 493 companies. Because these companies are valued so highly, investors will probably look for more than just the usual profit and revenue numbers. US FOMC Meeting It’s widely expected that the Federal Reserve will keep its main interest rate unchanged this Wednesday while they wait for more information showing that inflation is decreasing. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said he would insist on immediate cuts to interest rates globally, revisiting his frequent but ineffective pressure on the Fed during his first term. Early in his second term, Trump has already tightened immigration and announced plans to raise import taxes starting February 1. This creates uncertainty for the Fed, making it tough for them to plan monetary policy. The Fed is meeting soon and is expected to maintain the current interest rate between 4.25% and 4.50%, as recent data supports a gradual approach to reaching their 2% inflation target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his team face the challenge of balancing current monetary policy with uncertainties about the future and deciding how much to reveal about the Fed’s outlook. US Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index In November, the overall PCE prices in the US went up by 2.4% compared to last year, which is an increase from the three-year low of 2.1% seen in September. The core PCE price index, which the Fed uses to gauge underlying inflation, only rose by 0.1%—the smallest increase in six months. This kept the annual core PCE rate steady at 2.8% in December, which was below the expected 2.9%. Looking forward, the overall PCE is expected to rise to 2.6% year-over-year, which will be announced on Friday. The core PCE inflation rate is also expected to stay stable at 2.8%. European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate decision The ECB is expected to cut interest rates by 0.25% at its next meeting on 30 January, bringing the rate down to 2.75%. This would be the fifth rate cut since June 2024, aimed at supporting economic growth. Conclusion With the Fed likely on pause, the ECB poised to cut rates, and Trump’s pro-crypto signals still fresh, the crypto market appears positioned for a generally bullish week ahead.

As other assets in the crypto market make strides, Ethereum’s sideways movement has caused many to question whether it can regain its momentum this year. The prolonged consolidation has dampened sentiment, with some investors beginning to lose patience and faith in ETH’s ability to deliver substantial returns. Related Reading: Cardano Consolidates In A Symmetrical Triangle – Analyst Expects A 40% Move However, optimism remains among technical analysts who see Ethereum nearing a critical inflection point. Top crypto analyst Daan recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a massive falling wedge pattern forming on Ethereum’s chart. This setup is widely considered a bullish reversal indicator, with the potential to spark significant upward movement if the price breaks out. According to Daan, a breakout from this falling wedge would likely pave the way for Ethereum to test the $4,000–$4,100 level, offering a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. Such a move could reinvigorate market confidence and set the stage for Ethereum to reclaim its status as a leading altcoin. For now, all eyes are on ETH as traders await confirmation of the next big move in this highly-watched range. Ethereum Facing Serious Risks Ethereum has remained in a downtrend since late December, struggling to regain momentum as bearish sentiment continues to dominate the market. The lackluster price action has left investors and analysts increasingly concerned about the possibility of a deeper correction, as ETH consolidates near critical support levels. While some remain hopeful for a turnaround, the current outlook suggests Ethereum faces significant challenges ahead. Top crypto analyst Daan recently shared his insights on X, highlighting a massive falling wedge pattern on Ethereum’s chart. This pattern is often regarded as a bullish reversal signal, with the potential to trigger a significant breakout if confirmed. According to Daan, a successful breakout could propel ETH toward the $4,000–$4,100 range, revisiting its cycle highs. However, he also expressed caution, suggesting that if ETH does manage to reach this level, it may encounter strong resistance, potentially leading to another sharp rejection. Daan emphasized the importance of monitoring the falling wedge trendline, noting that it will play a crucial role in determining Ethereum’s next move. For now, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode, with ETH navigating a precarious balance between bullish breakout potential and the risk of further downside.

A breakout above the falling wedge could breathe new life into ETH and reignite optimism, while failure to hold support may lead to an extended period of consolidation or even a deeper correction. The coming days will be critical in shaping Ethereum’s trajectory, with its performance likely to influence broader market sentiment. ETH Consolidates Above Key Demand Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,322 after enduring several days of choppy price action, reflecting the broader uncertainty in the crypto market. The price has struggled to gain momentum as it remains stuck in a tight range, testing the patience of investors and traders alike. To ignite an uptrend, bulls must hold the critical $3,300 support level, which has served as a key demand zone in recent sessions. A decisive push above the $3,500 resistance level, which has capped ETH’s upward movement for weeks, is essential to confirm a bullish breakout. Clearing this level would likely reinvigorate market sentiment and attract fresh buying interest, setting the stage for Ethereum to target higher price levels in the coming days.

If ETH fails to hold the $3,300 mark, it could trigger a wave of selling pressure, leading to a deeper correction.

But do they need restaking? We’re talking taxes here – not death, the other certainty that last time anyone checked, couldn’t be offset through restaking. Tax, on the other hand, might just be. Due to the way capital gains are calculated in most regions, it’s preferable to avoid liquidating crypto assets where possible because doing so creates a taxable event. Hold onto them, however, and while you’ll still be liable for tax on any yield those staked assets generate, you won’t be on the hook for the underlying assets. They’ll remain tax-exempt, at least for the time being, allowing you to defer a big tax bill while capitalizing on the upside of being able to hold your crypto for longer. There are many reasons to explore restaking, from supporting the decentralization of blockchain networks to scooping up those sweet staking rewards. However, in tax minimization, there may be an even more compelling reason to explore this fast-growing on-chain sector. Tax might not be avoidable in life, but if you’re shrewd, it is at least reducible, and that’s a start. Here’s how it plays out when it comes to restaking. Getting a Handle on Crypto Tax A word of advice before we proceed: crypto tax regulations differ not only by country but sometimes even by region within a country. For this reason, the following strategy is intended for broad guidance only. To apply it to your own country, check the applicable laws that govern your tax code, or better still speak to your tax adviser. Hopefully, they’ll also know their crypto, saving you from having to explain such concepts as staking and restaking. Like other dreaded tasks, like cleaning the garage or visiting the dentist, calculating crypto tax is a chore that many are prone to putting off until the last minute. While crypto tax calculators have vastly simplified what was once a labyrinthine process, it would be stretching credulity to say that doing taxes is fun. But with a little forethought, it doesn’t need to be stressful – particularly if you’re still holding the bulk of your net worth in staking protocols. With restaking, you stake an asset such as ETH or BTC into a protocol to earn additional rewards while retaining the underlying token. On Ethereum, for example, EigenLayer enables restaking by allowing staked ETH or liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) like stETH or rETH to be reused across multiple networks. Mantle , an Ethereum Layer 2 network, uses EigenLayer’s restaking to secure its roll-up operations. On Bitcoin, meanwhile, restaking is also taking off thanks to protocols built on top of Babylon, the leading decentralized BTC staking layer. SatLayer , one of the first restaking protocols built on Babylon, enables bitcoiners to stake their BTC and earn rewards for helping to secure other networks. Given the vast potential for unlocking Bitcoin’s trillions of dollars in idle capital, coupled with the wide range of networks – including EVM – that can potentially be staked using the hardest crypto asset ever conceived, it’s evident that Bitcoin restaking will be huge. This brings us back to tax, unfortunately. Understanding how restaking is treated under tax law can make the difference between a modest and a monster tax bill. It’s not because restaking is tax-exempt, but rather because the act of doing so should leave you liable for capital gains tax only which is both lighter and later. But how does this work in practice? Restaking Crypto: Maximizing Gains, Minimizing Taxes From a tax perspective, the distinctions between staking and restaking are immaterial: the basic process is the same, regardless of whether you’re staking a native L1 asset – e.g. ETH – or a secondary LST, such as stETH. In each case, the outcome is the same as far as tax agencies are concerned: you remain in possession of the underlying token, potentially benefiting from its price appreciation, while accruing extra rewards on top. And it’s these rewards only that you should be liable for tax on during the calendar year. You don’t need to be an accountancy whizz to figure that 30% tax on $10K of restaking rewards is going to be a lot less painful than 30% on $100K of underlying. Restaking generally enhances your holdings through additional tokens, which can lead to compounding gains over time. However, the tax treatment of those rewards is crucial. In the U.S., for example, if staking rewards are viewed as taxable income upon receipt, you may owe taxes in the year you earn them. Later, if you sell those staking rewards for a profit, you incur capital gains tax on that difference. In the U.K., if considered income, staking rewards can be taxed according to your income bracket but upon disposal, any further appreciation is subject to capital gains tax. Delay, Defer One of the biggest levers crypto holders have for managing their tax liability is not selling their crypto assets prematurely. Restaking can be a powerful strategy for crypto investors seeking to grow their portfolios without incurring frequent tax events. By staking tokens like BTC or ETH, you remain exposed to potential price appreciation and accumulate additional rewards on top. In many jurisdictions, you are not liable for capital gains tax until you dispose of the asset. By simply holding onto your tokens, you defer the point at which capital gains tax is triggered. From a tax perspective, that is essentially the bull case for restaking. It gives you a way to delay and defer your tax obligations. Leaving more money in your pocket or crypto in your wallet in the here and now. Which is never a bad thing. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But do they need restaking? We’re referring to taxes here—death, the other certainty, isn't something restaking can offset. Taxes, on the other hand, might be reducible. Since capital gains are calculated in many regions based on asset liquidation, it's best to avoid selling crypto assets when possible, as this triggers a taxable event. By holding onto these assets, you’ll still owe taxes on any income generated from staking, but the assets themselves remain free from tax liability, at least temporarily. This allows you to postpone a hefty tax payment while still benefiting from holding your crypto longer. There are several reasons to consider restaking, from supporting the decentralization of blockchain networks to earning valuable staking rewards. However, when it comes to minimizing taxes, there’s an even stronger reason to delve into this rapidly growing area of blockchain. While taxes are unavoidable, they can be reduced with some smart planning, and that's a good place to start. Here’s how restaking can help with that. Understanding Cryptocurrency Taxation Before we proceed, here’s a tip: tax rules for crypto vary not just by country but sometimes by region. Therefore, the advice here is for general guidance only. To tailor it to your own situation, consult your country’s tax laws or, even better, talk to a tax professional. Ideally, they’ll be familiar with crypto, so you don’t have to explain concepts like staking and restaking. Much like other dreaded tasks, such as cleaning out the garage or going to the dentist, figuring out crypto taxes is something many avoid until the last minute. While crypto tax calculators have made what used to be a complicated process much easier, it's still a stretch to call tax preparation enjoyable. But, with some foresight, it doesn't have to be stressful, especially if you’re holding a significant portion of your wealth in staking protocols. With restaking, you invest an asset like ETH or BTC into a protocol to earn extra rewards while keeping the original token intact. On Ethereum, for instance, EigenLayer allows restaking by letting staked ETH or liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) like stETH or rETH be reused across multiple networks. Mantle , an Ethereum Layer 2 network, utilizes EigenLayer’s restaking to secure its roll-up processes. On the Bitcoin side, restaking is gaining traction through protocols built on Babylon, a leading decentralized BTC staking layer. SatLayer , one of the initial restaking protocols on Babylon, allows Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC and earn rewards for securing other networks. Considering the immense potential to unlock Bitcoin’s trillions in idle capital, alongside the numerous networks—including EVM—that can be staked using the most robust crypto asset ever created, it's clear that Bitcoin restaking is poised to become significant. And this brings us back to the topic of taxes. Knowing how tax laws treat restaking can be the difference between a small and a substantial tax bill. Restaking isn’t tax-free, but the process generally only subjects you to capital gains tax, which tends to be less burdensome and delayed. So how does this work in practice? Restaking Crypto: Boosting Returns, Cutting Taxes From a tax standpoint, the differences between staking and restaking aren't significant: the fundamental process remains the same whether you're staking a primary L1 asset—like ETH—or a secondary LST, such as stETH. In both cases, tax authorities see the same outcome: you still own the original token and might benefit from its value increase while earning additional rewards. During the year, you should be taxed only on these rewards. You don’t need to be a financial expert to realize that a 30% tax on $10K in restaking rewards is far less painful than 30% on a $100K asset. Restaking typically increases your holdings with extra tokens, potentially leading to compounded gains over time. However, how those rewards are taxed is crucial. In the U.S., for example, if staking rewards are taxed as income when received, you may owe taxes for that year. If you later sell those rewards at a profit, you face capital gains tax on the difference. In the U.K., if considered income, staking rewards might be taxed according to your income level, but any further increase in value upon sale is subject to capital gains tax. Hold and Delay One of the key strategies for crypto holders to manage tax liability is to avoid selling their crypto assets too soon. Restaking can be a powerful method for investors looking to expand their portfolios without triggering frequent taxable events. By staking assets like BTC or ETH, you remain open to potential price growth while earning more rewards. In many regions, capital gains tax is only due when you sell the asset. By holding onto your tokens, you postpone the point at which this tax is applied. From a tax perspective, this is essentially the bullish case for restaking. It offers a way to delay and defer your tax responsibilities, leaving more funds in your wallet or crypto holdings in your portfolio. And that’s always a good thing.

39524745,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123945,1737889493,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Japan’s Central Bank Raises Interest Rate to 0.5%, Highest Since 2008",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-central-bank-interest-rate-hike-2025/,"The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points , moving from 0.25% to 0.5% , according to Bloomberg . This adjustment marks the highest interest rate since October 2008 , a period closely tied to the global financial crisis following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The decision reflects the BOJ’s gradual shift away from ultra-loose monetary policies, signaling an important development in Japan’s economic strategy amidst ongoing inflation and global economic uncertainty. Key Highlights of the Rate Hike From 0.25% to 0.5% The 25 basis-point increase represents a significant step toward normalizing monetary policy, moving away from years of near-zero or negative interest rates. Highest Rate Since 2008 The last time Japan’s interest rates were at this level was in October 2008 , during the fallout from the Lehman Brothers collapse . Global Context The rate hike aligns Japan’s monetary policy more closely with other major economies, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank , which have also raised rates in response to inflationary pressures. Why Did Japan Raise Its Interest Rate? Addressing Inflation Japan has experienced higher-than-expected inflation, with the core consumer price index (CPI) consistently exceeding the BOJ’s target of 2%. The rate hike is aimed at curbing inflation while maintaining economic stability. Yen Stabilization The yen has faced significant volatility in recent months. A higher interest rate could strengthen the currency by attracting foreign investment. Gradual Policy Normalization After years of ultra-loose monetary policies, the BOJ is taking cautious steps toward policy normalization to address structural challenges in the Japanese economy. Impacts of the Rate Hike Domestic Economy Borrowing Costs : Higher interest rates will increase borrowing costs for businesses and households, potentially slowing domestic spending and investment. Savings Growth : Savers may benefit from improved returns on deposits, encouraging higher savings rates. Currency Markets The yen could strengthen as higher interest rates make Japanese assets more attractive to foreign investors. A stronger yen could reduce import costs but might also impact export competitiveness. Global Financial Markets Japan’s rate hike could influence global bond markets, especially as one of the largest holders of U.S. Treasury bonds adjusts its policy stance. Historical Context: Japan’s Interest Rate Policies Year Interest Rate Economic Context 1999-2008 Near-zero rates Efforts to combat deflation following Japan’s asset bubble collapse. 2008-2016 0.1%-0% Response to the global financial crisis and economic stagnation. 2016-2022 Negative rates BOJ implemented negative interest rates to stimulate growth. 2023-2025 Gradual hikes Inflation and global pressures drive cautious policy normalization. Expert Perspectives John Roberts (Global Economist, Bloomberg) : “This rate hike signals that the Bank of Japan is finally joining the global fight against inflation. However, the BOJ must tread carefully to avoid stifling growth in an economy heavily reliant on exports.” Aiko Tanaka (Tokyo-based Financial Analyst) : “The move will likely bolster the yen in the short term, but it’s a delicate balance. Exporters may face challenges, especially as Japan’s key trading partners, like China, deal with their own economic uncertainties.” Challenges Ahead for the BOJ Balancing Growth and Inflation While the rate hike addresses inflation, it could dampen economic growth, especially in a country with high public debt and an aging population. Export Competitiveness A stronger yen could make Japanese goods more expensive abroad, impacting the country’s export-driven economy. Global Economic Risks Geopolitical tensions and slowing global growth could complicate Japan’s economic recovery efforts. Conclusion The Bank of Japan’s decision to raise its interest rate to 0.5% , the highest level since 2008, marks a significant shift in the country’s monetary policy. While the move addresses rising inflation and yen volatility, it also poses challenges for economic growth and export competitiveness. As Japan cautiously transitions away from ultra-loose policies, the global financial markets will closely monitor the implications of this decision. For domestic and international stakeholders, this rate hike is a pivotal moment in Japan’s economic trajectory, reflecting its response to evolving global and domestic pressures.

FAQs What is the new interest rate set by the Bank of Japan? The Bank of Japan raised its interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5% , marking a 25 basis-point increase. Why is this rate hike significant? This is the highest rate since October 2008 , signaling a shift in Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policies amid inflationary pressures. How will the rate hike impact the Japanese yen? The rate hike could strengthen the yen by making Japanese assets more attractive to foreign investors, potentially reducing import costs but impacting export competitiveness. What are the risks of higher interest rates in Japan? Higher rates may increase borrowing costs for businesses and households, potentially slowing economic growth and affecting Japan’s export-driven economy. How does Japan’s rate hike compare to global trends? The BOJ’s move aligns with central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, which have also raised rates to combat inflation. What challenges does the BOJ face after this hike? Key challenges include balancing inflation control with economic growth, managing export competitiveness, and navigating global economic risks.

The significant reduction came during the final year under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler , whose tenure saw aggressive regulatory oversight of the cryptocurrency industry. Key Highlights from the Report Decline in Enforcement Actions The SEC’s crypto-related enforcement actions dropped from 47 in 2023 to 33 in 2024 , representing a 30% decrease . This decline is notable after 2023 marked the agency’s peak enforcement activity against cryptocurrency firms and projects. Concentration of Actions in September Over 50% of the SEC’s 2024 enforcement actions occurred in September , indicating a focused crackdown toward the latter part of the year. Shifts in Regulatory Priorities Cornerstone Research observed that the SEC’s declining enforcement activity aligns with shifting priorities under new leadership and evolving industry dynamics. Possible Reasons for the Decline Leadership Transition Gary Gensler’s tenure as SEC Chair ended in 2024, marking a potential shift in policy priorities under new leadership. Speculation suggests a possible move toward a more collaborative approach with the crypto industry. Court Rulings and Legal Challenges High-profile legal challenges, such as cases involving Ripple (XRP) and Grayscale , may have influenced the SEC’s enforcement strategy and resource allocation. Evolving Industry Standards Increased compliance by crypto firms in response to prior enforcement actions may have reduced the need for regulatory intervention. Focus on Other Financial Sectors The SEC may have redirected its attention to other financial sectors , including traditional markets, during this period. Historical Comparison of SEC Crypto Enforcement Actions Year Number of Enforcement Actions Key Context 2021 20 Increased focus following DeFi expansion. 2022 35 Regulatory crackdown amid market volatility. 2023 47 Peak enforcement under Gary Gensler. 2024 33 Decline during Gensler’s final year. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Industry Improved Compliance The crypto industry’s efforts to enhance regulatory compliance may have contributed to the reduction in enforcement actions. Investor Confidence Fewer enforcement actions could signal a stabilizing regulatory environment , boosting investor confidence in the sector. Focus on Collaboration A potential shift in regulatory strategy may encourage greater collaboration between the SEC and crypto firms. Uncertainty Persists Despite the decline in actions, unresolved cases and regulatory ambiguity continue to pose challenges for the industry. Expert Perspectives John Deaton (Crypto Legal Advocate) : “The decline in SEC enforcement actions is a welcome relief for the crypto industry, but it’s crucial to monitor how the agency’s strategy evolves under new leadership.” Laura Shin (Blockchain Analyst) : “This could mark the beginning of a more constructive approach by regulators, balancing innovation with investor protection.” Conclusion The 30% drop in SEC crypto enforcement actions in 2024 marks a significant shift from the regulatory fervor seen during the previous year. While the decline may indicate evolving priorities under new leadership, it also reflects the crypto industry’s increasing focus on compliance. As the regulatory landscape continues to develop, the balance between enforcement and collaboration will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. For industry participants, this period presents an opportunity to engage constructively with regulators and build a more resilient ecosystem.

The micro-scale has also turned positive as the asset recovered its 30-day percentage gain or loss to above 6% at the end of the week. The world’s most prominent cryptocurrency is trading at nearly double its price six months ago. Furthermore, it can be had or sold for more than 100% of its exchange rate 12 months ago. BTC Experts Remain Overwhelmingly Bullish But, most Bitcoin experts surveying the market conditions for blockchain assets today are very bullish on the currency’s prospects for another extended leg up the chart over the coming months in 2025. Some of the main reasons for the strong forward sentiment: First, there’s Donald Trump’s reelection, a new crypto-friendly SEC chair, and plans in Congress to appropriate US tax dollars to buy and hold Bitcoin in a strategic national reserve. Then there’s Bitcoin’s enormous demand, miner network participation, powerful use cases, limited currency supply, and the bullish phase of its four-year supply cycle. Finally, there’s the rapidly expanding US dollar supply under a low interest rate regime, four years of record-setting US budget deficits ahead, and economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Here are three recent Bitcoin price predictions from cryptocurrency experts: 2025 Expert Bitcoin Price Predictions Aquinas Wealth Advisors: $130,000 According to Christopher McMahon, CEO of Aquinas Wealth Advisors and author of “Faithful Finances,” Bitcoin’s price will top $130,000 this year. McMahon’s is the lowest of the three forward targets for BTC in 2025. He argues that institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies will make the numbers go up. Motley Fool: $200,000 According to a cryptocurrency analyst at the popular investment website Motley Fool, $200,000 BTC is “not only possible but also… fairly probable.” He’s tracking Bitcoin’s steep historical trend line, new investors, especially globally, as well as governments and companies joining the blockchain race. BlackRock: $700,000 Meanwhile, of all current expert Bitcoin price predictions, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s stands out most. The Wall Street executive warns Bitcoin’s price could rocket to $700,000 this year. The rocket fuel?

39524897,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123941,1737889877,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Glassnode Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $150K, Offering Massive Gains for Holders",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-prediction-150k-glassnode/,"Glassnode ‘s lead analyst , James Check , has projected that Bitcoin (BTC) could mirror its 2016-2017 cycle , potentially reaching a peak price of $150,000 , according to Cointelegraph . This optimistic forecast comes as Bitcoin continues to gain traction among institutional and retail investors, supported by bullish market dynamics and historical patterns. If Bitcoin hits this milestone, short-term holders , with an average entry price of $90,349 , could realize a 66% profit , while long-term holders , who entered at an average cost of $24,627 , stand to gain a staggering 509% return . Bitcoin’s 2016-2017 Cycle and Current Market Parallels James Check’s prediction draws comparisons between Bitcoin’s current cycle and the bull run of 2016-2017 : Accumulation Phase The current market reflects a similar accumulation phase observed before Bitcoin’s 2017 peak , characterized by increased wallet activity and growing institutional interest. Supply Dynamics Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins and heightened demand are driving scarcity, mirroring conditions that fueled the 2017 rally. Institutional Participation Unlike 2017, this cycle is bolstered by significant institutional involvement , such as spot Bitcoin ETFs , which enhance market stability and long-term growth potential. Potential Gains for Bitcoin Holders If Bitcoin achieves the $150,000 mark , here’s what holders could expect based on Glassnode’s data: Holder Type Average Entry Price Profit Margin Short-Term Holders $90,349 66% profit Long-Term Holders $24,627 509% profit Short-term holders are those who entered the market during recent bullish trends, while long-term holders have maintained their positions through multiple market cycles. Factors Driving the $150K Prediction Institutional Adoption The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing interest from major financial institutions are driving demand. Regulatory Clarity Improved regulatory frameworks in key markets like the U.S. are reducing uncertainty and attracting large-scale investors. Halving Event The next Bitcoin halving in 2024 is expected to reduce mining rewards, increasing scarcity and boosting the price. Global Macroeconomic Trends Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation and a store of value , especially in uncertain economic times. Challenges to Reaching $150K While the forecast is optimistic, several factors could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory: Regulatory Risks Stricter regulations or delays in ETF approvals could dampen investor sentiment. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s notorious price swings may cause hesitation among risk-averse investors. Global Economic Conditions Economic instability or a downturn in global markets could affect Bitcoin’s adoption and performance. Expert Perspectives on Bitcoin’s Potential James Check (Glassnode Analyst) : “Bitcoin’s current market dynamics strongly resemble the 2016-2017 cycle. With institutional backing and reduced market uncertainty, $150,000 is achievable.” Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy) : “Bitcoin’s fundamentals, coupled with growing institutional adoption, are setting the stage for a historic bull run.” Investor Takeaways Long-Term Perspective Long-term holders stand to benefit significantly, as Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its resilience and growth potential. Diversified Portfolio While Bitcoin offers lucrative opportunities, diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and assets can mitigate risks. Monitoring Key Indicators Investors should watch for ETF approvals, regulatory developments, and market sentiment to refine their strategies. Conclusion The prediction by Glassnode analyst James Check that Bitcoin could peak at $150,000 reflects growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. With parallels to the 2016-2017 cycle , rising institutional interest, and favorable macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin is well-positioned for substantial growth.

These often-volatile tokens, typically launched on unlicensed platforms , pose significant risks due to their susceptibility to manipulative practices like pump-and-dump schemes and wash trades , according to the advisory published on the NYSDFS official website. Memecoins have gained immense popularity in recent years, often propelled by online hype and cultural trends. However, the NYSDFS emphasizes that these digital assets lack the regulatory oversight and consumer protections necessary to safeguard investors from fraud or financial loss. Key Risks Highlighted by NYSDFS Lack of Regulatory Oversight Most memecoins are issued on unlicensed platforms that fail to comply with New York’s Virtual Currency Regulations , leaving investors vulnerable to fraud. Pump-and-Dump Schemes Memecoins are frequently manipulated by small groups who artificially inflate prices through pump-and-dump tactics , leaving unsuspecting investors at a loss. Wash Trades Some platforms engage in wash trading —a deceptive practice where fake transactions are created to inflate the trading volume, misleading investors about demand. Centralized Control Unlike established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, memecoins are often controlled by a small group , enabling them to manipulate supply and price. What Are Memecoins? Memecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that often derive their value from social media trends, online communities, or internet memes rather than intrinsic use cases or technical advancements. Examples : Popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained traction as community-driven projects. Speculative Nature : Their prices are frequently influenced by celebrity endorsements , viral content, or speculative trading. While some memecoins have developed robust communities, the majority lack real-world utility, making them highly speculative and prone to market manipulation. Why Is NYSDFS Warning New Yorkers? Protecting Consumers The NYSDFS’s primary goal is to safeguard consumers from financial losses due to unregulated and risky investments. Preventing Fraud The department aims to educate the public about common schemes in the crypto market, particularly those targeting retail investors. Encouraging Informed Decision-Making By issuing this warning, the NYSDFS hopes to encourage potential investors to conduct thorough research before purchasing memecoins. Tips for Consumers to Avoid Memecoin Risks Verify Platform Licensing Ensure the platform complies with NYSDFS regulations and holds a valid BitLicense for operating in New York. Research the Token Investigate the project’s whitepaper, team credentials, and utility before investing in any memecoin. Avoid Hype-Driven Decisions Do not invest solely based on social media trends or celebrity endorsements. Understand Market Dynamics Be aware of manipulative practices like pump-and-dump schemes and how they can impact prices. Diversify Investments Avoid putting all your capital into a single speculative asset. Instead, diversify across established and regulated investments. Expert Perspectives John Wu (Blockchain Analyst) : “Memecoins attract retail investors due to their low entry price and hype, but the lack of regulation makes them a breeding ground for scams.” Alicia Tan (Crypto Legal Consultant) : “The NYSDFS’s advisory is a timely reminder for investors to approach memecoins with caution and avoid unregulated platforms.” Impact of the NYSDFS Alert on the Crypto Market Rising Awareness The alert is expected to educate retail investors about the risks of speculative investments , fostering a more informed community. Regulatory Scrutiny Increased oversight could push memecoin projects to comply with state regulations, improving transparency and accountability. Market Correction A potential reduction in speculative trading could lead to more stable market dynamics, benefiting long-term investors. Conclusion The NYSDFS consumer alert serves as a crucial reminder for investors to exercise caution when dealing with memecoins . While these tokens may offer lucrative opportunities for short-term gains, their unregulated nature and vulnerability to manipulative practices make them a high-risk investment. By emphasizing the importance of due diligence , platform licensing , and market education , the NYSDFS aims to protect New Yorkers from falling victim to financial fraud. For potential investors, this advisory is an opportunity to make informed decisions and prioritize financial security over speculative trends.

In fact, large whales are now in the mood to hold on to their Bitcoin investments for the long term, meaning prices could see a further move upwards in the coming months. With Bitcoin poised for a whale-driven rally, the crypto space across the board is also expected to follow suit and cough up some mind-boggling returns for those who invest smartly and in high-potential cryptocurrencies. To help you out, here are the top 5 cryptos to invest in to become a millionaire in 2025. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Crypto for First-Time Investors With over $60M in presale funding and recent whale purchases of $115K , $82K , and $66K – all in the last couple of weeks, by the way – Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is undoubtedly one of the best crypto presales to invest in in 2025. What’s more, a whale gobbled up nearly $170K worth of $WEPE last December . Although $WEPE’s PEPE inspiration has a fair bit to do with its popularity, it is its unique mission of empowering small traders that makes it the next 100x meme coin , according to analysts. Wall Street Pepe aims to create a vibrant community of retail crypto traders and arm them with insider information, unique market insights, alpha trading calls, and even investing strategies. This way, token holders will finally have a real shot at crypto profitability, which was earlier almost impossible due to manipulation by crypto whales. If you want to flip the script on crypto whales, consider investing in $WEPE, which is available for just $0.0003665 at the time of writing. However, hurry up because the presale can end any moment now. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presales, check out our guide on how to buy $WEPE for step-by-step instructions. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer-2 Solution for Fast & Reliable Transactions Solaxy ($SOLX) aims to breathe new life into the Solana network, which is already a heartthrob of crypto enthusiasts, seeing as it’s gearing up for the next leg higher and expected to reach new all-time highs in the coming few weeks. As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network, Solaxy will not only eliminate Solana’s issues, such as failed transactions, congestion, and scalability limitations, but also double down on its own strengths, like low fees and lightning-fast speed, to revolutionize blockchain technology. With significant purchase orders in its ongoing presale, such as $67K and $50K (this one was just 5 days ago), $SOLX is setting up to be one of the most promising crypto presales of our time. Moreover, a whale bought $122K $SOLX during the end of December. The project has already raised over $15M so far, with 1 $SOLX priced at $0.001616 right now. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Cutting-Edge AI Technology for Crypto Profitability MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is another frog-inspired meme coin that has been making waves in the crypto market with its one-of-a-kind AI-powered functionality. Simply put, it’s a self-evolving AI agent that exists and grows on online platforms like X, where it interacts with crypto influencers, imbibing all that’s being said.

If you want to join the AI crypto bandwagon, visit the official $MIND website and buy the token for $0.0032016. Here’s how to buy $MIND . 4. YourTrump ($YTP) – Meme Coin Celebrating Donald Trump’s Popularity Official Trump ($TRUMP) has by far been the best-performing meme coin of 2025 so far, generating over 300% returns in less than 10 days from its launch a couple of weeks ago. However, if you missed out on $TRUMP, consider investing in YourTrump ($YTP). $YTP is based on the exact same concept, i.e., Donald Trump’s popularity, more specifically his follower count on X (Twitter). As Trump’s X followers reach the 100M mark, $YTP’s current expected listing price sits at around $8.6453, meaning early investors can yield up to a 30,440% return. Speaking of whale interest in $YTP, there have been small but noteworthy purchases almost every single day for the past two weeks. For instance, an investor bought over 300,000 YTP tokens on 23rd January , with a total purchase value of around $10K. 5. Rexas Finance ($RXS) – Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance ($RXS) has seen some massive whale purchases in the month of January. For instance, purchases of $179K and $158K were made on January 15 and January 22, respectively. Furthermore, the token’s recent purchase history is also laced with a lot of sizable buys, including amounts of $52K , $38K , and $89K . $RXS’s demand is for a good reason. It’s a very interesting project, seeing as it aims to tokenize real-world assets, such as commodities, art, gold, and even real estate. Rexas Finance is currently in presale, where it has already sold over 438M tokens and raised more than $43M. Interested buyers can get 1 $RXS for $0.200. Bottom Line Although following the footprints of crypto whales for your personal investments is a tried-and-tested strategy, it’s worth remembering that the crypto market is pretty volatile, meaning even the best cryptos to invest in can be filled with ups and downs. Additionally, none of the above is a replacement for financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing your hard-earned money in any crypto asset.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-26 11:15:26

As cited by Cointelegraph in a recent markets report, Thielen highlighted the potential for decentralized finance (DeFi) services to thrive, positioning Ethereum as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. The removal of SAB 121—a controversial accounting rule that imposed restrictive requirements on crypto custodians—paves the way for expanded Ethereum adoption by financial institutions and broader participation in DeFi. What is SAB 121? SAB 121 was a guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , requiring crypto custodians to account for digital assets held for clients as liabilities on their balance sheets. Impact on Custodians : This rule increased compliance costs, limiting the ability of banks and institutions to offer crypto custody services. Crypto Industry Response : The rule faced criticism for stifling innovation and adoption, particularly in the rapidly expanding DeFi sector . How Ethereum Benefits from SAB 121’s Abolition Increased Institutional Participation With the elimination of SAB 121, financial institutions can more easily participate in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols without burdensome accounting liabilities. This could attract institutional capital into Ethereum’s ecosystem, boosting liquidity and adoption. DeFi Expansion Ethereum’s leading position as the foundation of DeFi services positions it to benefit from the abolition of rules that previously hindered development in this space. Thielen noted, “This could be a pivotal moment for Ethereum, as it can potentially drive the expansion of DeFi services.” Improved Custody Solutions Crypto custodians will face fewer regulatory hurdles, enabling them to support Ethereum staking , tokenized assets, and other blockchain innovations. Growth of Layer-2 Solutions The reduced compliance burden could accelerate the adoption of Ethereum’s Layer-2 scaling solutions , further enhancing transaction efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The Role of DeFi in Ethereum’s Growth Ethereum serves as the backbone of the DeFi industry , hosting a wide range of protocols for lending, borrowing, and trading digital assets. Uniswap, Aave, and Compound : These flagship DeFi platforms rely on Ethereum’s blockchain to enable decentralized financial services. Tokenization of Assets : The abolition of SAB 121 could spur the growth of tokenized real-world assets (RWA), such as bonds and real estate, on Ethereum. Institutional Entry : With a clearer regulatory path, institutions may embrace Ethereum-based DeFi as a legitimate alternative to traditional finance. Challenges Ethereum Must Overcome While SAB 121’s abolition provides a significant boost, Ethereum still faces challenges: Scalability Issues Despite advances like Ethereum 2.0 and Layer-2 networks , scalability remains a concern for handling increased transaction volumes. Regulatory Ambiguity Although SAB 121’s removal is a step forward, broader regulatory clarity is still needed to ensure sustained institutional interest. DeFi Risks Ethereum-based DeFi protocols must address concerns around security , liquidity risks , and user education to build trust among mainstream users. Expert Perspectives on Ethereum’s Future Markus Thielen (10x Research) : “Ethereum stands to gain immensely from the removal of SAB 121, as it eliminates barriers for institutional participation in DeFi. This moment could define Ethereum’s growth trajectory.” Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy) : “Ethereum has proven its value in decentralized finance. With fewer regulatory obstacles, it has the potential to attract significant institutional capital.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “DeFi’s growth on Ethereum is inevitable, but aligning the ecosystem with institutional needs will be key to its long-term success.” Implications for the Crypto Industry The abolition of SAB 121 could have ripple effects across the cryptocurrency market: Enhanced Credibility A regulatory shift of this magnitude boosts the credibility of Ethereum and DeFi, paving the way for mainstream adoption. Market Growth Increased participation from banks and financial institutions could catalyze a bullish market cycle , benefiting Ethereum and related ecosystems. Competitive Edge for Ethereum With a strong DeFi foundation, Ethereum is well-positioned to outpace competitors in attracting institutional users. Conclusion The abolition of SAB 121 signals a turning point for Ethereum, with the potential to drive DeFi growth , attract institutional capital, and solidify its position as a leader in the blockchain space. While challenges like scalability and security remain, the removal of restrictive accounting rules creates a more favorable environment for Ethereum’s expansion. As the regulatory landscape evolves, Ethereum’s ability to adapt and capitalize on these changes will be crucial in shaping the future of decentralized finance.

In an interview with CoinDesk , Brogan emphasized the structural and operational differences between prediction markets and traditional gambling platforms. He highlighted that prediction markets function as neutral intermediaries , unlike sportsbooks, which profit from user losses. Key Differences Between Prediction Markets and Gambling Neutrality of Prediction Markets Unlike sportsbooks, which take one side of a bet, prediction markets serve as facilitators . They profit from transaction fees , ensuring no conflict of interest with participants. Regulation and Oversight In the U.S., federally registered prediction markets fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) . This oversight preempts state-level gambling laws , ensuring transparency and compliance. Core Purpose Prediction markets are designed to aggregate crowdsourced insights about future events, often serving as tools for data-driven forecasting rather than pure entertainment. What Are Prediction Markets? Prediction markets allow participants to trade contracts tied to the outcomes of specific events, such as elections, financial trends, or sports results. Examples : Popular platforms include Polymarket and Augur , which operate on blockchain technology for enhanced transparency. How They Work : Users buy and sell shares in a particular outcome, with prices fluctuating based on market sentiment and probabilities. Why the Gambling Label Is Misleading Transparency and Decentralization Many prediction markets operate on Web3 infrastructure , leveraging blockchain for transparency in transactions and outcomes. Smart contracts automate the settlement process, reducing the possibility of manipulation. Focus on Probabilities Prediction markets aim to predict the likelihood of events, often attracting participants interested in data analysis rather than recreational gambling. Non-Exploitative Model These platforms do not rely on user losses for revenue, distinguishing them from casinos and sportsbooks. CFTC Oversight and Legal Standing Federal Oversight In the U.S., prediction markets registered with the CFTC comply with federal regulations, offering a level of legitimacy and trust . This federal regulation often supersedes state gambling laws , providing clarity for platform operators and users. Distinction from Gambling Laws By focusing on market dynamics and data aggregation , prediction markets avoid the exploitative characteristics associated with traditional gambling. Use Cases for Prediction Markets Political Forecasting Platforms like Polymarket allow users to speculate on political outcomes, such as elections or policy changes, offering a real-time gauge of public sentiment . Economic Indicators Prediction markets can aggregate insights on financial trends, such as interest rate changes or stock market performance. Scientific Research Researchers use prediction markets to gather data on innovation probabilities, clinical trial outcomes, and more. Challenges and Misconceptions Regulatory Ambiguity Despite CFTC oversight, prediction markets face scrutiny from state regulators, leading to misconceptions about their legality. Perception as Gambling The casual use of the term “betting” to describe user participation often leads to incorrect comparisons with gambling. Complexity for New Users The technical aspects of blockchain-based prediction markets can deter mainstream adoption. Expert Perspectives Aaron Brogan (Crypto Attorney) : “Prediction markets are not gambling—they’re neutral, data-driven platforms designed for forecasting. Comparing them to sportsbooks misrepresents their purpose and functionality.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “As blockchain technology evolves, prediction markets will likely play a key role in fields like political analysis, finance, and even climate research.” Conclusion Prediction markets are far from being Web3 gambling platforms . With their focus on neutral facilitation , data-driven insights , and compliance with CFTC regulations , they represent a legitimate and innovative use of blockchain technology. While misconceptions persist, experts like Aaron Brogan emphasize the need to differentiate between prediction markets and traditional gambling. As the adoption of decentralized technologies grows, prediction markets could play a pivotal role in reshaping how individuals and organizations approach forecasting and decision-making.

With this, the crypto industry has achieved another milestone in the global markets. Moreover, the price of Bitcoin has hit a new ATH of over $109,000, suggesting a positive outlook. Evaluating the current cryptocurrency market sentiments, investors are closely monitoring the price of top tokens with new investors involved daily. In this article, we have uncovered the possible short-term price analysis of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP). Bitcoin (BTC) The price of Bitcoin today has recorded a neutral price action losing ~1% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $45.207 billion. However, the BTC price has added 6.64% in 30 days and has a YTD return of +11.86%, highlighting a strong long-term bullish action. TradingView: BTC/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) constantly supports the Bitcoin price chart in the daily time frame. However, its RSI indicator records a negative action. This highlights rising uncertainty for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Suppose, the crypto space experiences increased positive action, this could push the BTC price toward its new ATH of $110,000 in the coming time. However, if the bears dominate the market, the price of Bitcoin could retest its support level of $102,000.

Ethereum (ETH) Despite increased price action in the crypto space, the Ethereum token struggles to maintain its upward trajectory. This has resulted in the largest altcoin forming a consolidated price action this year. With a trading price of $3,288.00, it has a market cap of $396.51 billion. TradingView: ETH/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) records a neutral price trend with its averages displaying a similar action in the daily time frame. Moreover, its EMA 50/200-day witnessed a similar price action. This indicates a consolidated price action for the largest altcoin in the crypto market. Maintaining the price above its support trendline of $3,272 could set the stage for this altcoin to retest its upper resistance level of $3,700 during the upcoming month. Conversely, an intensified bearish action could pull the price toward its important support level of $3,100. Are you one of many who are wondering if the ETH price will hit a new ATH this 2025?

Instead of announcing a Bitcoin-specific Strategic Reserve, the administration proposed a broader evaluation of a “strategic national digital assets stockpile.” The decision has led to skepticism among traders and analysts, with many questioning the immediate market impact. Traders Unimpressed by Lack of Bitcoin Reserve Plans Nick Forster, founder of the onchain options protocol Derive, highlighted the dampened sentiment in a January 25 analyst note. “The market sees limited upside for the asset in the short term, likely due to the absence of a specific BTC reserve announcement,” Forster wrote. His analysis revealed a significant bearish signal—83.3% of Bitcoin options contracts on January 24 were “calls sold,” indicating traders’ lack of confidence in a price surge. Forster added, “Traders were expecting concrete actions, not vague promises, and the market is now making it clear that hype alone isn’t enough to drive lasting impact.” Ripple’s Multi-Coin Proposal Adds to the Debate President Trump’s January 23 executive order tasked a working group with developing strategies to position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space, including the controversial evaluation of a digital asset reserve. However, this move has sparked debate within the crypto community. Ripple has openly supported a multi-coin reserve approach, further dividing opinions on the best path forward. While Bitcoin’s price has seen historic highs in recent months, reaching $105,100 as of January 25, it remains 3.8% below its all-time high of just over $109,000. The lack of a Bitcoin-specific reserve announcement has caused some traders to hit the brakes on their bullish outlook. Veteran trader and analyst Filbfilb echoed these concerns, stating , “The market isn’t trading at $100,000 because people believe the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would happen right away.” However, he remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential, maintaining his 2025 target of $180,000—a level he first identified in early 2023. Hype vs. Action The executive order, while signaling the government’s growing interest in digital assets, highlights the divide between policy aspirations and market expectations . For now, Bitcoin’s traders appear to be in a holding pattern, awaiting actionable steps to translate government interest into tangible market drivers. Whether this initiative will serve as a stepping stone or a missed opportunity remains to be seen.

33767162,[object Object],1737891028,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Nears ATH As Data Reveals Low Retail Demand – Potential For Further Growth?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-nears-ath-as-data-reveals-low-retail-demand-potential-for-further-growth/,"Bitcoin is currently consolidating below its all-time highs, with market participants eagerly awaiting a clear trend confirmation. After a period of significant volatility, the cryptocurrency has entered a critical phase where its next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. While price action remains strong, sentiment across the market is mixed as uncertainty dominates investor decision-making. Recent data from CryptoQuant highlights a notable trend: retail demand for Bitcoin remains low, even as the cryptocurrency hovers near its all-time high. Historically, retail investors have played a crucial role in driving Bitcoin’s bull cycles, providing the liquidity and enthusiasm necessary for sustained upward momentum. The current lack of retail activity raises questions about whether Bitcoin’s rally can continue without this vital segment of the market. This scenario presents a dual-edged narrative. On one hand, the subdued retail presence could signify untapped growth potential, with room for more widespread participation to push prices higher. On the other hand, it may also serve as a warning sign, reflecting broader hesitance or uncertainty that could hinder Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its gains. Bitcoin Prepares For A Move Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,000, showing strength as it holds above key levels and maintains upward momentum. Many analysts believe BTC is gearing up for further gains, yet caution remains prevalent in the market. Sentiment among investors is surprisingly bearish, with some calling for a potential top or even the end of the current cycle. This mixed sentiment underscores the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin’s next move. Key metrics from CryptoQuant, shared by analyst Carl Runefelt on X , reveal an intriguing trend: retail demand for BTC remains notably low, even as the cryptocurrency approaches its all-time high (ATH). Historically, retail investors have been a driving force behind Bitcoin’s most significant bull runs. The lack of retail participation at these price levels could be seen as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it suggests untapped growth potential, as renewed retail interest could fuel further price increases. On the other hand, it highlights a possible lack of confidence among smaller investors, which could signal a shift in market dynamics. For Bitcoin to sustain its current bullish trajectory, it is crucial to hold above the $105,000 level and secure a breakout above its ATH. Such a move would likely attract new market participants and reinforce bullish sentiment. However, failure to hold current levels or decisively break above ATH could expose Bitcoin to a deeper correction, further amplifying bearish sentiment and dampening market optimism. As Bitcoin continues to consolidate near ATH, its ability to attract fresh demand and overcome bearish market sentiment will determine whether it can sustain its rally or enter a prolonged consolidation phase. The coming days and weeks will be critical in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory as the market navigates this pivotal moment. Is BTC Ready To Push Above ATH? Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $104,500 after several days of choppy price action characterized by high volatility and market indecision. While the long-term outlook remains bullish, short-term sentiment appears increasingly uncertain, leaving traders and investors on edge about the cryptocurrency’s next move. Currently, BTC’s price action reflects a delicate balance between bullish and bearish pressures. Bulls are closely watching the $103,600 support level, which has been critical in maintaining upward momentum. Holding above this level in the coming days would likely pave the way for a push above the all-time high (ATH), reigniting optimism and potentially drawing more participants into the market. However, the stakes are high. A failure to hold $103,600—and especially a breakdown below the psychological $100,000 level—could spell trouble for Bitcoin’s price action. Such a scenario would likely lead to extended consolidation or, in the worst case, a deeper correction. This would dampen short-term sentiment and create further hesitation among traders and investors.

Nonetheless, this $517 million single-day performance brought the US-based Bitcoin ETFs’ weekly record to $1.76 billion. Meanwhile, it extended the current streak of positive inflows to seven days, with the exchange-traded funds drawing $4.7 billion in capital within this period.

Now at +$40b net since launch with aum at $121b and return of 127%. For context they just passed ESG ETFs in assets ($117b) and have about same as gold spot.

39525565,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123927,1737891110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,MicroStrategy May Face 15% Tax on $19.3B Unrealized Bitcoin Gains,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microstrategy-15-percent-tax-on-bitcoin-gains/,"MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) , the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC) , may owe federal taxes on its $19.3 billion in unrealized BTC gains due to a provision in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act , according to a report by Cointelegraph . This could subject the company to a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) , even though it has not sold any of its Bitcoin holdings. The news, reported by the Wall Street Journal on January 24 , raises questions about how unrealized gains on digital assets like Bitcoin might be taxed under this new framework. What Is the 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax? The corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) was introduced in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to ensure that large corporations pay a minimum tax rate of 15% on their book income —a measure of income reported to shareholders rather than the IRS. Targeted Corporations : The tax applies to corporations with average annual earnings exceeding $1 billion over the previous three years. Unrealized Gains : While CAMT primarily focuses on realized earnings, unrealized gains, particularly on digital assets , may fall under scrutiny due to the lack of explicit guidelines. How This Could Impact MicroStrategy MicroStrategy, which holds over 152,300 BTC as of January 2025, has seen the value of its Bitcoin holdings rise significantly since it began accumulating the cryptocurrency in 2020 . Massive Unrealized Gains MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $19.3 billion at current market prices, representing substantial unrealized gains. Despite not selling any of its Bitcoin, the company’s balance sheet could trigger taxation under the CAMT. Potential Tax Liability If the IRS deems unrealized Bitcoin gains as part of the book income , MicroStrategy could face a 15% tax on these gains. This could translate to billions in tax liabilities, significantly impacting the company’s financial position. Legal and Regulatory Ambiguities The taxation of unrealized gains on digital assets remains a grey area: IRS Guidance The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not yet issued clear guidelines on whether unrealized gains from assets like Bitcoin qualify as book income under the CAMT. An official interpretation is expected to address these uncertainties in the near future. Potential Exemptions Legal experts speculate that the IRS may create exemptions for unrealized gains on certain assets, including cryptocurrencies. Without such exemptions, companies like MicroStrategy could be forced to restructure their holdings to avoid massive tax burdens. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Market Institutional Adoption The potential taxation of unrealized gains could deter other corporations from adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets , slowing institutional adoption. Market Volatility Concerns about taxation could trigger selling pressure on Bitcoin, potentially leading to short-term market volatility . Policy Precedent How the IRS handles this issue could set a precedent for how cryptocurrencies are taxed in the U.S., impacting both corporate and retail investors. MicroStrategy’s Response MicroStrategy has not publicly commented on its potential tax liability under the CAMT. However, the company is known for its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, with Executive Chairman Michael Saylor frequently advocating for Bitcoin as a long-term store of value . Resilience Amid Challenges : In the past, MicroStrategy has navigated regulatory and financial challenges related to its Bitcoin holdings without altering its strategy. It remains to be seen whether the CAMT could force a change in its approach. Expert Perspectives John Deaton (Crypto Legal Advocate) : “Taxing unrealized gains sets a dangerous precedent, especially for volatile assets like Bitcoin. This could have far-reaching implications for corporations and individual investors alike.” Michael Saylor (Executive Chairman, MicroStrategy) : “Bitcoin is a long-term asset. Regardless of short-term regulatory hurdles, we believe it will continue to provide value to our shareholders.” Laura Shin (Crypto Analyst) : “The IRS’s interpretation of CAMT in the context of Bitcoin could define how digital assets are treated under U.S. tax law for years to come.” What’s Next for MicroStrategy and the IRS? IRS Clarifications The IRS is expected to release formal guidelines on how CAMT applies to digital assets, potentially clarifying the treatment of unrealized Bitcoin gains. Industry Advocacy Crypto industry leaders may lobby for exemptions or revised tax policies to prevent undue burdens on companies holding digital assets. Impact on Corporate Strategies Companies with significant Bitcoin holdings may consider diversifying their portfolios or reclassifying their assets to mitigate potential tax liabilities. Conclusion The possibility of a 15% tax on MicroStrategy’s $19.3 billion in unrealized Bitcoin gains highlights the regulatory challenges facing the cryptocurrency market. As the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy’s situation underscores the need for clear and fair tax policies that address the unique nature of digital assets. How the IRS handles this issue could have a profound impact on institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For now, all eyes are on the agency’s next steps and the potential legal battles that could arise.

FAQs What is the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT)? The CAMT, introduced under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, ensures corporations earning over $1 billion annually pay a minimum tax of 15% on their book income. How does CAMT affect MicroStrategy? MicroStrategy may owe taxes on its unrealized Bitcoin gains, even though it hasn’t sold any BTC, due to the CAMT’s broad definition of taxable income. Why are unrealized gains controversial in tax policy? Unrealized gains are not actualized profits, making it burdensome for companies to pay taxes on assets they haven’t sold. What role does the IRS play in this issue? The IRS is responsible for interpreting whether unrealized Bitcoin gains qualify as taxable book income under the CAMT. How might this impact Bitcoin adoption? If unrealized gains are taxed, it could deter other corporations from holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, slowing institutional adoption. What is MicroStrategy’s position on Bitcoin? MicroStrategy remains committed to Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, with Executive Chairman Michael Saylor frequently advocating for its benefits.

39525683,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123925,1737891263,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Canada’s FINTRAC Warns of Increasing Crypto Use in Illegal Drug Trade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fintrac-crypto-drug-trafficking-warning/,"The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) has issued a warning regarding the growing use of cryptocurrencies in laundering proceeds from synthetic opioid trafficking. The Jan. 23 alert, as reported by Cointelegraph , outlines new risk factors for identifying illicit activity, including large crypto-to-fiat conversions and deposits originating from high-risk regions . This warning is part of Project Guardian , FINTRAC’s broader initiative to combat financial crimes in the cryptocurrency space by enhancing collaboration with virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and financial institutions. Key Risk Factors Identified by FINTRAC Large Crypto-to-Fiat Conversions Criminal organizations are increasingly converting large volumes of cryptocurrency into fiat , a common method of laundering illicit funds. Deposits from High-Risk Regions Deposits originating from regions associated with high levels of drug trafficking and weak regulatory enforcement are raising red flags. Synthetic Opioid Trafficking Cryptocurrencies are being used to facilitate payments and obscure financial transactions linked to the trafficking of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl . Unregulated Virtual Asset Platforms Criminals are exploiting unregulated crypto exchanges and peer-to-peer platforms to bypass regulatory oversight and conceal their activities. Project Guardian: Strengthening the Fight Against Crypto Crimes Project Guardian is a FINTRAC initiative aimed at addressing the misuse of cryptocurrencies in financial crimes, including drug trafficking. Collaboration with VASPs : FINTRAC calls on virtual asset service providers and financial institutions to adopt enhanced due diligence practices to identify and report suspicious activity. Public-Private Partnerships : By fostering partnerships with industry stakeholders, FINTRAC seeks to improve intelligence-sharing and strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) measures. Why Cryptocurrencies Appeal to Criminal Organizations Anonymity and Pseudonymity Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a degree of pseudonymity , making it harder to trace transactions compared to traditional banking systems. Cross-Border Transactions The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies facilitates cross-border payments , often bypassing regulatory scrutiny. Unregulated Platforms Criminals exploit unregulated or poorly regulated exchanges to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies without triggering alarms. Rapid Transactions Cryptocurrencies allow for instant transfers , enabling quick movement of funds that makes detection more difficult. Impact of Crypto Use in the Drug Trade Synthetic Opioid Epidemic The misuse of cryptocurrencies has contributed to the global opioid epidemic , with synthetic opioids like fentanyl posing significant public health challenges. Regulatory Gaps The lack of consistent global regulations on cryptocurrency use has created loopholes that criminal networks exploit. Increased Scrutiny on VASPs Virtual asset service providers now face greater pressure to enhance AML and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols. How FINTRAC Aims to Mitigate Risks Risk-Based Approach FINTRAC advises VASPs and financial institutions to adopt a risk-based approach , focusing on high-risk transactions and customers. Enhanced Reporting Requirements Businesses dealing in virtual assets must report suspicious transactions and comply with stricter monitoring standards. Education and Awareness FINTRAC is working to raise awareness about the risks associated with cryptocurrency misuse, both among industry participants and the public. Challenges in Combating Crypto-Related Financial Crimes Rapid Evolution of Technology Criminals quickly adapt to technological advancements , making it difficult for regulators to stay ahead. Global Jurisdictional Differences Disparities in cryptocurrency regulations across countries hinder international cooperation and enforcement. Sophisticated Money Laundering Techniques Techniques such as chain-hopping (moving funds between blockchains) and the use of privacy coins make tracking illicit transactions more challenging. Expert Perspectives Aaron Brogan (Crypto Legal Expert) : “FINTRAC’s proactive stance on cryptocurrency regulation is essential, but more international cooperation is needed to address cross-border financial crimes effectively.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “The growing use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities underscores the importance of balancing regulation with innovation to protect the broader ecosystem.” Conclusion FINTRAC’s warning about the rising use of cryptocurrencies in laundering funds from the illegal drug trade highlights the need for robust anti-money laundering measures and stronger collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders. As criminal networks exploit the anonymity and speed of crypto transactions, initiatives like Project Guardian play a crucial role in identifying and mitigating risks. However, addressing this challenge will require global coordination, enhanced regulatory frameworks, and continued vigilance from the crypto industry. For those operating in the digital asset space, compliance with FINTRAC’s recommendations is not only a regulatory obligation but also a vital step in ensuring the integrity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

What are the key risk factors identified by FINTRAC? Key risks include large crypto-to-fiat conversions , deposits from high-risk regions , and the use of unregulated platforms for laundering funds. What is Project Guardian? Project Guardian is a FINTRAC initiative aimed at combating financial crimes involving cryptocurrencies through enhanced collaboration with VASPs and financial institutions. Why are cryptocurrencies attractive to criminals? Cryptocurrencies offer pseudonymity , cross-border transaction capabilities , and access to unregulated platforms, making them appealing for illicit activities. What can VASPs do to mitigate risks? VASPs should adopt enhanced AML and KYC protocols , monitor high-risk transactions, and report suspicious activity to regulatory authorities.

As reported by Reuters , Cipollone emphasized the risks that global stablecoin development could pose to Eurozone banks , including the loss of fee revenues and shrinking client bases. This statement follows Trump’s recent executive order promoting stablecoin innovation, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in digital currency development . Meanwhile, the ECB continues to experiment with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) , but its launch hinges on legislative approval . Why a Digital Euro is Critical for the Eurozone Countering Stablecoin Dominance Trump’s executive order encourages the development of global stablecoins , which could become widely used for cross-border payments and challenge the dominance of fiat currencies like the euro. Protecting Banks from Disintermediation Stablecoins could reduce the role of traditional banks by offering lower transaction fees and bypassing intermediaries. Eurozone banks risk losing significant revenue streams if stablecoins become the preferred means of payment. Maintaining Monetary Sovereignty The widespread adoption of U.S.-backed stablecoins could weaken the euro’s role in the global economy, reducing the ECB’s ability to influence monetary policy. The ECB’s Digital Euro Experiment The ECB has been actively exploring the development of a digital euro , focusing on key areas such as: Retail Payments A digital euro could provide a secure and fast payment method , complementing cash and existing digital solutions. Financial Inclusion The ECB envisions a digital euro that ensures access to financial services for all Eurozone citizens, even in underserved regions. Cross-Border Transactions By reducing transaction costs and delays , a digital euro could improve cross-border payment efficiency, keeping the Eurozone competitive. Trump’s Stablecoin Strategy: A Game-Changer Executive Order on Stablecoins Trump’s recent order promotes the development and regulation of global stablecoins , ensuring that the U.S. leads in blockchain-based financial innovation . Private Sector Involvement Companies like BlackRock and Circle have been instrumental in advancing stablecoin adoption, with assets like USD Coin (USDC) gaining traction in global markets. Global Influence By fostering stablecoin innovation, the U.S. could solidify the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency , even in a digital economy. Challenges Facing the Digital Euro Legislative Approval The launch of a digital euro requires approval from European lawmakers , a process that could take years. Policymakers must address concerns about privacy , cybersecurity , and potential disruptions to the banking system. Public Acceptance The success of a digital euro depends on widespread consumer trust and adoption , which may require significant public education efforts. Competition from Private Stablecoins Stablecoins like USDC and Tether (USDT) already have a strong foothold in the market, posing a challenge for new entrants like the digital euro. Potential Impacts on Eurozone Banks Revenue Losses Banks could lose significant income from transaction fees as stablecoins and digital currencies reduce reliance on traditional payment systems. Reduced Intermediation If stablecoins bypass banks entirely, institutions could face reduced client bases and diminished roles in the financial ecosystem. Increased Competition The introduction of a digital euro could also introduce competition for private banks, forcing them to adapt their business models. Expert Perspectives Piero Cipollone (ECB Board Member) : “The euro’s role as a global currency is at stake. A digital euro is essential to counter the disruptive potential of U.S.-backed stablecoins.” Aaron Brogan (Crypto Legal Expert) : “Trump’s executive order is a wake-up call for the Eurozone. If the ECB doesn’t act quickly, stablecoins could erode the euro’s global influence.” Christine Lagarde (ECB President) : “We’re committed to exploring a digital euro that enhances financial inclusion while safeguarding the stability of the banking system.” Conclusion The competition between the digital euro and U.S.-backed stablecoins reflects the growing importance of digital currencies in shaping the future of global finance. While Trump’s executive order positions the U.S. as a leader in stablecoin development, the ECB faces pressure to accelerate its CBDC initiatives to maintain the euro’s relevance and protect Eurozone banks from disintermediation. However, the successful launch of a digital euro will require overcoming legislative hurdles, addressing public concerns, and ensuring compatibility with existing financial systems. For the Eurozone, this is not just a technological challenge but a matter of economic sovereignty in an increasingly digital world.

Why does the ECB see stablecoins as a threat? Stablecoins could reduce the role of traditional banks, lower fee revenues, and challenge the euro’s global dominance. What is Trump’s stablecoin strategy? Trump’s executive order promotes the development of global stablecoins to position the U.S. as a leader in digital currency innovation. What challenges does the digital euro face? Challenges include legislative approval, public trust, privacy concerns, and competition from established stablecoins like USDC and USDT. How could stablecoins impact Eurozone banks? Stablecoins could disintermediate banks by bypassing traditional payment systems, leading to reduced revenues and client bases. When will the digital euro launch? The ECB is still in the experimental phase, and the launch depends on legislative approval and further development.

Zhao first asked his followers if they had made a profit from memecoins, and reached 121,000 voters out of a total of 9.5 million followers. 44% of the users said they had lost money on memecoins, while 33% voted that they had made a profit from memecoins. The remaining users voted that they had not purchased any memecoins so far. Afterwards, 39 thousand people voted for the question of whether they had made a profit from Bitcoin. 50.4% of them stated that they had made money from BTC, 23% said they had lost money, and the remaining users shared that they had never bought BTC before. In his third survey, Zhao asked users if they had ever made a profit from NFTs, and the most dramatic results came in this survey. Only 15% of users said they had made a profit from NFTs, while 36% said they had lost money, and a majority of 48% said they had never purchased an NFT. Related News: Analytics Firm Assesses Solana's Next Price Targets from its Chart Finally, Zhao asked his followers the same question about BNB and the survey concluded that 31% made a profit, 27% made a loss. 41% said they had never bought BNB. Zhao, who evaluated the survey results, admitted that the results could be biased because his followers are already interested in cryptocurrencies. He attributed the fact that there are so many people making profits in Bitcoin to the fact that the BTC price is near an all-time high. *This is not investment advice.

Remarks by Armstrong came on Jan. 24 via X, formerly known as Twitter, when the crypto world was experiencing a high influx in token creation, with almost 1 million tokens being launched every week. Challenges in the Present System The current listing process at Coinbase includes extensive reviews and compliance checks, but this has become increasingly unsustainable with the number of new tokens emerging. Armstrong says it’s time to move away from the traditional “allow list” to a more scalable “block list” system. He further emphasized the need to incorporate customer reviews and automated on-chain data analysis as a way of filtering tokens for listing. We need to rethink our listing process at Coinbase, Armstrong stated, emphasizing the current system couldn’t keep up with the growth of the industry. Backlash from within the Industry Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, lashed out at Coinbase’s listing policy to indicate that TRX, a top-10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been in review for seven years without getting listed. Sun further alleged that Coinbase had asked for extreme fees to list TRX, including $330 million in assets, a claim that has sparked controversy in the crypto space. “This is not about TRX itself; it’s about Coinbase losing its sense of fairness and sound judgment,” Sun said in a response to Armstrong’s post. Reformist Appeals Crypto influencer Ansem suggested that Coinbase hire industry veterans to smoothen the process for token listings. “Experienced individuals could easily pinpoint the 10 tokens out of a million which deserve immediate listing,” he said, emphasizing practical industry experience for token selection. To the Hybrid Model Armstrong also announced Coinbase’s plans to integrate more deeply with decentralized exchanges. He envisioned a future where customers would have a smooth trading experience, whether the transactions occurred on centralized or decentralized platforms. This hybrid approach aligns with the exchange’s broader mission to adapt to industry shifts. These comments come at a time of optimism for crypto regulation under President Donald Trump’s presidency. During a World Economic Forum appearance in Davos, he focused on how regulative clarity has set the tone and could potentially turn the fate of the crypto industry; hence, the same changes await Coinbase, whose operations go international.",Blockchain|Coinbase|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|REGULATION|TRX|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-26 11:43:15

Why? The cryptocurrency market saw Mantra ( OM ) reach a new record high Sunday, while Optimism ( OP ) plans a $53 million token unlock. Sui ( SUI ), currently on a bearish trajectory, is set to unlock $138 million in tokens this week. Read on for a more detailed look at the technicals and what the trajectory of each token shows. You might also like: Litecoin price rises as LTC ETF approval odds jump Mantra : The top crypto project in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization industry jumped to a record high of $5.08. That rebound was in line with our recent OM price prediction . Mantra soared because of the recent call by BlackRock’s CEO for regulators to approve the tokenization of stocks and bonds. It also reached a deal to tokenize DAMAC’s real estate projects in Dubai. The daily chart reveals that the Mantra price has formed a bullish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. This pattern comprises a long vertical line and a rectangle pattern, and is then followed by a bullish breakout. Mantra’s flag pole is at least 156% tall. As such, measuring the same distance from $4.53 means the coin is expected to rise to $11 in the long term. Mantra price chart | Source: crypto.news Optimism : The third-biggest layer-2 network prepares to unlock tokens worth over $53 million or 1.48% of the float. It now has over 1.35 billion tokens in circulation against a total supply of 4.29 billion. Optimism’s unlock comes when the token has been under pressure in the past few months. It has dropped to a low of $1.6295, down by 40.7% from its highest level in November. Optimism is hovering at the key support at $1.6076, where it failed to move below since Dec. 20. It has also formed a symmetrical triangle pattern. Therefore, a break below that level will likely point to more downside, potentially to $1.30, its lowest swing in November last year. Optimism price chart | Source: crypto.news Sui : Like Optimism, Sui will also have a big unlock worth $138 million or 1.1% of the float on Thursday. Only 37% of all SUI tokens have been unlocked , with the final one expected to happen in 2069. Sui’s token unlock comes when it is in a technical bear market after falling 22% from its highest level this year. It has moved below the lower side of the ascending channel. The coin has moved below the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index and the MACD have continued falling. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling, with the next point to watch being at $2.9415, its lowest point on Nov. 26. Sui price chart | Source: crypto.news The other top coins to watch this week will be Pi Network, Ethereum, and dYdX. Pi Network’s know-your-customer verification deadline will end on Jan. 31. Ethereum will be in the spotlight as the market watches the controversy with the Ethereum Foundation . DYdX will unlock tokens worth $9.6 million on Wednesday.

According to reports shared on X (formerly Twitter) , major investors increased their Bitcoin holdings from 16.2 million BTC to 16.4 million BTC during this period. Conversely, individual investors saw their holdings drop from 175 million BTC to 169 million BTC , indicating a redistribution of assets as Bitcoin prices climbed. Key Findings from the Analysis Large-Handed Investors Lead the Charge CryptoQuant data shows that large-handed investors , often institutional players or whales, significantly increased their holdings post-election. The increase from 16.2 million BTC to 16.4 million BTC suggests bullish sentiment and strategic accumulation during a critical period. Decline in Retail Holdings Individual investor holdings dropped by 6 million BTC , decreasing from 175 million BTC to 169 million BTC . This decline may reflect profit-taking by retail investors or a shift toward institutional ownership. Market Impact The actions of large investors provided price traction , supporting Bitcoin’s post-election rally and reflecting confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. What Drove the Post-Election Bitcoin Rally? Market Optimism Post-Election The U.S. presidential election often triggers volatility across financial markets. For Bitcoin, the post-election period saw increased institutional confidence and speculation about crypto-friendly policies under the new administration. Institutional Accumulation Institutions capitalized on the opportunity to accumulate BTC, signaling increased adoption and long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value . Retail Profit-Taking Individual investors may have opted to sell at higher prices , leading to a redistribution of BTC from retail to institutional holders. The Role of Large Investors in Bitcoin’s Market Dynamics Whales as Market Movers Large-handed investors , often referred to as whales , have the ability to influence Bitcoin’s price trends due to their significant holdings. Their strategic actions, such as accumulation or distribution, can create market momentum. Institutional Impact Major financial institutions, funds, and corporate investors contribute to Bitcoin’s price stability and growth by providing liquidity and reducing volatility. Redistribution of Wealth The decline in individual holdings suggests a transfer of Bitcoin wealth from smaller players to large investors, reflecting shifts in market structure. Retail Investors’ Role in the Decline Profit-Taking Strategy Retail investors may have sold off Bitcoin to capitalize on price surges , leading to a reduction in their collective holdings. Psychological Factors Fear of volatility or market corrections often prompts smaller investors to sell during price rallies, contributing to short-term redistributions. Impact on Market Trends While retail investors add liquidity to the market, their actions can also amplify volatility during periods of high trading activity . Bitcoin Price Traction: A Long-Term Perspective The post-election surge highlights a broader trend of institutional adoption and market maturation : Growing Institutional Interest As institutions accumulate Bitcoin, it reinforces the narrative of BTC as a legitimate asset class for diversification and hedging. Market Confidence Increased holdings by large investors signal confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamentals , such as its finite supply and decentralized nature. Reduced Volatility Institutional participation reduces speculative swings, stabilizing Bitcoin’s price over time and fostering wider adoption. Expert Perspectives Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy Executive Chairman) : “Institutional accumulation signals a paradigm shift in how Bitcoin is perceived—as digital gold and a hedge against fiat currency devaluation.” John Wu (Blockchain Analyst) : “The redistribution of BTC from retail to institutional holders underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing role of big players.” Aaron Brogan (Crypto Legal Expert) : “The post-election rally shows how macroeconomic events and policy expectations influence Bitcoin’s adoption and market structure.” Conclusion The post-election Bitcoin rally highlights the growing influence of large-handed investors in shaping market trends. As institutional holders increased their BTC holdings from 16.2 million to 16.4 million , retail investors reduced their positions, reflecting profit-taking and redistribution of assets. This shift underscores Bitcoin’s evolving market dynamics, where institutional adoption continues to drive growth and stability.

To emphasize his point, Kiyosaki referenced two key economic principles—Gresham’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law—highlighting Bitcoin’s growing dominance in an X post on January 25. Kiyosaki explained Gresham’s Law, which states that “bad money drives good money into hiding,” by noting how gold and silver have historically been hoarded as the U.S. dollar depreciates. He added that Bitcoin has joined this “good money” category, further challenging the “fake U.S. dollar.” “When BAD money enters a system GOOD money goes into hiding. Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding,” he said. Turning to Metcalfe’s Law, which quantifies the power of networks, Kiyosaki likened Bitcoin’s expanding adoption to the success of global franchises like McDonald ‘s (NYSE: MCD ). The author stressed that network power lets smaller players gain influence and wealth, urging the adoption of capitalism through assets like Bitcoin. TWO LAWS THAT GIVE BITCOIN POWER 1: GRESHAMS LAW: When BAD money enters a system GOOD money goes into hiding. Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding. 2:… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 25, 2025 Kiyosaki’s pessimistic dollar outlook Kiyosaki’s sentiments align with his long-held pessimism about the dollar, which he has labeled as ‘fake money.’ In this context, he has consistently championed alternative investments over traditional financial tools. As reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki recently thanked Bitcoin investors for not trusting the U.S. government, Treasury, and Federal Reserve, which he referred to as a ‘Den of Thieves.’ With the investor maintaining a controversial outlook and predicting an impending economic crash , he continues to advocate for Bitcoin, gold, and silver as ideal assets for wealth preservation in such an environment. Additionally, with Bitcoin rallying to new highs above $100,000, Kiyosaki has stressed that accumulating the leading digital asset is not too late. He has projected that Bitcoin could reach approximately $500,000 by 2025, describing it as a coin “designed to make everyone rich,” whether early adopters or latecomers. Interestingly, Kiyosaki has maintained that whenever Bitcoin’s price crashes, it should be welcomed as an opportunity to accumulate more of the asset. Which asset is better? Amid this outlook, Kiyosaki considers all three alternatives equal, dismissing the debate between Bitcoin and gold as a distraction. He suggests that such comparisons serve as a smokescreen to divert attention. Overall, Kiyosaki’s criticism of traditional finance, particularly the dollar, potentially overlooks the currency’s strength as the current global reserve currency. While there may be a chance for the dollar to be dethroned by Bitcoin, gold, or silver, which offer diversification, the currency remains a dominant player in the financial landscape despite possible erosion from inflation.

This represents a 4-point drop from the previous day, indicating a shift in market dynamics favoring Bitcoin over altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index compares the performance of the top 100 coins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score closer to 100 indicates an Altcoin Season , while a score below 25 suggests a Bitcoin Season . What Does an Altcoin Season Index of 44 Indicate? Neutral Zone Leaning Toward Bitcoin Season With a score of 44 , the index remains in the neutral zone , but the decline suggests that Bitcoin’s performance is outpacing most altcoins in recent months. Altcoins Lag Behind Bitcoin For the market to enter an Altcoin Season , at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must outperform Bitcoin’s rate of growth over the past 90 days. The current score implies that fewer altcoins are exceeding Bitcoin’s gains , shifting sentiment toward Bitcoin Season dominance . How Is the Altcoin Season Index Calculated? The Altcoin Season Index evaluates market trends by comparing the performance of Bitcoin against altcoins: Top 100 Coins : Only the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are considered, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. Performance Benchmark : The index analyzes whether 75% of these coins have risen more than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Scoring System : A score closer to 100 indicates an Altcoin Season , where most altcoins outperform Bitcoin. A score closer to 0 signals Bitcoin Season , where Bitcoin dominates market performance. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Drop? Bitcoin Price Momentum Bitcoin has experienced a significant price rally in recent months, reducing the relative performance of altcoins. Altcoin Underperformance Many altcoins have struggled to keep up with Bitcoin’s gains, contributing to the decline in the Altcoin Season Index. Market Sentiment Investors may be shifting capital back into Bitcoin amid market uncertainty, further impacting altcoin performance. Implications for the Market Bitcoin Dominance A declining Altcoin Season Index indicates that Bitcoin continues to dominate market sentiment, attracting more investment and attention. Altcoin Recovery Potential While altcoins are lagging, they could regain momentum if market conditions shift, such as a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance or major altcoin project developments. Investment Strategies Investors may adopt a more Bitcoin-centric strategy during periods of Bitcoin Season, while monitoring altcoin opportunities for future growth. Expert Perspectives John Wu (Blockchain Analyst) : “The current Altcoin Season Index score reflects a market environment where Bitcoin is outperforming due to increased institutional interest and reduced altcoin momentum.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “A score of 44 suggests a transitional phase. Altcoins may still have potential, but Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market for now.” Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy Executive Chairman) : “Bitcoin’s dominance is a testament to its position as the ultimate store of value. Altcoin fluctuations often reflect short-term sentiment rather than long-term adoption.” What’s Next for Altcoins and Bitcoin? Market-Wide Trends If Bitcoin continues to outperform, the Altcoin Season Index could decline further, signaling a prolonged Bitcoin Season . Potential Catalysts for Altcoins Developments in DeFi , NFTs , or specific altcoin ecosystems could reignite interest and push the index toward an Altcoin Season. Long-Term Outlook Over time, market cycles tend to balance out, with periods of Bitcoin dominance alternating with strong altcoin rallies. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s drop to 44 highlights a shift toward Bitcoin dominance , with fewer altcoins outperforming the leading cryptocurrency in recent months. This change reflects broader market trends, where Bitcoin’s strength is driving investor sentiment and shaping investment strategies. While the index remains in the neutral zone, a continued decline could signal a prolonged Bitcoin Season. However, altcoin enthusiasts should not lose hope, as market dynamics could shift with new developments in the cryptocurrency space.

Amid the market consolidation phase XRP traders have been spotted making strategic moves that could potentially trigger another major breakout, in the near-term. XRP Holds $3.1 Support as Traders Anticipate Fresh Bullish Triggers Ripple (XRP) price action has been relatively muted in recent days as crypto markets digest developments from President Trump’s first week in the White House. The launch of Trump’s memecoins has drawn significant investor attention, while discussions about the U.S. adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve currency pushed Bitcoin prices above $105,000 on Sunday. This surge in Bitcoin dominance, coupled with memecoins dominating social sentiment, has limited traction for mega-cap altcoins like XRP. Ripple (XRP) Price Action |Source: TradingView The XRP price chart above reveals that XRP is consolidating within a tight range after a significant breakout earlier this month. The consolidation zone spans between $3.3695 and $2.8277, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. This breakout, observed in the week leading up to Trump’s inauguration, coincided with the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, which provided a notable liquidity boost. Ripple executives’ attendance at a pre-inauguration dinner at Mar-a-Lago further strengthened ties between XRP and the new administration, driving bullish sentiment. The current consolidation phase could act as a potential launchpad for further gains if market sentiment remains positive. A break above the $3.3695 resistance could resume the rally, while failure to hold $2.8277 might signal a retracement. XRP ETF Speculations Could Spark $4 Breakout as Binance Outflows hit $450M Ripple (XRP) may require another significant catalyst to break above the $4 threshold. Recent speculations surrounding altcoin ETF approvals, including fresh filings in the first week of Trump’s presidency, have fueled optimism. Reports indicate that [insert company] is progressing with an XRP Spot ETF, further lifting sentiment. While XRP’s price action remains relatively stagnant, CryptoQuant’s on-chain exchange reserves data reveals strategic movements by traders on Binance. Savvy investors appear to be positioning for long-term gains, anticipating bullish triggers like an XRP ETF approval. Ripple (XRP) Exchange Reserves vs. Price | Source: CryptoQuant As of January 16, traders on Binance held a cumulative balance of 3.04 billion XRP in exchange wallets. Since then, persistent outflows have reduced the balance to 2.89 billion XRP as of January 26. This 10-day outflow of 150 million XRP, valued at approximately $450 million, has contributed to a tightening of immediate market supply. This supply contraction has helped XRP maintain its support above $3 despite heightened altcoin market volatility during the first week of Trump’s presidency. Historically, large outflows from exchange wallets indicate traders are moving coins into cold storage, signaling long-term bullish expectations. With speculations around altcoin ETF approvals and institutional interest from the new Bitwise Dogecoin ETF filing, it’s possible that institutional players are acquiring XRP from retail traders, driving these substantial Binance outflows. XRP Price Forecast: More consolidation ahead before $4 breakout XRP’s price forecast hinges on its performance within a crucial consolidation range between $2.8 and $3.4, a zone that has defined its recent trading activity. The Ichimoku Span Intersection (ISI) pinpoints critical levels, with $2.9 acting as support and $3.6 as resistance. This tight trading range has left the market looking for directional cues, as mixed technical signals suggest both opportunities and risks. TradingView ‘s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator also affirms this dual narrative, with its latest reading of 0.22 hinting at emerging bullish momentum. However, a minor negative divergence of -0.0043 suggests underlying fragility in the current setup. A decisive move outside this consolidation range could dictate XRP’s trajectory in the coming weeks, making it a pivotal point for traders and investors alike. XRP Price Forecast | XRPUSD On the bullish side, a breakout above $3.3695, the upper boundary of the consolidation ceiling, could pave the way for a rally toward the ISI resistance at $3.5985. Should buying pressure persist, the $3.5995 ISO1 upper bound becomes a near-term target, while sustained momentum could fuel aspirations for $3.7000. The $450 million exchange outflows, and institutional accumutation, evidenced by XRP’s rebound from the multi-month low of $2.1373, adds weight to the bullish scenario and emphasizes the potential for a $4 breakout. Conversely, failure to maintain support above $2.8277 risks a retest of the ISI support level at $2.8679. A breach below this floor could accelerate selling pressure, potentially driving XRP toward $2.5000 and the ISO1 lower bounds near $2.1674.

While Ethereum faces challenges, Yeti Ouro’s strong presale signals high growth potential. Table of Contents Ethereum’s current performance Yeti Ouro: Meme virality and gaming, a good match? Why Yeti Ouro is a top pick for investors Ethereum vsv Yeti Ouro Conclusion This is shaping up to be an eventful year for the crypto market, with 2025 predicted to be a bullish year for cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) has had a shaky month so far, and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) has performed well ever since the launch of its successful presale. Yeti Ouro is distinguished as a great investment with high growth potential. Ethereum’s current performance As of January 22, 2025, Ethereum price is at $3,274.55, down 2.93% over the past month. The high over the last 24 hours was $3,362, and the low was $3,268. Ethereum Price Chart: CoinMarketCap What’s affecting ethereum’s price? Leadership Issues: The ongoing issues within the Ethereum Foundation have spooked some investors. These have slowed down progress and created uncertainty, and Ethereum is underperforming against Bitcoin and Solana. Regulatory Uncertainty: The approval of spot Ether ETFs in July 2024 was a big boost. However, the exclusion of staking from these ETFs due to unclear regulations limited the impact, and Ethereum couldn’t fully capitalize on this milestone. Market Volatility: Ethereum is still benefiting from institutional adoption and technological advancements, but its price is still sensitive to market conditions. You might also like: XRP could reach $30 by end of 2025, meanwhile Yeti Ouro thrives Yeti Ouro: Meme virality and gaming, a good match? Yeti Ouro works as both a meme coin and utility token through its flagship game, Yeti Go, combining the fun and virality of meme coins with real-world utility. Yeti Go is an immersive racing game built on Unreal Engine 5. Players earn YETIO tokens as rewards for racing, so it’s more than just a game, it’s a new way to interact with cryptocurrency. Players can buy skins, customizations, and powerful in-game items with their tokens. This entertainment and financial incentive drives YETIO token demand and puts Yeti Ouro at the top of the blockchain gaming space. Here is a glimpse into the level 1 map of the game. Why Yeti Ouro is a top pick for investors Yeti Ouro’s unique approach and strong market presence have attracted investors’ attention. Analysts predict YETIO will hit $1 by April 2025 as the P2E market grows. Having been audited by SolidProof, a reputable company, has strengthened investors’ confidence, further driving interest and engagement. Why Yeti Ouro is growing Utility Beyond Hype: Unlike most meme coins, Yeti Ouro has real-world utility through its gaming ecosystem for both gamers and investors. Deflationary Tokenomics: Yeti Ouro has a 1 billion token supply with a burn mechanism that reduces supply over time. This scarcity model means long-term price appreciation. Strong Community and Dev: Yeti Ouro’s active community and transparent team means trust and engagement, which is key to long-term growth and adoption. Ethereum vsv Yeti Ouro Growth: Ethereum is a giant in blockchain tech but is currently limited by internal and regulatory issues. Yeti Ouro is riding the P2E gaming wave and offers investors a lot of upside.

The analysis revealed that 500,000 BTC , valued at approximately $500 billion , has moved out of long-term holder wallets since November 2024 . This trend indicates a substantial shift in market dynamics, raising questions about the motivations and implications of long-term holders’ decisions to sell. Key Findings from Intuderblock’s Analysis Massive Outflow from Long-Term Holders Since Trump’s election, 500,000 BTC has exited addresses belonging to long-term holders (LTHs) . The cumulative value of these BTC holdings is estimated at $500 billion , reflecting a significant shift in the market. Accelerated Selling Activity Intuderblock’s report highlights a sharp uptick in selling activity following the election, breaking the typical pattern of hodling behavior. Impact on Bitcoin Market Dynamics The exit of such a large volume of BTC from LTH wallets could signal a change in market sentiment, affecting price trends and liquidity. Why Are Long-Term Holders Selling? Post-Election Uncertainty Political events, such as Trump’s election, often trigger market uncertainty , prompting LTHs to liquidate holdings as a precaution. Profit-Taking Behavior With Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs in recent months, long-term holders may be capitalizing on profits accumulated over years of hodling. Fear of Market Volatility Concerns over potential regulatory changes or macroeconomic instability may have influenced LTHs to reduce exposure. Shift to Other Assets Some long-term holders might be reallocating funds into stablecoins , altcoins , or traditional investments to diversify their portfolios. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin? Increased Selling Pressure The movement of 500,000 BTC out of LTH wallets introduces significant selling pressure , which could result in short-term price corrections . Liquidity Boost While selling pressure can impact prices, the release of such a large volume of BTC into the market could improve liquidity , attracting new buyers. Potential for Market Redistribution The shift from long-term holders to new investors or institutions may signal a redistribution of wealth within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historical Context: Hodler Behavior During Major Events Long-term holders often adjust their strategies in response to significant market or political events: 2017 Bull Run Many hodlers sold during Bitcoin’s surge to $20,000 , leading to profit-taking and market corrections. 2020-2021 Institutional Boom The entry of institutional investors prompted hodlers to hold onto their BTC, expecting further price appreciation. 2024 Post-Halving Rally The recent bull run following Bitcoin’s halving event created ideal profit-taking opportunities for LTHs. Community Reactions The crypto community has expressed mixed opinions on the accelerated selling by long-term holders: Bullish Optimism Some believe the selling activity is temporary and will pave the way for new investors to enter the market. Bearish Concerns Others worry that the selling pressure could lead to a prolonged price correction or signal declining confidence in Bitcoin. Strategic Neutrality A section of analysts argues that profit-taking is a natural market cycle and doesn’t necessarily indicate bearish sentiment. Expert Insights John Wu (Blockchain Analyst) : “While the volume of BTC sold by long-term holders is significant, it’s important to consider this within the broader context of Bitcoin’s market cycles and macroeconomic factors.” Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy Executive Chairman) : “Selling activity from hodlers is part of Bitcoin’s natural market evolution. Long-term value remains intact, especially as institutions continue to adopt Bitcoin.” Laura Shin (Crypto Journalist) : “The movement of 500,000 BTC is noteworthy but not unprecedented. It highlights the need to monitor market sentiment and political developments closely.” What’s Next for Bitcoin? Market Stabilization As new buyers absorb the BTC sold by hodlers, the market could stabilize, reducing volatility in the medium term. Institutional Entry The influx of BTC into the market may attract institutional investors , providing long-term support for Bitcoin prices. Monitoring Political Developments Investors will likely keep a close eye on the Trump administration’s stance on crypto regulations , which could influence market sentiment further. Conclusion The accelerated selling of 500,000 BTC by long-term holders following Trump’s election highlights a critical shift in market dynamics . While this move introduces selling pressure, it also signals potential opportunities for new investors and reflects the natural cycles of Bitcoin’s evolving ecosystem. As the market adapts to this redistribution, the focus will remain on Bitcoin’s ability to maintain price resilience and its growing role as a store of value . Investors should monitor key developments, including regulatory policies and market sentiment, to navigate this transitional period effectively.

DOGE is still loved by many but now the Dogecoin price is facing some ups and downs. Ripple (XRP) is picking up speed with its advanced payment tech, but DTX Exchange , a new DeFi token, is getting lots of attention for its smart and easy-to-use trading platform. Let’s see why these three coins could be the top picks this year. Dogecoin Price Potential: Could DOGE Deliver Another Stellar Run? Dogecoin price is trading at nearly $0.36, and it is staying close to the lower edge of its rising channel. While the Dogecoin price holds above support levels, weak buying activity raises questions about whether it can sustain its current trend. If DOGE drops further, it might test support near $0.31, which could determine its next move. Interest in DOGE continues to grow, with Bitwise recently filing for a Dogecoin ETF, signaling a push for institutional recognition. This could increase confidence in DOGE among traditional investors. Meanwhile, the connection between Dogecoin and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) agency has sparked further speculation, adding fuel to the Dogecoin price recovery. With a market value above $53 billion, DOGE is at a crucial stage. If the Dogecoin price can move above the $0.4 resistance zone, it could regain its bullish momentum. However, failure to hold its support levels may lead to further decline. But DTX, on the other hand, is growing steadily with its successful presale and features. Why Ripple (XRP) Could Skyrocket in 2025 Ripple (XRP) is set to see more institutional interest as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to launch XRP futures in February 2025. Following this news, the Ripple (XRP) price saw a rise of around 3%, reflecting growing optimism in the market. Ripple’s (XRP) legal battle with the SEC is also reaching a turning point. A settlement or victory could clear up years of uncertainty and allow Ripple (XRP) to expand its payment network globally. Experts believe a positive outcome could attract even more investors, solidifying XRP’s position as a major crypto asset. With XRP trading near $3.20 and a market cap of $184 billion, traders are closely watching its next move. If institutional adoption and legal clarity align, Ripple (XRP) could surge to 250%, making 2025 a pivotal year. DTX Exchange: 250% Potential with DeFi Capabilities Other cryptos like Dogecoin price and Ripple (XRP) have been in the spotlight for years, but DTX Exchange is bringing itself up as a different type of platform. It offers access to a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex, giving traders flexibility. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, it focuses on privacy with its no-KYC policy, setting it apart from traditional exchanges. DTX contains rational features like fractional trading which means traders don’t need a lot of money to start investing. Traders can also use copy trading tools to follow experienced investors and learn their strategies. Source: DTX Exchange While DOGE and Ripple (XRP) are known for their strong communities, DTX is slowly building trust through its performance. Its token price has increased from initial $0.02 to $0.16, and the platform has raised over $12.8 million during its presale stages. DTX Exchange shows how new platforms are trying to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional trading. With its focus on offering diverse assets and practical tools, DTX could attract traders looking for something different in 2025. Final Thoughts As the Dogecoin price remains stable, Ripple (XRP) is growing in the payment sector. DTX Exchange is getting noticed for its new ideas. These three viral altcoins DOGE, XRP, and DTX could surge 250% this year, highlighting why they are attracting attention in 2025.
