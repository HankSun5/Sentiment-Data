TAO coin continues to trade higher, indicating growing adoption among crypto investors as AI development and machine learning progress. Despite this, the coin faces uncertainties and volatility like all other cryptocurrencies. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores its expected movements from 2026 to 2032 while considering the past performance. However, this is not investment advice, and one must conduct their own research before taking any investment decision according to their risk tolerance. Why is TAO up? TAO is up primarily due to buying interest from traders after some degree of bullish price action previously, mainly due to strong market sentiment surrounding speculative AI tokens and the AI industry at large. However, recent resistance near key support levels also played a role in the continuation of the bearish trend during the past week, but the token’s price has also increased today. How much is the Bittensor stock worth? Bittensor (TAO) powers the Bittensor Network and is not a stock. Stocks are usually traded on stock exchanges, and stock ownership represents a stake in a company. Buying TAO tokens gives the buyer certain rights within the Bittensor Network, for example, governance participation but not ownership in a company. However, Bittensor (TAO) tokens can be purchased and traded on different exchanges, including Binance, Bitget, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken. See our price analysis part for day-to-day price changes of the TAO token. What is the price prediction for TAO 2026? The highest Bittensor (TAO) price prediction for 2026 is around $365.38, but it is not easy to predict Bittensor price movements due to its volatile nature. Will Bittensor reach $1000? Yes, Bittensor should surpass $1000 by 2030. Its price will range between $1,055.54 and $1,177.33 during that period, which makes it a viable option to buy Bittensor tokens, considering the future performance and long-term trends, as decentralized AI development is expected to scale exponentially. What is the total supply of Bittensor? The total supply of Bittensor (TAO) tokens is 21 million TAO. Does Bittensor have a good long-term future? According to most market observers, Bittensor TAO will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

Bittensor (TAO) historic price sentiment TAO price history by Coingecko TAO launched on March 6, 2023, at $93.4, but fell below its opening price within a week, sliding into the $76 range. By early April, it had lost half its value, dropping to $47, and continued downward to its $30.83 low in May before slowly recovering to $63 by the end of the month. The token climbed to $86.18 in July, just under its launch price, then pulled back again and traded near $54 through October. Momentum returned in November, pushing TAO into the $95 range, showing continuous improvement, and then sharply to a peak of $379 on December 15, 2023. TAO trended downward into early 2024 but surged to its all-time high of $757.60 in March. It quickly corrected to $522 in April and continued weakening through mid-year, reaching $216 in July. A brief rebound to $357 faded again as the token slipped back toward the mid-$200s by late summer, as per the crypto market price history records. Momentum returned in October, pushing TAO into the $660 range before cooling to $468. It climbed once more to $679 in November but ultimately closed 2024 at $440.69, as the broader crypto market turned bearish again. TAO opened in 2025 at $439.73, peaked at $565 in January, and its price decreased to the $324 level in February, taking down the token’s market capitalization as the technical indicators turned bearish due to some fundamental factors. In March, TAO dipped to the $259 mark and descended further to $228 in April; however, in May, it recovered to $467 as the Bittensor market revived. In October, TAO observed its year’s lowest prices extending toward $200.44. TAO opened trading in November at $506, lost 46% of its value, and closed the month at $269.11, while at the start of December, the coin was trading between $256.29 and $298.90. At the start of January 2026, TAO was trading near the $223 range, as the market shifted towards the bearish side. In February, TAO has plunged below the psychological level of $200, as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|Bittensor|TAO,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|BITTENSOR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-02-21 20:00:00

However, an interesting on-chain development suggests that the Bitcoin price could likely see a relief soon, but only after a certain condition has been met. Realized Profits Show Warning Pattern That Precedes Defined Moves In a recent Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, on-chain analyst MorenoDV revealed that Bitcoin whales have realized more than $208 million in profits. As shown by the Realized Profit By Whales metric, this event — where over $200 million is taken as profit by members of this cohort — marks the seventh such occurrence over the past two years. Related Reading: XRP’s Brutal Supply Compression Signals A Repeat Of The 2024 Expansion Notably, these spikes in profits-taken have not occurred without any impact on price; instead, they have often been followed by market turbulence, which has also mostly preceded the formation of local bottoms. This suggests that large-scale selling from seasoned holders tends to introduce temporary liquidity imbalances. After the supply created by these whales is absorbed, it often leads to price stabilization. Interestingly, this stability has often preceded bullish reversals in the Bitcoin price. However, there have also been a few instances where such profit-taking among this investor cohort coincided with the establishment of local tops. Nonetheless, MorenoDV explained that this profit-taking behavior among the Bitcoin whales typically signals conviction, due to the behavioral consistency of this investor class. As such, these large investors rarely sell impulsively, but when they do, “it signals conviction about near-term price exhaustion or strategic repositioning.” Hence, if history is anything to go by, the analyst explained that the Bitcoin market stands a high chance of experiencing turbulence in the near-term. However, this also comes with the inference that the Bitcoin price is closer to a local exhaustion point than to the start of a bearish market cycle. If institutional flows, or even mid-sized holders, begin accumulating at current levels, the market could interpret this as a healthy rotation, which could in turn translate into bullish momentum. On the other hand, if demand should remain insufficient or if more market participants sell their holdings, downside pressure could be amplified, thereby pushing prices further south. Bitcoin Price At A Glance At the time of writing, the price of BTC stands at around $67,960, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

Businesses and financial institutions seek faster, cheaper, and more efficient ways to move money internationally, creating an opportunity for innovative solutions to reshape the global financial infrastructure. Blockchain analyst Wilberforce Theophilus recently highlighted on X how XRP could serve as the bridge that unlocks this trapped capital. According to Wilberforce, XRP’s design allows it to streamline payments, reduce settlement times, and create real economic value by acting as a bridge currency for fiat transactions worldwide. Unlocking Dormant Global Liquidity Wilberforce explains that trillions of dollars sit dormant in nostro and vostro accounts, pre-funded solely to facilitate international payments. XRP’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solves this inefficiency by instantly converting local fiat into XRP, sending it across borders, and reconverting it into the destination currency. WHY XRP WILL POWER THE WORLD. -On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): Over $27 trillion is trapped in dormant global liquidity, money sitting idle in pre-funded nostro and vostro accounts just to handle cross-border payments. XRP is going to Change that. No more pre-funding nostro… — Wilberforce Theophilus (@Eze_Wilberforce) February 20, 2026 This mechanism allows banks to free up previously locked capital, which can then be deployed for lending, investment, and other productive economic activities. Contrary to claims that XRP’s supply is too large, Wilberforce argues that as global adoption grows, demand will surge, making the available supply increasingly valuable as a bridge asset. Fast, Low-Cost Cross-Border Payments Theophilus highlights XRP Ledger’s speed and efficiency. Transactions settle in just three to five seconds with minimal fees, a dramatic improvement over traditional systems like SWIFT, which often take days to complete a transfer. XRP’s instant currency conversion minimizes friction and mitigates currency risk, benefiting remittance providers, fintechs, and banks using RippleNet and ODL daily. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By functioning as a bridge asset, XRP simplifies global payments and accelerates settlement. Real-world adoption already demonstrates its value, as institutions rely on XRP for live cross-border transactions and liquidity management. Transforming Global Financial Infrastructure Wilberforce emphasizes that XRP’s potential extends beyond incremental efficiency gains. As adoption grows, it could become a foundational tool for global payments, supporting trillions of dollars in daily international transactions. Its scalability, speed, and low cost make it uniquely positioned to integrate legacy banking systems with next-generation digital finance. By unlocking trapped liquidity, enabling instant settlements, and providing a practical bridge for fiat, XRP is positioned not just as a cryptocurrency but as a transformative financial instrument. Wilberforce’s analysis underscores that XRP’s operational and technical advantages may allow it to power global finance, bridging the gap between traditional and digital monetary systems.

The mixed signals matter because they show a split between falling market sentiment and activity metrics that suggest users have not abandoned the chain. Security Patch Delays and Infrastructure Concerns A February 19 report from Santiment noted that a significant source of recent frustration for the Solana community stems from a critical security scare in January. Client maintainers urged validators to upgrade to Agave/Jito v3.0.14 after disclosing vulnerabilities that could crash nodes and threaten consensus integrity. Tim Garcia of the Solana Foundation urged operators to update quickly, but reports at the time said over half of validators were still on older versions, exposing the chain to potential risks. This operational friction resurfaced in February when a network disruption rerouted U.S. traffic through Europe and Asia. While infrastructure providers like DoubleZero noted that such rerouting is a normal part of internet networking, for validators operating a high-speed chain, milliseconds matter. These events have forced the market to pay closer attention to how smoothly Solana’s decentralized validator set can respond to pressure, as that response directly affects uptime and the safety of funds moving through DeFi. The uncertainty is reflecting on SOL’s price, which earlier in the month fell 25% in a week to about $96, with analysts such as Ali Martinez warning that losing the $100 zone could open a path toward $74 or even $50. At the time of writing, the asset was trading around the $84 level, down about 35% over the past month and more than 51% year-on-year. Shorter time frames show mild relief, with gains near 3% in 24 hours and about 6% in seven days, per CoinGecko data. Technical indicators remain mixed. Some traders say a breakdown near $80 confirmed a bearish chart pattern, while others see a shorter-term setup that could push prices back toward $114 if resistance clears. Santiment added that deeply negative funding rates suggest many traders are betting against SOL, a setup that sometimes comes right before short squeezes. Activity Growth Contrasts With Fading Hype Despite the price pressure, Santiment reported rising daily wallet creation in February. That metric tracks new addresses interacting with the network and suggests ongoing user interest even in the face of weakening sentiment. Exchange data also shows outflows exceeding inflows in recent weeks, a sign that some holders are moving tokens off trading platforms rather than preparing to sell. Nevertheless, the current mood contrasts with earlier cycles that defined Solana’s culture. According to Santiment, traders still reference past events such as NFT booms, meme coin launches, and exchange-related shocks that once dominated online discussion. More recently, app builder Zora shifted a new product from Base to Solana, charging about 1 SOL per creation, which sparked debate about incentives but also signaled ongoing developer interest. Ultimately, Solana’s is a layered picture, with prices and online attention having fallen since late 2025, yet new wallets, active builders, and crowded short positions showing that participation has not disappeared.

Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR found resistance at $340 causing a decline back to $328. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero recently reached a new all-time high of $798 before experiencing a sharp correction. The privacy-focused blockchain is expected to stabilize and potentially recover as it continues to reduce technical debt and enhance its utility and privacy features. However, widespread adoption may be hindered by regulatory scrutiny and market volatility, keeping the asset highly speculative. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2031, is expected to reach a minimum of $463.56, while averaging $726.61. The maximum projected value is $989.65. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low.

That move reversed an earlier drop of 10% that followed widespread outages in parts of the US. The numbers are blunt: machines went quiet during extreme weather, then came back online, and the protocol rebalanced itself. Winter Outages And The Bounce Back Foundry USA’s pool saw a dramatic swing in computing power, falling near 198 EH/s before climbing from roughly 400 EH/s. Reports say that many operators in affected regions shut down temporarily during the winter storms to protect equipment and help grids. Some of the spaces that host miners coordinated with utilities. Power was conserved. Power was redirected. Flexible Power Deals Changed The Game Reports note that several miners did more than pause operations. LM Funding America reported curtailing machines and sending contracted power back to the grid, pocketing curtailment payments that helped offset lost mining time. Canaan Inc. also said its US sites took part in demand response moves with local partners. These arrangements are part of why many facilities can afford to go offline when the grid needs relief, then restart when conditions improve. What Higher Difficulty Means Bitcoin’s difficulty is designed to reset every 2,016 blocks to hold average block times close to the 10-minute target. When more hash power returns, the algorithm raises difficulty . That makes the network harder to attack and raises the work needed to win a block reward. For miners, higher difficulty reduces the Bitcoin earned per unit of compute, squeezing margins for outfits with older rigs or higher electricity bills. Price Moves Stay Tied To Headlines Bitcoin traded near $68,000 as markets reacted to rising geopolitical strain, especially between the US and Iran. Trading has felt cautious. Volume is lighter. Prices have bounced and then stalled on headline-driven flows, showing that investor mood still swings with global news. At the same time, network metrics kept shifting under the surface — a reminder that technical and macro drivers can pull in different directions. The US now supplies a big chunk of global hash power, according to Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. That means regional events, weather, and grid policies in the US matter a lot to global security and miner economics. Some firms have begun to treat mining as a flexible load that can stabilize grids during stress, creating new income streams beyond pure block rewards. Politics And Market Tone Comments from politicians and geopolitical moves add friction. Mentions of US President Donald Trump in recent headlines have been tied to broader market nervousness ; geopolitics can pull risk appetite downward and keep crypto prices range-bound. The difficulty rebound itself didn’t spark a big price jump. Instead, it reinforced a simple truth: the protocol handled the shock, but miners felt the squeeze.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-proponent-says-clarity-act-is-huge-for-xrp-heres-why/,"The cryptocurrency industry has spent years operating under regulatory uncertainty. Developers have built networks, investors have allocated capital, and institutions have tested blockchain solutions while lawmakers debated definitions and oversight. As U.S. policymakers advance comprehensive digital asset legislation, the market now stands at a pivotal moment where regulatory clarity could reshape competitive dynamics across the sector. Crypto commentator Caesar recently argued on X that the proposed Clarity Act represents a major turning point for XRP . He contends that the bill matters for XRP not because the asset requires rescue, but because clearer rules could amplify an advantage XRP has already secured through prior legal scrutiny and market positioning. CLARITY Act is huge for $XRP Not because it needs it Because while everyone else is filing paperwork, XRP is already in the room — Caesar (@caesarnodes) February 20, 2026 The Regulatory Landscape Is Shifting Lawmakers designed the Clarity Act to define how U.S. regulators classify and oversee digital assets. The legislation seeks to clarify the roles of agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, reducing ambiguity that has slowed institutional participation. Clear classification standards would allow projects to understand compliance requirements without relying on case-by-case enforcement actions. XRP occupies a distinct place in this evolving environment. In 2023, a federal court ruled that XRP itself does not qualify as a security when traded on secondary markets. That judicial determination provided a level of clarity that many other digital assets still lack. While regulatory discussions continue, XRP already operates within a partially defined legal framework. Legal Precedent as Strategic Advantage Caesar’s perspective centers on timing and preparedness. If the Clarity Act becomes law, many blockchain projects may need to file disclosures, restructure offerings, or adjust governance models to align with statutory definitions. XRP, however, has already endured extensive legal examination and maintained operational continuity throughout high-profile litigation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 That history may now serve as a competitive advantage. Institutions typically prioritize regulatory certainty before allocating capital or integrating blockchain infrastructure. XRP’s prior courtroom validation reduces perceived compliance risk, potentially making it more attractive in a regulated environment. Institutional Readiness and Market Position Ripple, the enterprise-focused technology company associated with XRP’s payment use cases, has spent years building partnerships centered on cross-border transactions and liquidity solutions. Financial institutions evaluating blockchain tools often seek assets that combine technical utility with clearer legal status. If lawmakers finalize comprehensive digital asset regulations, institutions could accelerate the adoption of assets that already meet established legal benchmarks. Caesar suggests that while other projects prepare paperwork and adjust structures, XRP may already meet many of the standards policymakers aim to codify. As regulatory clarity approaches, the conversation shifts from uncertainty to readiness. Caesar frames the Clarity Act as a development that could highlight XRP’s legal groundwork and institutional integration, positioning it to compete effectively in a fully regulated digital asset marketplace.

Speaking at The Indian Express AI Summit, Altman dismissed viral claims about ChatGPT’s water usage as “totally fake” and “completely untrue,” sparking renewed debate about how society measures technological progress against ecological responsibility. Debunking the ChatGPT Water Consumption Myth Altman specifically addressed circulating internet claims suggesting each ChatGPT query consumes approximately 17 gallons of water. He labeled these assertions “totally insane” with “no connection to reality.” The OpenAI executive explained that such figures originated from outdated data center cooling methods no longer in widespread use. Modern facilities employ advanced cooling technologies that dramatically reduce water consumption. However, Altman acknowledged legitimate concerns about AI’s aggregate energy footprint. He emphasized that the real issue involves total energy consumption across global AI systems rather than individual query metrics. The Energy Reality of Modern AI Systems Data centers powering AI systems have become significant electricity consumers. Recent studies indicate AI-related computation could account for 3-5% of global electricity by 2030. Unlike traditional computing, AI requires specialized hardware and continuous operation for both training and inference phases. Training large language models like GPT-4 involves thousands of specialized processors running for months. Inference—the process of generating responses to user queries—requires constant computational resources across global server networks. Despite these demands, efficiency improvements have been substantial. Modern AI chips deliver 10-100 times more computation per watt than those from just five years ago. Comparative Energy Analysis: AI Versus Human Intelligence Altman introduced a novel perspective during his Mumbai presentation. He argued that comparing AI energy consumption to human energy use provides more meaningful context. “It takes like 20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart,” Altman noted. He extended this comparison to humanity’s evolutionary development, suggesting that assessing AI’s efficiency requires considering the complete energy investment in human education and biological development. According to this framework, AI might already demonstrate superior energy efficiency for specific cognitive tasks once initial training costs are amortized across billions of queries. The Renewable Energy Imperative Regardless of efficiency debates, Altman stressed the urgent need for cleaner energy infrastructure. “The world needs to move towards nuclear or wind and solar very quickly,” he declared. This position aligns with growing industry consensus. Major technology companies increasingly power data centers with renewable sources. Microsoft and Google have committed to 100% renewable energy for their cloud operations by 2025. Nuclear energy, particularly next-generation small modular reactors, has gained attention as a potential solution for providing reliable, carbon-free power to energy-intensive computing facilities. Transparency Challenges in Tech Energy Reporting A significant obstacle in assessing AI’s environmental impact involves limited corporate transparency. No legal requirements currently mandate technology companies to disclose detailed energy and water consumption data. Consequently, researchers must rely on estimates and reverse engineering. Independent studies suggest AI model training can consume electricity equivalent to hundreds of homes for a year. However, companies rarely release specific figures, making accurate assessment difficult. This opacity fuels both exaggerated claims and genuine uncertainty about AI’s ecological footprint. The Data Center Electricity Price Connection Beyond environmental concerns, data center expansion affects electricity markets. Regions with concentrated computing infrastructure sometimes experience upward pressure on local electricity prices. This occurs because data centers represent large, consistent electricity demands that can strain grid capacity. Utility companies must invest in additional generation and transmission infrastructure, costs often passed to all consumers. Some municipalities now consider special electricity rates for data centers to mitigate community impacts while encouraging economic development. Historical Context: Evolving Data Center Efficiency Data center energy efficiency has improved dramatically over the past decade. The industry transitioned from traditional evaporative cooling to advanced systems using outside air, liquid cooling, and AI-optimized temperature management. Power usage effectiveness—a metric comparing total facility energy to IT equipment energy—has decreased from averages above 2.0 to approximately 1.2 for state-of-the-art facilities. These improvements mean modern data centers deliver substantially more computation per unit of energy and water than their predecessors. However, absolute consumption continues rising due to exponential growth in computing demand. Expert Perspectives on AI Energy Debates Energy researchers offer nuanced views on AI’s environmental impact. Dr. Emma Strubell, a computer scientist specializing in AI sustainability, notes that while individual query energy might be minimal, aggregate effects matter. “We must consider scale,” she explains. “If ChatGPT serves billions of queries daily, even efficient systems consume significant energy.” Other experts emphasize that AI could indirectly reduce energy consumption by optimizing logistics, transportation, and industrial processes. The net environmental impact thus depends on both direct energy use and efficiency gains enabled by AI applications. The Bill Gates Comparison Clarified During his Mumbai appearance, Altman addressed a specific comparison suggesting a single ChatGPT query uses energy equivalent to 1.5 iPhone battery charges. He dismissed this estimate, stating, “There’s no way it’s anything close to that much.” While precise figures remain undisclosed, available data suggests typical AI queries consume energy comparable to several minutes of smartphone use rather than multiple full charges. This clarification highlights the challenge of communicating technical energy concepts through accessible analogies that sometimes oversimplify complex realities. Future Directions: Sustainable AI Development The technology industry increasingly prioritizes sustainability alongside capability improvements. Research focuses on several approaches: Algorithmic efficiency: Developing AI models that achieve similar performance with fewer computations Hardware specialization: Designing processors optimized specifically for AI workloads Renewable integration: Locating data centers near renewable energy sources Carbon-aware computing: Scheduling intensive computations when renewable generation peaks Lifecycle assessment: Considering environmental impacts across hardware manufacturing, operation, and disposal Conclusion Sam Altman’s Mumbai remarks highlight the complex relationship between artificial intelligence development and environmental sustainability. While dismissing exaggerated claims about AI’s resource consumption, Altman acknowledges legitimate concerns about aggregate energy use. His call for accelerated renewable energy adoption reflects growing industry recognition that technological progress must align with ecological responsibility. The debate continues about appropriate metrics for comparing AI and human efficiency, but consensus emerges around the need for greater transparency, continued efficiency improvements, and cleaner energy infrastructure to support AI’s expanding role in society. FAQs Q1: How much energy does a single ChatGPT query actually use? OpenAI hasn’t released exact figures, but estimates suggest typical queries consume minimal energy—likely equivalent to several minutes of smartphone use rather than the exaggerated claims of 17 gallons of water or multiple device charges. Q2: What did Sam Altman say about AI’s water consumption? Altman called viral claims about ChatGPT’s water usage “totally fake” and explained they’re based on outdated cooling methods. Modern data centers use advanced cooling systems with dramatically reduced water requirements. Q3: Why does Altman compare AI energy use to human energy consumption? He argues this provides fairer context, noting humans require decades of food, education, and evolutionary development. Comparing trained AI systems to educated humans might show AI’s superior energy efficiency for specific tasks. Q4: What energy solutions does Altman recommend for AI development? He advocates rapid adoption of nuclear, wind, and solar power to meet growing AI energy demands sustainably, aligning with broader industry moves toward renewable-powered data centers. Q5: How have data centers improved their energy efficiency? Modern facilities achieve power usage effectiveness ratings around 1.2 (compared to 2.0+ a decade ago) through advanced cooling, AI-optimized management, specialized hardware, and renewable energy integration.

On the standard view, the downtrend remains intact until key resistance is reclaimed, making the current optimism conditional. Inverted Structure Reinforces Ethereum Bearish HTF Outlook Presenting an inverted chart in a recent update, Mizer explained that he has been short on Ethereum for several days, outlining what he believes could unfold on the higher time frame (HTF). Mizer clarified that this doesn’t necessarily plan to hold the full position to his projected targets, as he prefers focusing on lower time frame (LTF) opportunities given the difficulty of forecasting HTF moves in the current macro environment. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Bounce Still Lacks Conviction — Downside Risk Remains According to Mizer, Ethereum’s HTF structure remains clear: a distribution phase followed by consistent breakdowns since the $5,000 peak. A parabolic curve formed off that top is a key indicator of this pattern, noting that the price has respected it for months. Until that parabola is decisively broken and price holds above it, the broader downtrend remains intact. Zooming into the current price action, Mizer highlighted a strong impulse move into this zone marked by a purple line. This area represents a significant support/resistance flip on the inverted chart: previously resistance, it was broken and now functions as support. Mizer is now closely watching the small blue box on the right side of the chart, which represents the current consolidation following the impulse. Two Scenarios From Consolidation The analyst further explained that from the current consolidation zone, there are two primary scenarios unfolding: either continuation after a shallow pullback, or a brief fake breakdown followed by a swift reclaim before the next leg higher on the inverted chart, which would translate to further downside for ETH itself. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces High-Stakes Moment at $2,200 as Whale Longs Clash With Bearish Flow Data He described the purple path on his chart as his “ideal” bullish scenario on the inverted structure, essentially tracking price as it continues to respect the long-standing parabolic curve. As long as that parabola remains intact, the broader bearish trajectory remains his base case. Regarding targets, he divided expectations into short- and long-term objectives. The immediate target sits around $1,700, which he views as the first logical area to take profits and monitor for a potential reaction strong enough to challenge or even break the parabolic resistance. The final target lies near $1,400, representing the larger extension if momentum fully plays out. However, he emphasized that the setup would be invalidated if ETH loses the key flip zone and begins accepting below it on the inverted chart, a move that would break the parabola and potentially signal a broader trend reversal.

Retail investors stepped in and bought $1.0 billion of stock. That makes five straight weeks of buying from everyday traders. Hedge funds also added exposure. They purchased $1.2 billion, logging their eighth buying week out of the last nine. Big money sold. Smaller players and fast money bought. Institutions offload US stocks just as dumb money and hedge funds absorb supply Equity ETFs saw $2.2 billion in inflows during the same week. At the same time, single stock names recorded $8.3 billion in outflows. Investors favored broad funds over individual companies. The gap between ETF inflows and single-name withdrawals was clear. Single stock outflows have now happened in 13 of the past 15 weeks. Total withdrawals over that stretch equal $52.0 billion. Institutions are selling directly into bids from retail traders and hedge funds. The flow data shows a steady transfer of ownership. Retail demand after the Supreme Court ruling stayed limited. At 10 a.m. ET, the high court said President Donald Trump wrongly used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose reciprocal tariffs. Traders reacted fast. Major averages jumped, dropped, then recovered within hours. The Nasdaq Composite is trying to end a five-week losing streak. By midday Friday, the index was up 0.8%. That brought its weekly gain to 1.4%. If it holds, the technology-heavy index will break its longest run of weekly losses since May 2022. Markets brace for tariffs, Iran risk, and Nvidia results After the ruling, Trump said he will impose a new 10% “global tariff” using other trade laws. Stocks reacted in stages on Friday. Tim Holland, chief investment officer at Orion Wealth Management, wrote, “It would seem that Wall Street and Main Street are going to be dealing with the issue of trade and tariffs for some time to come.” Tim focused on the ongoing policy risk facing markets. The Supreme Court did not address whether importers will receive refunds for tariffs already paid under steeper rates. The issue now returns to the lower courts. Ed Mills, managing director and Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, wrote , “We expect that the process for firms to receive tariff refunds will be lengthy and challenging, with litigants needing to bring individual cases or participate in class action.” Future tariffs may not be as broad unless Congress provides backing. If inflation eases, the Federal Reserve could gain room to cut interest rates. Traders are also watching geopolitical risk. Trump will deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress. Barclays’ trading desk said the speech may include an ultimatum to Iran. Meanwhile, Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday, and since the company is one of only two Magnificent Seven names posting a stock gain this year, expectations are high. Analysts want strong revenue and higher forecasts tied to artificial intelligence spending. Cryptopolitan will be reporting the earnings post live on February 25.

Optimism price prediction for 2029 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.40. In 2032, OP tokens will range between $2.10 and $4.60, with an average value of $3.05. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2026 – 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.1294 Market Cap $274.11M Trading Volume $130.03M Circulating Supply 2.117B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2519 (Dec 26, 2025) 24-hour High $0.1347 24-hour Low $0.1271 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 23.24% (Extremely High) 50-Day SMA $0.2665 14-Day RSI 21.92 (Oversold) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 8 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $0.4410 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is down by more than 35% from its recent swing high and by more than 50% from early February levels. On the 4-hour chart, the trend remains bearish below $0.136. Unless the $0.150 level is reclaimed, downside toward $0.120 remains open. Optimism 1-day price chart On the 1-day chart (February 21, 2026), OP is trading around $0.1290, barely green on the session at +0.31%, but structurally weak. The coin’s price has broken below the lower Bollinger Band at $0.1322, while the basis sits higher near $0.1838 and the upper band at $0.2354, showing how stretched the downtrend has become. From the recent local high near $0.200, OP has dropped roughly 35%, and from the early February region around $0.260, the decline exceeds 50%, confirming a persistent bearish trajectory rather than a simple pullback. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Candles continue to print lower highs and lower lows, and there is no meaningful bullish rejection at current levels. The MACD remains negative at -0.0030, with the signal line deeper at -0.0289, and although histogram momentum briefly attempted a recovery mid-month, it has rolled over again. Unless price reclaims $0.150 quickly, the path of least resistance remains toward the $0.120–$0.115 zone, where psychological and prior wick support may attempt to stabilize price. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP trades around $0.1288, still compressed under the Alligator lines, which are fully opened downward (jaw near $0.1456, teeth around $0.1366, lips at $0.1316). This alignment confirms the continuation of the trend rather than consolidation. The price remains capped below $0.1316, meaning short-term rallies are being sold into. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI sits deeply oversold near 22.9, having dipped below 20 earlier, which signals exhaustion but not reversal. The recent bounce attempts have been weak and lack follow-through, forming tight candles rather than impulsive bullish structures. If $0.125 fails, acceleration toward $0.120 becomes highly probable; conversely, only a strong reclaim of $0.136–$0.145 would signal that bears are losing control. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2035 SELL SMA 5 $0.1910 SELL SMA 10 $0.1816 SELL SMA 21 $0.1926 SELL SMA 50 $0.2665 SELL SMA 100 $0.2942 SELL SMA 200 $0.4410 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2157 SELL EMA 5 $0.2418 SELL EMA 10 $0.2673 SELL EMA 21 $0.2805 SELL EMA 50 $0.3103 SELL EMA 100 $0.3829 SELL EMA 200 $0.5251 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Across both timeframes, OP remains in a confirmed downtrend with momentum aligned to the downside. The 4-hour shows oversold conditions that could trigger a short-term relief bounce, but the daily structure suggests any rally is corrective unless $0.150 is reclaimed decisively. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

He said the token is not an inflation hedge and called it a “pseudo-asset class.” Bitcoin traded around 67,400 dollars on Wednesday, down 45 percent from its late-October high. He wrote, “Calling Bitcoin or any other crypto vehicle a ‘currency’ has always been bogus. Roubini also said Bitcoin has been tied to “the mother of all bubbles” and a “Ponzi Game.” Nouriel pointed to its use in illegal transactions and said crypto can put the financial system in danger as lawmakers push it into banks. He mocked the GENIUS Act and said the bill should be called the “Reckless Idiot Act.” The part that bothered Nouriel most is the lack of lender-of-last-resort support and no deposit insurance for stablecoins. He warned that some industry voices want interest paid on stablecoins, which he said could “undermine the foundations of the banking system.” Market losses hit Bitcoin as investors pull back The world’s biggest token has dropped more than 40 percent from its peak. Dip buyers are missing. Usual support is gone. Gold is winning the hedge fight. Stablecoins are beating Bitcoin in payments. Prediction markets are taking over speculation. None of this happened because regulators crushed it. Washington has been friendly. Big firms have joined in. Wall Street has treated it like a real asset. Bitcoin got everything it wanted but the price still fell. Robert Kiyosaki said, “Although Bitcoin is crashing I bought one more whole Bitcoin for 67k. Why? Two reasons: #1: Because the Big Print will begin when the US debt crashes the dollar and ‘The Marxist Fed’ begins printing trillions in fake dollars. #2: The magical 21 millionth Bitcoin is getting close to being mined. When the 21st millionth Bitcoin is mined… Bitcoin becomes better than gold.” His view stands in sharp contrast to Nouriel, but it captures how divided this crypto moment is. Flows move to gold as Bitcoin questions get louder Despite global tension and a weak dollar, gold and silver have jumped while crypto has fallen.US gold ETFs pulled in more than 16 billion dollars in the last three months. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw about 3.3 billion dollars in outflows. Market cap has dropped by more than 1 trillion dollars.The digital-asset treasury model, once a big selling point, has cracked. Companies like Strategy, MARA, Metaplanet, and GameStop bought Bitcoin, issued shares, and created a loop that boosted their value. That loop has now turned.

The fund comes as the broader cryptocurrency market faces a severe downturn, with token prices declining and investor enthusiasm weakened. $650 Million Fund Dragonfly’s previous fund, its third, deployed $500 million into startups such as Polymarket, Rain, and Ethena. The new $650 million vehicle aims to continue that trajectory and will provide capital for the firm to pursue early-stage investments at a time when the crypto venture sector is experiencing a slowdown as deal activity declines and firms face challenges in raising additional capital from investors, according to Fortune. Speaking about the latest development, co-founder Haseeb Qureshi commented , “We talk out loud and we say what we think. In a space that is just completely flooded with bulls**t and with fakers and self-promoters, I think that has actually been a superpower.” The firm’s investments have included Layer 1 blockchain projects such as Avalanche, financial services firms like Amber Group, and other crypto projects. Besides, Dragonfly’s operations have continued through multiple market disruptions, such as the collapse of the Terra Luna ecosystem, the FTX bankruptcy, and a move away from China amid a local crypto crackdown. Scrutiny Linked to Tornado Cash Investment It has also faced regulatory scrutiny from the Department of Justice (DOJ). In July 2025, prosecutors informed a federal judge that they were considering criminal charges against employees of the crypto venture firm, including general partner Tom Schmidt, in relation to the 2020 investment in Tornado Cash. The statement was made by prosecutor Nathan Rehn to District Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York during a break in the trial of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, who was later convicted of operating an unlicensed money transmission. Dragonfly co-founder Haseeb Qureshi clarified that the firm has fully cooperated with the government investigation, which began in 2023. He had then stated that if charges are filed, they intend to defend themselves. The Justice Department later backtracked, and no charges were filed against Schmidt.

One week it is Bitcoin news driving headlines. The next week, it is Ethereum upgrades stealing the spotlight. Yields pop up at random percentages. Referral bonuses appear without context. Many projects select numbers that look attractive but lack deeper meaning. Meanwhile, Bitcoin price today trends across search engines, and Ethereum innovation keeps expanding decentralized finance. Investors scan charts, yet few projects anchor their metrics to a real narrative. APEMARS changes that script. Instead of arbitrary percentages, every figure reflects Mars itself. From a 63% APY tied to Martian temperature to referral rewards echoing orbital eccentricity, the numbers tell a mission-driven story. Currently in Stage 9 at $0.00007841, APEMARS has raised over 215K, sold more than 11.5B tokens, and attracted over 1,010 holders. With a transparent listing target of $0.0055, the structured pricing gap defines positioning. That approach is why many analysts now describe it as the best crypto presale. APEMARS ($APRZ): The Best Crypto Presale Where Every Number Has a Mission APEMARS stands out as the best crypto presale because its metrics carry purpose. Built on Ethereum using the ERC-20 standard, $APRZ integrates seamlessly with major wallets and decentralized exchanges. The presale is currently in Stage 9 at $0.00007841. The intended listing price is $0.0055, creating a clearly defined pricing structure. Over 215K has been raised, and more than 11.5B tokens have already been sold. The modeled ROI from Stage 9 to listing reflects a 6,914.41% positioning gap based on the structured pricing framework. The Viral Referral System rewards both participants with 9.34%, inspired by Mars’ orbital eccentricity. High-Yield Staking delivers 63% APY, referencing Mars’ average temperature of minus 63 degrees Celsius. Structured burn events occur at Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23, reducing unsold supply at defined checkpoints. The upcoming Stage 10 price increases by 16.45% to $0.00009131. This stage-based model rewards earlier access through lower pricing while preserving long-term mission momentum. 1K Strategic Allocation: What Stage 9 Pricing Means Before the Next Surge A 1,000-dollar allocation at Stage 9 pricing of $0.00007841 secures over 12.7 million tokens before the next scheduled increase. With Stage 10 moving to $0.00009131, early positioning captures immediate structural upside. If the intended listing price of $0.0055 is achieved, the predefined gap highlights substantial theoretical upside relative to entry. Early joiners from previous stages already reflect a 361.50% progression through Stage 9 advancement alone. The model rewards timing, patience, and structured participation rather than speculation alone. Enter the Red Planet Mission: How to Secure APEMARS Before Stage 10 Activates Participation begins by connecting a compatible Ethereum wallet to the official APEMARS presale dashboard. After selecting a contribution amount, confirm the transaction on-chain. Tokens remain allocated until the post-presale claim phase. Pricing advances automatically once a stage allocation sells out or the weekly cycle ends. This transparent mechanism ensures fairness and predictable progression. With Stage 10 approaching at $0.00009131, availability at Stage 9 pricing remains limited by time and allocation thresholds. Bitcoin ($BTC): The Digital Gold Standard Powering Market Cycles Bitcoin remains the foundation of digital assets. It introduced decentralized scarcity and established the store-of-value model that reshaped finance. Recent Bitcoin news highlights institutional participation and ETF-driven exposure. Bitcoin price today reflects macro conditions, liquidity cycles, and global risk appetite. Its capped supply of 21 million coins reinforces long-term scarcity mechanics. Despite volatility, Bitcoin continues to anchor the broader crypto market. Developers prioritize security and decentralization over rapid experimentation. That deliberate pace strengthens credibility. While Bitcoin does not offer staking yields or referral systems, its predictable issuance and proof-of-work design provide structural reliability that newer projects seek to complement rather than replace. Ethereum ($ETH): The Smart Contract Engine Behind Modern Crypto Expansion Ethereum powers decentralized finance, NFTs, and thousands of ERC-20 tokens. Its transition to proof-of-stake introduced staking rewards and improved energy efficiency. Developers rely on Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities to create programmable financial systems. Ongoing scaling solutions strengthen throughput and reduce transaction congestion. Ethereum price trends often influence broader altcoin sentiment. Discussions sometimes compare Ethereum developments with topics like Cardano price prediction or Cardano 2025 price outlooks. However, Ethereum maintains the largest developer ecosystem and deep liquidity pools. That infrastructure supports projects like APEMARS, which depend on security, transparency, and reliable network architecture. Conclusion Bitcoin and Ethereum continue shaping market direction. Bitcoin news drives macro narratives, while Ethereum expands smart contract capabilities. In this environment, the Best crypto presale conversation increasingly favors structured models over arbitrary tokenomics. According to discussions often highlighted on “best crypto to buy now,” Bitcoin and Ethereum remain pillars, yet early-stage frameworks attract strategic positioning interest alongside established assets. APEMARS leverages that environment through measurable stage progression. Stage 9 pricing at $0.00007841 remains active before the planned $0.0055 listing benchmark. Over 215K raised and more than 11.5B tokens sold demonstrate traction. The 63% APY, 9.34% referral structure, and scheduled burns reinforce narrative consistency. For readers researching structured early-stage opportunities, platforms such as best crypto to buy now frequently analyze APEMARS alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum coverage, presenting comparative insights for informed decision-making. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official APEMARS Website Telegram: Join the APEMARS Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow APEMARS ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions What makes APEMARS different from other presales?

With XRP’s long history in the cryptocurrency market and its already substantial appreciation since launch, many holders still question whether significant upside is still possible for those entering at current price levels. The token is currently trading around $1.44, and this has shifted the discussion from past performance to future scenarios and whether these projected price milestones could realistically turn modest investments into retirement-level capital. XRP’s Progress Since Launch XRP has already established itself as one of the strongest digital assets in the industry. Since it began trading in 2013, the token has recorded cumulative gains exceeding 24,000%, according to data aggregated by CoinMarketCap. Early participants who accumulated XRP at fractions of a cent realized extraordinary returns as prices climbed into multi-dollar territory. A relatively small five-figure investment made near launch would now be valued in the millions. However, replicating that scale of growth from today’s market capitalization presents a much steeper challenge. Projected Prices for a Retirement Portfolio At current prices, a $1,000 investment in XRP would purchase approximately 704 tokens, while a $2,000 allocation would yield about 1,408 tokens. Whether these holdings could eventually support retirement depends not only on how high XRP’s price could rise, but also on how retirement needs differ across regions. In developed economies such as the United States, estimates often place the required retirement capital near $1.5 million, accounting for healthcare costs, inflation, and limited pension coverage. Comparable figures are seen in the United Kingdom and Canada, where comfortable retirement targets frequently exceed $1 million. In contrast, lower living costs in countries such as India reduce that threshold significantly, with estimates ranging between $360,000 and $600,000 depending on lifestyle and location. These benchmarks provide useful context when assessing XRP price projections. If XRP were to reach $100, a level frequently mentioned by bullish commentators, a 704 token holding would be valued at just over $70,000, while a 1,408 token holding would amount to roughly $140,000. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While significant, these sums fall well short of retirement requirements in most regions. Even at $500 per XRP, a $1,000 investment would grow to approximately $352,000, enough to approach financial independence only in a limited number of low-cost economies. Retirement-level outcomes become more plausible only under far more aggressive price assumptions. At $1,000 per XRP, a $1,000 investment would be worth roughly $704,000, while $2,000 invested today would exceed $1.4 million. At this level, retirement targets in many developed countries could be met. A $2,000 XRP price would double those figures again, placing even conservative investors comfortably above typical retirement thresholds. However, such valuations would imply a market capitalization far larger than XRP has ever achieved, raising questions about feasibility and timelines. Several market commentators have increased their ambitious long-term forecasts. Investor YoungHoon Kim has suggested that XRP could reach triple-digit prices within the next decade, while Alpha Lions Academy CEO Edoardo Farina has argued that prices in the hundreds may appear inexpensive in hindsight. Other analysts have floated four-figure valuations over longer horizons, though most acknowledge that such outcomes would require sustained institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and continued expansion of Ripple’s payments infrastructure through Ripple. Although XRP’s historical performance demonstrates that exceptional gains are possible in cryptocurrency markets, translating a $1,000 or $2,000 investment into retirement-level wealth would require extreme price appreciation that remains highly speculative.

Here’s The Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-whales-hit-record-milestone-heres-the-latest/,"XRP whales holding between 10 million and 100 million tokens have reached their largest share of the circulating supply in history. Data from market intelligence platform Santiment shows that this group now controls 17.04% of XRP’s supply, marking a significant increase from 12.21% in October 2025. This development follows a notable accumulation trend that began as market conditions turned bearish . Accumulation Campaign Intensifies Since October 2025, these top-tier whales have steadily expanded their holdings. Their cumulative balance rose from 7.89 billion XRP at the start of October to 11.06 billion tokens, amounting to an acquisition of 3.17 billion XRP valued at approximately $4.5 billion. This surge coincided with a period of significant market turbulence, indicating that these addresses may have been executing a deliberate “buy-the-dip” strategy . The most concentrated phase of this accumulation occurred over 20 days in November. Their combined holdings increased from 8.33 billion to 10.82 billion XRP, representing their sharpest purchasing activity to date. XRP Price Decline and Market Context XRP has experienced a prolonged downturn since August 2025, which intensified in October alongside broader market declines. XRP reached an all-time high of $3.66 in July 2025, but now trades at $1.42, down 61.2% from its peak. This period produced four consecutive bearish monthly candles. February is already showing a further 13.33% decline. Another red monthly candle will mark the first instance of five straight negative months since 2016 and 2017. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Redistribution Among Smaller Whales While the largest whales have been increasing their holdings, addresses with balances between 100,000 and 10 million XRP have been net sellers . Their combined holdings decreased from 13.12 billion XRP in October 2025 to 10.09 billion tokens at present, a reduction of approximately 3 billion XRP. Most of this reduction occurred within the 1 million to 10 million XRP tier, which contributed 2.8 billion tokens to the overall decline. November, the same month as the largest whale accumulation, saw the most significant reduction in these smaller whale balances, suggesting a possible transfer of tokens to larger holders. The data shows a phase of deliberate accumulation by the largest XRP holders, who have increased their control over the circulating supply during the market downturn. The contrasting behaviors across whale tiers reveal different approaches, with major holders consolidating their positions while smaller holders show less faith in the asset .

This downside volatility is believed to have been precipitated by the overleveraging in the BTC market at the time. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin derivatives market has witnessed a massive flush-out over the past week. BTC Market Now At Reduced Risk Of Liquidation Cascades In a fresh Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, trader CryptoOnchain revealed a dramatic flush-out in the Bitcoin derivatives market on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. The relevant indicator here is the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), which has seen a significant decline in recent weeks. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Could Be Headed For Another Drop: Research Firm Cites Three Key Risks The Estimated Leverage Ratio is an on-chain metric that measures the ratio of open interest and the reserve of an exchange (Binance, in this case). This indicator tracks the average amount of leverage used by traders in a particular market or exchange. A high ELR value typically implies elevated market risk, signaling that small price movements could potentially lead to significant liquidations and further price movements. As reported by NewsBTC in late January, the ELR was at an extremely high level of around 0.1980, indicating an overheated and highly speculative market. Following the crash of the Bitcoin price, the on-chain metric has also cooled off, falling to around 0.1414. According to CryptoOnchain, this 28% decline in the Estimated Leverage Ratio highlights a shiftbin market dynamics. The market quant said that the drop in ELR suggests that a severe deleveraging event has occurred, with the accompanying price decline causing the closure of several overleveraged long positions. CryptoOnchain added: While the immediate price action was painful, wiping out excess leverage is fundamentally healthy. It removes the “derivatives bubble” and leaves the market structure much lighter and less susceptible to extreme, sudden volatility. The crypto analyst concluded that the risk of further liquidation cascades is reduced, now that the Estimated Leverage Ratio has fallen to normal levels. However, the Bitcoin market needs organic buying pressure and genuine demand from the spot market to rebuild a bullish structure and resume a sustainable upward trend. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of BTC sits around $67,950, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is still down by more than 1% on the weekly timeframe.
