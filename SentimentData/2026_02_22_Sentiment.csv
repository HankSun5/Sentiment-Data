TAO coin continues to trade higher, indicating growing adoption among crypto investors as AI development and machine learning progress. Despite this, the coin faces uncertainties and volatility like all other cryptocurrencies. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores its expected movements from 2026 to 2032 while considering the past performance. However, this is not investment advice, and one must conduct their own research before taking any investment decision according to their risk tolerance. Why is TAO up? TAO is up primarily due to buying interest from traders after some degree of bullish price action previously, mainly due to strong market sentiment surrounding speculative AI tokens and the AI industry at large. However, recent resistance near key support levels also played a role in the continuation of the bearish trend during the past week, but the token’s price has also increased today. How much is the Bittensor stock worth? Bittensor (TAO) powers the Bittensor Network and is not a stock. Stocks are usually traded on stock exchanges, and stock ownership represents a stake in a company. Buying TAO tokens gives the buyer certain rights within the Bittensor Network, for example, governance participation but not ownership in a company. However, Bittensor (TAO) tokens can be purchased and traded on different exchanges, including Binance, Bitget, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken. See our price analysis part for day-to-day price changes of the TAO token. What is the price prediction for TAO 2026? The highest Bittensor (TAO) price prediction for 2026 is around $365.38, but it is not easy to predict Bittensor price movements due to its volatile nature. Will Bittensor reach $1000? Yes, Bittensor should surpass $1000 by 2030. Its price will range between $1,055.54 and $1,177.33 during that period, which makes it a viable option to buy Bittensor tokens, considering the future performance and long-term trends, as decentralized AI development is expected to scale exponentially. What is the total supply of Bittensor? The total supply of Bittensor (TAO) tokens is 21 million TAO. Does Bittensor have a good long-term future? According to most market observers, Bittensor TAO will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

Bittensor (TAO) historic price sentiment TAO price history by Coingecko TAO launched on March 6, 2023, at $93.4, but fell below its opening price within a week, sliding into the $76 range. By early April, it had lost half its value, dropping to $47, and continued downward to its $30.83 low in May before slowly recovering to $63 by the end of the month. The token climbed to $86.18 in July, just under its launch price, then pulled back again and traded near $54 through October. Momentum returned in November, pushing TAO into the $95 range, showing continuous improvement, and then sharply to a peak of $379 on December 15, 2023. TAO trended downward into early 2024 but surged to its all-time high of $757.60 in March. It quickly corrected to $522 in April and continued weakening through mid-year, reaching $216 in July. A brief rebound to $357 faded again as the token slipped back toward the mid-$200s by late summer, as per the crypto market price history records. Momentum returned in October, pushing TAO into the $660 range before cooling to $468. It climbed once more to $679 in November but ultimately closed 2024 at $440.69, as the broader crypto market turned bearish again. TAO opened in 2025 at $439.73, peaked at $565 in January, and its price decreased to the $324 level in February, taking down the token’s market capitalization as the technical indicators turned bearish due to some fundamental factors. In March, TAO dipped to the $259 mark and descended further to $228 in April; however, in May, it recovered to $467 as the Bittensor market revived. In October, TAO observed its year’s lowest prices extending toward $200.44. TAO opened trading in November at $506, lost 46% of its value, and closed the month at $269.11, while at the start of December, the coin was trading between $256.29 and $298.90. At the start of January 2026, TAO was trading near the $223 range, as the market shifted towards the bearish side. In February, TAO has plunged below the psychological level of $200, as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|Bittensor|TAO,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|BITTENSOR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-02-21 20:00:00

However, an interesting on-chain development suggests that the Bitcoin price could likely see a relief soon, but only after a certain condition has been met. Realized Profits Show Warning Pattern That Precedes Defined Moves In a recent Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, on-chain analyst MorenoDV revealed that Bitcoin whales have realized more than $208 million in profits. As shown by the Realized Profit By Whales metric, this event — where over $200 million is taken as profit by members of this cohort — marks the seventh such occurrence over the past two years. Related Reading: XRP’s Brutal Supply Compression Signals A Repeat Of The 2024 Expansion Notably, these spikes in profits-taken have not occurred without any impact on price; instead, they have often been followed by market turbulence, which has also mostly preceded the formation of local bottoms. This suggests that large-scale selling from seasoned holders tends to introduce temporary liquidity imbalances. After the supply created by these whales is absorbed, it often leads to price stabilization. Interestingly, this stability has often preceded bullish reversals in the Bitcoin price. However, there have also been a few instances where such profit-taking among this investor cohort coincided with the establishment of local tops. Nonetheless, MorenoDV explained that this profit-taking behavior among the Bitcoin whales typically signals conviction, due to the behavioral consistency of this investor class. As such, these large investors rarely sell impulsively, but when they do, “it signals conviction about near-term price exhaustion or strategic repositioning.” Hence, if history is anything to go by, the analyst explained that the Bitcoin market stands a high chance of experiencing turbulence in the near-term. However, this also comes with the inference that the Bitcoin price is closer to a local exhaustion point than to the start of a bearish market cycle. If institutional flows, or even mid-sized holders, begin accumulating at current levels, the market could interpret this as a healthy rotation, which could in turn translate into bullish momentum. On the other hand, if demand should remain insufficient or if more market participants sell their holdings, downside pressure could be amplified, thereby pushing prices further south. Bitcoin Price At A Glance At the time of writing, the price of BTC stands at around $67,960, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

Businesses and financial institutions seek faster, cheaper, and more efficient ways to move money internationally, creating an opportunity for innovative solutions to reshape the global financial infrastructure. Blockchain analyst Wilberforce Theophilus recently highlighted on X how XRP could serve as the bridge that unlocks this trapped capital. According to Wilberforce, XRP’s design allows it to streamline payments, reduce settlement times, and create real economic value by acting as a bridge currency for fiat transactions worldwide. Unlocking Dormant Global Liquidity Wilberforce explains that trillions of dollars sit dormant in nostro and vostro accounts, pre-funded solely to facilitate international payments. XRP’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solves this inefficiency by instantly converting local fiat into XRP, sending it across borders, and reconverting it into the destination currency. WHY XRP WILL POWER THE WORLD. -On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): Over $27 trillion is trapped in dormant global liquidity, money sitting idle in pre-funded nostro and vostro accounts just to handle cross-border payments. XRP is going to Change that. No more pre-funding nostro… — Wilberforce Theophilus (@Eze_Wilberforce) February 20, 2026 This mechanism allows banks to free up previously locked capital, which can then be deployed for lending, investment, and other productive economic activities. Contrary to claims that XRP’s supply is too large, Wilberforce argues that as global adoption grows, demand will surge, making the available supply increasingly valuable as a bridge asset. Fast, Low-Cost Cross-Border Payments Theophilus highlights XRP Ledger’s speed and efficiency. Transactions settle in just three to five seconds with minimal fees, a dramatic improvement over traditional systems like SWIFT, which often take days to complete a transfer. XRP’s instant currency conversion minimizes friction and mitigates currency risk, benefiting remittance providers, fintechs, and banks using RippleNet and ODL daily. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By functioning as a bridge asset, XRP simplifies global payments and accelerates settlement. Real-world adoption already demonstrates its value, as institutions rely on XRP for live cross-border transactions and liquidity management. Transforming Global Financial Infrastructure Wilberforce emphasizes that XRP’s potential extends beyond incremental efficiency gains. As adoption grows, it could become a foundational tool for global payments, supporting trillions of dollars in daily international transactions. Its scalability, speed, and low cost make it uniquely positioned to integrate legacy banking systems with next-generation digital finance. By unlocking trapped liquidity, enabling instant settlements, and providing a practical bridge for fiat, XRP is positioned not just as a cryptocurrency but as a transformative financial instrument. Wilberforce’s analysis underscores that XRP’s operational and technical advantages may allow it to power global finance, bridging the gap between traditional and digital monetary systems.

The mixed signals matter because they show a split between falling market sentiment and activity metrics that suggest users have not abandoned the chain. Security Patch Delays and Infrastructure Concerns A February 19 report from Santiment noted that a significant source of recent frustration for the Solana community stems from a critical security scare in January. Client maintainers urged validators to upgrade to Agave/Jito v3.0.14 after disclosing vulnerabilities that could crash nodes and threaten consensus integrity. Tim Garcia of the Solana Foundation urged operators to update quickly, but reports at the time said over half of validators were still on older versions, exposing the chain to potential risks. This operational friction resurfaced in February when a network disruption rerouted U.S. traffic through Europe and Asia. While infrastructure providers like DoubleZero noted that such rerouting is a normal part of internet networking, for validators operating a high-speed chain, milliseconds matter. These events have forced the market to pay closer attention to how smoothly Solana’s decentralized validator set can respond to pressure, as that response directly affects uptime and the safety of funds moving through DeFi. The uncertainty is reflecting on SOL’s price, which earlier in the month fell 25% in a week to about $96, with analysts such as Ali Martinez warning that losing the $100 zone could open a path toward $74 or even $50. At the time of writing, the asset was trading around the $84 level, down about 35% over the past month and more than 51% year-on-year. Shorter time frames show mild relief, with gains near 3% in 24 hours and about 6% in seven days, per CoinGecko data. Technical indicators remain mixed. Some traders say a breakdown near $80 confirmed a bearish chart pattern, while others see a shorter-term setup that could push prices back toward $114 if resistance clears. Santiment added that deeply negative funding rates suggest many traders are betting against SOL, a setup that sometimes comes right before short squeezes. Activity Growth Contrasts With Fading Hype Despite the price pressure, Santiment reported rising daily wallet creation in February. That metric tracks new addresses interacting with the network and suggests ongoing user interest even in the face of weakening sentiment. Exchange data also shows outflows exceeding inflows in recent weeks, a sign that some holders are moving tokens off trading platforms rather than preparing to sell. Nevertheless, the current mood contrasts with earlier cycles that defined Solana’s culture. According to Santiment, traders still reference past events such as NFT booms, meme coin launches, and exchange-related shocks that once dominated online discussion. More recently, app builder Zora shifted a new product from Base to Solana, charging about 1 SOL per creation, which sparked debate about incentives but also signaled ongoing developer interest. Ultimately, Solana’s is a layered picture, with prices and online attention having fallen since late 2025, yet new wallets, active builders, and crowded short positions showing that participation has not disappeared.

Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR found resistance at $340 causing a decline back to $328. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero recently reached a new all-time high of $798 before experiencing a sharp correction. The privacy-focused blockchain is expected to stabilize and potentially recover as it continues to reduce technical debt and enhance its utility and privacy features. However, widespread adoption may be hindered by regulatory scrutiny and market volatility, keeping the asset highly speculative. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2031, is expected to reach a minimum of $463.56, while averaging $726.61. The maximum projected value is $989.65. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low.

That move reversed an earlier drop of 10% that followed widespread outages in parts of the US. The numbers are blunt: machines went quiet during extreme weather, then came back online, and the protocol rebalanced itself. Winter Outages And The Bounce Back Foundry USA’s pool saw a dramatic swing in computing power, falling near 198 EH/s before climbing from roughly 400 EH/s. Reports say that many operators in affected regions shut down temporarily during the winter storms to protect equipment and help grids. Some of the spaces that host miners coordinated with utilities. Power was conserved. Power was redirected. Flexible Power Deals Changed The Game Reports note that several miners did more than pause operations. LM Funding America reported curtailing machines and sending contracted power back to the grid, pocketing curtailment payments that helped offset lost mining time. Canaan Inc. also said its US sites took part in demand response moves with local partners. These arrangements are part of why many facilities can afford to go offline when the grid needs relief, then restart when conditions improve. What Higher Difficulty Means Bitcoin’s difficulty is designed to reset every 2,016 blocks to hold average block times close to the 10-minute target. When more hash power returns, the algorithm raises difficulty . That makes the network harder to attack and raises the work needed to win a block reward. For miners, higher difficulty reduces the Bitcoin earned per unit of compute, squeezing margins for outfits with older rigs or higher electricity bills. Price Moves Stay Tied To Headlines Bitcoin traded near $68,000 as markets reacted to rising geopolitical strain, especially between the US and Iran. Trading has felt cautious. Volume is lighter. Prices have bounced and then stalled on headline-driven flows, showing that investor mood still swings with global news. At the same time, network metrics kept shifting under the surface — a reminder that technical and macro drivers can pull in different directions. The US now supplies a big chunk of global hash power, according to Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. That means regional events, weather, and grid policies in the US matter a lot to global security and miner economics. Some firms have begun to treat mining as a flexible load that can stabilize grids during stress, creating new income streams beyond pure block rewards. Politics And Market Tone Comments from politicians and geopolitical moves add friction. Mentions of US President Donald Trump in recent headlines have been tied to broader market nervousness ; geopolitics can pull risk appetite downward and keep crypto prices range-bound. The difficulty rebound itself didn’t spark a big price jump. Instead, it reinforced a simple truth: the protocol handled the shock, but miners felt the squeeze.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-proponent-says-clarity-act-is-huge-for-xrp-heres-why/,"The cryptocurrency industry has spent years operating under regulatory uncertainty. Developers have built networks, investors have allocated capital, and institutions have tested blockchain solutions while lawmakers debated definitions and oversight. As U.S. policymakers advance comprehensive digital asset legislation, the market now stands at a pivotal moment where regulatory clarity could reshape competitive dynamics across the sector. Crypto commentator Caesar recently argued on X that the proposed Clarity Act represents a major turning point for XRP . He contends that the bill matters for XRP not because the asset requires rescue, but because clearer rules could amplify an advantage XRP has already secured through prior legal scrutiny and market positioning. CLARITY Act is huge for $XRP Not because it needs it Because while everyone else is filing paperwork, XRP is already in the room — Caesar (@caesarnodes) February 20, 2026 The Regulatory Landscape Is Shifting Lawmakers designed the Clarity Act to define how U.S. regulators classify and oversee digital assets. The legislation seeks to clarify the roles of agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, reducing ambiguity that has slowed institutional participation. Clear classification standards would allow projects to understand compliance requirements without relying on case-by-case enforcement actions. XRP occupies a distinct place in this evolving environment. In 2023, a federal court ruled that XRP itself does not qualify as a security when traded on secondary markets. That judicial determination provided a level of clarity that many other digital assets still lack. While regulatory discussions continue, XRP already operates within a partially defined legal framework. Legal Precedent as Strategic Advantage Caesar’s perspective centers on timing and preparedness. If the Clarity Act becomes law, many blockchain projects may need to file disclosures, restructure offerings, or adjust governance models to align with statutory definitions. XRP, however, has already endured extensive legal examination and maintained operational continuity throughout high-profile litigation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 That history may now serve as a competitive advantage. Institutions typically prioritize regulatory certainty before allocating capital or integrating blockchain infrastructure. XRP’s prior courtroom validation reduces perceived compliance risk, potentially making it more attractive in a regulated environment. Institutional Readiness and Market Position Ripple, the enterprise-focused technology company associated with XRP’s payment use cases, has spent years building partnerships centered on cross-border transactions and liquidity solutions. Financial institutions evaluating blockchain tools often seek assets that combine technical utility with clearer legal status. If lawmakers finalize comprehensive digital asset regulations, institutions could accelerate the adoption of assets that already meet established legal benchmarks. Caesar suggests that while other projects prepare paperwork and adjust structures, XRP may already meet many of the standards policymakers aim to codify. As regulatory clarity approaches, the conversation shifts from uncertainty to readiness. Caesar frames the Clarity Act as a development that could highlight XRP’s legal groundwork and institutional integration, positioning it to compete effectively in a fully regulated digital asset marketplace.

Speaking at The Indian Express AI Summit, Altman dismissed viral claims about ChatGPT’s water usage as “totally fake” and “completely untrue,” sparking renewed debate about how society measures technological progress against ecological responsibility. Debunking the ChatGPT Water Consumption Myth Altman specifically addressed circulating internet claims suggesting each ChatGPT query consumes approximately 17 gallons of water. He labeled these assertions “totally insane” with “no connection to reality.” The OpenAI executive explained that such figures originated from outdated data center cooling methods no longer in widespread use. Modern facilities employ advanced cooling technologies that dramatically reduce water consumption. However, Altman acknowledged legitimate concerns about AI’s aggregate energy footprint. He emphasized that the real issue involves total energy consumption across global AI systems rather than individual query metrics. The Energy Reality of Modern AI Systems Data centers powering AI systems have become significant electricity consumers. Recent studies indicate AI-related computation could account for 3-5% of global electricity by 2030. Unlike traditional computing, AI requires specialized hardware and continuous operation for both training and inference phases. Training large language models like GPT-4 involves thousands of specialized processors running for months. Inference—the process of generating responses to user queries—requires constant computational resources across global server networks. Despite these demands, efficiency improvements have been substantial. Modern AI chips deliver 10-100 times more computation per watt than those from just five years ago. Comparative Energy Analysis: AI Versus Human Intelligence Altman introduced a novel perspective during his Mumbai presentation. He argued that comparing AI energy consumption to human energy use provides more meaningful context. “It takes like 20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart,” Altman noted. He extended this comparison to humanity’s evolutionary development, suggesting that assessing AI’s efficiency requires considering the complete energy investment in human education and biological development. According to this framework, AI might already demonstrate superior energy efficiency for specific cognitive tasks once initial training costs are amortized across billions of queries. The Renewable Energy Imperative Regardless of efficiency debates, Altman stressed the urgent need for cleaner energy infrastructure. “The world needs to move towards nuclear or wind and solar very quickly,” he declared. This position aligns with growing industry consensus. Major technology companies increasingly power data centers with renewable sources. Microsoft and Google have committed to 100% renewable energy for their cloud operations by 2025. Nuclear energy, particularly next-generation small modular reactors, has gained attention as a potential solution for providing reliable, carbon-free power to energy-intensive computing facilities. Transparency Challenges in Tech Energy Reporting A significant obstacle in assessing AI’s environmental impact involves limited corporate transparency. No legal requirements currently mandate technology companies to disclose detailed energy and water consumption data. Consequently, researchers must rely on estimates and reverse engineering. Independent studies suggest AI model training can consume electricity equivalent to hundreds of homes for a year. However, companies rarely release specific figures, making accurate assessment difficult. This opacity fuels both exaggerated claims and genuine uncertainty about AI’s ecological footprint. The Data Center Electricity Price Connection Beyond environmental concerns, data center expansion affects electricity markets. Regions with concentrated computing infrastructure sometimes experience upward pressure on local electricity prices. This occurs because data centers represent large, consistent electricity demands that can strain grid capacity. Utility companies must invest in additional generation and transmission infrastructure, costs often passed to all consumers. Some municipalities now consider special electricity rates for data centers to mitigate community impacts while encouraging economic development. Historical Context: Evolving Data Center Efficiency Data center energy efficiency has improved dramatically over the past decade. The industry transitioned from traditional evaporative cooling to advanced systems using outside air, liquid cooling, and AI-optimized temperature management. Power usage effectiveness—a metric comparing total facility energy to IT equipment energy—has decreased from averages above 2.0 to approximately 1.2 for state-of-the-art facilities. These improvements mean modern data centers deliver substantially more computation per unit of energy and water than their predecessors. However, absolute consumption continues rising due to exponential growth in computing demand. Expert Perspectives on AI Energy Debates Energy researchers offer nuanced views on AI’s environmental impact. Dr. Emma Strubell, a computer scientist specializing in AI sustainability, notes that while individual query energy might be minimal, aggregate effects matter. “We must consider scale,” she explains. “If ChatGPT serves billions of queries daily, even efficient systems consume significant energy.” Other experts emphasize that AI could indirectly reduce energy consumption by optimizing logistics, transportation, and industrial processes. The net environmental impact thus depends on both direct energy use and efficiency gains enabled by AI applications. The Bill Gates Comparison Clarified During his Mumbai appearance, Altman addressed a specific comparison suggesting a single ChatGPT query uses energy equivalent to 1.5 iPhone battery charges. He dismissed this estimate, stating, “There’s no way it’s anything close to that much.” While precise figures remain undisclosed, available data suggests typical AI queries consume energy comparable to several minutes of smartphone use rather than multiple full charges. This clarification highlights the challenge of communicating technical energy concepts through accessible analogies that sometimes oversimplify complex realities. Future Directions: Sustainable AI Development The technology industry increasingly prioritizes sustainability alongside capability improvements. Research focuses on several approaches: Algorithmic efficiency: Developing AI models that achieve similar performance with fewer computations Hardware specialization: Designing processors optimized specifically for AI workloads Renewable integration: Locating data centers near renewable energy sources Carbon-aware computing: Scheduling intensive computations when renewable generation peaks Lifecycle assessment: Considering environmental impacts across hardware manufacturing, operation, and disposal Conclusion Sam Altman’s Mumbai remarks highlight the complex relationship between artificial intelligence development and environmental sustainability. While dismissing exaggerated claims about AI’s resource consumption, Altman acknowledges legitimate concerns about aggregate energy use. His call for accelerated renewable energy adoption reflects growing industry recognition that technological progress must align with ecological responsibility. The debate continues about appropriate metrics for comparing AI and human efficiency, but consensus emerges around the need for greater transparency, continued efficiency improvements, and cleaner energy infrastructure to support AI’s expanding role in society. FAQs Q1: How much energy does a single ChatGPT query actually use? OpenAI hasn’t released exact figures, but estimates suggest typical queries consume minimal energy—likely equivalent to several minutes of smartphone use rather than the exaggerated claims of 17 gallons of water or multiple device charges. Q2: What did Sam Altman say about AI’s water consumption? Altman called viral claims about ChatGPT’s water usage “totally fake” and explained they’re based on outdated cooling methods. Modern data centers use advanced cooling systems with dramatically reduced water requirements. Q3: Why does Altman compare AI energy use to human energy consumption? He argues this provides fairer context, noting humans require decades of food, education, and evolutionary development. Comparing trained AI systems to educated humans might show AI’s superior energy efficiency for specific tasks. Q4: What energy solutions does Altman recommend for AI development? He advocates rapid adoption of nuclear, wind, and solar power to meet growing AI energy demands sustainably, aligning with broader industry moves toward renewable-powered data centers. Q5: How have data centers improved their energy efficiency? Modern facilities achieve power usage effectiveness ratings around 1.2 (compared to 2.0+ a decade ago) through advanced cooling, AI-optimized management, specialized hardware, and renewable energy integration.

On the standard view, the downtrend remains intact until key resistance is reclaimed, making the current optimism conditional. Inverted Structure Reinforces Ethereum Bearish HTF Outlook Presenting an inverted chart in a recent update, Mizer explained that he has been short on Ethereum for several days, outlining what he believes could unfold on the higher time frame (HTF). Mizer clarified that this doesn’t necessarily plan to hold the full position to his projected targets, as he prefers focusing on lower time frame (LTF) opportunities given the difficulty of forecasting HTF moves in the current macro environment. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Bounce Still Lacks Conviction — Downside Risk Remains According to Mizer, Ethereum’s HTF structure remains clear: a distribution phase followed by consistent breakdowns since the $5,000 peak. A parabolic curve formed off that top is a key indicator of this pattern, noting that the price has respected it for months. Until that parabola is decisively broken and price holds above it, the broader downtrend remains intact. Zooming into the current price action, Mizer highlighted a strong impulse move into this zone marked by a purple line. This area represents a significant support/resistance flip on the inverted chart: previously resistance, it was broken and now functions as support. Mizer is now closely watching the small blue box on the right side of the chart, which represents the current consolidation following the impulse. Two Scenarios From Consolidation The analyst further explained that from the current consolidation zone, there are two primary scenarios unfolding: either continuation after a shallow pullback, or a brief fake breakdown followed by a swift reclaim before the next leg higher on the inverted chart, which would translate to further downside for ETH itself. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces High-Stakes Moment at $2,200 as Whale Longs Clash With Bearish Flow Data He described the purple path on his chart as his “ideal” bullish scenario on the inverted structure, essentially tracking price as it continues to respect the long-standing parabolic curve. As long as that parabola remains intact, the broader bearish trajectory remains his base case. Regarding targets, he divided expectations into short- and long-term objectives. The immediate target sits around $1,700, which he views as the first logical area to take profits and monitor for a potential reaction strong enough to challenge or even break the parabolic resistance. The final target lies near $1,400, representing the larger extension if momentum fully plays out. However, he emphasized that the setup would be invalidated if ETH loses the key flip zone and begins accepting below it on the inverted chart, a move that would break the parabola and potentially signal a broader trend reversal.

Retail investors stepped in and bought $1.0 billion of stock. That makes five straight weeks of buying from everyday traders. Hedge funds also added exposure. They purchased $1.2 billion, logging their eighth buying week out of the last nine. Big money sold. Smaller players and fast money bought. Institutions offload US stocks just as dumb money and hedge funds absorb supply Equity ETFs saw $2.2 billion in inflows during the same week. At the same time, single stock names recorded $8.3 billion in outflows. Investors favored broad funds over individual companies. The gap between ETF inflows and single-name withdrawals was clear. Single stock outflows have now happened in 13 of the past 15 weeks. Total withdrawals over that stretch equal $52.0 billion. Institutions are selling directly into bids from retail traders and hedge funds. The flow data shows a steady transfer of ownership. Retail demand after the Supreme Court ruling stayed limited. At 10 a.m. ET, the high court said President Donald Trump wrongly used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose reciprocal tariffs. Traders reacted fast. Major averages jumped, dropped, then recovered within hours. The Nasdaq Composite is trying to end a five-week losing streak. By midday Friday, the index was up 0.8%. That brought its weekly gain to 1.4%. If it holds, the technology-heavy index will break its longest run of weekly losses since May 2022. Markets brace for tariffs, Iran risk, and Nvidia results After the ruling, Trump said he will impose a new 10% “global tariff” using other trade laws. Stocks reacted in stages on Friday. Tim Holland, chief investment officer at Orion Wealth Management, wrote, “It would seem that Wall Street and Main Street are going to be dealing with the issue of trade and tariffs for some time to come.” Tim focused on the ongoing policy risk facing markets. The Supreme Court did not address whether importers will receive refunds for tariffs already paid under steeper rates. The issue now returns to the lower courts. Ed Mills, managing director and Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, wrote , “We expect that the process for firms to receive tariff refunds will be lengthy and challenging, with litigants needing to bring individual cases or participate in class action.” Future tariffs may not be as broad unless Congress provides backing. If inflation eases, the Federal Reserve could gain room to cut interest rates. Traders are also watching geopolitical risk. Trump will deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress. Barclays’ trading desk said the speech may include an ultimatum to Iran. Meanwhile, Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday, and since the company is one of only two Magnificent Seven names posting a stock gain this year, expectations are high.

Optimism price prediction for 2029 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.40. In 2032, OP tokens will range between $2.10 and $4.60, with an average value of $3.05. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2026 – 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.1294 Market Cap $274.11M Trading Volume $130.03M Circulating Supply 2.117B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2519 (Dec 26, 2025) 24-hour High $0.1347 24-hour Low $0.1271 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 23.24% (Extremely High) 50-Day SMA $0.2665 14-Day RSI 21.92 (Oversold) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 8 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $0.4410 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is down by more than 35% from its recent swing high and by more than 50% from early February levels. On the 4-hour chart, the trend remains bearish below $0.136. Unless the $0.150 level is reclaimed, downside toward $0.120 remains open. Optimism 1-day price chart On the 1-day chart (February 21, 2026), OP is trading around $0.1290, barely green on the session at +0.31%, but structurally weak. The coin’s price has broken below the lower Bollinger Band at $0.1322, while the basis sits higher near $0.1838 and the upper band at $0.2354, showing how stretched the downtrend has become. From the recent local high near $0.200, OP has dropped roughly 35%, and from the early February region around $0.260, the decline exceeds 50%, confirming a persistent bearish trajectory rather than a simple pullback. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Candles continue to print lower highs and lower lows, and there is no meaningful bullish rejection at current levels. The MACD remains negative at -0.0030, with the signal line deeper at -0.0289, and although histogram momentum briefly attempted a recovery mid-month, it has rolled over again. Unless price reclaims $0.150 quickly, the path of least resistance remains toward the $0.120–$0.115 zone, where psychological and prior wick support may attempt to stabilize price. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP trades around $0.1288, still compressed under the Alligator lines, which are fully opened downward (jaw near $0.1456, teeth around $0.1366, lips at $0.1316). This alignment confirms the continuation of the trend rather than consolidation. The price remains capped below $0.1316, meaning short-term rallies are being sold into. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI sits deeply oversold near 22.9, having dipped below 20 earlier, which signals exhaustion but not reversal. The recent bounce attempts have been weak and lack follow-through, forming tight candles rather than impulsive bullish structures. If $0.125 fails, acceleration toward $0.120 becomes highly probable; conversely, only a strong reclaim of $0.136–$0.145 would signal that bears are losing control. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2035 SELL SMA 5 $0.1910 SELL SMA 10 $0.1816 SELL SMA 21 $0.1926 SELL SMA 50 $0.2665 SELL SMA 100 $0.2942 SELL SMA 200 $0.4410 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2157 SELL EMA 5 $0.2418 SELL EMA 10 $0.2673 SELL EMA 21 $0.2805 SELL EMA 50 $0.3103 SELL EMA 100 $0.3829 SELL EMA 200 $0.5251 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Across both timeframes, OP remains in a confirmed downtrend with momentum aligned to the downside. The 4-hour shows oversold conditions that could trigger a short-term relief bounce, but the daily structure suggests any rally is corrective unless $0.150 is reclaimed decisively. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

He said the token is not an inflation hedge and called it a “pseudo-asset class.” Bitcoin traded around 67,400 dollars on Wednesday, down 45 percent from its late-October high. He wrote, “Calling Bitcoin or any other crypto vehicle a ‘currency’ has always been bogus. Roubini also said Bitcoin has been tied to “the mother of all bubbles” and a “Ponzi Game.” Nouriel pointed to its use in illegal transactions and said crypto can put the financial system in danger as lawmakers push it into banks. He mocked the GENIUS Act and said the bill should be called the “Reckless Idiot Act.” The part that bothered Nouriel most is the lack of lender-of-last-resort support and no deposit insurance for stablecoins. He warned that some industry voices want interest paid on stablecoins, which he said could “undermine the foundations of the banking system.” Market losses hit Bitcoin as investors pull back The world’s biggest token has dropped more than 40 percent from its peak. Dip buyers are missing. Usual support is gone. Gold is winning the hedge fight. Stablecoins are beating Bitcoin in payments. Prediction markets are taking over speculation. None of this happened because regulators crushed it. Washington has been friendly. Big firms have joined in. Wall Street has treated it like a real asset. Bitcoin got everything it wanted but the price still fell. Robert Kiyosaki said, “Although Bitcoin is crashing I bought one more whole Bitcoin for 67k. Why? Two reasons: #1: Because the Big Print will begin when the US debt crashes the dollar and ‘The Marxist Fed’ begins printing trillions in fake dollars. #2: The magical 21 millionth Bitcoin is getting close to being mined. When the 21st millionth Bitcoin is mined… Bitcoin becomes better than gold.” His view stands in sharp contrast to Nouriel, but it captures how divided this crypto moment is. Flows move to gold as Bitcoin questions get louder Despite global tension and a weak dollar, gold and silver have jumped while crypto has fallen.US gold ETFs pulled in more than 16 billion dollars in the last three months. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw about 3.3 billion dollars in outflows. Market cap has dropped by more than 1 trillion dollars.The digital-asset treasury model, once a big selling point, has cracked. Companies like Strategy, MARA, Metaplanet, and GameStop bought Bitcoin, issued shares, and created a loop that boosted their value. That loop has now turned.

The fund comes as the broader cryptocurrency market faces a severe downturn, with token prices declining and investor enthusiasm weakened. $650 Million Fund Dragonfly’s previous fund, its third, deployed $500 million into startups such as Polymarket, Rain, and Ethena. The new $650 million vehicle aims to continue that trajectory and will provide capital for the firm to pursue early-stage investments at a time when the crypto venture sector is experiencing a slowdown as deal activity declines and firms face challenges in raising additional capital from investors, according to Fortune. Speaking about the latest development, co-founder Haseeb Qureshi commented , “We talk out loud and we say what we think. In a space that is just completely flooded with bulls**t and with fakers and self-promoters, I think that has actually been a superpower.” The firm’s investments have included Layer 1 blockchain projects such as Avalanche, financial services firms like Amber Group, and other crypto projects. Besides, Dragonfly’s operations have continued through multiple market disruptions, such as the collapse of the Terra Luna ecosystem, the FTX bankruptcy, and a move away from China amid a local crypto crackdown. Scrutiny Linked to Tornado Cash Investment It has also faced regulatory scrutiny from the Department of Justice (DOJ). In July 2025, prosecutors informed a federal judge that they were considering criminal charges against employees of the crypto venture firm, including general partner Tom Schmidt, in relation to the 2020 investment in Tornado Cash. The statement was made by prosecutor Nathan Rehn to District Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York during a break in the trial of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, who was later convicted of operating an unlicensed money transmission. Dragonfly co-founder Haseeb Qureshi clarified that the firm has fully cooperated with the government investigation, which began in 2023. He had then stated that if charges are filed, they intend to defend themselves. The Justice Department later backtracked, and no charges were filed against Schmidt.

This order comes as the latest regulatory blow dealt to the prediction market platform in recent weeks. Dutch Regulator Threatens Polymarket With $840,000 Fine In a notice dated Tuesday, February 17, the Netherlands Gambling Authority ordered Polymarket’s Dutch arm, Adventure One, to “cease its activities immediately” or risk incurring up to $840,000 in fines per week. According to the Dutch regulator, Adventure One offered illegal bets, including on the local elections, to residents without a license. While prediction markets do not particularly fall into the traditional gambling category, the Netherlands Gambling Authority has classified them as betting. The regulator revealed that it contacted Polymarket about its activities on the Dutch market, but have seen no corrective action or response from the prediction markets company. Netherlands Gambling Authority’s director of licensing and supervision, Ella Seijsener, said in the notice: Prediction markets are on the rise, including in the Netherlands. These types of companies offer bets that are not permitted in our market under any circumstances, not even by license holders. Besides the social risks of these kinds of predictions (for example, the potential influence on elections), we conclude that this constitutes illegal gambling. Anyone without a Ksa license has no business in our market. This also applies to these new gambling platforms. This restriction in the Netherlands marks the latest stumbling block for Polymarket in terms of regulation over the past few months. Despite receiving approvals from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), individual state authorities have placed significant scrutiny on the activities of prediction market platforms . This has led to an issue of jurisdiction, as the CFTC chair criticized the state-level scrutiny which undermines their federal authority over prediction markets. Dutch Unrealized Gains Tax On Crypto Rolls On This crackdown on prediction markets comes just a week after the Dutch House of Representatives advanced a proposal to introduce a 36% capital gains tax on most liquid investments, including cryptocurrencies. This controversial bill, if passed, would see profits made from interest-bearing financial instruments, equity investments, cryptocurrencies, and savings accounts be subject to tax, whether realized or not. The proposal of this capital gains tax led to interesting reactions, with several crypto analysts noting that the legislation will drive investors out of the Netherlands. “To be honest, the fact that there’s the unrealized gains tax for Bitcoin in the Netherlands is the dumbest thing I’ve seen in a long time. The amount of people willing to flee the country is going to be bananas,” analyst Michaël van de Poppe said on X.",Crypto News|CFTC|Netherlands|Netherlands Gambling Authority|Polymarket|prediction markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-21 23:00:06

One week it is Bitcoin news driving headlines. The next week, it is Ethereum upgrades stealing the spotlight. Yields pop up at random percentages. Referral bonuses appear without context. Many projects select numbers that look attractive but lack deeper meaning. Meanwhile, Bitcoin price today trends across search engines, and Ethereum innovation keeps expanding decentralized finance. Investors scan charts, yet few projects anchor their metrics to a real narrative. APEMARS changes that script. Instead of arbitrary percentages, every figure reflects Mars itself. From a 63% APY tied to Martian temperature to referral rewards echoing orbital eccentricity, the numbers tell a mission-driven story. Currently in Stage 9 at $0.00007841, APEMARS has raised over 215K, sold more than 11.5B tokens, and attracted over 1,010 holders. With a transparent listing target of $0.0055, the structured pricing gap defines positioning. That approach is why many analysts now describe it as the best crypto presale. APEMARS ($APRZ): The Best Crypto Presale Where Every Number Has a Mission APEMARS stands out as the best crypto presale because its metrics carry purpose. Built on Ethereum using the ERC-20 standard, $APRZ integrates seamlessly with major wallets and decentralized exchanges. The presale is currently in Stage 9 at $0.00007841. The intended listing price is $0.0055, creating a clearly defined pricing structure. Over 215K has been raised, and more than 11.5B tokens have already been sold. The modeled ROI from Stage 9 to listing reflects a 6,914.41% positioning gap based on the structured pricing framework. The Viral Referral System rewards both participants with 9.34%, inspired by Mars’ orbital eccentricity. High-Yield Staking delivers 63% APY, referencing Mars’ average temperature of minus 63 degrees Celsius. Structured burn events occur at Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23, reducing unsold supply at defined checkpoints. The upcoming Stage 10 price increases by 16.45% to $0.00009131. This stage-based model rewards earlier access through lower pricing while preserving long-term mission momentum. 1K Strategic Allocation: What Stage 9 Pricing Means Before the Next Surge A 1,000-dollar allocation at Stage 9 pricing of $0.00007841 secures over 12.7 million tokens before the next scheduled increase. With Stage 10 moving to $0.00009131, early positioning captures immediate structural upside. If the intended listing price of $0.0055 is achieved, the predefined gap highlights substantial theoretical upside relative to entry. Early joiners from previous stages already reflect a 361.50% progression through Stage 9 advancement alone. The model rewards timing, patience, and structured participation rather than speculation alone. Enter the Red Planet Mission: How to Secure APEMARS Before Stage 10 Activates Participation begins by connecting a compatible Ethereum wallet to the official APEMARS presale dashboard. After selecting a contribution amount, confirm the transaction on-chain. Tokens remain allocated until the post-presale claim phase. Pricing advances automatically once a stage allocation sells out or the weekly cycle ends. This transparent mechanism ensures fairness and predictable progression. With Stage 10 approaching at $0.00009131, availability at Stage 9 pricing remains limited by time and allocation thresholds. Bitcoin ($BTC): The Digital Gold Standard Powering Market Cycles Bitcoin remains the foundation of digital assets. It introduced decentralized scarcity and established the store-of-value model that reshaped finance. Recent Bitcoin news highlights institutional participation and ETF-driven exposure. Bitcoin price today reflects macro conditions, liquidity cycles, and global risk appetite. Its capped supply of 21 million coins reinforces long-term scarcity mechanics. Despite volatility, Bitcoin continues to anchor the broader crypto market. Developers prioritize security and decentralization over rapid experimentation. That deliberate pace strengthens credibility. While Bitcoin does not offer staking yields or referral systems, its predictable issuance and proof-of-work design provide structural reliability that newer projects seek to complement rather than replace. Ethereum ($ETH): The Smart Contract Engine Behind Modern Crypto Expansion Ethereum powers decentralized finance, NFTs, and thousands of ERC-20 tokens. Its transition to proof-of-stake introduced staking rewards and improved energy efficiency. Developers rely on Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities to create programmable financial systems. Ongoing scaling solutions strengthen throughput and reduce transaction congestion. Ethereum price trends often influence broader altcoin sentiment. Discussions sometimes compare Ethereum developments with topics like Cardano price prediction or Cardano 2025 price outlooks. However, Ethereum maintains the largest developer ecosystem and deep liquidity pools. That infrastructure supports projects like APEMARS, which depend on security, transparency, and reliable network architecture. Conclusion Bitcoin and Ethereum continue shaping market direction. Bitcoin news drives macro narratives, while Ethereum expands smart contract capabilities. In this environment, the Best crypto presale conversation increasingly favors structured models over arbitrary tokenomics. According to discussions often highlighted on “best crypto to buy now,” Bitcoin and Ethereum remain pillars, yet early-stage frameworks attract strategic positioning interest alongside established assets. APEMARS leverages that environment through measurable stage progression. Stage 9 pricing at $0.00007841 remains active before the planned $0.0055 listing benchmark. Over 215K raised and more than 11.5B tokens sold demonstrate traction. The 63% APY, 9.34% referral structure, and scheduled burns reinforce narrative consistency. For readers researching structured early-stage opportunities, platforms such as best crypto to buy now frequently analyze APEMARS alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum coverage, presenting comparative insights for informed decision-making. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official APEMARS Website Telegram: Join the APEMARS Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow APEMARS ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions What makes APEMARS different from other presales? APEMARS connects every core metric to Mars symbolism. The 63% APY reflects Martian temperature, and referral rewards mirror orbital data. Structured burn checkpoints reduce supply at defined stages, reinforcing transparency and mission cohesion. What is the current Stage 9 price of APEMARS? Stage 9 is priced at $0.00007841. The next stage increases by 16.45% to $0.00009131. The intended listing price is $0.0055, creating a defined presale-to-listing pricing structure. How does the staking system work? APEMARS offers 63% APY staking inspired by Mars’ climate. Rewards accumulate automatically and remain locked for two months after launch. This lock supports early ecosystem stability and discourages short-term volatility. How many tokens have been sold so far? More than 11.5B tokens have been sold during the presale. The project has raised over 215K and attracted over 1,010 token holders in Stage 9 of Operation RED BANANA. Is APEMARS built on Ethereum? Yes. APEMARS is deployed as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. This ensures compatibility with major wallets, decentralized exchanges, and established on-chain infrastructure for transparency and security. Glossary ERC-20 : A token standard on Ethereum enabling interoperability. APY : Annual Percentage Yield earned through staking. Burn Event : Permanent removal of tokens from circulation. Presale Stage : Time-based pricing phase before public listing. ROI : Return on investment based on entry and exit levels. Staking Lock : Period where tokens cannot be withdrawn.

With XRP’s long history in the cryptocurrency market and its already substantial appreciation since launch, many holders still question whether significant upside is still possible for those entering at current price levels. The token is currently trading around $1.44, and this has shifted the discussion from past performance to future scenarios and whether these projected price milestones could realistically turn modest investments into retirement-level capital. XRP’s Progress Since Launch XRP has already established itself as one of the strongest digital assets in the industry. Since it began trading in 2013, the token has recorded cumulative gains exceeding 24,000%, according to data aggregated by CoinMarketCap. Early participants who accumulated XRP at fractions of a cent realized extraordinary returns as prices climbed into multi-dollar territory. A relatively small five-figure investment made near launch would now be valued in the millions. However, replicating that scale of growth from today’s market capitalization presents a much steeper challenge. Projected Prices for a Retirement Portfolio At current prices, a $1,000 investment in XRP would purchase approximately 704 tokens, while a $2,000 allocation would yield about 1,408 tokens. Whether these holdings could eventually support retirement depends not only on how high XRP’s price could rise, but also on how retirement needs differ across regions. In developed economies such as the United States, estimates often place the required retirement capital near $1.5 million, accounting for healthcare costs, inflation, and limited pension coverage. Comparable figures are seen in the United Kingdom and Canada, where comfortable retirement targets frequently exceed $1 million. In contrast, lower living costs in countries such as India reduce that threshold significantly, with estimates ranging between $360,000 and $600,000 depending on lifestyle and location. These benchmarks provide useful context when assessing XRP price projections. If XRP were to reach $100, a level frequently mentioned by bullish commentators, a 704 token holding would be valued at just over $70,000, while a 1,408 token holding would amount to roughly $140,000. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While significant, these sums fall well short of retirement requirements in most regions. Even at $500 per XRP, a $1,000 investment would grow to approximately $352,000, enough to approach financial independence only in a limited number of low-cost economies. Retirement-level outcomes become more plausible only under far more aggressive price assumptions. At $1,000 per XRP, a $1,000 investment would be worth roughly $704,000, while $2,000 invested today would exceed $1.4 million. At this level, retirement targets in many developed countries could be met. A $2,000 XRP price would double those figures again, placing even conservative investors comfortably above typical retirement thresholds. However, such valuations would imply a market capitalization far larger than XRP has ever achieved, raising questions about feasibility and timelines. Several market commentators have increased their ambitious long-term forecasts. Investor YoungHoon Kim has suggested that XRP could reach triple-digit prices within the next decade, while Alpha Lions Academy CEO Edoardo Farina has argued that prices in the hundreds may appear inexpensive in hindsight. Other analysts have floated four-figure valuations over longer horizons, though most acknowledge that such outcomes would require sustained institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and continued expansion of Ripple’s payments infrastructure through Ripple. Although XRP’s historical performance demonstrates that exceptional gains are possible in cryptocurrency markets, translating a $1,000 or $2,000 investment into retirement-level wealth would require extreme price appreciation that remains highly speculative.

Here’s The Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-whales-hit-record-milestone-heres-the-latest/,"XRP whales holding between 10 million and 100 million tokens have reached their largest share of the circulating supply in history. Data from market intelligence platform Santiment shows that this group now controls 17.04% of XRP’s supply, marking a significant increase from 12.21% in October 2025. This development follows a notable accumulation trend that began as market conditions turned bearish . Accumulation Campaign Intensifies Since October 2025, these top-tier whales have steadily expanded their holdings. Their cumulative balance rose from 7.89 billion XRP at the start of October to 11.06 billion tokens, amounting to an acquisition of 3.17 billion XRP valued at approximately $4.5 billion. This surge coincided with a period of significant market turbulence, indicating that these addresses may have been executing a deliberate “buy-the-dip” strategy . The most concentrated phase of this accumulation occurred over 20 days in November. Their combined holdings increased from 8.33 billion to 10.82 billion XRP, representing their sharpest purchasing activity to date. XRP Price Decline and Market Context XRP has experienced a prolonged downturn since August 2025, which intensified in October alongside broader market declines. XRP reached an all-time high of $3.66 in July 2025, but now trades at $1.42, down 61.2% from its peak. This period produced four consecutive bearish monthly candles. February is already showing a further 13.33% decline. Another red monthly candle will mark the first instance of five straight negative months since 2016 and 2017. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Redistribution Among Smaller Whales While the largest whales have been increasing their holdings, addresses with balances between 100,000 and 10 million XRP have been net sellers . Their combined holdings decreased from 13.12 billion XRP in October 2025 to 10.09 billion tokens at present, a reduction of approximately 3 billion XRP. Most of this reduction occurred within the 1 million to 10 million XRP tier, which contributed 2.8 billion tokens to the overall decline. November, the same month as the largest whale accumulation, saw the most significant reduction in these smaller whale balances, suggesting a possible transfer of tokens to larger holders. The data shows a phase of deliberate accumulation by the largest XRP holders, who have increased their control over the circulating supply during the market downturn. The contrasting behaviors across whale tiers reveal different approaches, with major holders consolidating their positions while smaller holders show less faith in the asset .

This downside volatility is believed to have been precipitated by the overleveraging in the BTC market at the time. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin derivatives market has witnessed a massive flush-out over the past week. BTC Market Now At Reduced Risk Of Liquidation Cascades In a fresh Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, trader CryptoOnchain revealed a dramatic flush-out in the Bitcoin derivatives market on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. The relevant indicator here is the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), which has seen a significant decline in recent weeks. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Could Be Headed For Another Drop: Research Firm Cites Three Key Risks The Estimated Leverage Ratio is an on-chain metric that measures the ratio of open interest and the reserve of an exchange (Binance, in this case). This indicator tracks the average amount of leverage used by traders in a particular market or exchange. A high ELR value typically implies elevated market risk, signaling that small price movements could potentially lead to significant liquidations and further price movements. As reported by NewsBTC in late January, the ELR was at an extremely high level of around 0.1980, indicating an overheated and highly speculative market. Following the crash of the Bitcoin price, the on-chain metric has also cooled off, falling to around 0.1414. According to CryptoOnchain, this 28% decline in the Estimated Leverage Ratio highlights a shiftbin market dynamics. The market quant said that the drop in ELR suggests that a severe deleveraging event has occurred, with the accompanying price decline causing the closure of several overleveraged long positions. CryptoOnchain added: While the immediate price action was painful, wiping out excess leverage is fundamentally healthy. It removes the “derivatives bubble” and leaves the market structure much lighter and less susceptible to extreme, sudden volatility. The crypto analyst concluded that the risk of further liquidation cascades is reduced, now that the Estimated Leverage Ratio has fallen to normal levels. However, the Bitcoin market needs organic buying pressure and genuine demand from the spot market to rebuild a bullish structure and resume a sustainable upward trend. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of BTC sits around $67,950, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is still down by more than 1% on the weekly timeframe.

This is the largest spike in such losses since late 2022, according to on‑chain analytics firm Santiment. The metric, which tallies coins sold below their original purchase price, surged to levels last seen roughly 39 months ago. This level has rapidly become a focal point for traders trying to gauge whether the market is entering an upcoming turning point. If investors sell their coins at a price below their original purchase price , it’s called a realized loss. To put it simply, it also means traders are locking in losses rather than waiting for prices to rise. When this number climbs sharply, many would attribute it to market fear or frustration. Santiment’s numbers confirm that this week saw the highest realized losses since a similar spike in 2022, totaling $1.93 billion. The above leap occurred before XRP rose by 114% over the next eight months. Thanks to that historical trend, many traders are now keeping a close eye on it. Sized realized losses are commonly tied to a common problem that analysts have dubbed “capitulation.” This is when less bullish stockholders sell their positions amid sustained price declines. But this downside can also reduce selling pressure. By the time most likely sellers have moved out of the market, fewer sellers are available to reduce prices. In the past, severe spikes in realized losses have been observed around market bottoms for many cryptocurrencies. And while that doesn’t guarantee a rebound, it does explain why the current data has generated so much interest. Profit-and-loss numbers, Santiment said, can also be useful for monitoring market emotional extremes. Analysts share bold price forecasts Although realized losses signal pessimism in the short term , many analysts maintain their focus on the long-term price potential. A few estimates reference past cycle patterns, meaning that each downturn sets the stage for higher lows in the next cycle. As the evidence is released, several crypto analysts have aired their views on XRP’s price . CryptoBull analyst has issued some very aggressive short-term targets: $13 in March, $27 in April, and $70 in May. Their estimates center on three-month price momentum. Egrag Crypto, another analyst who has taken a longer perspective by analyzing past market cycles. He cited XRP’s cycle bottom at $0.10 in 2020 and $0.28 in 2022. That is a 2.8-times increase between cycle lows. However, not all forecasts are optimistic. Several institutions have altered their targets as market conditions shift, and many commentators maintain that whale movements and exchange flows continue to shape short-term pricing. Yet even today, recent events still frame XRP’s future. Forecasts, for example, in the long term often take into account how XRP might benefit from greater institutional integration and increased use of its currency in payments or asset settlements. Institutional developments help stabilize XRP Even with the hefty realized losses, XRP has proven relatively strong in the short term. XRP was trading at $1.44 at the time of publication, up 1.55% in the last 24 hours. But it has been down 25.12% in the last month. Its latest move came as the crypto market rebounded, with Bitcoin leading gains. Institutional developments could also underpin sentiment. Japan’s SBI Holdings recently launched a ¥10 billion on-chain bond issuance worth around $64.5 million. What’s also interesting is that the bond’s investors are rewarded in XRP, providing another real-world example of how a token could be used. Elsewhere in Europe, banking giant Société Générale introduced its euro-backed stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible, on the XRP Ledger as part of a multi-chain strategy. Also, XRP spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have posted three consecutive weeks of net inflows, although the speed of new investments is down from previous weeks. Don’t just read crypto news.

Usually, the crypto market experiences a major sell-off following tariff announcements. Even so, the market remained unchanged despite the latest news. The announcement, intended to address trade imbalances and boost US industry, immediately sparked uncertainty among investors about the broader economic outlook and ongoing legal and political battles. Regarding the crypto market, reliable sources noted that Bitcoin’s price was roughly $68,000 and that Ether’s price remained relatively stable at the time the new tariff announcement was made public. Reports noted that Trump opposed the Supreme Court’s decision that restricted his power to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). To demonstrate the intense nature of the situation, the President shared a post on Truth Social noting that, “As President of the United States, I am raising the 10% global tariff on countries that have been taking advantage of the US for many years, without any consequences until my administration came along. This increase will go to a fully allowed and legally tested level of 15%.” He further stated that, “In the coming months, the Trump Administration will decide on and announce new tariffs that are legal.” UK officials raise concerns regarding Trump’s recent tariff decision Concerning Trump’s recent move, Britain’s largest business group swiftly raised concerns about his threatening tariff policy and advised the Government to maintain dialogues with officials in the United States to safeguard the UK’s competitive edge. In a statement, William Bain, the head of Trade Policy at the British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC), stated that, “We were worried that the President’s backup plan could be more harmful for British businesses, and it seems that is indeed the case.” According to him, “This means an additional 5% increase in tariffs on many UK goods exported to the US, except those included in the Economic Prosperity Deal.” Bain’s remarks sparked further tension among individuals when he pointed out that Trump’s decision would negatively affect trade, resulting in a decline in international economic growth and harming US consumers. Seeing these disadvantages, the UK official asserted that tariff hikes are a misguided approach. Meanwhile, he stressed that transparent and stable conditions are essential for firms on both sides of the Atlantic. At this moment, sources revealed that the US president signed an executive order, with congressional approval, to impose a 10% import tax globally. Trump embraced this move just after his earlier reciprocal tariffs, implemented in April of last year under emergency powers, were deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court. In the meantime, analysts are still weighing the potential economic consequences for the UK; nonetheless, officials in the country believe that Trump’s move will not have a substantial effect on most of Britain’s trade with America. Notably, this trade consisted of special steel, cars, and pharmaceuticals deals. As for crypto markets, reports highlighted that the Total3 indicator, a market capitalization index that represents the combined value of all cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH, slipped less than 1% on Saturday, February 21, settling at around $713 billion. Crypto markets encountered a substantial decline amid Trump’s tariff hikes Concerning the recent market behavior triggered by the US president’s tariff decision, analysts conducted research. They found that the price movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum followed a week of heavy investor outflows from significant US exchange-traded funds. To support this claim, sources disclosed that investors in the US pulled out almost $316 million from Bitcoin funds, with only Friday, February 20, showing positive market activity. On the other hand, Ethereum funds saw a major decline, exceeding $123 million. Some key players in the industry that implemented substantial withdrawals from these funds include BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale . Analysts argued that these firms typically make this decision when cryptocurrency prices are declining. Over the past week, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw a downward trend, losing 2% and 5%, respectively. Nonetheless, despite the ongoing withdrawals, reports from SoSoValue stressed that the funds maintain a substantial presence: Net inflows reached nearly $54 billion, bringing total net assets to $85.3 billion.

While the flagship cryptocurrency’s price movement has been largely — and painfully — sideways in recent weeks, this represents a notable improvement from how the month of February started. The new month ushered in a fresh low just above the $61,000 level for Bitcoin, confirming the start of the bear market . Amidst the relative stability in recent weeks, a recent on-chain evaluation suggests that BTC and the broader cryptocurrency mark is still at risk of further downside volatility. BTC’s Future In The Hands Of Large Investors: CryptoQuant In the last bull cycle, the price action of Bitcoin was heavily influenced and impacted by the increased influx and activity of institutional investors (primarily through the spot exchange-traded funds). Similarly, it appears that the large investor cohort will still be at the wheel even during the bear market. According to CryptoQuant’s latest market report , the Bitcoin exchange inflows — and the immediate selling pressure — have normalized since the capitulation spike in early February. This trend can be seen in the decline in exchange inflows from around 60,000 BTC at the start of the month to around 23,000 BTC now. While the acute sell-off phase appears to be easing off, a troubling trend seems to be brewing among Bitcoin’s largest investors. In its market report, CryptoQuant highlighted that the BTC exchange whale ratio has climbed to 0.64, its highest level since 2015, suggesting that whale inflows account for a significant portion of the exchange deposits being seen. Meanwhile, the average BTC deposit size has also reached a level not seen since mid-2022, during the heat of the last bear market. This trend further reinforces the idea that institutional or large investors are behind the increasing exchange supply. CryptoQuant noted that the altcoin market is still facing elevated distribution pressure, with the average daily number of altcoin exchange deposits rising from 40,000 in Q4 2025 to 49,000 in 2026. This continuous capital rotation out of riskier assets reflects weakened market confidence and increases the risk of downside volatility. Meanwhile, the ongoing flow of stablecoins out of exchanges points to a decline in marginal buying power (or “dry powder”) in the Bitcoin market. According to CryptoQuant data, net USDT flows into exchanges have fallen sharply from a one-year high of $616M in November 2025 to only $27M, turning negative at times (-$469M in late January). Ultimately, the combination of the increased selling pressure from Bitcoin’s large holders, rising altcoin distribution, and consistent stablecoin outflows suggests that the crypto market structure remains at risk of further downside volatility.

Indeed, around $3.8 billion has exited Bitcoin ETFs over the last five weeks, as Ether funds follow suit. Meanwhile, a few altcoin-related products are still attracting fresh capital. This trend is happening amid broader questions about BTC’s evolving role in financial markets and the narratives that once brought its popularity to the surface. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States saw net outflows of about $316 million through Feb. 20, the fifth week in a row of capital cashing out of the funds, the longest outflow in close to a year. The pressure began early in a shortened trading week with negative flows on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, but a slight recovery on Friday. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC received small inflows over the last day, which weren’t enough to reverse the overall losses. The most recent round of withdrawals swallowed up billions of dollars of investor capital from BTC products since late January. Bitcoin ETF overall net assets are still very high, but the new trend suggests a shift from near-constant buying to distribution. This move is partly a reflection of Bitcoin’s price action. BTC’s value is around $66,000 and $68,000, sharply down from its all-time highs months before, but below key technical levels that many traders interpret as support or resistance. It is an external reflection of the market’s state of mind. Others warn that if Bitcoin sinks any deeper, it could fall back to lower price tiers, as low as $50,000, before any significant bounce comes into play. That bearish sentiment has played out in flows into ETFs, with big holders seemingly cautious and liquidity askew. Ethereum ETFs extend losses as altcoins gain momentum Spot Ether ETFs also followed Bitcoin’s trend, posting their fifth straight streak of outflows totaling nearly $123 million . At the same time, institutional appetite for Ethereum-linked funds has cooled recently. On the flip side, emerging altcoin ETFs showed resilience. Net inflows from the Solana products totaled around $14 million, continuing a pattern of investor rotation into assets they believe offer growth opportunities beyond BTC and ETH. XRP ETFs also saw minor inflows, albeit at a smaller scale. This internal rotation, in which capital moves between crypto products rather than exiting crypto entirely, challenges the narrative that investors are abandoning digital assets. Instead, it suggests a rebalancing of preferences within the ecosystem, with growing interest in assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin faces an identity crisis beyond price swings During moments of macro uncertainty in early 2026, BTC failed to behave like a hedge asset, unlike gold, which rallied strongly. While flows are shifting, Bitcoin itself is beset by greater questions about its role in markets. According to a recent report, Bitcoin is in the midst of an “identity crisis,” in which its historical narratives no longer hold the authority they once did. Formerly portrayed as digital gold, an inflation hedge, and the best store of value in crypto, Bitcoin faces fierce competition today from other financial technologies and assets. Bitcoin’s price has fallen more than 40% from its peak, analysts say, and the usual catalysts of a rally, dip buyers, or speculative interest have not been there. Instead, gold is becoming a macro hedge, stablecoins are widely used for payments, and prediction markets are attracting speculative activity away from traditional crypto trading. Continuing arguments regarding the use of mining power and technological risks, such as quantum computing, changing AML/KYC regulations, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), all underscore the fact that Bitcoin’s future identity isn’t solely a function of price, but rather depends on how it coexists within a rapidly changing financial and policy context. Collectively, these forces illustrate that the current identity crisis for Bitcoin transcends short-term price volatility and touches on a much broader issue.

While price action often dominates headlines, shifts in distribution metrics can reveal structural changes. A falling NDF suggests that the balance of BTC holdings across different wallet cohorts is evolving, and potentially signaling a redistribution of market participants. What The Network Distribution Factor Actually Measures An advanced on-chain data analytics firm, Alphractal, noted on X that the NDF of Bitcoin is declining sharply, and revealing an important structural shift in how the asset supply is distributed across the market. The NDF measures the proportion of the total BTC supply held by larger holders controlling at least 0.01% of the entire circulating supply. When the metric declines, it indicates that the BTC supply concentration among large holders is decreasing. In practical terms, this shift represents a reduced relative dominance of large holders over the total supply and broader redistribution of BTC among smaller participants and new market entrants. A declining extreme concentration is often seen during early accumulation phases, and a natural redistribution process follows the periods of strong accumulation by large entities. Historically, extended declines in the NDF tend to occur during phases when the market is mature, and the asset becomes more widely distributed. This often occurs after major bull cycles, when large players accumulate supply and are gradually absorbed by the broader market . Rather than signaling weakness, this dynamic can strengthen BTC economic decentralization and reduce structural risk tied to excessive concentration. At the same time, it reflects a transition phase where supply is being redistributed globally, reinforcing BTC’s evolution from a relatively concentrated asset into a widely distributed global financial network. However, this does not signal structural weakness , but rather signals maturation and the expansion of BTC’s ownership base. Why Bitcoin Represents A True Financial Revolution The clearest reasons Bitcoin remains the most compelling asset of our generation are its ownership structure and fixed supply. According to Crypto Patel, roughly 63% of the total circulating supply is held by everyday individual participants, not Wall Street, not the government, or even the institutions. At the core of this thesis, there are only 21 million BTC in existence, and the number is fixed permanently; no central bank can inflate it, no politician can alter the code, and no corporation can dilute holders. In a world characterized by aggressive money printing and currency debasement, BTC stands alone as mathematically enforced scarcity, and the majority of that asset belongs to ordinary individuals. Crypto Patel frames BTC’s decentralized ownership and fixed supply not just as a technology, but as a structural revolution.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto Patel|NDF|Network Distribution Factor,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-22 05:00:58
58313104,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1429349,1771737233,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/58313104.jpeg,Crypto Predicted the Fentanyl Slowdown Months Before Overdose Deaths Fell: Chainalysis,https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-predicted-the-fentanyl-slowdown-months-before-overdose-deaths-fell-chainalysis/,"Cryptocurrency payments to suppliers of fentanyl precursor chemicals began falling in mid-2023, months before overdose deaths declined. This pattern suggests that blockchain data may provide an early signal of disruptions in the illicit drug supply, according to a new report from Chainalysis. Early Disruption in Fentanyl Supply The blockchain data company observed a measurable drop in on-chain payments linked to vendors of chemicals commonly used in fentanyl production well before official mortality statistics reflected a reduction in fatalities. Because overdose data is typically released with delays due to investigation and certification processes, the earlier contraction in crypto transactions points to a potential three-to-six-month lead time between supply chain stress and public health outcomes. The findings suggest that tracking blockchain payments to precursor suppliers could give law enforcement and policymakers an early signal of changes in synthetic opioid supply, alongside traditional measures like drug seizures and overdose death data. The report also documented a sharp rise in cryptocurrency activity tied to suspected human trafficking networks. In 2025, crypto flows to identified services increased 85% year over year, reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. According to Chainalysis, much of that activity is concentrated in Southeast Asia, where trafficking operations overlap with scam compounds, online gambling platforms, and Chinese-language money laundering networks that operate largely through Telegram. The firm identified four primary categories of suspected crypto-facilitated trafficking – Telegram-based “international escort” services believed to traffic individuals, “labor placement” agents recruiting workers for scam compounds, prostitution networks, and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) vendors. Payment patterns vary by category. “International escort” services and prostitution networks rely predominantly on stablecoins, which offer price stability and ease of conversion. CSAM vendors have historically favored bitcoin but are increasingly using alternative Layer 1 networks as well as privacy-focused assets such as Monero, and often turn to instant exchangers that allow rapid swaps without know-your-customer requirements. The company said these changes complicate tracing efforts but still leave observable patterns on-chain. Infrastructure Behind Crypto-Based Exploitation Transaction size data indicates differing operational structures. Over 48% of transfers associated with Telegram-based “international escort” services were recorded to be more than $10,000, indicating organized operations functioning at scale. Prostitution networks demonstrated a higher concentration of transactions between $1,000 and $10,000, which is consistent with mid-tier agency activity. Meanwhile, payments to “labor placement” agents recruiting for scam compounds typically fell within the same $1,000 to $10,000 range. This trend aligns with advertised fees for transporting workers across borders. Victims recruited through these channels are often coerced into operating online fraud schemes under threat of violence, according to prior reporting cited in the analysis. The report also found that some escort and recruitment services are integrated with Chinese-language money laundering networks and “guarantee” platforms that rapidly convert stablecoins into local currencies, thereby reducing exposure to potential freezes. In the CSAM sector, operators increasingly use subscription-based models, which often charge less than $100 per month, to generate recurring revenue. Chainalysis also observed overlap between CSAM networks and online extremist communities, as well as the use of US-based web infrastructure to host surface websites while operators may be located abroad.

The summary section of the release explains that the partnership will develop a support environment for startups seeking to use blockchain technology in financial services. It also assumes the use of “XRP Ledger,” described as being implemented by financial institutions worldwide. The statement focuses on technical support, regulatory response, business design, and business viability. It does not explicitly state that SBI, as a banking group, will directly settle all transactions using the XRP Ledger . However, it does confirm that the ledger is being considered within the scope of blockchain-based financial service implementation.

He stated that XRP will consolidate the global financial system and described it as the only asset designed to sit above the existing system rather than within it. He further claimed that when liquidity moves freely, value will flow to decentralized networks rather than traditional institutions. The commentator also discussed the role of the United States Department of the Treasury in controlling the U.S. monetary supply and asserted that the Federal Reserve has already been shuttered in Washington. He described the current central bank fiat monetary structure as being in a “controlled demolition”, claiming that a new quantum financial system based on blockchain and gold-backed is imminent, identifying XRP as infrastructure for that system.

Data from RWA.xyz shows that XRPL now represents roughly 63% of all tokenized U.S. Treasury supply, a dominant share that highlights its accelerating institutional adoption and strategic relevance in the evolving on-chain finance landscape. Treasury issuance on XRPL has surged to $54.41 million, overtaking volumes on Ethereum, a network long regarded as the dominant infrastructure layer for tokenized assets and decentralized finance. Well, this crossover is more than symbolic; it signals a meaningful shift in institutional capital flows, suggesting that issuers are increasingly choosing XRPL as their preferred on-chain settlement layer. The momentum comes as Wall Street accelerates its blockchain integration, highlighted by the launch of a permissioned decentralized exchange (DEX) on the XRP Ledger. Designed to meet regulatory and compliance standards while preserving blockchain efficiency, the platform bridges traditional finance and decentralized infrastructure. Notably, Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have emerged as one of the most credible, institutionally aligned applications of blockchain technology. Unlike speculative digital assets, these instruments represent regulated, yield-bearing government debt issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and deployed on distributed ledger infrastructure. Their rapid growth signals genuine financial integration, bringing traditional safe-haven assets on-chain, rather than another hype-driven cycle. Further strengthening its value proposition, XRPL has introduced token escrow functionality. This upgrade enables advanced treasury management, programmable and automated transactions, and the development of decentralized marketplaces. By combining regulated real-world assets with enhanced on-chain financial tooling, XRPL is positioning itself as a serious infrastructure layer for institutional-grade digital finance, not merely a venue for speculative trading. XRPL Poised as Front-Runner in Institutional Real-World Asset Tokenization Institutional activity on the XRP Ledger is accelerating, reinforcing its emergence as a serious platform for regulated asset issuance. Dubai’s expanding real estate tokenization initiatives are adding meaningful momentum, showcasing XRPL’s growing role in compliant, real-world asset deployment. At the same time, rising volumes of regulated stablecoins moving across the network are deepening liquidity and improving settlement efficiency, key advantages for cross-border financial use cases. Notably, XRPL now ranks second in 30-day Real World Asset (RWA) growth, underscoring the pace of on-chain adoption and highlighting its strengthening position within the institutional blockchain landscape. Why does this matter? Well, the rapid expansion of real-world assets on the blockchain is emerging as one of the clearest indicators of sustainable adoption. Unlike retail-driven rallies or meme-fueled cycles, tokenized U.S. Treasuries and real estate integrate directly into the existing financial system, delivering tangible utility. This shift signals that institutions are moving beyond experimentation, actively deploying capital and building long-term infrastructure on-chain. Therefore, the XRPL is increasingly being positioned at the center of this transformation. Known for its low transaction costs, high throughput, and near-instant settlement, XRPL’s architecture aligns closely with institutional requirements for efficiency, scalability, and reliability. As a result, the network has seen strong growth in tokenized assets and stablecoins, with total on-chain value surpassing $1 billion, an inflection point that underscores rising institutional participation. Conclusion XRPL’s dominance in tokenized U.S. Treasuries marks more than a market milestone, it signals a pivotal shift in blockchain adoption. As capital moves from speculative assets to regulated, yield-bearing instruments, networks enabling compliant, scalable issuance will drive the next wave of growth. With the largest share of tokenized Treasury supply and rising institutional participation, the XRP Ledger is positioning itself as a central hub for this transformation. Sustained real-world asset growth could cement XRPL not just as a payments blockchain, but as core infrastructure for the digitized financial system of tomorrow.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-22 06:57:14

The forecast was shared alongside a detailed chart of the XRP/USD pair on the three-day timeframe, illustrating a long-term structural pattern that, according to the analyst, supports a sharp upward move. The projection immediately draws attention due to both the magnitude of the target and the compressed timeframe in which it is expected to occur. CryptoBull’s post focuses solely on the technical structure visible on the chart, highlighting what appear to be converging trendlines that suggest a breakout scenario. The #XRP chart shows that price can be $13 by March 11. That’s 21 days from today. pic.twitter.com/dBodswc6Yd — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 20, 2026 Chart Structure and Technical Outlook The chart attached to the post shows XRP trading within an ascending formation on the three-day timeframe. Two prominent trendlines frame the price structure, with the upper boundary extending toward a projected price region marked at $13. The visual representation suggests that, in CryptoBull’s view, XRP is approaching a decisive technical moment. The upper boundary of the formation is drawn to intersect $13, which is prominently displayed on the chart. The implication is that a breakout toward the upper resistance line could coincide with a rapid price expansion. The projection does not include intermediate targets but instead focuses directly on the $13 level within the specified 21-day window. The current price region on the chart appears significantly lower than the projected target, reinforcing the scale of the anticipated move. CryptoBull’s statement is concise and does not elaborate on additional indicators, relying primarily on the structural setup displayed in the three-day timeframe. Counterpoints Raised by Market Participants In response to the forecast, an X user, Jeongmin, offered a more cautious assessment grounded in current resistance levels and broader market context. According to the comment, XRP is presently facing substantial resistance between $1.51 and $1.57, following what was described as a sharp rejection at the $1.66 level. Jeongmin further noted that most institutional projections, including those attributed to Standard Chartered, place XRP closer to an $8.00 year-end target rather than a short-term objective for early March. The comment emphasized the scale of the move required to reach $13 within three weeks, estimating that such a rally would represent nearly an 850 percent increase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The response also acknowledged recent fundamental developments, including the appointment of Brad Garlinghouse to the CFTC and institutional ETF inflows , suggesting these factors may provide underlying support. However, the commenter argued that a rise of the magnitude suggested by CryptoBull would constitute an unprecedented vertical shift within such a short timeframe. As the March 11 date approaches, market observers will closely monitor whether the technical structure outlined by CryptoBull begins to validate the projected trajectory or whether resistance levels continue to constrain price action.

Core Team’s Anniversary Post Met With Fury From Pioneers,https://cryptopotato.com/is-the-pi-network-dream-over-core-teams-anniversary-post-met-with-fury-from-pioneers/,"The team behind the controversial project posted a celebratory message a few days ago, marking the first anniversary of the Open Network’s launch. However, many users questioned the project’s actual use case once again and lashed out at the lack of migration progress. Open Network Celebrates 1st Birthday In its blog post, the team began by outlining some of the achievements reached even before the official launch of the Open Network on February 20, 2025. “Prior to Open Network, the Pi community collectively built out the ecosystem over six years to ensure Pi’s readiness and sustainable utility. This developmental period allowed Pi to create real apps and utilities for Pioneers to engage with, and verify the identities of millions of Pioneers to prepare the network for real-world assets and production processes.” They explained that the main idea of Pi is to be a freely accessible, allowing “anyone to mine without technical or financial barriers.” The team added that this design allowed wide distribution and inclusivity, and also enabled the network and all participants to “afford the patience to engage in the difficult work necessary to establish a fully functional ecosystem predicated on utility.” The post doubled down on the network’s progress, which aligns with the team’s long-term vision and strategy – to create an inclusive, utility-driven, and widely-adopted cryptocurrency that is broadly accessible. Pioneers Lash Out Perhaps it was some of those claims that triggered a significant backlash from numerous Pioneers on X under the Core Team’s post. YouLong/PiNetwork – a popular Pioneer with 27,000 followers, raised a few valid questions about the network’s state and the performance of the underlying token: “What reason is there to celebrate? To celebrate the fact that compliant users have not migrated? Or to celebrate the steady decline in coin prices over the past year since its launch? Please approach the genuine concerns of long-time miners with objectivity.” It’s worth noting that the PI token has been in a free-fall state for nearly a year. It peaked at $2.99 on February 26 last year, but has plunged by 94.5% since then and now sits inches above $0.16. Other users echoed the previous statement, with one adding , “We are tired of waiting for the second migration,” while others said they have been waiting for five or six years for that coin migration.

Crypto analyst BullRunners (@BullRunnersHQ) reported that Ripple’s technology is now integrated into SWIFT’s evolving payment system, signaling a major move toward institutional adoption and practical use. Ripple and SWIFT Collaboration BullRunners explained, “Ripple’s footprint is now baked directly into this new payment stack.” SWIFT, historically the dominant intermediary in cross-border payments, is modernizing its network to incorporate blockchain. HSBC, which has partnered with Ripple through the Medeco Harmonized Platform acquired in 2023, is now a managing partner in SWIFT’s multi-chain blockchain ledger. According to BullRunners, XRP was likely tested on SWIFT rails in Q4 of 2025, further embedding it within large-scale banking operations.

JP Morgan is reportedly participating in the making of SWIFT’s blockchain ledger . BullRunners highlighted that this setup is built for institutional compliance. The XRPL permissioned DEX amendment, which recently passed , provides KYC and AML controls, enabling banks to operate securely. BullRunners noted, “Although this might not feel truly decentralized… at the end of the day, this is what institutions demand before they integrate and operate.” Regulatory Momentum and Market Opportunity Regulatory clarity is enhancing XRP’s position. BullRunners cited Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, stating there is a “ 90% certainty ” that the Clarity Act, a landmark crypto legislation, will pass by April. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has also indicated that regulators should focus on providing clear frameworks rather than reacting to daily market swings. These developments create a more predictable environment for XRP’s integration into mainstream finance. BullRunners emphasized the scale of the opportunity. He referenced Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, noting that the addressable market for crypto spans multiple trillions of dollars, covering payments, lending, and institutional financial services. XRP’s integration into SWIFT and partnerships with major banks position it to capture significant revenue and adoption.

BullRunners highlighted that major financial players choosing XRP over other assets could drive substantial price growth. The combination of SWIFT integration, HSBC involvement, and the permissioned DEX amendment indicates that XRP is moving beyond speculation into practical, on-chain utility for banks and regulated institutions. The integration of Ripple’s blockchain with SWIFT, combined with institutional backing and regulatory clarity, points to a new phase for XRP.

This transaction, valued at approximately $700 million, represents one of the most significant on-chain movements of stablecoin capital into decentralized finance (DeFi) this year, prompting deep analysis of its potential motivations and market-wide implications. Decoding the $700 Million USDT Whale Transfer The sheer scale of this USDT whale transfer immediately distinguishes it from routine crypto activity. Whale Alert, a trusted on-chain analytics provider, first flagged the transaction. Consequently, the crypto community began scrutinizing its details. The transfer originated from a wallet associated with the HTX exchange, formerly known as Huobi. It then moved directly to a wallet connected with the Aave Protocol, a leading decentralized liquidity market. This action is not merely a large withdrawal. Instead, it represents a strategic capital allocation from a centralized trading venue to a decentralized financial application. Such a move typically indicates a holder’s intent to engage with DeFi’s yield-generating opportunities. These opportunities often surpass the passive holding of assets on an exchange. The transaction executed on the Tron network, known for its low fees and high throughput, which is a common blockchain for USDT transfers. Understanding the Key Players: HTX and Aave To grasp the full context of this whale movement, one must understand the platforms involved. HTX is a major global cryptocurrency exchange with deep roots in the Asian market. It provides users with a platform for trading, staking, and custodial services. Aave, in contrast, operates as a non-custodial, open-source liquidity protocol. Users can participate as depositors to supply liquidity and earn passive income, or as borrowers to obtain overcollateralized loans. The fundamental difference lies in control and utility. On HTX, the exchange controls the private keys to user funds. On Aave, users retain control through self-custody wallets. This transfer, therefore, signifies a shift of capital from a centralized, custodial model to a decentralized, user-controlled financial system. The table below outlines the core distinctions: Feature HTX (Centralized Exchange) Aave (DeFi Protocol) Custody Custodial (Exchange holds funds) Non-Custodial (User holds keys) Primary Function Trading, Spot & Derivatives Lending, Borrowing, Earning Yield Access Requires KYC/Account Permissionless, Global Access Yield Source Staking, Exchange Programs Interest from borrowers’ fees Expert Analysis of Whale Motivation Market analysts and on-chain researchers point to several plausible motivations for such a substantial capital movement. Firstly, the entity likely seeks a competitive yield on its stablecoin holdings. Aave frequently offers attractive supply Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) for USDT, especially during periods of high borrowing demand. Secondly, the whale may be preparing to leverage its position. By supplying USDT as collateral on Aave, the holder can borrow other assets to pursue additional investment strategies, a common practice known as “DeFi leveraging.” Furthermore, this transfer could signal a broader trend of institutional or sophisticated capital migrating toward DeFi’s transparent and programmable financial rails. The timing is also critical. Movements of this magnitude often precede or respond to significant market events, such as anticipated volatility, changes in monetary policy sentiment, or the launch of new DeFi products that require substantial liquidity seeding. Immediate Market Impact and Liquidity Effects The immediate effect of this USDT whale transfer is a direct injection of liquidity into the Aave protocol. A deposit of $700 million significantly boosts the total value locked (TVL) in Aave’s markets. This action enhances the protocol’s liquidity depth, which can lead to: Lower borrowing rates: Increased supply can reduce interest rates for borrowers seeking USDT loans. Increased protocol stability: Larger liquidity pools can better handle large withdrawals without impacting rates. Market sentiment shift: Such a confident move can be interpreted as a bullish signal for DeFi’s robustness and utility. Conversely, the withdrawal of $700 million from HTX represents a substantial outflow from the exchange’s reserves. While HTX maintains deep liquidity, large outflows are monitored as indicators of user sentiment and exchange health. This single transaction highlights the fluid nature of capital in the digital asset space, where billions can move between platforms in minutes based on yield differentials and strategic outlooks. The Broader Context of Stablecoin Flows in 2025 This event occurs within a specific macroeconomic and regulatory landscape. In 2025, stablecoins like USDT have solidified their role as the primary settlement and liquidity layer within crypto markets. Their movement between centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized protocols (DeFi) is a key metric for gauging market risk appetite and capital allocation trends. A steady flow into DeFi suggests a preference for yield and self-custody, while flows into CEXs often precede active trading or a flight to simpler custody. The transaction also underscores the maturation of blockchain infrastructure. Transferring $700 million across networks securely and with minimal cost was a significant technical challenge just years ago. Today, it is a routine, albeit notable, event. This reliability builds trust among large-scale participants and is a foundational element for the next phase of institutional adoption of decentralized finance. Conclusion The transfer of 700,000,001 USDT from HTX to Aave is far more than a large number on a blockchain explorer. It is a clear signal of sophisticated capital seeking yield and utility within the decentralized finance ecosystem. This USDT whale transfer underscores the deepening interconnection between centralized and decentralized finance, highlights the competitive dynamics of yield generation, and demonstrates the massive scale that modern blockchain networks can facilitate. As the DeFi sector continues to evolve, monitoring such liquidity movements will remain crucial for understanding market trends, risk sentiment, and the shifting landscape of global digital finance. FAQs Q1: What does a “whale transfer” mean in cryptocurrency? A whale transfer refers to a transaction involving a very large amount of cryptocurrency, typically initiated by an entity or individual (a “whale”) holding substantial funds. These moves are closely watched as they can influence market prices and signal the strategies of major players. Q2: Why would someone move USDT from an exchange like HTX to Aave? The primary reasons are to earn yield and retain self-custody. By supplying USDT to Aave, the holder can earn interest from borrowers. Additionally, moving funds off a centralized exchange to a DeFi protocol like Aave means the user controls the assets via a private key, reducing counterparty risk. Q3: Is a $700 million transfer safe on the blockchain? Blockchain transactions are cryptographically secure. The safety depends on the network’s integrity (e.g., Tron) and the user’s security practices. A transfer of this size would undergo rigorous verification by network validators. The main risks are user error (like sending to a wrong address) or smart contract risk once the funds are deposited into Aave. Q4: How does this transfer affect the price of USDT or other cryptocurrencies? A transfer of this size itself does not directly affect the market price of USDT, as it is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. However, it can indirectly influence the market by signaling whale confidence in DeFi, potentially affecting the prices of governance tokens like AAVE or the general sentiment in the crypto market. Q5: Can anyone see who made this whale transfer? Blockchain transactions are transparent and pseudonymous. Anyone can see the sending and receiving wallet addresses and the transaction amount on a block explorer. However, the real-world identity of the wallet owner is not revealed unless they publicly associate themselves with the address.

Key Takeaways: SBI is issuing 10 billion yen in tokenized bonds recorded on a blockchain platform. Investors will earn fixed interest plus XRP rewards tied to their subscription amount. The launch reflects SBI’s broader push to integrate crypto assets into traditional finance. The new issuance, called the SBI START Bonds , totals 10 billion yen (about $64.5 million) and will be recorded and managed onchain using the “ibet for Fin” platform developed by enterprise blockchain firm BOOSTRY. The three-year securities carry an indicative annual yield ranging from 1.85% to 2.45%, with interest paid twice a year. SBI Bond Investors to Receive XRP Rewards Alongside Interest Payments In addition to fixed returns, eligible investors will receive XRP token rewards. Retail buyers and companies investing at least 100,000 yen (roughly $650) and holding an account with SBI VC Trade qualify for the bonus program. According to the product details, investors will receive XRP equivalent to about 200 yen per 100,000 yen invested. The rewards will be distributed at issuance and again alongside each interest payment through 2029. The bonds are expected to begin secondary trading on March 25 via the Osaka Digital Exchange’s proprietary START trading system, marking another step in Japan’s gradual rollout of tokenized securities markets. SBI’s move reflects its long-standing ties to the XRP ecosystem. The firm partnered with Ripple in 2016 and has since supported XRP-powered remittance services, including cross-border payments between Japan and the Philippines. Chairman and CEO Yoshitaka Kitao has previously said SBI holds roughly 9% of Ripple Labs, underscoring the company’s strategic alignment with the network. Founded in 1999 as part of SoftBank before becoming independent in 2006, SBI has grown into a major financial group with more than $8 billion in annual revenue.

SBI has also worked with Circle to introduce the USDC stablecoin in Japan and signed a memorandum of understanding with Ripple to distribute its RLUSD stablecoin. By pairing bonds with crypto incentives, the firm is testing whether traditional investors will adopt tokenized securities that offer familiar yields alongside blockchain-based settlement and rewards. In August last year, Ripple signed a memorandum of understanding with SBI Holdings and its crypto arm SBI VC Trade to distribute its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin in Japan. Ripple Secures UK Regulatory Approval Amid Global Expansion The rollout comes amid Ripple’s broader expansion across regulated markets. Earlier this month, the company received approval from the UK’s financial regulator for an Electronic Money Institution license and crypto asset registration. Ripple has also secured preliminary approval for a similar license in Luxembourg , positioning the firm to expand its payments services across Europe. In the United States, Ripple applied for a national banking license with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in July 2025, joining a growing list of crypto firms seeking deeper integration with the traditional financial system. In recent months, the company has also secured approvals in Dubai and Abu Dhabi and onboarded partners including Zand Bank and Mamo. As reported, Ripple is also weighing whether to bring staking to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , a move that would push the decade-old blockchain deeper into the rapidly expanding world of decentralized finance.

A February 5 report showed that the project’s co-founder had sold off 2,961 ETH ($6.6 million at the time) in just three days. A day later, Lookonchain informed that the total sales had grown to 6,183 ETH, which was valued at $13.2 million. The average exit price was $2,140. Arkham Intelligence keeps a close eye on Buterin’s addresses, and a report from earlier this week noted that he still held more than 240,000 ETH, valued at around $467 million. However, that data was before today’s sell-offs. Meanwhile, ETH’s price has been on a consistent downtrend for months. After it peaked at close to $5,000 in late August last year, it was violently rejected and ended 2025 at around $3,000. The late January/early February crash was brutal, pushing the asset to under $1,800. Although it has recovered some ground since then, Ether still struggles below $2,000. Popular analyst Ali Martinez outlined the formation of a bullish flag yesterday for ETH, but with a major catch: the chart was inverted, showing in reality that ETH could be primed for another correction to under $1,400.

XRP saw 1.66B tokens locked in futures, driving a 2.56% rise in open interest in 24 hours, hinting at a potential turning point after weeks of downward pressure, according to analyst VinCoop. Well, XRP has surged to $1.42 , gaining 2.4% as momentum builds per CoinCodex data. Rising open interest hints at renewed trader confidence, but also signals caution, as leverage may be rising. Bulls remain anchored to a 9-year support, eyeing a potential $10 target. On the other hand, XRP ETFs saw no inflows or outflows in the latest session, signaling muted institutional activity. With retail traders driving derivatives markets, the divergence underscores a market shaped more by speculation than by deep-pocketed, long-term investors. XRP at a Crossroads: Rising Futures Open Interest Signals Volatility Ahead Why does this matter? Well, If XRP’s price rises alongside gradual OI growth, bullish momentum could strengthen, laying the groundwork for a sustained recovery. Nevertheless, a sudden OI surge without spot-market support risks a leveraged squeeze, forcing rapid unwinds and sharp price swings. Notably, weekly and monthly RSI now dip below 2020 lows, signaling that a potential bottom and reversal may be forming. XRP futures just saw a massive 1.66 billion token commitment, signaling that traders are bracing for volatility rather than calm. Leverage is returning, and the next price move will test market conviction. This surge does not confirm a sustained breakout. Rising optimism is tempered by structural risk: retail traders are speculating, but institutional participation remains absent, keeping caution high. Momentum may build, but so could sharp corrections if leverage overheats. Still, XRP has climbed to a five-week sentiment high, defying broader market pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, a keen eye should be given to growing open interest as to whether it translates into lasting gains, or if the market is merely setting up another leveraged trap. The coming sessions could determine whether this is the start of a genuine uptrend or just another wild swing in the crypto rollercoaster. Conclusion With 1.66B XRP locked in futures, the market signals readiness for movement rather than calm. Early momentum is promising, but the gap between active retail derivatives trading and sidelined institutions highlights structural risk. Therefore, it remains to be seen if rising open interest supports spot gains or signals leverage overextension. XRP’s near-term path hinges on whether this momentum can hold without sparking a sharp correction, a key test that could define its next chapter.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-22 08:59:23

As the latest trading session closed on February 20, the Bitcoin ETFs have now experienced five consecutive weeks ending on a red note, as combined net outflows within this period climbed to $3.81 billion. Investors’ Exit From Bitcoin Spot ETFs Continue According to data from SoSoValue , the Bitcoin ETFs registered $315.89 million in net outflows in the third week of February. Notably, trading commenced on Tuesday with a negative showing that lasted for three days, resulting in aggregate net withdrawals of $403.9 million. On Friday, the institutional funds saw a positive change, as total net inflows reached $88.04 million, albeit still far from breaking the multi-week red streak. More data from SoSoValue showed that BlackRock’s IBIT processes $303.4 million in net outflows, accounting for most of the bearish action as has been frequently observed. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC investors withdrew $19.60 million more than deposits. Other ETFs with significant negative readings included Grayscale’s GBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and 21Shares/Ark Invest’s ARKB, with net outflows ranging from $8 million to $10 million. Valkyrie’s BRRR experienced the least net redemption activity, valued at $1.7 million. On the other hand, Grayscale’s BTC registered $35.97 million in net inflows to maintain a positive showing for the third consecutive week. Other Bitcoin Spot ETFs, including VanEck’s HODL, Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Hashdex’s DEFI, all recorded zero netflow, highlighting a concerning reluctance in market participation by institutional investors. At press time, Bitcoin is valued at $68,357 as the cumulative total net inflow for the Bitcoin Spot ETFs stands at $54.01 billion, while total net assets are valued at $85.31 billion. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT maintains undisputed market dominance, accounting for 60% of the reported assets under management. Ethereum ETFs Mirror BTC Counterparts Based on data from SoSoValue, the Ethereum ETFs are experiencing a persistent struggle similar to that observed with Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Over the last week, total net outflows reached $123.37 million, ensuring the institutional funds are yet to record a combined positive net flow in over six weeks.

In 2029, the DOT price is expected to range from a maximum of $6.32 to a minimum of $5.16. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $18.44 in 2032. Polkadot (DOT) is a next-generation blockchain network designed to connect and secure multiple blockchains, enabling them to share data and operate together seamlessly. Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot aims to solve key issues such as scalability, interoperability, and security through its unique multi-chain architecture. The network’s central relay chain coordinates specialized blockchains known as parachains, allowing transactions to be processed in parallel for greater efficiency. DOT, the native token, is used for network governance, staking to secure the ecosystem, and bonding to add new parachains, making it a core component of Polkadot’s growing Web3 infrastructure. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2026-2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $1.34 Market Cap $2.238B Trading Volume $94.98M Circulating Supply 1.667B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $1.15 Feb 06, 2026 24-hour High $1.39 24-hour Low $1.34 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 15.07% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $1.77 14-Day RSI 42.03 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 9 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $2.77 Polkadot price analysis DOT is compressing around $1.33 after a +29% rebound from $1.10, but upside momentum is slowing. Failure to reclaim $1.40 keeps DOT range-bound with $1.22 support at risk. A break above $1.46 sustains a bullish continuation. Polkadot daily price chart As of February 22, DOT is trading at $1.334, down -1.84% on the session after printing a high at $1.365 and rejecting near the upper Bollinger Band at $1.467. The price remains compressed between the 20-day SMA around $1.344 and the lower band near $1.221, reflecting a market that has stabilized after the sharp selloff from the late-January $1.95 area to the recent swing low near $1.10, a drawdown of roughly -43%. DOT/USDT 1-day price chart The rebound from $1.10 to $1.42 marked a +29% recovery, but momentum is flattening as candles cluster around $1.33–$1.36 without expansion. MACD has crossed bullish and sits slightly positive, yet histogram growth is modest, suggesting recovery momentum is present but not accelerating. A daily close above $1.36 opens the path toward $1.46, while a loss of $1.30 exposes $1.22 and potentially a retest of $1.10. The structure is transitioning from impulsive recovery to range-bound compression, which typically precedes a volatility expansion. Polkadot 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, DOT is trading around $1.335, down -0.60%, after rejecting from the $1.39–$1.40 intraday high. The Alligator lines have converged, signalling trend exhaustion after the push from $1.27 to $1.40, a +10% move. DOT’s price is now slipping back toward the jaw/teeth cluster around $1.33–$1.34, reflecting short-term indecision. DOT/USDT 4-hour price chart The MACD remains slightly positive, but histogram bars are shrinking, indicating bullish momentum is fading rather than reversing aggressively. If $1.33 fails decisively, the next support levels sit near $1.30 and $1.27. Holding above $1.33 keeps the structure constructive and allows another attempt at $1.40. The inability to break and hold above $1.40 is the key near-term weakness. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.64 SELL SMA 5 $1.50 SELL SMA 10 $1.37 SELL SMA 21 $1.37 SELL SMA 50 $1.77 SELL SMA 100 $1.98 SELL SMA 200 $2.77 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.51 SELL EMA 5 $1.64 SELL EMA 10 $1.80 SELL EMA 21 $1.88 SELL EMA 50 $2.09 SELL EMA 100 $2.49 SELL EMA 200 $3.07 SELL What can you expect next for Polkadot (DOT)? DOT is consolidating after a sharp relief bounce, with higher-timeframe stabilization but weakening short-term momentum. Unless $1.40–$1.46 breaks convincingly, expect continued sideways action between $1.22 and $1.40, with risk skewed slightly bearish if $1.30 gives way. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot (DOT) shows cautious short-term price behavior, trading in a tight range between $1.25 and $1.30. For investors, this range-bound movement suggests monitoring price action carefully before committing, as the market is currently indecisive. Long-term potential depends on Polkadot’s continued network development, adoption, and overall crypto market conditions. Traders seeking short-term gains should wait for a clear breakout above resistance or breakdown below support, while long-term investors may consider DOT’s technology and ecosystem growth as part of their evaluation. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot (DOT) is down today, trading at $1.27, largely due to cautious market sentiment and short-term profit-taking. Traders are closely watching the $1.25 support level, and minor selling pressure has contributed to the 1.77% decline. Broader crypto market volatility and consolidation in major tokens also weigh on DOT’s price. Investors remain hesitant as the market navigates a tight range between $1.25 and $1.30, reflecting uncertainty before a potential breakout or further dip. Will Polkadot reach $10? Yes, according to long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $10 by 2031. Will Polkadot reach $15? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $15 by 2032. Will Polkadot reach $100? Reaching $100 for Polkadot (DOT) is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Does Polkadot have a promising long-term future? Based on Polkadot’s ongoing buying demand and positive community support, the DOT price is set to make new highs in the coming years. However, you are advised to do your research before investing in the volatile market, especially considering future performance. Recent news/opinion on Polkadot Polkadot’s new smart contract upgrade, launched on January 27, has seen a slow start with only 19 contracts deployed in its first week.

Crypto analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) shared a chart showing this formation, noting that “the chart can’t stay in this triangle after 8 years.” The pattern, visible since 2018, shows converging highs and lows, signaling that a significant shift may be imminent. XRP Long-Term Trend and Triangle Analysis The chart displays a series of lower highs and higher lows, forming a symmetrical triangle over 8 years. This structure indicates that XRP’s performance relative to Bitcoin has been consolidating for an extended period. Each peak has been lower than the previous, while each trough has held above the prior low. CryptoBull’s analysis emphasizes that this consolidation cannot continue indefinitely. Historically, prolonged patterns like this often precede decisive moves in one direction. The closer the price approaches the apex of the triangle, the higher the likelihood of a breakout. Reminder: The #XRP vs Bitcoin chart can’t stay in this triangle after 8 years. It has to breakout in March pic.twitter.com/6NLQFe2cFX — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 20, 2026 Will XRP Break Out? The upper boundary of the triangle represents resistance formed by previous highs in 2018 and 2025. The lower boundary, tracing support from 2018, 2020, and 2024 lows, has consistently prevented prolonged declines below the trend line. While XRP’s 2024 low took it below the triangle, it recovered quickly to print 500% rally before the year ended . Current monthly candles suggest XRP is now testing the upper portion of this structure. According to CryptoBull, March could be pivotal for XRP. A breakout above the upper boundary would mark a shift in trend relative to Bitcoin. Such a move would indicate that XRP may outperform Bitcoin over the coming months. The analyst recently predicted that XRP could hit $4 by March 2 and $9 by March 11 . He has consistently expressed optimism for XRP, and the current chart suggests a massive breakdown is imminent. Traders and investors will likely monitor these levels closely for confirmation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? Over the past 8 years, XRP has displayed periods of sharp gains followed by extended consolidation. The large upward movement in 2018, followed by subsequent declines and recoveries, formed the initial structure of the triangle. Later spikes in 2021 and 2025 reinforced the pattern’s limits, shaping the current channel. If XRP breaks above the triangle, it may trigger strong buying pressure versus Bitcoin. This scenario aligns with CryptoBull’s observation that the chart cannot remain confined, and XRP could hit a new all-time high in the next few weeks.

Most larger-cap alts have produced little to no volatility as well over the past day, but some, such as Pi Network’s native token, have slipped once again. BTC Calm at $68K Bitcoin marked some gains last weekend after it bounced from the then-low of $65,200. In just a few days, it jumped to almost $71,000 for the first time in about a week. This Sunday surge, though, came to an end as the business week began, and a few consecutive leg downs by the bears drove the asset down to $65,600 on Thursday. It tried to rebound on Friday and Saturday again, as the bulls managed to take it to a local peak of $68,800. Interestingly, these minor gains came even after some controversial moves on the tariff front, a topic that has typically resulted in more volatility and price declines for BTC. On Friday, the US Supreme Court ruled that many of Trump’s imposed tariffs were illegal. The POTUS was livid, calling the decision a “disgrace,” and quickly announced a global 10% tariff on top of the existing ones. On Saturday, he raised it to the maximum allowed of 15%. Although bitcoin now trades below its weekend high, it’s still around $68,000. More volatility could be expected on Sunday evening when the futures markets open, similar to what happened several weeks ago during the EU tariff saga over Greenland. For now, though, BTC’s market cap stands at $1.360 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 56.6%. BTCUSD Feb 22. Source: TradingView PI Declines (Again) Pi Network’s first anniversary after the launch of its Open Network has not had any positive effect on the underlying asset’s price performance. PI is among the poorest performers in the past 24 hours, losing 6% of value and struggling below $0.165. Other notable losers include ETC (-8%), ARB (-7%), and ENA (-7%). In contrast, PIPPIN has jumped by more than 17% to almost $0.60. Most larger-cap alts are also in the red, albeit in a more modest manner. DOGE, ADA, and HYPE have lost the most value (around 3% each), while XRP, LINK, and CC are down by 1%. ETH, SOL, TRX, and BCH have marked insignificant gains.

This comprehensive analysis examines Zcash price predictions from 2026 through 2030, exploring the fundamental drivers that could shape the privacy coin’s trajectory. Recent regulatory developments and technological advancements create a complex landscape for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies worldwide. Zcash Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Landscape The year 2026 represents a pivotal period for Zcash price movements according to multiple cryptocurrency analysts. Several factors will influence ZEC valuation during this timeframe. Firstly, broader cryptocurrency market adoption typically drives attention toward specialized assets like privacy coins. Secondly, regulatory clarity around privacy technologies will significantly impact investor sentiment. Thirdly, technological upgrades to the Zcash protocol could enhance its competitive position. Historical data shows that Zcash often experiences volatility during major network upgrades. The upcoming transition to new proof mechanisms may affect mining economics. Additionally, institutional interest in privacy solutions continues growing steadily. Major financial institutions now explore privacy-preserving technologies for legitimate business applications. This institutional validation could provide substantial support for Zcash’s long-term valuation. Expert Perspectives on Medium-Term Growth Cryptocurrency research firms present varied but generally optimistic Zcash price predictions for 2026. These projections consider multiple variables including transaction volume growth and protocol development. For instance, increased adoption of shielded transactions would demonstrate real-world utility. Furthermore, partnerships with privacy-focused applications could expand Zcash’s use cases beyond simple value transfer. Privacy Coin Market Dynamics Through 2027 The privacy coin sector faces unique challenges and opportunities as we approach 2027. Regulatory environments continue evolving across different jurisdictions. Some nations embrace privacy technologies while others impose restrictions. This regulatory fragmentation creates both risks and potential arbitrage opportunities for Zcash. Market analysts monitor these developments closely when formulating price predictions. Technological innovation represents another crucial factor. Zcash’s zk-SNARKs technology maintains its position as leading privacy cryptography. However, competing solutions emerge regularly. The Zcash development community must continue advancing their technology to maintain competitive advantages. Network security and scalability improvements remain ongoing priorities that could influence price trajectories. Zcash Price Prediction Ranges 2026-2030 Year Conservative Estimate Moderate Estimate Optimistic Scenario Key Drivers 2026 $45-65 $65-95 $95-140 Regulatory clarity, adoption metrics 2027 $60-85 $85-125 $125-180 Technology upgrades, market share 2028 $80-115 $115-160 $160-230 Institutional adoption, use cases 2029 $100-145 $145-210 $210-300 Mainstream integration, competition 2030 $130-190 $190-280 $280-400 Market maturity, global adoption Market analysts emphasize that these Zcash price predictions represent scenarios rather than guarantees. Actual outcomes depend on numerous unpredictable variables. The cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility requires cautious interpretation of any long-term projections. Investors should consider these estimates as frameworks for understanding potential trajectories. Technological Foundations Driving Zcash Valuation Zcash’s unique technological architecture provides the foundation for its price potential. The cryptocurrency utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable two transaction types. Transparent transactions function similarly to Bitcoin’s public ledger. Shielded transactions offer complete privacy through advanced cryptography. This dual approach addresses different user needs and regulatory requirements. Several technological developments could significantly impact Zcash price predictions: zk-SNARKs advancements: Ongoing improvements to privacy technology efficiency Scalability solutions: Layer-2 implementations and protocol optimizations Interoperability features: Cross-chain privacy capabilities with other networks User experience enhancements: Simplified privacy tools for mainstream users The Electric Coin Company, Zcash’s primary development organization, maintains an active roadmap. Their commitment to research and development provides confidence in the protocol’s continued evolution. However, development timelines and implementation success remain uncertain variables in any price prediction model. Comparative Analysis with Privacy Coin Alternatives Zcash operates within a competitive privacy coin ecosystem. Monero, Dash, and newer entrants all offer different approaches to transaction privacy. Each project makes distinct technological and philosophical choices. Zcash’s optional privacy represents both a strength and potential limitation. Regulatory acceptance often favors this approach over mandatory privacy implementations. Market share dynamics within the privacy sector will influence Zcash price movements. Network effects could create winner-take-most scenarios if one solution achieves dominant adoption. Alternatively, multiple privacy coins might coexist serving different niches. The evolving regulatory landscape will likely determine which approaches gain mainstream acceptance. Macroeconomic Factors Influencing 2028-2030 Projections Long-term Zcash price predictions must account for broader economic conditions. Cryptocurrency markets increasingly correlate with traditional financial markets during certain periods. Interest rate environments, inflation trends, and geopolitical developments all impact risk asset valuations. Privacy coins might demonstrate different correlation patterns than mainstream cryptocurrencies during market stress. Digital privacy concerns continue growing globally. Data breaches and surveillance capitalism drive demand for privacy solutions. This societal trend could benefit privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Zcash. However, regulatory responses to these concerns might restrict certain privacy technologies. The tension between individual privacy rights and regulatory oversight creates uncertainty for price predictions. Institutional adoption represents another crucial variable. Traditional financial institutions gradually incorporate blockchain technologies. Their approach to privacy features will significantly influence Zcash’s trajectory. Some institutions might embrace Zcash for specific use cases while avoiding it for others. This selective adoption could create specialized rather than universal demand. Risk Factors in Zcash Price Predictions All cryptocurrency price predictions involve substantial uncertainty. Zcash faces specific risks that investors must consider. Regulatory actions represent the most significant near-term risk factor. Governments might restrict privacy coin transactions on regulated exchanges. Such restrictions could reduce liquidity and accessibility despite continued technological utility. Technological risks also merit consideration. While zk-SNARKs technology appears secure, theoretical vulnerabilities might emerge. Additionally, competing privacy technologies could achieve superior performance or adoption. Quantum computing advancements represent a longer-term concern for all cryptographic systems including Zcash’s implementation. Market competition creates another risk dimension. New privacy solutions emerge regularly with different approaches and trade-offs. Some might better balance privacy, regulatory compliance, and usability. Zcash must continue innovating to maintain its competitive position. Community support and development funding remain crucial for sustained advancement. Conclusion Zcash price predictions from 2026 through 2030 reflect cautious optimism about privacy coin growth. The fundamental drivers include technological advancement, regulatory developments, and broader cryptocurrency adoption. While substantial uncertainty surrounds any long-term prediction, Zcash’s unique value proposition positions it for potential growth. Investors should monitor key indicators including shielded transaction adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological milestones. The privacy coin sector likely faces volatility but offers compelling opportunities as digital privacy concerns intensify globally. FAQs Q1: What makes Zcash different from other privacy coins?

Yes, Zcash enables private transactions for individuals and businesses requiring financial privacy, with growing adoption in specific sectors valuing transaction confidentiality. Q5: How does regulatory development affect Zcash price predictions?

Key Takeaways: Spot Bitcoin ETFs posted a fifth straight week of withdrawals, losing about $316 million and roughly $3.8 billion over the streak. Midweek selling outweighed Friday inflows, showing cooling institutional demand despite stable prices. Capital appears to be rotating within crypto funds, with Ether also seeing outflows while Solana and XRP products drew inflows. Data from SoSoValue shows the 12 funds collectively lost about $316 million during the week ending Feb. 20. Trading activity was compressed into four sessions due to the Presidents’ Day holiday, and the first three days all closed negative. Bitcoin ETFs Post Heavy Midweek Outflows Despite Friday Rebound Roughly $105 million exited on Tuesday, followed by $133 million on Wednesday and $166 million on Thursday. A modest recovery on Friday, when $88 million flowed back into the products, was not enough to reverse the weekly trend. BlackRock’s IBIT led the rebound with about $64.5 million in inflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC added roughly $23.6 million. The current run of outflows began the week of Jan. 20 and has removed around $3.8 billion from the Bitcoin ETF complex. The last comparable stretch occurred nearly a year ago during a tariff-driven market sell-off that also weighed on risk assets. While the duration of the streak matches that period, the magnitude has been smaller, with the heaviest withdrawals concentrated in late January when funds lost $1.33 billion and $1.49 billion in consecutive weeks. Bitcoin's entire history in 89 seconds! As of Feb 2026, the numbers: Individuals: 13.15M BTC ETFs & Funds: 1.6M BTC Companies: 1.17M BTC Governments: 647K BTC Institutions and companies are buying. But the majority of individuals are still HODLing! Video… pic.twitter.com/13kEHTr52Y — Sumit Gupta (CoinDCX) (@smtgpt) February 20, 2026 More recent weekly losses have ranged between roughly $316 million and $360 million. Despite the withdrawals, the ETF market remains substantial. Cumulative net inflows since launch in January 2024 still total about $54 billion, and aggregate net assets stand near $85.3 billion. Bitcoin has traded around $68,600, down more than 20% year to date and below a key onchain level identified by analysts as separating expansion from consolidation phases. Ether funds showed a similar pattern, losing about $123 million during the week and extending their own five-week streak of withdrawals. By contrast, newer products tied to Solana attracted approximately $14.3 million in inflows, while XRP-based funds recorded a modest $1.8 million gain. The divergence suggests capital is rotating within crypto investment products rather than leaving the sector altogether, with investors repositioning across assets as sentiment remains cautious rather than panicked. Trump Media Files for Bitcoin, Ether and Cronos ETFs With Staking Rewards Last week, Trump Media and Technology Group filed applications for two cryptocurrency ETFs that would track Bitcoin, Ether and the Cronos (CRO) token, expanding the company’s involvement in digital assets. The proposed “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ether ETF” would primarily follow the performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies, while the “Truth Social Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF” would provide exposure to CRO. The Cronos-focused fund would also offer staking rewards, with Crypto.com serving as custodian and providing liquidity and staking services. Trump Media has also signaled interest in integrating blockchain beyond ETFs. The company recently said it intends to distribute a new digital token to shareholders on the Cronos network and previously disclosed plans for a corporate crypto treasury involving CRO.

58322901,https://timestabloid.com/?p=97790,1771754449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin (BTC) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Why Investors Are Paying Attention,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-and-mutuum-finance-mutm-why-investors-are-paying/,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate headlines as the benchmark cryptocurrency in 2026. But while BTC shines, investor attention is also turning to new projects with early-stage growth potential. One such project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is capturing investor interest as the next big crypto thanks to its DeFi-focused utility and attractive entry price. With both established and emerging assets on the radar, MUTM is being highlighted as a top crypto to invest in for those seeking diversification beyond legacy assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin Faces Resistance Around Key Supply Zones Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading near $66,200, encountering resistance within highlighted supply zones where sellers have historically stepped in. This has drawn the attention of investors as the price structure indicates repeated hesitation, limiting upside momentum, and keeping BTC range-bound in the short term. While Bitcoin remains a central pillar of the crypto market, its consolidation has coincided with growing interest in emerging projects, as some investors seek higher returns with Mutuum Finance. Multi-Layered Oracle Security for Lending Mutuum Finance protects its lending ecosystem through a multi-layered oracle structure. Rather than relying on a single price feed, the protocol uses Chainlink Price Feeds as the main reference while incorporating fallback oracles and an internal Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) system for cross-verification. This architecture ensures asset valuations remain accurate even during extreme market volatility or feed disruptions, mitigating the risk of manipulation. The system actively shields borrowers from sudden market shocks. If the price of an asset on a major exchange deviates sharply from the Chainlink feed beyond a preset threshold, the platform temporarily freezes that market to prevent harmful liquidations. For example, if a sudden market anomaly shows SOL trading at $10 on one exchange, the fallback system disregards the outlier and maintains loan calculations based on the verified average market price. This protects users’ positions from both accidental and malicious market events. Early Participation Unlocks Exceptional Returns Investing in MUTM during the early presale phases means positioning for the biggest returns. Analysts anticipate the token could climb to $0.65, and an investor buying at $0.04 during Phase 7 would see a 16.25x return. In contrast, waiting until the final presale phase at $0.06 would reduce that return to just 10.8x, a significant difference that could separate moderate profits from transformative wealth. Mutuum Finance’s presale success, which has led to over $20.62 million raised from more than 19,020 participants, is underpinned by the protocol’s advanced DeFi features. These include a multi-layered approach to price security for loans, leveraging Chainlink oracles, while a successful V1 Protocol launch positions the token on track for a $0.65 post-listing rally. The combination of operational reliability and growth potential positions MUTM as a prime candidate for the next big crypto. Hands-On Experience on Testnet Mutuum Finance’s V1 Protocol is now live on the Sepolia testnet, offering users an interactive way to explore its decentralized lending and borrowing ecosystem. Investors can deposit test assets to receive mtTokens, while borrowers are issued debt tokens that transparently record their obligations on-chain. The platform’s automated liquidator bot monitors positions to maintain protocol health. Currently, the testnet supports USDT, ETH, LINK, and WBTC, with plans to integrate additional chains and tokens when the project fully launches. This hands-on environment allows participants to familiarize themselves with a functioning DeFi protocol without risking real assets. Bitcoin remains the market anchor, but investors seeking exponential upside are paying attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next big crypto. Priced at just $0.04 in Phase 7 of its presale, with over $20.60 million raised, MUTM offers a DeFi lending platform protected by multi‑layered oracle security and a live testnet for hands‑on experience. Early participation could deliver 16x returns after launch, making MUTM a top crypto to invest in for those targeting high‑growth diversification.

A bold number. Both are on the table for Bitcoin this week as a debate over how to read short-term streaks in price gains grows louder. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Bleeds $1 Trillion, Saylor Signals Strongest Crypto Conviction Yet Crypto analyst Timothy Peterson has pointed out that half of the last 24 months showed positive returns. Based on reports, he then gave a nearly 90% chance that Bitcoin would be higher in 10 months. That leap from a simple count to a firm probability is the headline grabber. It should be met with careful questions about how the odds were calculated and what assumptions were built into the model. Counting Positive Months Peterson based his view on a review of monthly performance data. Figures compiled by CoinGlass show that Bitcoin closed six months of 2025 in positive territory, while the remaining six finished lower. According to the data, 50% of the past 24 months ended with gains. Peterson said he tracks this rolling two-year window to spot potential turning points in price trends. 50% of the past 24 months have been positive. This implies a 88% chance that Bitcoin will be higher 10 months from now. The average return is exp(60%)-1 = 82% => $122,000. Data goes back to 2011. https://t.co/k4IjTisuTH pic.twitter.com/ZxfTyequjt — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) February 21, 2026 Market Odds And Betting An exchange of bets shows a very different view. Polymarket currently prices December as only a 17% shot at being the best month of 2026, with November a hair higher. Those numbers answer a different question from Peterson’s: they reflect market bets on which month will outperform others, not whether the price will simply be higher at a future date. Betting markets can be blunt tools, but they do pack the collective view of many traders into a single number. Bitcoin Price Action Price has not been calm. Bitcoin traded in a roughly $67,000–$68,000 band this week as geopolitical tension in the Middle East tightened. Safe-haven assets like gold and oil jumped on news flows, and Bitcoin felt the squeeze as some buyers stepped back. At the same time, live tickers showed the token about 20% below its level at the start of the year, a reminder that headline percentages hide wide intraday swings. Analysts Are Split Voices from the trading desk are divided. Michael van de Poppe suggested near-term green candles could be coming, urging traders to watch for a lift. On the other hand, Peter Brandt has argued a deeper low may not arrive until late 2026. Both views rest on different sets of signals — one on momentum and chart structure, the other on longer cycle patterns and risk of macro shocks. Sentiment Still Down Meanwhile, flow data from spot ETF purchases, derivatives positioning, and on-chain liquidity figures would add weight to any forecast.

The Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump’s tariffs are illegal. Crypto pundit Levi Rietveld drew attention to this ruling, as the 6-3 decision opens the door to $150 billion in potential tariff refunds. Rietveld emphasized the scale of the decision. He noted, “The refund process is likely going to be a mess.” He added that Trump is preparing backup plans to ensure the refunds are only temporary. These maneuvers could trigger intense volatility across the cryptocurrency market. MAJOR WHITEHOUSE $XRP BOMBSHELL UPDATE (THIS IS CRAZY) pic.twitter.com/PaVqlqtWu1 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) February 20, 2026 Potential Impact on XRP The ruling introduces uncertainty in U.S. economic policy, which often directly influences digital assets. XRP, known for its responsiveness to regulatory and macroeconomic shifts, could experience significant price movements. In early 2024, the tariffs caused a notable price drop across the market, and these refunds could have the opposite effect. The combination of potential liquidity from refunds and market speculation may fuel upward momentum for the token. Rietveld highlighted that Trump’s plans could create conditions for rapid price changes. “With what Trump is planning to do, it’s going to cause crazy volatility in the crypto industry ,” he said. This statement suggests traders and investors may prepare for short-term spikes and rapid fluctuations in XRP’s market value. Financial Consequences Beyond Law The Supreme Court ruling is not just a legal matter. It has financial consequences that could extend into crypto. With $150 billion potentially moving through the economy, digital assets like XRP could benefit from increased capital inflows . Traders may view XRP as a liquid option to navigate emerging market conditions influenced by tariff refunds and policy adjustments. Rietveld’s analysis also points to the strategic nature of the upcoming moves. He mentioned that Trump has a backup plan following the court’s decision, which could influence both the speed and scale of financial flows into markets. XRP could see accelerated adoption as institutions and retail investors position themselves for volatility.

If the refunds begin to circulate, XRP could benefit from both speculation and strategic positioning. Volatility will likely intensify before any stable trends emerge, creating opportunities for both short-term gains and longer-term investment. Rietveld’s update suggests that crypto participants should stay alert. The Supreme Court’s decision, combined with Trump’s planned actions, creates a dynamic environment for XRP.

Now They’re Fighting for It Once dismissive of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as risky or illegitimate, traditional banks are now rushing into the digital asset space. From skeptics in 2017 to active participants in 2026, this dramatic shift highlights how crypto is redefining global finance, says analyst VinCoop. Well, Neobanks are feeling the squeeze as users treat them as mere salary transit points, swiftly moving funds to crypto exchanges to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other assets. This outflow has hit liquidity, lowered average balances, and eroded customer retention, forcing the sector to adapt fast, just as Bitcoin’s Lightning Network surpasses $1B in monthly volume. Specifically, financial giants including AMEX, PayPal, Visa, JPMorgan, and BlackRock are aggressively hiring blockchain and crypto experts, signaling a shift from skepticism to strategic adoption. These institutions aren’t just offering custody, they’re building the infrastructure to retain crypto-savvy clients, unlock new revenue streams, and compete with fintech and decentralized finance platforms. The High Stakes of Bitcoin Adoption in Traditional Finance Bitcoin , now trading at $68,060 per CoinCodex data, is no longer just a speculative asset, it’s a benchmark for modern finance. Institutional adoption signals banks’ push to reclaim deposits, drive transactions, and engage a digital-native generation. The market also shows signs of reverting to its traditional four-year cycle. Well, VinCoop observes that crypto adoption is as much cultural as technological. Banks are adapting to volatile markets, complex regulations, and innovative digital products, reshaping traditional models to stay relevant. Bitcoin is no longer optional, once-skeptical institutions now view it as essential, fueling a high-stakes race for a rapidly expanding market. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise and major banks’ rapid pivot signal a seismic shift in global finance. What was once seen as speculative is now strategic. Early adopters can reclaim capital, attract new clients, and secure the future of money, signalling that digital assets have moved from fringe speculation to core strategy.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|BTG|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-22 10:06:27

According to the latest on-chain data, there might be a fresh answer as to where the price bottom will be in the current bear market. Here’s Why $40,000 Could Be Pivotal To The Bear Market In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified the $40,000 level as a potential bottom for the Bitcoin price in the current market phase. This projection is based on the cost basis of an old investor cohort known as the long-term holders (LTH) For context, the cost basis of long-term holders refers to the average price at which Bitcoin investors (who have held their coins for 155 days or more) acquired their coins. This price level is often relevant because long-term investors are often referred to as diamond hands, who are less likely to sell during periods of downside volatility. Moreover, the LTH cost basis tends to act as the ultimate support level during bear markets, as most long-term investors are usually still in profit even in the thick of the bear market. Hence, when the Bitcoin price falls to this support, the long-term holders double down on their positions. This renewed buying activity by the long-term holders would prop up the price of the premier cryptocurrency above their cost basis, as observed in the chart above. According to the highlighted data, the LTH cost basis is currently around $40,363, about 40% from the current price point. If the Bitcoin price were to face further downside pressure and approach this cost basis, there is a likelihood it would receive support from the long-term investors’ increased reaccumulation. Hence, this cost basis could become the bottom for the current bear market. On the flip side, the Bitcoin market could face an even deeper correction if the selling pressure overwhelms the long-term holders’ reaccumulation spree. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $68,330, reflecting a nearly 1% increase in the past 24 hours. However, this mild single-day action does little to correct the over 2% price decline witnessed by the premier cryptocurrency over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price is currently down from its all-time high by more than 45%.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|BTC Long-Term Holder Cost Basis|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-22 11:00:44

Here’s the Proof,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-by-far-the-most-used-asset-on-the-xrpl-heres-the-proof/,"XRP continues to dominate the XRP Ledger in terms of transaction volume. According to a detailed analysis covering October 1, 2019, to April 30, 2020, XRP accounted for 125 billion units over seven months, averaging 586 million XRP per day. This makes it the most used currency on the ledger by a significant margin. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) shared this data in response to claims that institutions could use the XRP Ledger without XRP, relying instead on stablecoins or other assets. The data clearly supports XRP’s central role . The ledger records show that payment activity overwhelmingly favors XRP, not alternative tokens. Yes, XRP is “by far the most used currency on the ledger in terms of payment volume.” Of course it’s documented. https://t.co/bcUil7E3zn pic.twitter.com/wNVD44judU — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) February 20, 2026 Concentration Among Top Accounts The data shows that the distribution of XRP transactions was also concentrated. The top 10 senders processed 53% of the total volume, while the top 10 receivers captured 50%. Ripple accounted for 7% of activity, or 9 billion XRP, mainly from monthly 1 billion XRP escrow releases . Most escrowed funds were unused, but still added to Ripple’s transaction share. Exchanges played a major role in XRP flows. Binance led activity by sending 15.2 billion XRP and receiving 14.5 billion during the observation period. Other major exchanges, including Bithumb, Coinbase, Bittrex, and Bitso, also appear as key participants in XRP transfers. XRP Compared to Other Tokens XRP dominates the ledger compared with fiat tokens. USD, EUR, and CNY appear with much smaller volumes: 328M USD, 8M EUR, and 19M CNY. On-ledger exchange rates averaged 5.4 XRP/USD, 5.5 XRP/EUR, and 0.7 XRP/CNY, matching off-ledger values, but transaction volumes remain minimal compared to XRP’s activity. The ledger’s data indicates that XRP remains the primary medium of exchange, with other currencies used mostly as secondary or niche instruments. This activity shows the token’s liquidity, accessibility, and utility within the ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Use and Network Function SMQKE’s point reinforces that XRP is not optional for the ledger’s core payments activity. While some suggest institutions could rely on other assets , the actual flows demonstrate heavy XRP usage. Payments, settlement, and account liquidity all rely predominantly on XRP. The ledger’s transparency enables clear tracking, which reveals that XRP facilitates the majority of value transfer. Ripple has revealed that XRP is at the core of its plans , and this data backs that stance. XRP’s activity on the ledger demonstrates both scale and concentration. High-volume accounts, major exchanges, and regular escrow-related flows all contribute to its dominance. The ledger shows a structured and consistent pattern of XRP usage that other tokens do not match. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Led by the Dubai Land Department in collaboration with Ctrl Alt and secured through Ripple Custody, the initiative enables controlled secondary-market trading of tokenized properties directly on the XRP Ledger. Robert Farquhar, CEO of MENA at Ctrl Alt, welcomed the initiative, emphasizing : ”Native tokenization only reaches its full potential when assets can move efficiently post-issuance, and secondary market trading is essential to that outcome. By establishing robust tokenization infrastructure that supports the regulated transfer of tokenized land title deeds, Dubai is setting a global benchmark for how assets can be issued, traded, and managed on-chain.” Phase Two expands on a successful pilot that tokenized 10 high-value properties worth over $5 million (AED 18.5M), issuing 7.8 million tokens representing fractional ownership. These tokens can now trade in a regulated secondary market, unlocking unprecedented liquidity and access in Dubai’s real estate sector. Leveraging the XRP Ledger, which commands a 63% share of the tokenized U.S. Treasury market and outpaces Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum, this initiative sets a new benchmark for secure, efficient property tokenization. Dubai Advances Tokenized Real Estate The project prioritizes transparency, governance, and investor protection. Secondary trading operates within a controlled pilot on the distribution platform, seamlessly aligning with land registry processes and safeguarding transaction integrity. All on-chain activity runs on the XRPL, leveraging Ripple Custody to ensure secure, immutable records. Ctrl Alt, the tokenization infrastructure provider, drives Phase Two of Dubai’s Real Estate Tokenization Project. Building on Phase One, where it minted the original title-deed tokens, Ctrl Alt now powers secondary market trading and manages both ownership and Asset-Referenced Virtual Asset (ARVA) tokens. These on-chain tokens enable regulated transfers and maintain a single, immutable record of property ownership, fully synchronized with Dubai Land Department systems. Meanwhile, Wall Street is poised to go on-chain with a permissioned decentralized exchange (DEX) launching on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This milestone signals more than a technical breakthrough, it’s a major leap toward mainstream adoption of tokenized real-world assets. By digitizing property ownership and enabling fractional trading, Dubai is democratizing real estate investment while boosting market efficiency. With XRP Ledger’s new token escrow supporting treasury management, automated transactions, and decentralized marketplaces, Phase Two is transforming Dubai’s pilot program into a fully regulated, scalable ecosystem. The initiative showcases blockchain’s potential to make high-value assets transparent, liquid, and accessible, positioning Dubai as a global leader in regulated digital asset innovation and attracting significant international capital as tokenized markets grow. Conclusion Phase Two of Dubai’s Real Estate Tokenization Project highlights the city’s drive to fuse innovation with regulatory precision. By putting $5 million in property assets on-chain and issuing 7.8 million tokens for regulated secondary-market trading, Dubai sets a new global standard for transparency, liquidity, and accessibility in real estate. The initiative modernizes property ownership and cements Dubai’s role as a leader in blockchain adoption for real-world assets, making investment opportunities more inclusive, secure, and efficient.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-22 11:02:54

This analysis provides a detailed, evidence-based examination of the Memes AI (MEMESAI) price prediction for 2026 through 2030, scrutinizing its underlying technology, market position, and the realistic potential for significant value appreciation. Memes AI Price Prediction: Foundation and Tokenomics Memes AI operates at the convergence of two dominant crypto narratives. The project leverages AI for meme generation and community engagement, creating a dynamic ecosystem. Consequently, any price prediction must first consider its foundational elements. The token’s utility within its native platform drives fundamental demand. For instance, users might spend MEMESAI to access premium AI tools or participate in governance. Market analysts consistently emphasize tokenomics as a primary price driver. A clear vesting schedule for team and investor tokens prevents sudden supply shocks. Furthermore, the project’s burn mechanisms or staking rewards can directly impact circulating supply. Historical data from similar AI-driven tokens in 2024 shows that projects with transparent and sustainable economic models experienced more stable growth. Expert Analysis of Supply Dynamics Financial technologists point to on-chain metrics as critical indicators. Active wallet addresses and transaction volume provide real-time insight into network health. A 2024 report from Blockchain Analytics Group demonstrated that tokens maintaining a high utility-to-speculation ratio outperformed purely speculative assets by over 300% across a three-year horizon. Therefore, Memes AI’s price trajectory will heavily depend on actual platform adoption, not just market sentiment. Market Context and Comparative Analysis for 2026-2030 The broader cryptocurrency market cycle profoundly influences individual asset performance. Projections for 2026-2030 must account for macroeconomic factors like regulatory developments and institutional adoption. The memecoin sector, while volatile, has shown remarkable resilience and capacity for viral growth. However, AI tokens add a layer of technological substance that pure memecoins often lack. We can analyze potential scenarios through a comparative framework: Year Bull Case Scenario Base Case Scenario Bear Case Scenario 2026 Widespread AI tool adoption drives utility demand. Steady user growth with moderate price appreciation. Market downturn or failed platform feature rollout. 2027-2028 Integration with major social platforms; ecosystem expansion. Consolidation of market position within AI-meme niche. Increased competition erodes market share. 2029-2030 Established as a leading cultural-AI crypto asset. Mature, utility-driven token with lower volatility. Technological obsolescence or regulatory challenges. Several key factors will determine which path Memes AI follows: Technology Execution: The reliability and innovation of its AI meme-generation engine. Community Strength: The size and engagement level of its holder base. Partnerships: Strategic alliances with other Web3 projects or traditional platforms. Roadmap Delivery: Consistent achievement of published development milestones. Assessing the Potential for a 10x Rally The question of a tenfold price increase requires dispassionate, data-backed reasoning. First, we must define the starting price point and timeframe. A 10x rally from a 2025 baseline to a 2030 peak is mathematically different from a 10x surge within a single year. Historical crypto data reveals that such exponential gains typically require a confluence of factors. These factors often include a major product launch, a viral marketing event, or a paradigm shift in how the token is used. For example, if Memes AI’s technology becomes the standard for a new form of digital advertising or social media interaction, demand could skyrocket. Conversely, if the project fails to differentiate itself in a crowded market, growth may remain linear or stagnant. Veteran crypto investors, like those cited in 2024’s “Institutional Digital Asset Review,” often apply risk-adjusted return models. They weigh the probability of high-growth outcomes against the significant volatility inherent in emerging crypto sectors. Therefore, while a 10x rally is within the realm of possibility for any promising altcoin, it represents a high-risk, high-reward outcome dependent on flawless execution and favorable market conditions. The Role of AI and Meme Synergy The unique proposition of Memes AI lies in its hybrid model. AI provides a tangible utility layer—content creation—that can generate sustainable revenue. The meme component provides cultural relevance and community virality. This combination could potentially buffer the token against downturns in either pure-DeFi or pure-meme sectors. Success hinges on balancing technological depth with accessible, engaging user experiences. Conclusion This Memes AI price prediction analysis underscores the complexity of forecasting crypto assets, especially those blending emerging technologies with cultural trends. The trajectory for MEMESAI from 2026 to 2030 will likely be non-linear, shaped by its ability to deliver real utility, grow its community, and navigate an evolving regulatory landscape. While ambitious growth is possible, investors should prioritize understanding the project’s fundamentals and the broader market context over speculative price targets. The most realistic outlook involves monitoring key adoption metrics and technological milestones to gauge its long-term potential accurately. FAQs Q1: What is the main utility of the Memes AI (MEMESAI) token? The primary utility centers on accessing and powering the platform’s AI-driven meme creation tools. Holders may use tokens for transaction fees, premium features, and participating in community governance decisions regarding the platform’s development. Q2: How does Memes AI differ from other memecoins? Unlike many memecoins reliant solely on social sentiment, Memes AI incorporates a functional AI layer. This provides a foundational product and potential revenue stream beyond speculative trading, aiming to combine viral culture with substantive technology. Q3: What are the biggest risks to this price prediction? Key risks include technological failure of the AI platform, intense competition from other AI or meme projects, adverse cryptocurrency regulations specifically targeting utility tokens, and broader bear markets that reduce capital flow into altcoins. Q4: Can historical memecoin performance guide this forecast? Historical performance offers context regarding volatility and community-driven pumps, but direct comparison is limited. The added AI utility component makes Memes AI a novel asset class, meaning its price drivers may differ from predecessors like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data on MEMESAI’s progress? Investors should monitor the project’s official announcements and verified social channels for roadmap updates. On-chain data from block explorers provides transparent metrics on holder distribution and transaction activity, while independent audits of the AI technology and smart contracts verify security and claims.

Key Takeaways: Elliptic identified five Russia-linked crypto exchanges providing pathways to bypass Western sanctions. Only one platform is formally sanctioned, yet several processed large transactions with restricted entities. Activity has shifted across multiple services, suggesting enforcement actions redirect rather than halt flows. The study identifies five trading platforms , most of them not formally sanctioned, that continue to provide channels for high-volume crypto transactions beyond the oversight of the traditional banking system. The findings arrive as European officials consider tighter measures, including a potential blanket ban on crypto transactions involving Russia, amid concerns that new platforms are emerging to replace previously targeted operators. Elliptic: Nearly 10% of Bitpapa Transactions Tied to Sanctioned Targets Among the exchanges examined, only the peer-to-peer marketplace Bitpapa is under US sanctions. The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated the platform in March 2024 for alleged sanctions evasion. Elliptic found that about 9.7% of Bitpapa’s outgoing transactions were linked to sanctioned entities and that the exchange frequently rotated wallet addresses to make monitoring more difficult. The report also highlights ABCeX, an unsanctioned exchange operating from Moscow’s Federation Tower, the same building previously used by Garantex before US authorities seized its domains in March 2025. Elliptic estimates ABCeX has processed at least $11 billion in crypto, with significant transfers flowing to Garantex and another exchange, Aifory Pro. JUST IN: European Union proposes banning all crypto transactions with Russia to prevent sanctions evasion. pic.twitter.com/4FlGZJJorB — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) February 10, 2026 Another case involves Exmo, which said it exited the Russian market after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by selling its regional operations to a separate entity, Exmo.me. Elliptic’s analysis suggests operational ties remain: both services appear to share custodial infrastructure and pooled hot wallets. The firm recorded more than $19.5 million in transactions between Exmo and sanctioned exchanges, including Garantex, Grinex and Chatex. Rapira, registered in Georgia but maintaining a Moscow office, was also flagged after sending over $72 million directly to sanctioned exchange Grinex. Authorities in Russia reportedly raided Rapira’s offices in late 2025 over suspected capital transfers to Dubai. The fifth platform, Aifory Pro, operates cash-to-crypto services in Moscow, Dubai and Turkey. The company reportedly offers virtual payment cards funded with USDT that allow Russian users to access services restricted by Western providers. Elliptic also traced nearly $2 million from Aifory Pro to the Iranian exchange Abantether. Sanctions Shift Activity, Illicit Crypto Volume Hits Record High Researchers say the network illustrates how enforcement actions can shift activity rather than eliminate it. After the shutdown of Garantex, transaction volumes rose on other exchanges, according to data from multiple analytics firms. Chainalysis reported that illicit crypto addresses received a record $154 billion in 2025, while TRM Labs produced a similar estimate of $158 billion. As reported, Russia’s industrial crypto mining sector continued to expand in 2024, with the country’s two largest operators, BitRiver and Intelion, generating a combined $200 million in revenue and accounting for more than half of the legal market.

Direct Knowledge of Ripple’s Leadership Eric Trump revealed that he personally knows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. He stated, “ I know Brad very well , and XRP. And, you know, he’s done a great job.” This direct connection demonstrates a level of familiarity with Ripple’s leadership that is rare among public figures. Trump’s comments indicate that he closely follows the network’s development and understands the platform’s trajectory. He also commended Garlinghouse, who has led Ripple for almost a decade . Under his leadership, XRP gained regulatory clarity in the U.S. and has seen significant adoption worldwide. Trump’s comments suggest the CEO has done a good job, and the majority of the XRP army agrees with him.

Big moves happen quietly. XRP keeps winning. pic.twitter.com/zm4XzYsJm1 — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) February 20, 2026 Broader Crypto Perspective While XRP was central in his remarks, Trump also addressed other leading cryptocurrencies. He expressed confidence in Ethereum, noting that he recommended buying it during a dip, and that it has since performed strongly. He described Bitcoin as “digital gold” and has previously called it the currency of the future . He also called Ethereum “the oil by which all financial systems are going to run on.” These remarks show Trump’s broader awareness of the cryptocurrency market and its key players, positioning him as informed on both the technology and its market trends. XRP’s Position in the Market Trump’s comments reinforce XRP’s status as a major digital asset. By highlighting Ripple’s leadership and signaling personal familiarity, he supports the asset’s credibility. XRP’s consistent performance and ongoing adoption in institutional settings align with this perspective. Observers can infer that leadership engagement and real-world use cases can aid the token’s upward trajectory. Eric Trump’s remarks suggest he strategically monitors digital assets. He indicated that his support for Ethereum was based on early observation of price movements. Applying similar attention to XRP implies awareness of the asset’s market potential and utility .

Although it has recovered some ground since then, the cryptocurrency is deep in the red even on a year-to-date scale. Santiment investigated which investor group sold off during the months-long correction, and which increased their positions. Who’s Selling and Buying? The post from the analytics company reveals an interesting pattern. It reads that wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 bitcoins have reduced their positions by 0.8% since the October peak. In contrast, micro investors, those with 0.1 BTC or less, have increased their holdings by 2.5% within the same timeframe. The analysis reads that this behavior from both groups does not suggest an upcoming price reversal. “Optimally, we begin to see these two Bitcoin groups begin to reverse course. Without key stakeholder support, any spark of a rally will tend to be slightly limited due to the lack of large capital,” Santiment said, before indicating that retail investors have remained undeterred, currently holding the highest amount in nearly two years. Bitcoin Investor Behavior. Source: Santiment ETF Investors Flock Unlike the small discrepancy between the two investor groups examined by Santiment, those who gain exposure to the largest cryptocurrency through ETFs have shown a clear and painful trend. In the two weeks leading to the asset’s all-time high of over $126,000, they poured in over $6 billion into the funds. Since then, red has dominated almost every week, with multiple $1 billion or more net outflow examples. In three consecutive weeks in early November, they withdrew more than $3.5 billion. This behavior continued into the new year, and the spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently on a massive red streak of five weeks in a row in the red. Data from SoSoValue shows that these investors pulled out $1.33 billion during the week that ended on January 23. Another $1.49 billion followed, but the silver lining is that the net inflows have decreased to under $360 million in the past three weeks. Nevertheless, the total net inflows into the spot BTC ETFs have declined from $62.77 billion in early October to $54 billion last Friday. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Net Flows.

MSTY's options strategies—covered calls and call spreads—allow investors to capture premiums while limiting downside, making it attractive in stagnant or declining MSTR scenarios. MSTR maintains robust reserves, supporting over 30 months of dividend coverage and 53 years with BTC reserves, mitigating payout and solvency risks. Supportive U.S. crypto policy and prudent management of options strategies position MSTY as a compelling vehicle for income-focused exposure to MSTR. Introduction The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) is a fund that aims to provide weekly income for investors by selling call options or call spreads on Strategy ( MSTR ). This allows investors in the fund to capture premiums for income while participating in some of the upside and appreciation of MSTR. See below for details of the fund, from the website . YieldMax MSTY is a buy because it provides consistent income for investors and limits the raw exposure to MSTR, which is a volatile name that experiences heavy swings due to Bitcoin swings. Below, we will outline some recent news and highlights of the underlying company, MSTR. Recent news that impacts MSTR The firm remains steadfast throughout the swings that have occurred in Bitcoin Despite all of the ups and downs that Bitcoin investors have faced over the past few months, MSTR and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor remain bullish on the currency long term. Just last week, the firm disclosed a purchase of BTC in the form of 2,486 new coins for a total of $168.4M. See the image below from MSTR that highlights their recent purchases as well as their overall cost basis. Strategy As you can see, the firm’s average cost basis on BTC is $76K, which for now remains above the current prices of BTC at around $66.7K. This delta is where Saylor and the people who believe in the mission of MSTR can argue that on a long-term basis, these swings in the currency, and therefore the stock, are meaningless and do not dilute the overall thesis. MSTR is becoming more of a financial engineering company The firm, late last year, announced a pivot of its maturity based convertible debt into perpetual preferred stock, which should help to reduce its future ongoing refinancing risk and dampen credit-based volatility across its balance sheet. The firm offers “perpetual dividends” in the form of 4 different instruments: Stride, Stretch, Strike, and Strife. These sum to combined annual dividends for their holders of over $876M. To minimize distribution risk on these instruments based on the volatility of the BTC market, the firm also has a $2.25B reserve, which reduces the payout risk and allows the firm more options to fund these distributions. See the below details on this arrangement from the website of MSTR. Strategy As you can see, even though the stock is down 63% on a 1-year basis, the firm still has enough reserves across its portfolio to cover 30.1 months of dividend coverage as it stands today. With their BTC reserves, they have enough to cover over 53 years of ongoing dividends for their investors. MSTR, clearly, has been engineered well enough to sustain its creditor operations for the foreseeable future despite the BTC volatility. The current administration is very supportive of crypto assets, and this is a strong tailwind for the industry as a whole The Trump administration has clearly outlined their bullishness on the crypto industry as a whole. In fact, just earlier today the President’s sons, heads of World Liberty, hosted a forum on crypto in America. This is consistent with the news and releases that have come out of the White House, including this Presidential Action that was released in 2025 that emphasizes the President’s desire to turn America into the epicenter of digital financial technologies. We believe that this push from the administration will serve as a strong push for the industry overall, and that this momentary dip in the markets should be considered a long-term buying opportunity. Additional actions such as forming the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve also prove that the administration is supportive of digital assets, and BTC should remain a strong long-term play. This backing from the administration should provide relief to investors in the long run, and this short-term weakness should be nothing but an opportunity for those looking to establish a position. BTC is notoriously volatile, and these swings are to be expected. Options Strategy The fund’s main strategy is to purchase shares of MSTR and then sell covered calls on those shares. An alternate strategy employed is the covered call spread strategy. Both of these strategies are considered “synthetic” because the fund does not directly buy the shares of MSTR. Instead, they purchase option contracts in a manner that mimics the same returns as you would get by owning the shares. For this analysis, we will assume that the fund is buying the shares directly. The overall strategy works out the same. Let’s look at the primary strategy of covered calls using an example scenario: We purchase 100 shares of MSTR at $100 per share We sell a covered call with a strike price of $110 and make $200 in premiums The below chart compares this strategy with the strategy of just buying the shares (no options traded). Doodad Capital The chart has the following properties: At generally lower prices, the “with option” strategy is better. At the higher end of the range, the shares only strategy is better Why is this the case? It has mainly to do with the option premium and strike price. When the shares of MSTR go above the strike price (in this case $110), the purchaser of the option will exercise the option and buy 100 shares from you for $110 each. You will then be left with no positions because the shares are sold and the option contract is closed. This is why the blue line flattens past $110. Below $110, the only impact of the option is the premium you gained. This is why the option strategy is better at lower prices of MSTR. Overall, with this strategy, we see that the best scenario after selling the call options is for the share price to go as close to $110 as possible without going over. Assuming you already own the shares of MSTR, the covered call strategy is best when you think the price of MSTR will decline, or at least not increase by much. The other strategy employed by the fund is the covered call spread. With this strategy, the fund also buys shares of MSTR. However, instead of selling a single call, the fund instead will buy a call option at a strike higher than the current share price and then sell a call option at an even higher strike. We will use this scenario: Buy 100 shares of MSTR at $100 per share We buy a call option at a $110 strike for $300 We sell a call option at a $120 strike for $150 Doodad Capital In this strategy: At generally lower prices, the shares-only strategy is better At generally higher prices, the covered call spread strategy is better In this case we are starting at a deficit of $150. This is because buying a call at a lower strike will cost more than buying one at a higher strike. That is why, without exercise impacts (aka below the lowest option strike of $110), the shares-only strategy is better. However, at higher prices, the $110 strike we purchased will start returning value. After we lose some opportunity value of the shares, we will be obligated to sell. However, that will be more than offset by the returns on the $110 strike option. As stated in the prospectus about the covered call spread strategy, “The Adviser will primarily employ this strategy when it believes that the share price of its Underlying Security is likely to rise significantly in the short term.” The fund does not explicitly specify when they used the covered call strategy, but we can infer that they will use it when they believe MSTY will drop or only increase modestly in the short term. These strategies are aligned with our analysis above. Similar ETF Comparison and Comparison to MSTR We look at other MSTR based ETFs to see how MSTY stacks up: Seeking Alpha We see that in terms of AUM, MSTY is the biggest. In terms of expense ratio, it’s one of the lowest, however, by about 50% compared to the most expensive one ( MSTP ). We also looked at the total performance (which includes dividends) comparison of the funds. The general trends are similar, but we can see that MSTY is clearly beating the pack with only ~54% loss in the last year compared to ~76% loss for the next best ( MSTW ) and ~94% loss for the worst one ( MSTX ). Overall, MSTY stacks up favorably compared to similar options. Seeking Alpha Over the past year, holding MSTY would have been slightly better than holding MSTR outright, as you can see from this chart. This is a total return chart, which includes the income that MSTY would have provided to its investors. It has outperformed its underlying holding over the past year, which is a strong reason for investors to consider a position in MSTY. Risks Management efficacy As we discussed, there are 2 different strategies the fund employs. Generally speaking, one strategy is better when the stock is predicted to increase in value, and another strategy is better when the stock is predicted to remain stagnant or decrease in value (assuming you already own the shares). In either case, it is up to management to make the right prediction and employ the appropriate strategies at the appropriate strike prices and premiums. These are a lot of decisions to make, right? And of course, the stock market is notoriously difficult to predict. Near-term volatility can cause increased selling pressure on MSTR As BTC continues to swing, there remains the risk that MSTR becomes more and more underwater on its treasury. However, as all of its BTC holdings are unencumbered , meaning that they are not pledged as collateral on anything, the firm has a large amount of flexibility before it may face any solvency issues. This risk remains low for now. Conclusion MSTY is a fund that allows investors to gain income on a very volatile asset, which is further amplified by the swings of BTC. However, this ETF shields investors from a significant amount of this volatility, and we rate it a buy. MSTR remains a solvent vehicle for BTC investments, and the Executive Chairman is the most outspoken long-term BTC bull. If the management can prudently employ the strategies discussed, MSTY can be a great vehicle for investors to gain exposure to MSTR while also making a little extra income.",MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-02-22 12:17:07

At the same time, the underlying asset has struggled to maintain the price resurgance from last week, and now trades over 10% lower. Where Did the Ripple ETF Demand Go? Canary Capital’s XRPC was met by investors with open arms, breaking the 2025 debut-day trading volume record on November 13. Four more products tracking the altcoin followed suit, and the total inflows quickly skyrocketed to over $1 billion. However, it has been mostly plateauing since then, and even some weeks deep in the red. For example, investors pulled out $40.64 million during the week that ended on January 23, and another $52.26 million the following week. The next one was more positive, with $39.04 million in net inflows. The trend changed then: the interest and demand are nowhere to be found. Two weeks ago – on February 11 – the ETFs had no reportable daily flows , with SoSoValue showing a clear “$0.00” for the first time since the products’ inception. This behavior worsened last week when there were two such days – February 17 and February 20. Even the other two showed little interest: $2.21 million in net outflows on February 18 and $4.05 million in net inflows on February 19. Since Monday was a national holiday in the US and the markets were closed, this meant that half of the business days had no actual trading volume to report. As such, it’s no surprise that the cumulative net inflows have remained flat at $1.23 billion. Ripple (XRP) ETF Flows. Source: SoSoValue XRP Price Falls Somewhat unexpectedly, Ripple’s native cross-border token jumped hard by double digits last weekend, going to a multi-week peak of over $1.65 despite the lack of ETF action. However, this sporadic price pump was short-lived, and the asset quickly lost traction. It returned to $1.40 mid-week and even dipped below that level on a couple of occasions. It has managed to defend that support as of press time, but it’s still more than 10% down weekly. Aside from ETF investors who had displayed a serious lack of interest in the asset, data shared by popular analyst CW shows that short traders continue to dominate the XRP landscape. Nevertheless, a recent report by Santiment suggested that XRP could be slightly undervalued at the moment, according to the 30-day MVRV ratio. Moreover, the skyrocketing amount of realized losses could lead to a significant price rebound for Ripple’s token, as it has happened in the past. In fact, it led to a 114% surge back in 2022 when such losses were last observed.

For technology-focused investors weighing new assets, understanding the real drivers behind Bitcoin’s value matters more than hype. This guide shines a light on Bitcoin’s speculative core, persistent misconceptions, and artificial scarcity, helping you see how its unique design and volatility could fit into a forward-thinking, diversified portfolio. Key Takeaways PointDetailsUnderstanding Bitcoin's NatureBitcoin is primarily a speculative asset, lacking the intrinsic value of traditional currencies or commodities like gold.Volatility as a Risk FactorBitcoin's price volatility can undermine its utility as a stable medium of exchange, making proper allocation essential.Role of Institutional AdoptionGrowing institutional participation enhances Bitcoin's market stability, transforming it into a more legitimate portfolio asset.Strategic Portfolio InclusionBitcoin should be seen as a supplementary investment within a diversified portfolio, focusing on growth potential while managing risk. Bitcoin's Core Value and Misconceptions Bitcoin's value proposition rests on a few core claims that deserve scrutiny. Understanding what Bitcoin actually is—and isn't—separates informed investors from those chasing hype. The most persistent misconception frames Bitcoin as ""digital gold"" with intrinsic value. This narrative appeals to investors seeking a safe haven asset, but the reality is more complex. What Bitcoin Actually Is Bitcoin functions as a speculative asset rather than a stable monetary standard. Research analyzing Bitcoin's monetary claims reveals structural shortcomings that limit its role as money. Key characteristics that define Bitcoin: A decentralized digital ledger without government backing or central authority Scarce supply capped at 21 million coins through cryptographic protocol Network secured through proof-of-work mining by global participants Transactional capability with variable fees and confirmation times Price volatility driven primarily by market sentiment and adoption shifts None of these features create intrinsic value. Bitcoin's worth derives entirely from what others will pay for it—that's speculative value, not fundamental value. The Volatility Problem Bitcoin's extreme price swings undermine traditional monetary functions. Currencies should store value reliably and facilitate exchange without fear of drastic overnight changes. Consider this: Bitcoin moved from $65,000 to $42,000 in months during 2021-2022. A currency experiencing 35% swings in weeks fails as a stable medium of exchange. Your Bitcoin holdings could lose a quarter of their purchasing power while you sleep. Bitcoin's volatility makes it unreliable as money but potentially valuable as a speculative asset for portfolio diversification. Debunking the Intrinsic Value Claim Investors often justify Bitcoin ownership by comparing it to gold—a tangible asset with industrial uses. Gold possesses intrinsic value rooted in jewelry demand, dentistry, electronics manufacturing, and historical precedent as a store of wealth. Bitcoin has no such utility. It cannot be worn, refined, or used in manufacturing. Its only value is speculative: the belief that someone else will pay more later. This doesn't mean Bitcoin cannot be profitable. Markets reward speculative assets all the time. Tulips once commanded fortunes during Dutch mania. The key distinction is honest acknowledgment of what drives returns. Scalability and Real-World Adoption Limits Bitcoin processes approximately 7 transactions per second. Visa handles 24,000 transactions per second. For Bitcoin to replace global payment systems, it would need a thousand-fold improvement in throughput. Proposals like the Lightning Network attempt to layer additional transactions on top of Bitcoin's base chain. However, these require trade-offs in security and decentralization that many Bitcoin purists resist. This structural limitation matters significantly. Different cryptocurrency types serve different purposes , and Bitcoin's design prioritizes security over transaction volume. The Role of Market Structure Bitcoin's market remains relatively fragile despite growing adoption. Large holders, called ""whales,"" can move prices meaningfully. Institutional investors are still deciding whether to allocate capital. Regulatory uncertainty persists globally. These dynamics create a speculative environment where narrative often trumps fundamentals. When adoption sentiment shifts, prices can reverse sharply regardless of technical improvements. Why This Matters for Your Portfolio Clarifying Bitcoin's actual nature changes investment decisions. If you view it as money or gold replacement, you'll be disappointed by volatility and non-use. If you view it as a speculative asset with potential for returns due to growing adoption and scarcity, expectations align with reality. That perspective supports thoughtful portfolio allocation—a small percentage aimed at long-term appreciation rather than stability. Pro tip: Evaluate Bitcoin based on what it actually is—a speculative digital asset with limited monetary function—not on marketing narratives or aspirational comparisons to gold or currency. How Bitcoin Creates Scarcity and Value Scarcity drives value across all markets. Gold is precious because it's rare. Real estate appreciates partly due to limited land supply. Bitcoin operates on the same economic principle—artificial scarcity encoded into its protocol. Unlike government currencies that central banks can print endlessly, Bitcoin has a hard cap: exactly 21 million coins will ever exist. This mathematical certainty creates genuine scarcity that supports long-term value potential. The 21 Million Coin Limit Bitcoin's maximum supply was set at the protocol's creation. Every Bitcoin that will ever exist is already accounted for mathematically. No government decree can change this. No central bank can vote to print more. This differs fundamentally from traditional money. The US Federal Reserve increased money supply by 40% between 2020 and 2022 alone through quantitative easing. That dilution erodes purchasing power for existing currency holders. Bitcoin's fixed supply means your holdings cannot be diluted by policy decisions: 21 million coins represents the absolute maximum that will ever be created No exceptions exist in the protocol code Every lost or destroyed Bitcoin reduces circulating supply further The limit becomes more valuable as adoption grows The Halving Mechanism Bitcoin reduces new supply through halving events that occur approximately every four years. When a halving happens, the reward miners receive for validating transactions drops by 50%. The first halving in 2012 reduced rewards from 50 to 25 Bitcoin per block. The second in 2016 moved it to 12.5. The 2020 halving brought it to 6.25. Eventually, rewards will approach zero. Bitcoin's scarcity design ensures declining inflation rates that mirror precious metal extraction. Early halvings resulted in dramatic price increases as supply growth slowed while demand remained steady. Bitcoin's supply is affected by halving events. Here is a summary of key halvings and their impact: YearBlock Reward (BTC)Circulating Supply GrowthNotable Market Effect201225Slowed significantlyFirst major bull run201612.5Further reductionSustained price rise20206.25Minimal new supplyIncreased adoption, ETF launches2024+3.125Approaching zeroLong-term scarcity pressure This creates a predictable scarcity schedule: Halving reduces new Bitcoin entering circulation by 50% Existing Bitcoin becomes relatively scarcer Demand remains constant or grows with adoption Supply-demand imbalance can drive price appreciation How Scarcity Translates to Value Scarcity alone doesn't guarantee value—worthless items can be rare too. But when scarcity combines with demand and utility, value emerges. Bitcoin benefits from growing institutional and retail demand. Corporations like Tesla and Square added Bitcoin to balance sheets. Investment funds launched Bitcoin ETFs. This expanding demand meets a fixed supply. The economics are straightforward: fixed supply plus increasing demand equals upward price pressure over extended timeframes. Bitcoin's mathematical scarcity removes the inflationary risk inherent in fiat currencies where central banks control supply. Why This Matters for Investors Scarcity protection benefits long-term holders. You're not gambling that a new policy won't devalue your holdings through excessive printing. The supply cap protects purchasing power against monetary inflation. This makes Bitcoin useful for portfolio stability in an inflationary environment. While not a stable asset itself, Bitcoin provides a hedge against currency devaluation—distinct from its speculative growth potential. Investors concerned about currency dilution find genuine value in Bitcoin's fixed supply guarantees. Pro tip: Track Bitcoin halving dates in your calendar and understand how each halving historically preceded extended bull markets, helping you plan long-term allocation decisions around supply scarcity cycles. Institutional Adoption and Portfolio Impact Institutional investors have transformed Bitcoin from a niche digital asset into a legitimate portfolio component. This shift fundamentally changed how professional money managers approach cryptocurrency allocation. Just five years ago, Bitcoin was too volatile and unregulated for corporate treasuries. Today, major corporations hold thousands of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This represents a seismic shift in market dynamics and credibility. The Corporate Treasury Movement Companies began adding Bitcoin to reserves around 2020. MicroStrategy loaded up on thousands of coins for its corporate treasury. Square (now Block) allocated 1% of total assets to Bitcoin. Tesla purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin under Elon Musk's direction. These weren't speculative bets by rogue traders. They were deliberate strategic decisions by established firms managing billions in assets. When institutional money enters, market structure changes fundamentally. Corporate adoption patterns include: Treasury diversification seeking alternative store-of-value assets Long-term holding strategies rather than trading profits Public disclosure signaling confidence in Bitcoin's legitimacy Influence on peers to consider Bitcoin allocations Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Regulated Access The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs removed a major barrier to institutional participation. Previously, institutions faced regulatory complexity accessing Bitcoin directly. ETFs solved this overnight. Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide regulated access points.pdf) that institutions can hold through familiar brokerage accounts. No cryptocurrency exchange accounts needed. No custody complications. Just like trading stock. This regulatory clarity accelerated adoption dramatically: Institutional investors gained comfortable access mechanisms Pension funds and endowments could legally allocate capital Insurance companies added Bitcoin exposure through ETFs Traditional financial advisors could recommend Bitcoin positions Changing Correlation Patterns Institutional adoption has reshaped how Bitcoin behaves within portfolios. Bitcoin's correlation with equity indices has increased as institutions integrated it into mainstream portfolios. This matters for diversification. If Bitcoin moves in sync with stocks, it loses diversification benefits. Higher correlations mean Bitcoin now functions as an integrated financial instrument rather than a pure alternative asset. Yet this correlation remains lower than traditional assets, providing meaningful portfolio benefits: Bitcoin still diversifies better than bonds during equity downturns Correlation varies across market cycles Institutional adoption creates price stability relative to retail-only markets Growing institutional holdings reduce extreme volatility Strategic Reserve Asset Status Institutions are treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset—similar to how governments hold foreign currency reserves. This transforms Bitcoin's role from speculative tool to core portfolio component. When corporate treasurers add Bitcoin, they signal confidence in long-term value. They're not trading it weekly. They're holding it as protection against currency devaluation and financial system risk. Institutional adoption transforms Bitcoin from a speculative asset into an integrated financial instrument reshaping portfolio management and global monetary dynamics. What This Means for Your Portfolio Institutional adoption improves Bitcoin's market stability and legitimacy. You're no longer betting on a fringe experiment. You're participating in an asset class that major financial institutions actively manage. This doesn't guarantee Bitcoin profits. But it does suggest Bitcoin has transitioned from speculation to portfolio staple. Institutions don't allocate significant capital to assets they expect to disappear. The presence of institutional holders also means better market liquidity and fewer extreme price swings driven by retail panic. Pro tip: Monitor institutional Bitcoin holdings through publicly disclosed corporate filings and ETF inflows—when institutions increase positions, it often signals confidence that precedes broader market appreciation. Volatility, Regulation, and Risk Management Bitcoin's path to mainstream acceptance requires addressing two fundamental concerns: extreme price swings and regulatory uncertainty. Both directly impact your ability to hold Bitcoin confidently within a diversified portfolio. Volatility isn't just a number on a chart. It determines whether you can sleep at night holding Bitcoin or whether you'll panic-sell during the next 30% drop. Understanding Bitcoin's Volatility Reality Bitcoin experiences price swings that would terrify traditional investors. In 2022, Bitcoin fell from $69,000 to $16,500—a 76% decline in months. Compare this to the S&P 500's typical annual volatility of 15-20%. This volatility stems from several sources: Speculative trading by retail investors moving on sentiment Regulatory announcements creating sudden uncertainty Large institutional trades moving thin markets Media narratives shifting investor psychology overnight Network security concerns or technical developments Advanced risk management models incorporating machine learning and regime-switching approaches can improve volatility prediction, but they cannot eliminate it. Bitcoin will remain volatile relative to traditional assets. The Volatility-Regulation Connection Regulatory clarity reduces volatility. When governments signal they'll regulate rather than ban Bitcoin, prices stabilize. When they announce crackdowns, panic selling erupts. The United States, European Union, and United Kingdom have all moved toward clearer regulatory frameworks. This regulatory evolution expands institutional participation and reduces speculative panic. However, regulatory uncertainty persists globally as different jurisdictions take inconsistent approaches. China restricts Bitcoin while El Salvador adopted it as legal tender. This patchwork creates ongoing volatility. Regulation's actual impact includes: Reducing extreme price swings from regulatory shock Encouraging institutional participation through legal clarity Protecting against fraud and exchange collapses Creating tax reporting requirements (visibility, not restriction) Risk Management Strategies for Bitcoin Holdings Volatility and regulatory risk require disciplined strategies. You cannot eliminate these risks, but you can manage them: Position sizing keeps Bitcoin from destroying your portfolio. A 5% allocation means a 50% Bitcoin decline affects your overall portfolio by only 2.5%. A 50% allocation means a 50% Bitcoin crash cuts your wealth in half. Most advisors suggest 1-5% of total portfolio value for investors seeking exposure without volatility stress. Conservative investors go 1-2%. Aggressive investors might reach 5-10%. Time horizon matters enormously. Bitcoin volatility decreases over longer periods. Monthly price movements swing wildly, but multi-year trends show steadier appreciation. If you cannot hold for 5+ years, Bitcoin allocation should be minimal. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk. Instead of buying $10,000 Bitcoin at once, buy $1,000 monthly over ten months. This smooths out price swings and removes the pressure of perfect timing. Regulatory Clarity as Risk Reduction Regulations create investor protection frameworks that reduce catastrophic loss risk. When exchanges must hold customer funds separately, theft risk decreases. When tax requirements clarify, you avoid surprise audit liability. Bitcoin's volatility demands careful position sizing and long-term commitment—use regulatory clarity to reduce timing risk, not as a signal to abandon risk management discipline. Building a Sustainable Bitcoin Strategy Sustainable Bitcoin allocation requires honest assessment of your volatility tolerance. If a 40% drawdown causes panic selling, you're over-allocated. Scale back until you can hold through downturns. Combine modest Bitcoin allocation with steadier assets. Bonds, dividend stocks, and real estate provide stability while Bitcoin plays the growth role. Pro tip: Set your Bitcoin allocation percentage before you buy, then ignore short-term price movements—rebalance annually by selling winners and buying weakness, which enforces disciplined buying low and selling high. Comparing Bitcoin to Other Investments Choosing where to allocate capital means comparing Bitcoin against established investment categories. Understanding how Bitcoin behaves relative to stocks, bonds, gold, and real estate clarifies whether it belongs in your portfolio and at what allocation size. Bitcoin isn't a replacement for traditional investments. It's a supplementary asset that serves a distinct role based on market conditions. Bitcoin vs. Stocks Stocks and Bitcoin both appreciate over time, but through different mechanisms. Stocks derive value from company earnings, dividends, and competitive position. Bitcoin derives value from network adoption and scarcity. Stock volatility typically ranges 15-25% annually. Bitcoin volatility exceeds 50% in many years. This makes Bitcoin riskier but also offers higher potential returns during bull markets. Critically, Bitcoin acts as a diversifier against stock portfolios depending on market conditions. During stock market crashes, Bitcoin sometimes rises while stocks fall—providing genuine portfolio benefit. Other times Bitcoin falls alongside stocks during broad market stress. Key differences include: Stocks tied to economic fundamentals; Bitcoin driven by sentiment Stocks produce dividends; Bitcoin produces no cash flow Stocks benefit from company growth; Bitcoin benefits from adoption Stocks face company-specific risk; Bitcoin faces network risk Bitcoin vs. Bonds Bonds offer stability. They provide predictable income and protect capital during equity downturns. Bitcoin provides neither. A 10-year Treasury bond yields around 4% annually with minimal default risk. Bitcoin yields 0% and fluctuates wildly. Bonds and Bitcoin serve opposite purposes. However, Bitcoin outperforms bonds during high inflation. When central banks print money and erode purchasing power, Bitcoin's fixed supply becomes valuable. Bonds lose purchasing power as inflation rises. During the 2021-2023 period, Bitcoin rebounded while bonds remained weak due to rising interest rates. This shows Bitcoin's role as an inflation hedge—not as a bond replacement. Bitcoin vs. Gold Gold is often compared to Bitcoin as ""digital gold,"" but the comparison breaks down quickly. Gold possesses industrial utility, jewelry demand, and 5,000 years of historical precedent. Bitcoin has network adoption. Gold returns average 5-6% annually over long periods. Bitcoin returns have exceeded 50% annually during bull markets but crashed 70%+ during bear markets. Bitcoin exhibits hedging abilities relative to traditional assets , particularly during market crises when investors seek safe havens. Yet Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset than a safe haven during severe downturns. Both gold and Bitcoin serve portfolio roles: Gold provides steady inflation protection and proven stability Bitcoin provides growth potential and adoption upside Combined, they offer diversified non-correlated exposure Neither should dominate alternative asset allocation Bitcoin vs. Real Estate Real estate produces income through rent. Bitcoin produces no income. Real estate provides shelter and land scarcity. Bitcoin provides transaction capability and network effects. Real estate requires significant capital, illiquidity, and management overhead. Bitcoin requires only a few dollars and can be sold instantly. Real estate appreciates 3-4% annually plus rental income. Bitcoin volatility makes steady return prediction impossible—but bull market appreciation can exceed 100%. Most investors benefit from both. Real estate provides stable income and forced savings. Bitcoin provides growth exposure and portfolio diversification beyond real assets. Building a Comparative Framework Think of investment allocation in tiers based on your needs. Bonds and stocks form the core—providing reliable returns and lower volatility. Real estate adds inflation protection and income. Bitcoin enters as a satellite position—1-5% seeking growth and diversification rather than income or stability. This positioning leverages Bitcoin's strengths without exposing you to its volatility weaknesses. Here's how Bitcoin compares to major asset classes: AttributeBitcoinStocksBondsGoldReal EstateReturn PotentialVery high, volatileModerate to highLow but predictableModerate, steadyModerate plus rental incomeIncome GenerationNoneDividends possibleRegular interestNoneRental paymentsInflation HedgeStrong during monetary expansionLimitedWeakStrong, provenGood, property scarcityLiquidityHigh, 24/7 tradingHigh, market hoursHigh, flexibleHigh, market hoursModerate, requires saleHistorical StabilityLimited historyProven track recordVery stable5,000+ yearsDecades of reliabilityCorrelation to EquitiesLow to moderateHighNegative to stocksLowVariableAccessibilityEasy to buy in small amountsEasy, widespreadEasy, widespreadEasy, widespreadRequires capital, less liquid Bitcoin functions best as a diversification satellite within a traditional portfolio, not as a core holding that replaces stocks, bonds, or real estate. Finding Your Allocation Your Bitcoin allocation depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and what you need your portfolio to accomplish. Conservative investors might skip Bitcoin entirely. Aggressive investors might allocate 5-10%. Most balanced investors find 2-3% meaningful. This size captures Bitcoin's diversification and growth benefits without creating unmanageable volatility. Compare Bitcoin alongside your other investments. If you already own gold for inflation protection, Bitcoin's allocation can be smaller. If you own only stocks and bonds, Bitcoin's diversification benefit suggests larger allocation. Pro tip: Compare Bitcoin's expected returns and volatility profile directly against your other holdings, then size your position to balance growth potential against your ability to hold through 50%+ drawdowns without panic selling.

The USDT operator has attributed this development to a lack of market demand, among other points. Tether To Terminate CNH₮ Redemption In One Year In a recent blog post , Tether shared a strategic update on its CNH₮, communicating a management decision to withdraw the stablecoin product from its offerings. This decision is based on multiple factors centered around demand and operational efficiency. A statement from the announcement read: Community interest and adoption are central to every product decision we make. When evaluating whether to maintain or introduce a Tether token, we assess market demand, operational sustainability, and broader ecosystem conditions that influence long-term usability. Our priority is to allocate resources where they can most effectively enhance security, reliability, and innovation across the digital asset landscape. Tether explains that the CNH₮ recorded low interest, adoption, and community demand compared to their products, thereby failing to produce an acceptable return on technical and operational efforts. As of this moment, all new issuance of CNH₮ has been halted. Meanwhile, CNH₮ users will have the next year to process any redemptions before the stablecoin is permanently phased out. The stablecoin operator will issue another reminder ahead of the redemption deadline. Following this development, Tether reiterates its commitment to stablecoin global growth and adoption. The statement read: Tether will continue to focus its efforts on stablecoins and infrastructure that demonstrate strong, organic adoption and long-term relevance. This includes advancing core stablecoin liquidity, expanding tokenization infrastructure, and supporting new financial tools that better serve global users and builders. Tether remains the operator of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, which presently boasts a total market cap of $183.7 billion. In January, the stablecoin company launched USAT, designed specifically for American users. Nigeria Leads Demand For Stablecoins In other news, a recent survey by BVNK has revealed that Africa’s largest economies are leading the demand for stablecoins. This survey, done in collaboration with Coinbase, YouGov, and Artemis, involved 4658 adults across 15 countries. The results revealed that 80% of Nigerian and South African respondents presently hold stablecoin, while 75% aim to increase holdings as citizens seek a haven from their local fragile currencies. At press time, the total stablecoin market cap is valued at $310 billion, with high expectations of future market expansion following the approval of the GENIUS Act last July.",Tether (USDT)|CNH₮|GENIUS Act|Offshore Yuan|Tether|USAT|USDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-22 13:00:08

Many see it as a speculative asset or a coin chasing short-term gains. According to CryptoBull, this perspective misses the true value of XRP. He described it as “the single cleanest, most neutral, most battle-tested digital asset ever engineered for global finance.” This characterization positions XRP not as a traditional cryptocurrency but as a foundational tool for global financial infrastructure. Its neutrality and resilience give it a unique standing among digital assets. Unlike many coins that rely purely on hype, XRP is built to operate at scale and meet the demands of institutions and cross-border finance. The majority of you holding #XRP still don’t grasp what you actually own. You think it’s just another coin. You think it’s a speculative ticket to the moon. You’re wrong. XRP is the single cleanest, most neutral, most battle-tested digital asset ever engineered for global… — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 21, 2026 Market Potential and Price Targets CryptoBull has consistently projected that XRP could reach $70 . This projection is based on the asset’s structural advantages, adoption trajectory, and its ability to integrate with major financial systems. The $70 target is not speculative hype in his view but the outcome of XRP’s inherent qualities and ongoing adoption trends. Analysts like CryptoBull focus on XRP’s utility in real-world financial applications. Experts have repeatedly stressed that XRP’s design enables it to settle transactions quickly and efficiently, increasing demand in both institutional and retail sectors. The combination of these factors sets the stage for a significant upward move . Adoption and Institutional Integration XRP has seen growing use cases among payment networks, banks, and corporate treasury operations. CryptoBull’s remarks highlight that this adoption is a key driver of value. Like many market participants, he sees XRP as a bridge currency and a digital asset engineered to solve problems that traditional systems cannot handle efficiently. As CryptoBull noted, XRP has been battle-tested. After years of direct suppression by the SEC through the Ripple lawsuit, XRP emerged with full legal clarity. This clarity eliminates regulatory uncertainty, making XRP more appealing to institutions. With clear compliance and a proven track record, adoption by banks and financial networks is likely to accelerate. This trend supports widespread use and price growth.

The meme coin has been oscillating between key support and resistance zones, as the bulls and bears can’t seem to decide the next price direction. The latest on-chain evaluation has identified a specific support level to watch out for the Dogecoin price in the coming days. Support Levels To Watch In a February 21 post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified a major critical support level around $0.096 and $0.074, with the latter price level seen as a deep demand wall for Dogecoin. This on-chain evaluation is based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which tracks the amount of a cryptocurrency purchased at different price levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Looks Bullish, But Only On The Inverted Chart As the price of Doge approaches a decisive technical moment, traders are closely watching the two critical price levels ($0.096 and $0.074). These URPD support levels often serve as psychological and structural anchors, while offering insight into the next move for an asset’s price. Technically, the real concern starts if DOGE drops below the minor support threshold around $0.096. A breakdown below this cushion could imply weakening short-term buyer confidence, suggesting a sentiment shift from careful optimism to high bearish pressure. While this does not guarantee a major sell-off, especially considering the relatively low relevance of the $0.096, it does signal that sellers gained slight control of price action. However, if the Dogecoin price drops below the first support level, $0.074 becomes the next major floor to watch – a level where buyers might step in heavily. Market dynamics often intensify at the critical point, and it could pay off to watch whether buyers will absorb selling pressure aggressively enough to create a rebound. If buying demand is high, the $0.074 support may hold, forming a base for recovery. On the flip side, if the support level fails to hold, the breach could trigger additional selling momentum. It is worth mentioning that these price levels are not guarantees of reversal or continuation. Ultimately, Dogecoin now stands at a technical crossroads; holding above $0.096 would maintain short-term structural stability and could encourage renewed buying interest. Meanwhile, a break below that level shifts attention decisively towards $0.074, with the market reaction at these levels potentially shaping Dogecoin’s next significant move. Dogecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of DOGE stands around $0.098, reflecting a 6.46% increase in the past 24 hours.

Brandt, a legendary analyst, has repeatedly identified critical turning points in the token’s price. His insights remain highly relevant as XRP navigates its current market trajectory. He Predicted EVERY $XRP Crash (Now He Says $1 Is Coming) pic.twitter.com/sHvGQMiG3O — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) February 20, 2026 Historical Accuracy and Market Signals On December 17, 2025, Brandt identified a potential double top in XRP’s price chart . At the time, XRP was trading significantly higher than its current levels. Brandt noted, “Sure, it may fail, and I will deal with that if it does. But for now, this has bearish implications.” Following this analysis, XRP broke below the identified support level, triggering a notable downward movement that continued into 2026. While the asset attempted a resurgence in early January , it was short-lived. XRP still trades below the support levels from early December. Rietveld emphasized that Brandt’s record of accurate predictions adds weight to his current observations. One key example cited was the massive liquidation event in October. Brandt had correctly identified the potential for a bearish move , noting a line break followed by a sharp correction. XRP subsequently rebounded after the drop, confirming the reliability of his technical interpretation. Current Observations According to Rietveld, Brandt highlighted a possible movement toward $1. While he did not assign a timeframe, his analysis suggests the price could reach this level under current technical conditions. XRP has historically demonstrated rapid responses to market shifts, making sudden rebounds common following sharp declines. XRP’s previous performance illustrates its capacity to recover quickly after significant losses. The October liquidation event showed that after a sharp drop, the token rebounded swiftly. This indicates that even if the price reaches $1, the move may be brief before adjustments occur. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Takeaways Levi Rietveld highlighted Brandt’s accuracy in predicting past XRP movements. Observing these patterns shows that XRP often recovers after notable declines. While a rise to $1 is possible, historical trends suggest that such moves may be followed by short-term corrections or consolidation, reflecting the token’s responsiveness to market activity. XRP’s history demonstrates resilience and rapid rebound capabilities. Other analysts share Brandt’s belief that XRP could drop to $1 , but this technical assessment serves as a reference point rather than a forecast of sustained growth. The token’s behavior in prior events emphasizes that sharp downward moves are often temporary and can reverse quickly.

According to market analyst Paul Bennet, the crypto market’s $730 billion wipeout in just 100 days marks far more than a routine correction. What initially appeared to be a healthy pullback from October’s record highs has accelerated into what Bennet describes as a broad institutional retreat, fundamentally shifting liquidity, sentiment, and capital flows across the entire digital asset market, from Bitcoin to smaller-cap tokens. A Bear Market Blueprint Emerges Bitcoin Dominance Trap Bitcoin is showing clear signs of strain. Its market capitalization has fallen by roughly $350 billion, dropping from about $1.69 trillion to $1.34 trillion. While public narratives emphasize unwavering hodling by major holders, on-chain data tells a more cautious story: risk-off positioning and slowing accumulation among large wallets. With Bitcoin trading at $68,060 per CoinCodex data, key metrics point to growing restraint rather than renewed conviction. The pullback has also created a dominance paradox. Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market has edged higher, but largely because capital is exiting altcoins faster, not because of aggressive inflows into BTC. In other words, its dominance is being driven more by capitulation than confidence. Ironically, as volatility resurfaces, traditional financial institutions that once dismissed Bitcoin are now racing to secure exposure, underscoring its enduring strategic relevance despite short-term weakness. Altcoin Massacre The downturn extends well beyond Bitcoin. Over the past 100 days, the top 20 altcoins (excluding stablecoins) have fallen about 15%, and the damage deepens further down the market cap ladder. Mid- and small-cap tokens have plunged 20% or more, as capital rotates into perceived safe havens. Once the drivers of speculative upside, smaller tokens are now the epicenter of forced selling, with thinning liquidity and widening bid–ask spreads amplifying volatility. Yet amid the drawdown, institutional sentiment is beginning to diverge. JPMorgan Chase has identified XRP as one of the most compelling digital assets for financial institutions, underscoring growing confidence in its real-world utility and scalability despite broader market weakness. Retail Panic & Liquidity Drought The fallout for everyday traders has been severe. Small-cap liquidity, a vital gauge of market health, has plunged from $390 billion to $267 billion, signaling a sharp contraction in risk appetite. The speed of this decline mirrors classic deleveraging cycles, where margin calls and cascading stop-losses intensify selloffs. Retail investors, often overleveraged and under-hedged, aren’t exiting by choice, they’re liquidating to survive. Institutional Forced Liquidations: A New Driver Historically, crypto downturns were fueled by retail panic. This cycle marks a shift: institutional forced liquidations are now driving price action. As broader market losses mount, professional risk managers are selling crypto to offset equity drawdowns, tightening its correlation with traditional financial markets and reinforcing its integration into the global macro landscape. Conclusion: Cycle Ending or Reset Beginning? Is this the end of the crypto cycle or just a reset? While debate continues, one thing is clear: the market has shifted from optimism to caution, setting the tone for digital assets in the months ahead.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-22 14:21:12
