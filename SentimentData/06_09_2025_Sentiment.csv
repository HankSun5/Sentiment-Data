Increasing optimism about potential rate cuts has pushed prices slightly higher today, with the market remaining on the cusp of a potential breakout. It’s in this context that we examine Maxi Doge (MAXI), PEPENODE (PEPENODE) and Wall Street Pepe (WEPE), three new coins that have the potential to rally strongly later in the year. We explain their features and tokenomics, unpacking just why they’re joining the ranks of the best meme coins in the market. Best Crypto to Buy Now – 5 September Maxi Doge (MAXI) One of the best crypto to buy now, Maxi Doge (MAXI) is an ERC-20 token that opened its presale a few weeks ago. It has already raised over $1.8 million, as investors race to buy the token while it remains cheap. The premise of Maxi Doge is pretty simple: a Dogecoin-themed token, but with a strong focus on hyper-bullish trading. Proudly announcing on its website that it ‘trades with 1000x’ leverage, it’s currently building an online community of traders. It has opened Telegram and Discord channels, where its community members will be able to share tips and coordinate strategies. Not only that, but they’ll be able to compete in regular trading competitions, with the best-performing traders receiving rewards in MAXI and appearing on global leaderboards. This should help encourage greater involvement and engagement with Maxi Doge, which has also allocated 25% of its total supply (150.24 billion MAXI) to a Maxi Fund. Why flex a whip when you can flex retiring entire bloodlines? pic.twitter.com/kncgh2JkYH — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) August 30, 2025 This fund will support new partnerships and ad campaigns, helping to increase awareness of Maxi Doge. Taken with its growing community, this fund should help grow the token quickly, with investors able to join its presale by to its official website . Visit the Official Website Here PEPENODE (PEPENODE) One of the newest presale coins in the market, PEPENODE (PEPENODE) is a self-described ‘mine-to-earn’ token that is gamifying staking. It began its ICO last month, and has so far raised $600,000, a total which is rapidly increasing. POV: You looking for the perfect Node. https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/IFY0q6bUSh — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 1, 2025 What’s exciting about PEPENODE is that it has a novel staking system, one which may attract more users and investors than the average proof-of-stake coin. Its staking setup invites users to build their own virtual mining rigs, paying for virtual nodes using PEPENODE tokens. The more nodes you have, the higher your staking yields will be. As such, this system could incentivize greater demand for PEPENODE, pushing up its price over time. This is ultimately why PEPENODE is one of the more exciting new coins in the market, with investors able to join its presale at the PEPENODE website . It’s currently available at $0.0010449, although this price will rise every 3 days until the sale ends. Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Unlike the two coins above, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) has already closed its presale, which it ended in February after raising over $73 million. This made it one of the biggest presales of recent years, and since launching WEPE has been listed on such exchanges as MEXC, KCEX, XT.com, Uniswap, and Bilaxy. It’s currently up by more than 260% since the end of May, making it one of the best-performing coins over this timeframe. Excitingly, it’s in the process of launching a Solana-based version of its WEPE token, which currently runs on Ethereum. This will enable it to benefit from Solana’s greater speed and scalability, as well as from its growing base of users. It will burn pre-existing Ethereum-based WEPE whenever someone buys the new Solana-based version, at a ratio of 1:1. Launching on Solana You can buy early Every dollar buy on $SOL = burns $WEPE on ETH Once ETH $WEPE hits $0.001 → $SOL Peg goes 1:1 Sol buy = Eth burn New site, new plans, the Solana expansion begins pic.twitter.com/c3GBYJZliX — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) August 19, 2025 This will keep its total supply at the same level, having burned 2,794,724,039 WEPE so far.

Pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan sees the announcement as a clear signal of real-world adoption. In June, Webus revealed plans for a $300M XRP treasury reserve managed by Samara Alpha. Webus International (NASDAQ: WETO), through its travel brand Wetour, has entered a strategic alliance with Air China. The collaboration offers access to the airline’s PhoenixMiles loyalty program, reaching over 60 million members worldwide. As part of this initiative, Wetour plans to enable support for XRP payments, with the goal of facilitating faster settlements, blockchain-based vouchers, and tokenized rewards. Pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan weighed in, acknowledging that the press announcement’s wording, “XRP payment support,” may be ambiguous. Critics may argue it doesn’t guarantee that XRP will be used in actual transactions, but nonetheless, Morgan sees it as a clear signal of real-world adoption.

That surge boosted the ETH ecosystem plays and lit up the whole alt scene before cooling off. Sentiment’s still riding bullish, though, with regulators turning friendlier on crypto, and Deepseek predicts that momentum will stay alive. Bitcoin dropped hard from its August peak at 124K down to under 107K but managed to climb back above 110 K. Still, the market feels shaky, and support could slip fast. With a 96% chance of a September rate cut, uncertainty is heavy. Even so, Deepseek AI is sticking to a bullish long-term prediction. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Predicts $5+ If ETF Gets Approved Some of DeepSeek’s calls might sound unattainable, but they fit when you check XRP’s already wild year. 2025 turned into its breakout run, beating the SEC, ripping past $1, and stacking 400% gains since then. Deepseek backing that momentum too, predicts the rally’s far from over, and another leg is on deck. A mysterious XRP whale, later tied to Kraken, recently moved millions in one shot, and it looks like a clear sign that big players are stacking up before the next leg higher, feeding into the bullish XRP price calls. With Trump leaning heavily into crypto and reportedly locking in a deal to buy 684.4 million CRO, it’s obvious that adoption is speeding up like crazy. XRP’s own adoption this year has been on another level. The XRP Mastercard hit the market, putting it in the trillion-dollar credit card space. At the same time, Bloomberg now sees an 85% chance of ETF approval in October—a move that could unleash serious institutional inflows. Meanwhile, B3 Network, a layer-3 chain on Base, linked up with XRP Commons to bring gaming to XRPL, adding fresh real-world utility to the Ripple ecosystem. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView The long-term targets for XRP are still bullish. While September tends to be rough on crypto, rate cuts on the horizon could change that. XRP has room to break past $5, though volatility is something to watch. The daily chart shows a strong footing after months of consolidating near $2.80, setting up for a bounce. New highs are in play if it clears $3.60, like DeepSeek predicts, while $2.50 and $2.30 stay key reversal zones. Ethereum Textbook Correction Before the Next Reversal DeepSeek isn’t holding back on its Ethereum predictions, especially after the last couple of months of action. ETH just smashed a new all-time high before cooling off to the 4,280 zone, and it’s holding that level with solid strength right now. ETH is sitting at a major decision point right now, holding key support around 4,280. If bulls defend this zone and push back above 4,490, the next big hurdle is 4,700–4,800, and clearing that opens the path toward 5,100. RSI’s down near 36, showing oversold conditions and a likely bounce. MACD is still negative, meaning momentum hasn’t flipped yet, but that could turn quickly. In the short term, ETH looks shaky, but as long as 4,070 holds, there’s room for a recovery. A clean move above 4,490 could set ETH up for another run at fresh highs, maybe even those levels DeepSeek’s been calling for. DeepSeek Predicts PI Coin Hitting $1 With the Help of Its Massive Community and Recent Updates Since launch, PI’s price has been on a steady slide, dropping 88% from over 2.80 to just under 0.34. So why’s DeepSeek still bullish for the rest of the year? It all comes down to the massive community backing the coin and its expanding user base. In addition, Pi has been rolling out solid updates. The latest is a Linux version of its node software, making it easier for more validators and devs to join. They also launched Pi App Studio, letting even non-coders build on the network, which could push adoption further. The RSI is sitting around 44, leaving plenty of room for upside. The MACD is flat but showing early signs of a momentum shift. The key resistance levels to watch are $0.80, $1.10, and $2.50. If PI clears those, it could easily run toward the $4 target that DeepSeek is calling out. If that plays out, it really shows how much weight community power carries in driving crypto projects. That’s exactly why memecoins are successful, and it’s where Pepenode steps in as one of the hottest coins to scoop up in the market right now. PepeNode Tiered Nodes Reward Early Adopters PepeNode is a mine-to-earn memecoin and the native currency of a virtual mining ecosystem, doubling as a governance token that gives holders a say in how the platform evolves. So far, it’s raised $675,971 for its mining project, where users can buy meme nodes, upgrade facilities, and earn rewards along the way. Each reward cycle also triggers token burns, making the system deflationary and boosting scarcity over time. Getting in early matters. PepeNode’s tiered-node staking setup gives the first tiers more reward-generating power than later buyers, making early adoption extra valuable. At the time of writing, staking rewards return 2,914 %. The distribution of PEPENODE token rewards is at a rate of 3,001 PEPENODE tokens per produced ETH block. The rewards are disbursed over a two-year period. To grab PEPENODE before the crowd, jump on the PepeNode presale site . You can buy using ETH, BNB, or USDT (both ERC-20 and BEP-20), plus they even accept credit and debit cards for easy access.

This includes the outlook for XRP, Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which have all benefited from the expectation that the Fed will finally cut rates when it meets on the 17-18 of this month. These three coins have all risen in the past 24 hours, and while their respective gains aren’t substantial, they prepare the ground nicely for a bigger rally in the next couple of weeks. And given their fundamentals, each of them could have a very strong end to the year, potentially reaching new highs. Crypto Price Prediction Today 5 September XRP (XRP): Ripple Expansion Boosts the Case for New ATH in Q4 Rebounding from a seven-day low of $2.72, XRP is now sitting at $2.84, marking a slight 0.3% gain in the past 24 hours. The altcoin does remain down by 2% in a week and by 3.5% in the last 30 days, yet it boasts a 410% increase in the past year. This makes it one of the best-performing top-20 cryptos across this timeframe, yet its enviably strong fundamentals would suggest that things can only get better in Q4. This is largely because Ripple continues to grow as a business, having thrown off the shackles of its battle with the SEC in early August. It has announced new acquisitions and new partnerships in recent weeks (e.g. in Dubai and Africa ), boosting the bull case for XRP over the medium- and long-term. Source: TradingView XRP’s chart today shows that it’s very close to hitting bottom, at which point it could rebound strongly. Its two main indicators—the MACD (orange, blue) and RSI (yellow)—have both flattened out after several weeks of decline, a sign that buyers are returning to buy XRP at a relative discount. What’s also bullish is that the XRP price has formed a pennant over the past couple of months, from which it may break out very soon. If it does climb above the psychologically important $2 level, it could begin a climb towards $2.50 and $3. And if it breaks its current ATH of $3.65, it could potentially end the year closer to $5. Cardano (ADA): Steady Growth of Layer-One Network Shows Massively Undervalued Native Token ADA has returned to $0.826 today, marking a 1% gain in 24 hours and a 13% increase in the past month. While it has declined in the past week, the crypto price prediction for ADA remains very positive, if only because it’s still massively below its ATH of $3.09, which it set back in September 2021. This failure to set a new record in recent months may be disappointing, but it’s arguable that it gives Cardano the space to outpace market averages in the coming months. This is why Ethereum (ETH) has done recently, and given Cardano’s fundamentals, it could do something similar. Indeed, Cardano is something of a dark horse in the crypto market, with its network growing and evolving steadily . The Cardano blockchain currently has a TVL of $365 million , a figure which has risen by 640% since the beginning of 2023 (while ADA’s price has risen by only 225%). This shows its gradual growth, which gives ADA a great platform for further price appreciation in the longer term. Source: TradingView Its chart today shows it moving into what could be a major position, with ADA also looking like it could break out of a pennant in the very near future. Its MACD and RSI also have flattened out in recent days, suggesting that a period of decline may have reached an end. Given these factors, and given that the coin is still massively undervalued, it could return to $1 in the next few weeks, before rallying above $2.50 by the end of the year. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Undervalued Meme Token Has Fundamentals for Big Xmas Rally At $0.00001226, Shiba Inu has just about posted a 24-hour gain today, while it’s also up by a very modest 0.5% in the past month. However, it has bucked the general trend by posting a loss of 9% in the past year, which may arguably point to serious problems for the coin, which appears to be struggling to attract interest. Having said that, SHIB is also in a position similar to Cardano, in that it’s 85% below its ATH ($0.00008616) and could therefore make big headway in the coming months. Unlike many other meme tokens, Shiba Inu and its team has gone to great lengths to give it more utility, having launched its own DEX ( ShibaSwap ), its own layer-two network , and various dapps . It’s therefore entirely arguable that the market is undervaluing SHIB substantially at the moment, and that it will soon catch up once the market enters full ‘bull mode’ towards the end of the year. Source: TradingView Its chart today suggests that it too is close to a bottom, and may recover strongly soon. The catalyst for a recovery may be the aforementioned FOMC meeting in the middle of September, which could result in a long-awaited rate cut. In such a scenario, the SHIB price could reach $0.000020 by October, and could even end the year above $0.000040. Wall Street Pepe Gains Momentum As It Prepares for Solana Token Launch The crypto price prediction for the three coins above looks very good right now, but there are also other, newer alts that traders may want to consider as they diversify their portfolios. New coins can often outperform the market as they enjoy their initial growth spurts, as we’ve seen with the likes of SPX6900, MemeCore and Pump.fun. One of the newest and most interesting coins showing potential right now is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE), an ERC-20 meme coin that’s currently in the process of launching a Solana-based version of its token.

It’s now taking this impetus and using it as it launches an SLP version of its WEPE, which investors can buy by visiting the Wall Street Pepe website .

Die Aufnahme könnte nicht nur das Unternehmen stärken, sondern auch Bitcoin und den gesamten Kryptomarkt. Doch die Entscheidung liegt beim unabhängigen US Index Committee – und das könnte kritisch auf das Modell schauen. Die Wall Street schaut gespannt auf Michael Saylors Unternehmen Strategy. Der mögliche Aufstieg in den S&P 500 ist nicht nur für Aktionäre spannend, sondern könnte auch die Krypto-Welt kräftig bewegen. Doch trotz beeindruckender Zahlen bleibt am Ende eine entscheidende Hürde: die Zustimmung des US Index Committee. Strategy vor dem großen Sprung Michael Saylors Firma Strategy, früher bekannt als MicroStrategy, hat es fast geschafft. Analysten sehen die Chance auf eine Aufnahme in den berühmten US-Leitindex S&P 500 bei satten 91 Prozent. Das wäre nicht nur ein Prestigeerfolg, sondern ein echter Meilenstein für das Unternehmen. Denn neben Coinbase und Block wäre Strategy erst das dritte Unternehmen mit starker Krypto-Verbindung im Index. 100x growth in 5 years with $BTC . Thinking about the next 5 years… pic.twitter.com/7ZQo2yF2TY — Strategy (@Strategy) August 11, 2025 Der S&P 500 gilt als wichtigstes Barometer der US-Wirtschaft, und ein Platz darin bedeutet automatisch mehr Aufmerksamkeit von Investoren. Für Strategy könnte das einen kräftigen Schub bedeuten. Doch auch die Krypto-Welt blickt gespannt, denn das Unternehmen hält mehr Bitcoin als jede andere Firma weltweit. Warum Strategy so wichtig für Bitcoin ist Strategy hat aktuell 636.505 Bitcoin in der Firmenkasse – eine gigantische Summe, die selbst kleine Länderhaushalte übertrifft. Kein anderes Unternehmen hat eine so große Bitcoin-Treasury. Damit ist Strategy eng mit der Kryptowährung verflochten, und jede Kursbewegung spiegelt sich in beiden Richtungen wider. Würde Strategy in den S&P 500 aufgenommen, kämen automatisch Milliarden von Dollar durch Indexfonds und ETFs ins Spiel. Diese investieren nämlich blind in alle Unternehmen des Index. So könnte der Aktienkurs stabiler werden – und Bitcoin gleich mit profitieren. Der S&P 500 als Türöffner Eine Aufnahme in den S&P 500 bedeutet für Unternehmen weit mehr als nur Ruhm. Viele große Fonds und Privatanleger investieren automatisch in alle enthaltenen Firmen. Das sorgt für verlässliche Nachfrage nach der Aktie und in vielen Fällen für steigende Kurse. Da Strategy so eng mit Bitcoin verbunden ist, würde ein solcher Effekt auch die Kryptowährung stützen. Der Markt könnte dies als Signal werten, dass Bitcoin noch weiter in den klassischen Finanzstrukturen angekommen ist. Für Krypto-Fans wäre das eine Bestätigung, für Skeptiker vielleicht ein Denkanstoß. Damit würde die langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin weiter an Kraft gewinnen. Die harten Kriterien Der Weg in den S&P 500 ist streng geregelt. Unternehmen müssen mindestens 22,7 Milliarden US-Dollar wert sein, über Monate hinweg hohe Handelsvolumina zeigen und vier Quartale in Folge Gewinn machen. Außerdem wird ein Liquiditätsfaktor von mindestens 0,75 verlangt. Strategy erfüllt all diese Anforderungen mit Leichtigkeit. Laut Nasdaq liegt der Börsenwert bei rund 92 Milliarden US-Dollar, das Handelsvolumen ist riesig und die Gewinne der letzten vier Quartale belaufen sich auf über 5 Milliarden US-Dollar. Rein rechnerisch gibt es also kaum etwas zu meckern. Das letzte Wort hat das Komitee Doch Zahlen allein reichen nicht. Die finale Entscheidung trifft das US Index Committee, ein Gremium mit zehn Mitgliedern. Sie stimmen per Mehrheitsbeschluss ab, wer in den Index aufgenommen wird. Dabei zählen nicht nur die harten Fakten, sondern auch weiche Faktoren. Gerade bei Strategy könnte das kritisch sein. Das Modell basiert stark auf Bitcoin, und dieser Markt ist bekanntlich extrem volatil. Ob das Komitee die Nachhaltigkeit des Ansatzes anerkennt oder als Risiko sieht, bleibt spannend. Krypto rückt näher an die Wall Street Sollte Strategy den Sprung schaffen, wäre es ein klares Zeichen: Krypto-Unternehmen gehören zunehmend zur etablierten Finanzwelt. Schon Coinbase und Block haben vorgemacht, wie viel Aufmerksamkeit und Vertrauen der Index mit sich bringt. Strategy könnte diesen Trend weiter verstärken. Damit würden die Grenzen zwischen klassischen Märkten und der Welt der Kryptowährungen noch mehr verschwimmen. Für viele Beobachter ist das ein entscheidender Schritt hin zur langfristigen Akzeptanz digitaler Assets. Chancen für Anleger Für Investoren hätte die Aufnahme gleich mehrere Folgen. Passive Anleger würden automatisch in Strategy investieren, ohne selbst aktiv entscheiden zu müssen. Gleichzeitig könnten Trader von der zusätzlichen Bewegung im Markt profitieren. Auch für Bitcoin selbst könnte das ein Gewinn sein. Mehr Kapital bedeutet mehr Aufmerksamkeit, und die Glaubwürdigkeit der Kryptowährung würde weiter steigen. Wer bisher gezögert hat, könnte durch die S&P-500-Aufnahme Vertrauen gewinnen. Fazit: Zwischen Euphorie und Risiko Strategy steht an der Schwelle zu einem historischen Schritt. Die Aufnahme in den S&P 500 könnte sowohl das Unternehmen als auch Bitcoin und den gesamten Kryptomarkt stärken . Anleger sehen darin große Chancen, und die Aufmerksamkeit ist riesig. Doch Risiken bleiben. Die Entscheidung des US Index Committee ist unberechenbar, und die starke Abhängigkeit von Bitcoin birgt Unsicherheit. Ob Strategy am Ende den Sprung schafft, wird zeigen, wie offen die Wall Street wirklich für Krypto ist. Neue Player wie Bitcoin Hyper Während Strategy die Schlagzeilen dominiert, entstehen im Hintergrund neue Projekte. Ein Beispiel ist Bitcoin Hyper, ein Layer-2-Netzwerk für Bitcoin. Es verspricht blitzschnelle Transaktionen, smarte Verträge und minimale Gebühren. Kurz gesagt: Bitcoin wird nicht nur zum Halten, sondern zum aktiven Nutzen. Noch spannender ist die Kombination aus Bitcoin und Solana-Technologie: Bitcoin HYPER verbindet dabei die Sicherheit und Stabilität von Bitcoin mit der Geschwindigkeit und dem hohen Utility von Solana. Der eigene Token $HYPER bietet Staking-Rewards, Governance-Rechte und die Möglichkeit, in dApps aktiv zu werden. Für frühe Unterstützer ist der Einstieg besonders günstig, und durch die Verbindung zu Bitcoin könnte das Projekt eine spannende Ergänzung im Krypto-Ökosystem werden. Damit vereint Hyper zwei Welten, die bisher getrennt waren – Stabilität und Tempo – und schafft so einen Investment-Case, der auf lange Sicht echten Mehrwert verspricht. Jetzt rechtzeitig einsteigen und $HYPER im Presale kaufen. Hinweis: Investieren ist spekulativ. Bei der Anlage ist Ihr Kapital in Gefahr.

51256998,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=816864,1757113200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51256998.jpeg,"XRP Will Never Crash 90% Again, Says Digital Ascension CEO",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-will-never-crash-90-again-digital-ascension-ceo/,"Jake Clover, CEO of Digital Ascension Group and a long-time XRP advocate, used a new video published on September 3 to deliver an unambiguous message to traders waiting for one last capitulation: he doesn’t think a 90% collapse is coming back. “I would love it too. I don’t think it’s going to happen,” Clover said, arguing that the market already gave skeptics ample time to buy during prolonged sub-$1 ranges. “When it was 50 cents, nobody wanted to buy it… You had three years to buy it at 50 cents or 30 cents or 40 cents or whatever it was. It ain’t coming back.” Will XRP Never Crash By 90% Again? Clover roots that conviction not in a single catalyst but in what he describes as a structural change to XRP’s market microstructure. He repeatedly cites the role of spot exchange-traded products – Bloomberg’s James Seyffart puts SEC approval in 2025 odds at 95% – and the execution algorithms used by institutional liquidity providers as a persistent source of demand that alters the asset’s downside dynamics. “It’s going to be sustained here because of the ETFs, because of the TWAP and VWAP and them entering the market. They’re not letting it come back down,” he said, referring to time- and volume-weighted execution that systematically slices large orders into the market over extended intervals. Related Reading: XRP Millionaires Dump After Major Accumulation Trend, Will It Be A Red September? He frames the current tape as a test the asset has already passed. “If it was going to [crash], there’s a bunch of stuff that rolled up and then it’s back down 90% since it went up. XRP hadn’t done that,” Clover noted, contrasting XRP’s behavior with other, sharper retracements elsewhere in crypto. In his reading, support has repeatedly asserted itself on the cross with Bitcoin as well. “It’s back on the line here where there’s been support on the Bitcoin and XRP chart. I think it’s up from here, especially if Bitcoin keeps going up,” he said, tying XRP’s path to the broader beta of the cycle. Clover also connects his outlook to a suite of prospective macro and market-structure tailwinds. He points to what he calls a “reverse carry trade,” the prospect of “adoption for the backend settlement of the stock market,” and the influence of ETF flows as scenario drivers that could render near-term entry prices largely irrelevant over a longer horizon. In one of the video’s most pointed passages, he underscores that view with a blunt thought experiment on future price levels: “You’re not going to care if you bought it at $2.30 or you bought it at $2.40 or you bought it at $2 when it’s a hundred dollars or $200 or $500.” Related Reading: XRP Will Lead The Next Upswing, Says Analyst — Here’s The Case The operational takeaway he offers to investors is procedural rather than tactical. Clover is explicit that market timing is a losing game for nearly everyone and that disciplined accumulation outperforms attempts to catch exact bottoms. “Dollar cost averaging is going to be your best bet 99.9% of the time,” he said. “Trying to time the market, you’re not going to do it. It’s like 1% of traders that ever timed the market well. And those that dollar cost average in, you’re going to win. Like you can’t, you can’t lose doing that. You’re going to get highs and lows, but your average is going to be pretty fair.” Risk management, in his account, is non-negotiable. He warns explicitly against taking on debt or leverage that compromises basic obligations in order to chase upside. “Don’t leverage yourself or over leverage yourself to the point where you can’t make your bills or can’t pay other stuff,” Clover said, adding that small, regular allocations made only from surplus cash are the appropriate way to express conviction while surviving the volatility that remains endemic to the asset class. If that thesis holds, the implication for strategy—again in Clover’s own words—is to stop waiting for the ghost of an old regime. “I know everybody wants the most they can get on stuff,” he said, “but dollar cost averaging is going to be your best bet… When you have some extra liquidity, buy a little bit.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.87.

XRP, Avalanche (AVAX), and a new viral low-cap altcoin are increasingly seen as leading candidates for investors hunting 1000% gains this cycle. This renewed interest follows a pattern observed in previous bull markets: once Bitcoin establishes momentum, capital rotates into altcoins with higher upside potential. Analysts believe we are entering that phase now, with major projects and early-stage tokens both poised to benefit. Among the low-cap names generating buzz is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project already flagged as one of the best altcoins to buy for aggressive bull run portfolios. XRP Positioned for Institutional Demand Ripple’s XRP has weathered years of regulatory battles, but its outlook in 2025 is dramatically different. With the possibility of XRP ETFs on the horizon and growing use in payment corridors, institutional adoption could drive demand higher. Price projections suggest XRP could rise toward $7–$10 if ETF approvals materialize, delivering the kind of exponential growth long anticipated by its community. Low-Cap Play With High ROI Potential Among presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. Forecasts suggest a 12,000% upside before late-stage euphoria drives the market , making it one of the most talked-about emerging tokens. What differentiates it from others is its transparent roadmap, audited tokenomics, and a strong focus on sustainability across cycles. With exchange listings expected to unlock mass adoption, it’s quickly gaining traction as the low-cap altcoin to watch in 2025. Avalanche (AVAX) Gains Momentum Avalanche is carving out its niche as a high-performance blockchain for DeFi, gaming, and real-world asset tokenization. With low fees and high throughput, it is positioning itself as a direct competitor to Ethereum. Analysts are eyeing the $250–$300 range for AVAX if capital rotation continues, a move that would represent significant upside from current levels. The Viral Low-Cap Trend History shows that each bull run creates a viral low-cap story — from Dogecoin in 2021 to PEPE in 2023. Analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could be that breakout narrative this cycle, particularly given the size of its community growth in just a few months. Viral momentum combined with sound tokenomics creates the kind of formula that has historically led to staggering returns. Conclusion With capital rotation underway, XRP and AVAX stand out as strong contenders for institutional adoption and ecosystem growth. At the same time, viral low-cap altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE represent speculative plays with the potential to deliver massive multiples. For investors who missed Bitcoin and Ethereum early, this could be a second chance to capture exponential returns before altcoin season reaches full swing.

51257058,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81965,1757113245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ethereum and Solana Price Outlook for 2026 – Can They Rally 50%?,https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-and-solana-price-outlook-for-2026-can-they-rally-50/,"The crypto market is never short on speculation, and as 2026 approaches, all eyes are on Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Both blockchains have set bold targets, rolled out upgrades, and captured strong developer activity, leaving investors asking if another 50% rally is within reach. These two networks, often seen as rivals, represent very different approaches to scaling and adoption, but each has carved out its place in the industry. Alongside this discussion, newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing comparisons to Ethereum’s earliest days. Analysts warn that early allocations are already disappearing at record speed, making it one of the fastest-moving presales of the year. With Ethereum and Solana chasing institutional inflows and next-generation upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a potential breakout story for investors who don’t want to miss the next wave of growth. Ethereum: Preparing for Its Next Evolution Ethereum continues to dominate the decentralized economy, powering everything from DeFi to NFTs. Having shifted to proof-of-stake, its next leap involves major scaling updates. Plans for Danksharding and ZK-based proving aim to drastically reduce fees while boosting throughput. If executed smoothly, these could eliminate Ethereum’s long-standing bottlenecks and keep it ahead of competitors. Institutional adoption is also on the horizon. A spot Ethereum ETF could trigger billions in inflows, replicating the surge seen after Bitcoin ETFs. Combined with the rapid growth of Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Linea, Ethereum is setting up a strong case for renewed upward momentum. If ETH surges 50% from its current price level, it would position the top altcoin at around $6,600. Solana: The Challenger With Speed Solana has earned a reputation as the “high-speed chain,” powering games, DeFi platforms, and NFT projects with low costs and rapid settlement times. Its 2026 upgrade cycle centers on the Alpenglow protocol , a redesigned consensus system that could bring near-instant finality. The chain’s ecosystem has already ballooned, with DeFi activity and total value locked (TVL) climbing higher. Talk of a spot Solana ETF adds another layer of potential, as institutional investors begin to view SOL as a long-term strategic asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. If regulatory clarity continues to improve, Solana could cement its position as the go-to high-performance blockchain. If SOL manages to jump 50% or more, it would place the price at around $300 (considering momentum continues to build.) MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early Momentum, Limited Access While Ethereum and Solana fight for dominance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a dark horse. What makes it stand out is the speed of its presale rounds, which are selling out faster than anticipated. Analysts note that early participants could see explosive upside similar to Ethereum’s first breakout phase , with the project’s focus on long-term utility and ecosystem expansion setting it apart from meme-driven tokens. With early access running out quickly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up as a rare early-stage opportunity , where relatively small allocations could turn into life-changing returns if adoption takes off. The 50% Surge: Can ETH and SOL Deliver? For Ethereum and Solana, a 50% rise in 2026 isn’t just possible – it’s within striking distance if everything aligns. Both networks must deliver their ambitious upgrades on time, attract institutional inflows, and fend off competition from new Layer 1 and Layer 2 players. Macro conditions, like interest rates and global risk appetite, will also heavily influence their performance. Conclusion Ethereum is betting on scalability and institutional adoption, while Solana leans on speed and ecosystem growth. If the altcoin season builds up momentum as many experts anticipate, without major setbacks, both assets could see significant gains in the next cycle, and 50% could just be the base case. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about early-stage projects, with presale demand signaling that its window of opportunity may not stay open for long. For investors, 2026 may offer multiple pathways to capture growth—if they position themselves before the market gets crowded.

51258829,575101,1757113258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51258829.jpeg,3 Fresh Wallets Buy $148.8M Ethereum – Signs Of Silent Stacking,https://bitcoinist.com/3-fresh-wallets-buy-148-8m-ethereum-silent-stacking/,"Ethereum is currently undergoing a price correction, slipping below key levels as selling pressure grows across the broader market. Despite this pullback, institutional interest in ETH remains resilient, with major players continuing to add aggressively to their holdings. Analysts have raised the possibility of a deeper correction, pointing to mounting volatility and the inability of ETH to reclaim the $4,500 zone. However, the long-term outlook still leans bullish as onchain data highlights consistent demand from whales and institutions. According to analyst Ted Pillows’ data, large-scale investors have been particularly active in recent days, withdrawing ETH from exchanges and reallocating it into long-term strategies and DeFi protocols. This divergence between short-term price weakness and long-term accumulation highlights Ethereum’s unique position in the current market cycle. While price action may continue to test lower levels in the near term, the fundamentals of Ethereum remain intact, with capital rotation and institutional flows supporting the broader bullish thesis. For investors, the coming weeks could prove decisive, as the market weighs short-term volatility against the persistent confidence of whales betting on Ethereum’s long-term strength. Whale Accumulation Reinforces Ethereum Position According to Pillows, Ethereum continues to attract large-scale buyers despite the recent correction, with data showing that three fresh wallets purchased $148,860,000 worth of ETH in the past few days. Such aggressive accumulation reinforces the conviction that institutions and whales maintain in Ethereum’s long-term potential, even as short-term volatility pressures the broader crypto market. While many retail investors are cautious, institutional players appear to be quietly stacking ETH, preparing for the next leg of growth. Their actions indicate not only faith in Ethereum’s fundamentals but also a recognition of its expanding role in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and as collateral within the broader crypto economy. The conviction displayed by these whales is a positive signal for the market, and one of the key reasons why ETH has been outperforming Bitcoin recently. As capital rotation continues to favor Ethereum, it suggests that big players are positioning for stronger relative performance compared to BTC. Technically, ETH must hold above the $4,000 level to preserve its bullish structure and maintain strength against Bitcoin. A breakdown below this threshold could weaken its position, but holding firm would provide the foundation for another surge. With whale conviction still rising, Ethereum’s resilience in this consolidation phase could set the stage for its next major move. Consolidation Above Key Price Levels Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $4,414, showing resilience after weeks of heightened volatility. The daily chart highlights a period of sideways consolidation just below the $4,500 resistance, a key level that bulls must reclaim to confirm renewed momentum. The moving averages provide important context: the 50-day SMA around $4,115 acts as the nearest short-term support, while the 100-day SMA at $3,368 remains further below, reinforcing the bullish structure despite the correction. The 200-day SMA sits at $2,721, well beneath the current price, underscoring ETH’s long-term strength in this cycle. Recent price action shows repeated attempts to break through the $4,500 level, each time meeting selling pressure. This rejection pattern highlights market caution, as traders anticipate further tests of support levels before a decisive move. Should ETH fail to hold above $4,200, the next significant demand area lies closer to $3,900. On the other hand, if buying pressure resumes, particularly from whales and institutions that have been accumulating aggressively, a breakout above $4,500 could quickly target the $4,800 region. For now, Ethereum remains in consolidation mode, balancing between strong fundamentals and the weight of short-term selling.

This monumental Robinhood S&P 500 inclusion marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company, but for the broader cryptocurrency landscape, further cementing digital assets within mainstream finance. However, not all crypto-related entities shared in this success, with one prominent strategy missing out. What Does S&P 500 Inclusion Mean for Robinhood? Becoming part of the S&P 500 is more than just a listing; it is a powerful symbol of legitimacy and market prominence. The S&P 500 index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, representing a significant portion of the total U.S. stock market value. For Robinhood, this inclusion brings several key benefits: Enhanced Visibility: Being part of such a widely followed index dramatically increases Robinhood’s exposure to institutional and retail investors alike. Increased Investment Flow: Many index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are designed to mirror the S&P 500. Consequently, these funds will automatically buy Robinhood shares, leading to increased demand and potentially more stable valuations. Credibility and Trust: Inclusion signals that Robinhood meets rigorous financial and operational standards, boosting investor confidence and market credibility. This development is a testament to Robinhood’s growth and its established position within the financial ecosystem. It also highlights the evolving nature of traditional indices to include companies that cater to modern investment trends, including cryptocurrency. How Does Robinhood’s S&P 500 Inclusion Impact the Crypto Market? Robinhood’s entry into the S&P 500 is particularly significant for the cryptocurrency space. It brings the total number of crypto-related companies in the index to three, joining industry giants like Coinbase and Block (formerly Square). This growing representation underscores a critical trend: Mainstream Legitimacy: Each new inclusion of a crypto-linked company in a major index further validates digital assets as a legitimate and integral part of the global financial system. Broader Investor Exposure: Institutional investors who might have previously shied away from direct crypto investments can now gain indirect exposure through companies like Robinhood within their diversified portfolios. Normalizing Digital Assets: This move helps to normalize cryptocurrency trading and ownership, potentially encouraging more traditional investors to explore the digital asset market. The collective presence of these companies within the S&P 500 suggests that the line between traditional finance and the crypto world is increasingly blurring, paving the way for greater integration and innovation. The Curious Case of Strategy: A Puzzling Omission Amidst Criteria? While Robinhood celebrates its inclusion, the report also noted that a company referred to as ‘Strategy’ was not included in the latest rebalancing, despite reportedly meeting all the requirements for inclusion. This detail raises questions about the selection process and the competitive landscape within the financial technology sector. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the S&P 500, uses a committee to make decisions on index additions and removals. While quantitative factors like market capitalization, liquidity, and profitability are crucial, qualitative factors can also play a role. The specific reasons for ‘Strategy’s’ omission are not detailed, but it highlights the intense competition and the discretionary nature of such high-profile index decisions. For other companies vying for similar recognition, this serves as a reminder that meeting basic criteria does not always guarantee inclusion, and the path to mainstream acceptance can be complex and challenging. Actionable Insights for Investors After Robinhood’s S&P 500 Inclusion For investors, this development offers several insights into the evolving market: Diversification Opportunities: The increasing presence of crypto-related companies in major indices provides new avenues for diversified exposure to the digital asset economy through traditional stock investments. Market Trends: This signals a continued trend towards the institutionalization and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Investors should observe how these companies perform within the index. Regulatory Environment: As more crypto-linked firms join traditional indices, the regulatory landscape will likely continue to adapt, potentially bringing more clarity and stability to the crypto market. Understanding these shifts can help investors make more informed decisions about their portfolios, balancing traditional assets with exposure to the rapidly growing digital economy. In conclusion, the Robinhood S&P 500 inclusion is a landmark event for the financial sector, underscoring the undeniable integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream investment vehicles. While it’s a significant win for Robinhood and the broader crypto market, the omission of ‘Strategy’ reminds us of the competitive and nuanced nature of index selection. This move undoubtedly paves the way for a more intertwined future between traditional finance and digital assets, promising exciting developments for investors and the market as a whole. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the S&P 500 index? The S&P 500 is a stock market index that represents the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It is widely regarded as one of the best gauges of large-cap U.S. equities and the overall health of the U.S. stock market. Why is Robinhood’s inclusion significant for crypto? Robinhood’s S&P 500 inclusion is significant because it further legitimizes cryptocurrency within mainstream finance. As a major platform for crypto trading, its presence in a top index increases institutional exposure and helps normalize digital assets for a broader investor base. Which other crypto-related companies are already in the S&P 500? With Robinhood’s addition, there will be three crypto-related companies in the S&P 500: Coinbase, Block (formerly Square), and now Robinhood. What does Robinhood’s S&P 500 inclusion mean for its investors? For Robinhood investors, inclusion in the S&P 500 typically means increased visibility, enhanced liquidity for shares, and potential for more stable stock performance due to automatic buying by index funds. It also boosts the company’s credibility. Why was ‘Strategy’ not included despite meeting requirements? While the exact reasons for ‘Strategy’s’ omission are not publicly detailed, S&P Dow Jones Indices’ committee considers both quantitative and qualitative factors for index selection. Even if a company meets basic criteria, other strategic considerations or discretionary decisions by the committee can influence the final outcome.

51258137,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81934,1757115019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,AI Models Forecast Where XRP Could Trade by the End of 2025,https://timestabloid.com/ai-models-forecast-where-xrp-could-trade-by-the-end-of-2025/,"Artificial intelligence platforms ChatGPT and Google Gemini have shared projections for where XRP might stand by December 2025, taking into account several potential catalysts for Ripple and its native token. Ripple is currently navigating a series of major initiatives that could significantly affect XRP’s valuation . One of the most closely watched is the potential approval of a U.S.-based spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP . Prediction market Polymarket assigns a 91% probability that regulators will authorize at least one ETF before the year ends. In addition, Ripple has applied for a national bank charter in the United States. The filing, made in July, is now under review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, with a decision expected by late October. Securing this charter would allow Ripple to operate more directly within the country’s regulated banking framework. The company is also expanding internationally. In recent weeks, Ripple has formed partnerships with African fintech firms, including Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card, to advance cross-border payment solutions using RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. RLUSD has quickly gained traction, with its market capitalization surpassing $700 million. Since many RLUSD transfers are settled through the XRP Ledger, its growing adoption indirectly increases XRP’s utility. ChatGPT’s Forecast for December 2025 At present, XRP is priced at $2.84 , with a market capitalization of about $169 billion. Asked about its potential price by the end of 2025, ChatGPT outlined several possibilities based on different outcomes. In a conservative case, if ETF approval moves forward but the bank charter is delayed, ChatGPT expects XRP could climb to a range of $5 to $7. This would represent an increase of roughly 80% to 150% from current levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Should both the ETF and bank charter receive approval while RLUSD adoption continues to rise, the model projects a stronger outcome, with XRP advancing to between $10 and $15. This scenario would imply a market capitalization approaching $600 billion. Under the most optimistic assumptions, where institutional and retail demand accelerate together, ChatGPT believes XRP could even exceed $20 in a speculative rally. Google Gemini’s Perspective Google Gemini offered a more cautious outlook. According to its assessment, an ETF approval alone could lift XRP by about 60%, placing the token near $4.48. If Ripple also secures the bank charter, Gemini foresees an additional 20% to 25% increase, bringing XRP into the $5.38 to $5.60 range. With sustained growth in RLUSD adoption and strategic partnerships, Gemini concludes the year-end price could settle between $5.65 and $6.16. While these projections highlight the potential impact of upcoming events, both platforms stressed that the figures are speculative. Market conditions, regulatory outcomes, and adoption rates remain uncertain, and there is no guarantee XRP will respond as modeled even if the developments occur.

Recently, WLFI made headlines with a significant move aimed at bolstering crypto security . Their proactive decision to blacklist 272 addresses over the past week underscores a critical commitment to safeguarding users from the ever-present threat of account abuse. This action highlights a crucial aspect of navigating the cryptocurrency world: vigilance and decisive intervention are paramount. Why is Proactive Crypto Security Essential? WLFI’s recent actions, initially shared on X, provide a clear example of how digital platforms are fighting back against malicious activities. The firm’s decision to blacklist 272 addresses wasn’t arbitrary; it was a targeted effort to protect the community. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, threats like phishing attacks and compromised accounts are unfortunately common. These incidents can lead to significant financial losses for unsuspecting individuals. Here’s a breakdown of the blacklisted addresses: 215 Addresses: These were blocked specifically to prevent the transfer of funds originating from sophisticated phishing attacks. Phishing attempts trick users into revealing sensitive information, leading to unauthorized access to their digital wallets. 50 Addresses: Blacklisted at the direct request of their original owners. These individuals had reported their accounts as compromised, meaning unauthorized parties had gained control. This strategic blacklisting is a vital layer of defense, demonstrating a commitment to enhancing overall crypto security . How WLFI Safeguards Your Digital Assets WLFI isn’t just blocking addresses; they are actively working to mitigate the damage caused by these illicit activities. Their statement confirms a dedication to supporting victims. The firm plans to collaborate directly with those whose accounts were compromised, aiming to assist in the recovery of their funds. This level of engagement goes beyond simple blocking; it’s about providing a pathway to restitution. This commitment is crucial for building trust within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. When platforms take such decisive steps, it reassures users that their investments are being protected. WLFI has also indicated that they will share further updates, suggesting ongoing transparency and a continuous effort to evolve their crypto security measures. It’s a testament to their proactive stance in a landscape often targeted by bad actors. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Security Challenges The digital asset space, while innovative, faces constant security challenges. The sheer volume and speed of transactions make it an attractive target for cybercriminals. From sophisticated phishing campaigns to elaborate social engineering scams, the methods used to exploit users are ever-evolving. This makes the role of platforms like WLFI even more critical. They act as front-line defenders, identifying and neutralizing threats before they can cause widespread harm. Common challenges in crypto security include: Phishing Attacks: Deceptive websites or emails designed to steal login credentials. Malware and Viruses: Software designed to compromise devices and steal private keys. Social Engineering: Tricking users into performing actions that compromise their security. Exploits in Smart Contracts: Vulnerabilities in code leading to fund loss. Understanding these threats is the first step in effective protection. What Can You Do to Enhance Your Personal Crypto Security? While platforms like WLFI play a vital role, individual users also bear responsibility for their own crypto security . Being informed and adopting best practices can significantly reduce your risk. Think of it as a shared responsibility: the platform provides the infrastructure, and you secure your access points. Here are some actionable insights to protect your digital assets: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always use 2FA on all your crypto accounts and exchanges. Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Never reuse passwords, and use a password manager. Be Wary of Phishing: Double-check URLs, email senders, and never click suspicious links. Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, consider using a hardware wallet for offline storage. Educate Yourself: Stay updated on common scams and security threats. Regularly Monitor Accounts: Keep an eye on your transaction history for any unauthorized activity. Taking these steps can significantly bolster your personal defense against potential threats. WLFI’s decisive action to blacklist 272 addresses is a powerful reminder of the ongoing battle for crypto security . By actively protecting victims of account abuse and phishing attacks, they are setting a strong precedent for platform responsibility. As the digital asset world continues to expand, such proactive measures, combined with informed user practices, will be indispensable in fostering a safer and more trustworthy environment for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “blacklisting addresses” mean in the context of crypto security? A1: Blacklisting addresses means identifying and marking specific cryptocurrency wallet addresses as associated with malicious activities, such as phishing or theft. Platforms then prevent funds from being sent to or received from these blacklisted addresses, effectively isolating them to protect users and prevent further illicit transactions. Q2: How can I tell if an address is involved in a phishing attack? A2: It’s often difficult for an individual to definitively identify a phishing address without expert tools. However, you should always be suspicious of unsolicited requests for funds, unexpected links, or promises of unrealistic returns. Always verify the sender’s identity and the legitimacy of any platform through official channels before interacting with any address. Q3: What should I do if my crypto account is compromised? A3: If you suspect your crypto account has been compromised, immediately take action: change all passwords, enable or strengthen 2FA, and notify the platform or exchange support team. Provide them with all relevant details, including transaction IDs and any communication logs. Acting quickly can sometimes limit the damage. Q4: Is WLFI the only platform taking such security measures? A4: No, many reputable cryptocurrency platforms and exchanges actively implement various security measures, including blacklisting, fraud detection, and victim support. WLFI’s actions highlight a broader industry trend towards enhancing crypto security and protecting users from illicit activities. It’s a collective effort across the ecosystem. Q5: How can I recover funds if they were stolen in a phishing attack? A5: Recovering stolen crypto funds can be challenging, but not impossible. Immediately report the incident to the platform involved and, if possible, to law enforcement. Platforms like WLFI sometimes assist victims in fund recovery, especially if the funds are still traceable within their system. However, success depends on many factors, including how quickly the theft is reported and the nature of the attack. Found this article insightful?

For those deeply entrenched in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, understanding these foundational shifts in artificial intelligence is paramount. Just as decentralized networks rely on robust protocols, the future of AI hinges on the careful cultivation of its core behavior. Recent developments within OpenAI highlight a pivotal moment: a significant reorganization of the team responsible for shaping the very essence—the personality—of its groundbreaking models, including ChatGPT. This move isn’t just an internal reshuffle; it’s a strategic realignment poised to redefine how we interact with advanced AI, influencing everything from user experience to the ethical frameworks governing these powerful tools. OpenAI ‘s Strategic Shift: Realigning Research for Deeper Integration OpenAI , the powerhouse behind revolutionary AI models, is undertaking a significant restructuring of its Model Behavior team. This small yet influential group, comprising roughly 14 researchers, has been instrumental in defining how AI models interact with users. According to an August memo to staff, Chief Research Officer Mark Chen announced that the Model Behavior team would integrate into the larger Post Training team, a group dedicated to refining AI models post-initial pre-training. This integration means the Model Behavior team will now report to Max Schwarzer, the Post Training lead. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed these changes, signaling a strategic move to embed the nuances of AI personality directly into core model development. This reorganization underscores OpenAI ‘s commitment to evolving its AI capabilities. By bringing the Model Behavior team’s expertise closer to the fundamental development cycle, the company aims to ensure that AI personality is not an afterthought but a central consideration from the outset. This strategic pivot reflects the increasing importance of user experience and ethical considerations in the deployment of advanced AI. How Does This Impact ChatGPT Personality and User Experience? The Model Behavior team’s primary mission has been to sculpt the ChatGPT personality , ensuring models interact effectively and appropriately with users. Their work has focused on critical areas: Shaping AI Personality: Defining the conversational tone, empathy, and overall demeanor of AI models. Reducing Sycophancy: Actively working to prevent AI models from merely agreeing with user beliefs, even potentially harmful ones, instead promoting balanced and critical responses. Navigating Political Bias: Developing strategies to ensure AI responses remain neutral and fair across diverse political viewpoints. Defining AI Consciousness: Contributing to OpenAI ‘s stance and understanding of what constitutes AI consciousness. In recent months, OpenAI has faced considerable scrutiny regarding the perceived changes in ChatGPT personality . Users noted a colder, less engaging tone in GPT-5, despite the company’s efforts to reduce sycophancy. This led to a public response, including restoring access to legacy models like GPT-4o and releasing updates to make newer GPT-5 responses feel “warmer and friendlier” without compromising on sycophancy reduction. The integration of the Model Behavior team is a direct response to these user feedback cycles, aiming for a more harmonized and user-centric approach to AI personality development. The Evolving Landscape of AI Model Behavior and Ethical Challenges The work of the AI Model Behavior team is complex, navigating the fine line between creating helpful, friendly chatbots and avoiding harmful sycophancy. This challenge was starkly highlighted by a recent lawsuit filed against OpenAI . In August, the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine sued OpenAI , alleging that ChatGPT (specifically a GPT-4o powered version) failed to adequately push back against their son’s suicidal ideations in the months leading up to his death. It is important to note that the Model Behavior team did not exist during GPT-4o’s development, underscoring the ongoing and critical need for such specialized teams. This incident, while tragic, brings into sharp focus the immense responsibility inherent in shaping AI Model Behavior . The ethical implications of AI interactions are profound, demanding constant vigilance and iterative refinement. The reorganization aims to integrate these ethical considerations more deeply into the development pipeline, ensuring that the ‘personality’ of AI models is not just about user satisfaction but also about safety and responsible interaction. Pioneering the Future: Joanne Jang and OAI Labs for Generative AI As part of these changes, Joanne Jang, the founding leader of the Model Behavior team, is embarking on a new venture within OpenAI . She is establishing a new research team called OAI Labs, where she will serve as General Manager, reporting directly to Mark Chen. OAI Labs’ ambitious mission is to “invent and prototype new interfaces for how people collaborate with AI.” Jang expressed her excitement about moving beyond the conventional chat paradigm, which she feels is often associated with companionship or autonomous agents. Jang envisions AI systems as “instruments for thinking, making, playing, doing, learning, and connecting.” This forward-thinking approach for Generative AI seeks to explore novel interaction patterns that could redefine human-AI collaboration. While it’s early days, the potential for OAI Labs to revolutionize how we engage with AI, possibly even collaborating with figures like former Apple design chief Jony Ive on AI hardware, is significant. This initiative reflects OpenAI ‘s continuous drive to innovate and expand the utility and accessibility of its advanced Generative AI capabilities. Addressing the Core: Why This Matters for AI Ethics and Trust The overarching theme of OpenAI ‘s reorganization is a profound commitment to refining AI Ethics and building user trust. By integrating the Model Behavior team’s expertise more closely with core model development, OpenAI acknowledges that the ‘personality’ and ethical framework of its AI are not secondary features but fundamental components of its success and societal acceptance. The company is actively responding to user feedback and critical incidents, striving to create AI that is both highly capable and responsibly deployed. This internal shift signifies a maturation in the field of AI development. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, the need for robust ethical guidelines and carefully designed interactions grows exponentially. For users, especially those exploring the decentralized world of crypto, trust in underlying technologies is paramount. OpenAI ‘s proactive steps in shaping AI Ethics and behavior are crucial for fostering this trust, ensuring that advanced AI serves humanity positively and responsibly. The Road Ahead: A Balanced and Trustworthy AI Future OpenAI ‘s reorganization of its Model Behavior team and the launch of OAI Labs mark a significant evolution in its approach to AI development. These changes reflect a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in creating intelligent systems that are not only powerful but also empathetic, ethical, and genuinely helpful. By embedding the principles of responsible AI Model Behavior and focusing on innovative human-AI interfaces, OpenAI is laying the groundwork for a future where AI can be a trusted partner in various aspects of life, from creative endeavors to critical decision-making. The journey to a perfectly balanced AI is ongoing, but these strategic adjustments indicate a clear direction towards a more thoughtful and user-centric future for Generative AI .

This announcement , made by S&P Dow Jones Indices, has sent ripples through the community, particularly given the recent speculation surrounding the potential inclusion of Strategy, the Bitcoin treasury firm led by Michael Saylor. Robinhood Joins S&P 500 Joining Robinhood in the S&P 500 are AppLovin, a marketing platform, and Emcor, a mechanical and electrical construction services company. These firms will replace MarketAxess, a bond trading platform, and Enphase Energy, a solar inverter manufacturer, respectively. The changes are set to take effect on September 22. Following the announcement, shares of Robinhood experienced a notable rise, climbing 7.3% in extended trading. AppLovin saw a 7% increase, while Emcor gained 2.2%. Notably, Robinhood’s stock has more than doubled this year in line with the broader cryptocurrency market, bringing the company’s market capitalization to approximately $91.5 billion. No Official Comment From Strategy Earlier this year, Coinbase made headlines as the first digital asset firm to join the S&P 500, adding a layer of legitimacy to the US cryptocurrency sector which has gained significant traction under President Donald Trump’s administration. The announcement also follows a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) from Michael Saylor that hinted at Strategy’s potential inclusion in the S&P 500: Nasdaq’s new position on digital asset treasury formations doesn’t affect Strategy, our ATMs or our other capital markets activities. As of this writing, there has been no official statement from the company or Saylor himself regarding Strategy’s failure to join the prestigious index on Friday.

By the end of the year, the market capitalization had ballooned from just $50.9 million in October to $4.6 billion. Trading fees reached as high as $1.5 million a day, while the leading agent token, AIXBT, grew from $162,000 on its November launch to nearly $1 billion just two months later. Since then, Virtuals’ market cap has fallen to less than $704 million, down 84% from its peak. AI agent tokens show signs of divergence Despite the gloom that befell the AI agent token space, for the first time, fundamentals are beginning to decouple from weak token prices. In August, daily fees within the Virtuals ecosystem rose from $33,000 to $230,000, even as the market cap fell by 10%, according to data shared on X by Chris Davis, a researcher at Messari, a crypto market intelligence platform. Virtuals fee generation and market cap in August. Source: Messari The market itself has been experiencing a shift in leadership. In early August, Ribbita dethroned AIXBT as the leading token, while another project, launched in July by former Coinbase engineer Luke Youngblood, also surpassed AIXBT . Some quarters believe that newer-generation agents with better use cases are getting attention from market participants compared to the first-generation agents. Projects like Mamo, an automated yield-farming agent integrated into Coinbase’s Base app, have attracted around $138 million in deposits, a signal of growing institutional-style demand. Quality over quantity The performance of standout agents has brought the ecosystem back to the limelight. ArAIstotle, a multilingual fact-checking agent developed by the team behind facticity.ai and listed by TIME as one of 2024’s best inventions, has outlined an enterprise-driven monetization strategy. Since its August launch, its token has risen by 3,170%, reaching a $16.2 million market cap a few days before the end of the month. Another notable case is 1000xAgent, built by crypto investors Avi Felman and Jonah Van Bourg and tied to their podcast “1000xPod.” The project utilizes an AI terminal for market analysis with a token buyback model funded by podcast revenues. In August alone, its token rose more than five-fold. The Virtuals team is also experimenting with new community structures though its Genesis launch mechanism allows participants to pledge “Virgen Points,” earned by staking the core VIRTUAL token, for allocations in new projects. Over half of all individual staking positions, representing 56% of over 73,000 accounts, are locked for 104 weeks. Clouds on the horizon The latest rebound comes after a tough first half of 2025 for AI Agents. In March, AIXBT suffered a hack that drained around 55.5 ETH, triggering a 20% token drop. The breach is one of the challenges early-stage ecosystems like this one face, as investors already have little trust in them, and these hacks cause further strain. For enthusiasts, however, this period of reduced hype may offer a rare window to position ahead of renewed interest, and it may account for why there’s a surge as investors see promise and want to put their cash where their mouth is, given the rising use cases and adoption of AI globally. The alignment of stronger fundamentals and an engaged core community suggests that the sector is not merely a passing fad. It also shows that investors are placing a premium on quality projects with proper use cases.

Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Oxford Economics now all expect the Fed to cut rates three times between September and November. According to Kalshi, the probability of a 25 basis point cut at the September 17 meeting has jumped to 99%, while the odds of a more aggressive 50 basis point cut have climbed to 12%, up from zero just a day earlier. Morgan Stanley said Friday’s report “tilts risks in the direction of 75 basis points in cuts by year-end.” Oxford Economics made its own adjustment, now projecting a rate cut in September rather than December. But the surprising change came from Bank of America. Analysts there now expect 25 basis point cuts in both September and December, abandoning their earlier prediction of no cuts until 2026. Aditya Bhave, senior U.S. economist at the bank, explained that “there is now clearer evidence of deterioration in labor demand, not just supply.” Bank of America now sees five more cuts into 2026 Aditya also said that inflation measured by the core PCE gauge could hit 3% in August and likely rise toward the end of the year. Despite that, the Fed is unlikely to hike in October. The reasoning is simple; too many signs now point to a weaker hiring environment. In fact, Bank of America’s new forecast includes three more quarter-point cuts in 2026, starting in June, which would lower the Fed’s target rate to 3%-3.25%, down from the current 4.25%-4.5%. This updated path now lines up with the broader view across Wall Street. Swap contracts that track the Fed’s next moves have already priced in not just a September cut, but also strong chances of cuts at the two other remaining meetings this year. Until now, Bank of America was the only top-tier bank not on board with a September cut. That’s no longer the case. Markets didn’t waste time reacting. The 10-year Treasury yield sank by 10 basis points to 4.076%, and gold hit a record high of $3,644.90 per ounce, rising 1% on the day. The reaction shows traders are treating the rate cuts as near-certain. There’s growing sentiment that the Fed may have to move quicker than expected. Analysts brace for even faster cuts after jobs data disappointment The jobs report released at 8:30 a.m. ET pushed expectations into overdrive. Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO, said the report was “disappointing” and “will start the conversation about whether the FOMC should cut 50 bp on September 17.” While Ian still believes a 25 basis point cut is most likely, he warned that “next week’s benchmark revisions and CPI could shift the market’s perception.” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said the weak numbers “leave the door wide open for the Fed to cut rates at the September 17th meeting.” He pointed out that the current labor environment might require fewer job additions to keep unemployment flat. “Last year it was between 100,000 and 150,000,” Art said. “This year with limited emigration and retiring baby boomers it is likely closer to 50,000.” Saira Malik, head of equities and fixed income at Nuveen, told CNBC that “this gives the Fed the greenlight to cut by 25 basis points,” and added that “it’s going to bring 50 basis points of rate cuts on the table for this September FOMC meeting and that’s why markets are positive.” Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, noted that the August employment dip wasn’t surprising. He said the Bureau of Labor Statistics has repeatedly revised its job numbers downward in recent months. “The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,” Joe said. Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said the August payrolls report “did little to quell fears of a recessionary-esque labor backdrop.” Job creation is “at stall speed,” Jeff said, adding that “nothing in today’s report changes the outlook for a September rate cut.” He said the data supports “additional and faster rate cuts beyond September,” and warned that the QCEW revisions next week could further impact how much ground the FOMC lays for the rest of the year.

Ethereum, Solana, and XRP started as niche bets before gaining mass recognition. As 2025 matures, investors are asking which smaller projects could step into the spotlight over the next five years. The likely winners pair real technical edge with compelling narratives, strong communities, and improving liquidity. Modular data availability, decentralized compute, high-throughput trading chains, and new programming models are all fertile terrain for the next breakout. Diversification matters, but so does selection: choose projects with traction, clear use cases, and momentum that can compound. Alongside this hunt for the next big names, cultural plays with credibility are also drawing attention, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly mentioned in those conversations as a narrative asset with unusual legitimacy. Celestia (TIA) – modular data availability Celestia popularized the modular thesis: separate data availability from execution so many chains can scale in parallel. By offering a DA layer that rollups can post to, Celestia lowers costs and opens the door to an ecosystem of specialized blockchains. If the next wave of apps prefers app-specific rollups, a neutral DA backbone can accrue value from broad adoption. The metric to watch is how many production rollups actually settle on Celestia and whether developer tooling keeps onboarding teams quickly. If modular wins, TIA could graduate from niche to necessary. Injective (INJ) – on-chain trading infrastructure Injective targets orderbook-style trading natively on a fast chain, enabling derivatives, spot, and structured products with cross-chain routing. That makes it a candidate to capture exchange-like fees without the custodial risks of centralized venues. Its appeal rests on latency, liquidity depth, and product breadth. If volumes migrate from CEXs to performant DEXs, protocols that feel familiar to pro traders can scale. Keep an eye on institutional-grade market makers integrating with Injective and the pace of new markets listed. Akash Network (AKT) – decentralized cloud As AI demand explodes, GPU compute is scarce and expensive. Akash matches providers of idle compute with buyers via a decentralized marketplace, aiming to undercut centralized cloud pricing. The story is compelling because it ties crypto to a massive real-world bottleneck. For AKT to become a big name, capacity must grow, developer experience must improve, and workloads need to move from trials to production. If decentralized cloud becomes a line item for AI teams, AKT’s relevance could compound. MAGACOIN FINANCE – credibility meets cultural momentum Hidden-gem lists are not only about infrastructure. Narratives move markets, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales marrying story and structure. With both CertiK and HashEx audits completed , it carries a legitimacy most meme-driven tokens lack. The project’s scarcity framing and rapidly expanding community have turned heads, while analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could climb toward 7,800% ROI , inviting comparisons to SHIB’s early mania phase. The difference here is credibility embedded at launch, which is why some traders view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare cultural asset that can sustain momentum beyond the first listing window. In a market where trust and narrative often diverge, MAGACOIN FINANCE aims to fuse them. Sei (SEI) – trading-optimized Layer 1 Sei is built for speed and parallelization, targeting use cases where milliseconds matter: orderbooks, gaming, prediction markets, and social trading. Its thesis is simple: a chain optimized for exchange-like experiences can capture flows that generic chains struggle with. For Sei to level up, it needs sticky applications, strong liquidity incentives, and visible user growth. If it becomes the default substrate for high-frequency on-chain apps, its brand can graduate from promising to prominent. How to build exposure to tomorrow’s names A smart approach blends themes. Modular data availability captures rollup growth. Decentralized cloud taps AI compute demand. Trading-focused chains ride the perennial need for liquidity and execution. Meanwhile, a small allocation to credible cultural tokens can juice returns when narratives turn. It’s about constructing a basket where each position has a different reason to win and a different adoption funnel. Conclusion Big names are crowned by usage, not slogans. Over the next five years, Celestia , Injective , Akash , Sei , and Sui each have credible paths from promising to prominent if execution and adoption compound. And in parallel, MAGACOIN FINANCE shows how cultural branding supported by audits can turn narrative into staying power. For investors willing to balance infrastructure bets with a measured allocation to credible culture plays, this mix could define the next wave of breakout winners.

This breakout signals a shift in momentum, as the price action re-establishes a clear upward trend. Technical Setup Signals Room For Further Upside Crypto VIP Signal, in a recent update on X, highlighted that SUI has sustained its bullish momentum exactly as anticipated, successfully breaking out of the falling wedge pattern. This breakout is a strong technical signal often associated with trend reversals, suggesting that the token has shifted from a period of consolidation into a phase of renewed upward strength. Such a move indicates that market sentiment is leaning toward optimism, with buyers steadily reclaiming control. Related Reading: 20 Million New SUI Tokens Push Treasury To New High – Details The update further explained that following the breakout, SUI retested the support line, a critical step in confirming the validity of the breakout. Holding this support level firmly not only reinforces the bullish structure but also builds a stronger foundation for future gains. This development underscores the resilience of SUI’s price action, as it demonstrates the ability of the market to absorb selling pressure while maintaining upward momentum. Looking ahead, Crypto VIP Signal pointed to $3.50 as the next key resistance level that traders and investors should keep an eye on. If this level is broken, it would likely attract more buyers into the market, creating the conditions for SUI to extend its upward trajectory and establish new short-term highs. SUI Indicators Align For Potential Upside Continuation Adding to the growing bullish outlook for SUI, Gemxbt recently emphasized in a post that the token is showing signs of a strong reversal. The analysis revealed that SUI’s price has crossed above both the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which strengthens the case for continued upward pressure in the near term. Related Reading: SUI Holds The Line: Rounded Bottom Hints At 13% Breakout Setup Resistance is currently positioned near $3.35, a zone that will play a pivotal role in determining whether SUI can maintain its bullish breakout. On the downside, strong support is established around $3.20, serving as a safety net in case of short-term pullbacks. Holding this support will be essential for sustaining market confidence. In addition to these key levels, momentum indicators are also aligning with the current bullish narrative. The RSI has begun rising from oversold territory, signaling renewed buying interest, while the MACD has confirmed a bullish crossover. Together, these technical signals suggest that SUI could be gearing up for another upward push, with momentum building toward testing and possibly breaking above the next resistance barrier.

VET Chases 800% Rally While BlockDAG Nears $400M with Over 200,000 Holders on Board",https://thecoinrise.com/can-xrp-reach-3-10-vet-chases-800-rally-while-blockdag-nears-400m-with-over-200000-holders-on-board/,"The 2025 market outlook has gained momentum as major projects deliver bold signals. XRP is being tracked closely, with analysts pointing toward a $3.10 target if the $2.97–$2.84 support range holds. VeChain (VET) could see up to 800% growth should resistance at $0.032 be broken. Yet BlockDAG (BDAG) is attracting the most attention. Unlike usual presales, BDAG has secured listings on 20 large exchanges such as MEXC, BitMart, and LBank. Backed by almost $400M presale and a 2,900% price increase since launch, BDAG has already proven its momentum. Analysts are calling it one of the strongest prospects of 2025, with potential to reach $1. VET Price Prediction: 800% Target in Play VeChain is trading at $0.02587 with a $2.22 billion market cap. Its trading volume has climbed 237% in 24 hours to $179.54 million. This shows strong new participation. Support rests at $0.024–$0.022, with resistance near $0.032. Breaking above could push toward $0.25315, offering an 800% gain. Still, risks exist. Losing support zones, slower corporate adoption, or unclear regulations could delay progress. Even with these issues, the surge in trading volume suggests growing attention. Analysts remain cautiously positive, noting that VET may surprise if momentum continues through 2025. Ripple Price Analysis: $3.10 Remains the Key Level XRP trades at $2.95, carrying a market cap of $176.03 billion and 24-hour trading volume of $12.35 billion. Despite a 1.98% dip, its setup remains steady. Analysts say the $2.97–$2.84 range is crucial, and breaking higher could send XRP above $3.10. Market data shows a 119.74% jump in trading volume to $12.58 billion, while open interest fell 0.90% to $8.27 billion. The numbers point to increased engagement but also some caution. The outcome depends on whether XRP can break the resistance. If achieved, it could confirm fresh growth potential in 2025. Regulatory concerns and profit-taking may test progress, but the structure remains positive. BlockDAG Confirms 20 Listings, Raises Almost $400M & Sells 19,500+ Miners! BlockDAG is setting a higher standard in presales. It has locked in listings on 20 major exchanges, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com. Most presales secure one or two, but BlockDAG has built worldwide access from the start. This approach gives BDAG stronger liquidity and faster reach once trading begins. The presale numbers reflect this strategy. BlockDAG has raised close to $400 million, selling more than 25.9 billion coins. The price began at $0.001 and surged up to $0.03 in batch 30, showing a 2,900% increase. More than 200,000 holders are already involved, proving consistent demand. Currently the coin is available at a limited time price of $0.0013 until October 1 right before BlockDAG Deployment Event aligning the community under one simple presale model Hardware sales also support the project. Over $7.8 million worth of miners have been sold, with 19,500+ units purchased. The X1 app now has 2.5 million active users, giving the network scale in both digital and hardware mining. With proven demand, mass adoption, and confirmed exchange access, analysts suggest BDAG could be the next $1 coin. Each batch reduces low-cost entry, keeping urgency high. Final Look The crypto market in 2025 is showing potential across many projects. XRP is holding near a $3.10 target, and VeChain carries an 800% outlook. But BlockDAG has set itself apart. Now at $0.0013 in its final presale stretch, it has raised almost $400M and delivered a 2,900% increase. With 20 exchange listings, its global reach is already secure. Each batch brings higher prices, reducing chances for low entry. Analysts see BDAG as the frontrunner for 2025. For many, this presale offers one of the clearest paths to growth.

51259227,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81970,1757116835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP ETF Decisions Are Coming: What Investors Should Know,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-decisions-are-coming-what-investors-should-know/,"An XRP ETF has gone from being a long shot to a real possibility. From the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs early in 2024 to spot Ether ETFs in late 2024, the natural progression has been set for the next major ETF contender – XRP. These approvals proved that legitimate, regulated, and mainstream access to leading crypto assets is possible – and helped build what an XRP product could look like. At the same time, buoyant projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its astonishing ROI projections by the end of 2025, have garnered attention from investors as one of the best altcoin projects to invest in before they explode. What is an XRP ETF? In simple terms, an XRP ETF would simply invest in XRP and trade on a stock exchange. Instead of having to set up a crypto wallet or deal with private keys, you simply buy or sell your shares via a standard brokerage account. Where is the Project in the Approval Process? One reason why this discussion is heating up now is that the long SEC lawsuit against XRP has finally concluded. With the legal cloud removed, there are multiple issuers now queuing to create spot XRP ETF proposals. The issuers have until October 2025, but several substantive decisions could be handed down in a rapidly increasing flow of final SEC decisions from Grayscale, Bitwise, and others. Why an XRP ETF Matters If an XRP ETF is approved, investors can expect to gain several advantages from this: Simplicity : Easy access to the brokerage without any technical crypto knowledge required. Regulatory Clarity: SEC approval serves as a hallmark of legitimacy and lends credibility. Diversification: Provides an alternative payments approach to a portfolio of BTC or ETH. Liquidity: Higher volume, tighter spreads, smoother institutional entry. Key Risks to Keep in Mind While an XRP ETF has the potential to be transformative, it is not without its risks, which investors should not overlook: Market Volatility – XRP is a highly sensitive cryptocurrency to sentiment and macro factors. No Direct Ownership – ETF holders own shares in the fund and not XRP itself. Over-Hyped Rallies : Prices can spike before approval, and then drop off after the trial is completed. Competition: XRP is still competing in the worldwide payments market. About What Early-Stage Angle Investors Are Talking About MAGACOIN FINANCE is another mega bullish early-stage play, and is making waves separately from XRP. Analysts expect it to provide an eye-popping 22,000% ROI by the end of 2025, that’s why investors are jumping in now at the right time while allocations last. The hype is genuine, however, just like any speculative token, it is essential to properly size positions and track advancements. Fourth, its impressive tokenomics, growing community, and record-breaking growth make it one of the go-to selections for investors ahead of the Blast off season for Altcoins. What to Expect Next For the next few years, ending in October 2025, headlines are all but guaranteed as the SEC continues to push against final deadlines on numerous XRP ETF filings. For XRP, a green light will be a milestone towards its access to the mainstream. It may not lead to an instant price explosion, but it may pave the way for consistent flows if institutional adoption gains momentum over the years. Bottom Line The story behind the XRP ETF is about expanding, democratizing, and making it easier and safer for everyone to access it. This would be another step towards crypto joining the ranks of standard portfolios, as are the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, projects that promise high ROI on speculative investments such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the interests of speculators. The key is to strike a balance between opportunity and risk and take a long-term view.

51259228,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81938,1757116836,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Outlook if Tokenization Captures 10% of Global GDP by 2030,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-outlook-if-tokenization-captures-10-of-global-gdp-by-2030/,"The prospect of large-scale asset tokenization has emerged as one of the most-discussed topics in global finance. Ripple has consistently highlighted the trend, stressing that institutions will require the same standards of custody, trust, and security for tokenized assets that they currently rely on in traditional finance. The company recently pointed to projections that show tokenization could play a transformative role in the world economy by the end of this decade. Tokenization Forecasts and Global GDP Growth A report from Boston Consulting Group estimates that tokenized assets could represent up to 10% of global GDP by 2030. This estimate has generated considerable interest among investors and market analysts who see significant opportunities for blockchain networks positioned to support large-scale tokenization. To place this forecast into perspective, global GDP has grown consistently in recent years. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows worldwide economic output was valued at $86.1 trillion in 2020, rising to $106.9 trillion by 2023. By 2024, estimates put the figure at approximately $111.2 trillion. Assuming an average annual growth rate of about 6.7%, global GDP could reach $164 trillion by 2030. If 10% of this total is tokenized, the market would be worth roughly $16.4 trillion. The Role of the XRP Ledger in Tokenization The question of which networks could capture a meaningful share of this projected market remains open. Analysts often point to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as a strong contender. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, previously confirmed that the ledger is adapting its infrastructure to support tokenization . Similarly, asset manager Bitwise has identified XRP as one of the clearest ways to gain exposure to the tokenization trend. If XRPL were to capture 15% of the tokenization market, that would correspond to $2.46 trillion in tokenized value hosted on the ledger. The impact this would have on the price of XRP depends on how much of that value requires backing by the native token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential XRP Price Outcomes To assess this, we examined projections from ChatGPT. In one bullish outlook, where XRP directly underpins tokenized reserves, the ledger’s share of $2.46 trillion would equate to an XRP market capitalization of the same size. With approximately 59.5 billion XRP in circulation, this would place the token at about $41. However, tokenized asset value does not necessarily convert directly into token valuation. At present, the XRPL holds around $306.8 million in tokenized assets, while XRP itself maintains a market cap exceeding $160 billion. This indicates that other factors, such as liquidity demand, speculation, and payment utility, play an essential role in shaping the price. Another projection assumes XRP becomes a preferred settlement asset for cross-border payments. If 3% of global GDP transactions, about $4.92 trillion in 2030, were to move through the XRPL, and 20% of that activity required XRP reserves, the implied capitalization would be $984 billion. This translates to roughly $16.55 per token. With additional premiums driven by speculation and adoption momentum, ChatGPT suggested a possible range of $40 to $50. Finally, in a more ambitious combined scenario where XRP captures market share from both tokenized assets and global settlement flows, the token could see valuations exceeding $100. The expansion of tokenization could unlock a multi-trillion-dollar market by 2030, and Ripple’s positioning suggests the XRPL may benefit from this shift. While projections remain speculative, the possibility of XRP reaching double or even triple-digit valuations highlights the scale of potential growth if tokenization fulfills its promise and XRP secures a central role.

51261356,575236,1757116849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51261356.jpeg,Russia Looks To Open Crypto Market Wider For Citizens – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/russia-looks-to-open-crypto-market-wider-for-citizens-details/,"Russia’s Ministry of Finance wants to open the door wider for citizens to take part in crypto trading, calling for lower entry requirements that currently limit participation to the country’s wealthiest individuals. Russia Wants Broader Crypto Participation Finance Ministry official Alexey Yakovlev said the government must reduce income and asset thresholds for those who want to join the Central Bank’s experimental crypto trading program, RBC and Interfax have reported. At present, only investors with deposits and securities worth over 100 million rubles ($1.22 million) or an annual income exceeding 50 million rubles ($615,755) can take part. Those numbers place crypto access far beyond the reach of ordinary Russians, whose average monthly salary falls between $700 and $1,200. Yakovlev argued that keeping eligibility this high makes little sense if the country wants its supervised crypto pilot to succeed. A History Of Disagreement The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have been at odds for years on how Russia should handle crypto. While the ministry has pushed for regulation and taxation, the Central Bank has preferred strict controls, including calls to ban trading altogether. That divide narrowed last year when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered both sides to find common ground. Putin has also urged Russian regions with unused energy reserves to engage in crypto mining, tying the sector’s future to the country’s broader economic strategy. Testing Ground Before Permanent Rules The Central Bank introduced what it calls an experimental legal governance, designed as a sandbox for companies to use crypto in cross-border deals. It also provides a controlled space where qualified investors can buy and sell crypto under official oversight. The ministry now wants the ELR to get more people involved before the program ends. Current plans limit the sandbox to three years, after which permanent regulations are expected. Tokenization Plans On The Table The Ministry of Finance also sees the pilot as an opportunity to expand tokenized assets in Russia. Yakovlev mentioned that companies could be allowed to release coins backed by real-world assets, intellectual property, and corporate rights in limited liability firms. He added that smart contract technology could give investors more tools and flexibility. While the Central Bank continues to argue that average citizens must be protected from the risks of crypto trading, its stance is losing ground. The Moscow Exchange now offers investors access to securities tied to overseas crypto ETFs, and some commercial banks have started looking at derivatives and other crypto-related products.

Fundamentals supported by Aptos deployment, Horizon initiative, and V4 roadmap. By Jainam Mehta Aave ( AAVE-USD ) is currently trading at $310.25, recovering modestly after yesterday’s sell-off but still hovering below the $314–$318 resistance cluster. The token is consolidating just above the $309.5 20-day EMA and testing the 50-day EMA at $312.7, while the 200-day EMA at $315.7 forms the upper boundary of near-term resistance. If AAVE manages a decisive close above $318, it could retest the $325–$330 zone, while failure to hold the $309–$310 base risks another slide toward the $300 psychological support. The RSI at 48.4 signals neutral momentum, with MACD still in negative territory, suggesting fading buyer conviction. Technical and on-chain picture On-chain flows highlight cautious behavior. CoinGlass data shows $2.28M in exchange inflows on September 5, signaling short-term distribution and profit-taking pressure. This contrasts with earlier outflow-led accumulation, suggesting whales remain divided - some reducing exposure while others continue rotating into cold storage. Market cap has stabilized around $4.5B, reflecting resilience compared to smaller DeFi peers despite recent volatility. Aave price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technically, price action is in a make-or-break setup. A sustained close above the $318–$322 zone would signal the beginning of a fresh upward leg, targeting the $330–$332 supply band. Failure here would lock AAVE inside a $300–$318 consolidation range, where downside breaks risk retesting $290 support. RSI remains neutral, but MACD’s negative slope shows buying conviction is weak, leaving AAVE vulnerable to another correction if buyers cannot reclaim control quickly. Fundamental positioning and outlook From a fundamentals standpoint, AAVE continues to reinforce its blue-chip DeFi status. The Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) beta trade rotation has helped altcoin inflows tied to ETH’s relative strength, while the Aptos deployment of Aave V3 marked its first non-EVM chain expansion, broadening adoption beyond Ethereum-native ecosystems. The Horizon initiative is also noteworthy, designed to onboard tokenized real-world assets and strengthen Aave’s role as a bridge between TradFi and DeFi. Institutional engagement remains supportive, highlighted by integrations such as Kraken’s white-label lending partnership and liquidity engine adoption. However, risks persist in the near term. Phishing-related concerns have created temporary unease within the retail community, while regulatory scrutiny of DeFi governance tokens continues to weigh on sentiment. Together, these headwinds temper Aave’s otherwise positive growth trajectory. Short-term outlook Looking forward, AAVE’s short-term structure will hinge on whether bulls can clear $318 with conviction. A close above that level opens upside targets at $325–$330, and potentially $340, should flows return. Conversely, losing the $309–$310 pivot could extend the correction toward $300, where the psychological support will be tested. Below this, $290 is the next critical level to watch. Traders should also monitor Ethereum closely, as AAVE’s 0.82 correlation with ETH means ETH’s direction will likely dictate AAVE’s momentum in the coming sessions. In earlier analysis, the $318 resistance zone was identified as the level AAVE must break to flip momentum bullish. Current price action continues to respect that resistance, confirming its importance as the defining level for short-term direction.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval, Trump said, “You could say those are the top three,” while making clear he’s not waiting around to change the direction of the central bank. The comment came as the president continues his push to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as chair of the Fed ends in May. This update comes from Reuters, which also noted that Trump, while already leaning toward a specific name, plans to carry out formal interviews. That hasn’t stopped him from signaling who he’s favoring. He’s said multiple times that Powell won’t be renominated, and that decision has now turned into a full search operation. The president blames Powell’s refusal to cut rates for the weak August jobs report and has accused him of slowing the economy. Scott leads search while attacking Fed policies Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was initially thought to be a possible replacement himself, has removed his name from consideration. Speaking Friday, Scott said, “I’m the only person on the planet who does not want the job.” Instead, he’s managing the replacement process. According to Bloomberg, the interviews to find Powell’s replacement began Friday, although there’s no official confirmation yet on who is participating. Scott isn’t just organizing interviews. He’s also taking aim at the Fed’s authority. Writing in the Wall Street Journal , he called for a full nonpartisan review of how the Fed operates. That includes monetary policy, staffing, regulation, and how it communicates with the public. He argued that the Fed should stop overseeing banks and pull back on actions that affect markets, like bond buying in non-emergency situations. In a separate article published in The International Economy , Scott went further, claiming the Fed has been responsible for worsening inflation, helping the wealthy while hurting working-class Americans, and making housing more expensive. He also accused the central bank of misusing taxpayer money, citing expenses like renovations and its internal police. These are all claims the Fed has denied, but Scott insisted that his goal is to restore independence at the institution. This all happens as Powell, originally appointed in 2018, faces pressure from Trump to step aside. Trump has repeatedly said Powell should have slashed rates this year and pushed his allies into key positions inside the Fed to make that happen. The three finalists — Hassett, Waller, and Warsh — are seen as more aligned with Trump’s views on interest rates and economic management. Cook fights removal while Miran pledges unpaid leave Trump’s actions aren’t limited to Powell. He’s also trying to remove Lisa Cook, another Fed governor, after accusing her of mortgage fraud. Lisa denies the charges and is taking legal action to block the move. For now, she remains in her position. The White House has not commented on how that process will move forward, but Trump appears determined to push her out. Meanwhile, Trump’s pick to fill an actual vacant Fed seat, Stephen Miran, testified this week at his nomination hearing. He told the Senate that he would take unpaid leave from his role as economic advisor at the White House if confirmed. That move is meant to avoid conflicts of interest, though Democrats have questioned whether that’s enough. They argue that anyone closely tied to the president may still lack the independence expected of Fed officials.

This information came straight from S&P Global’s index committee, which announced the change in a public statement released after trading hours. Robinhood will replace Caesars Entertainment, while AppLovin is set to take over the slot currently held by MarketAxess Holdings. This reshuffling is part of the index’s regular update cycle. When companies drop out, fund managers tracking the S&P 500 are forced to buy the replacements. That’s why both stocks rallied in after-hours trading. Fund-driven buying happens automatically, no emotions involved. The announcement closed a frustrating chapter for both firms. Robinhood, which was left out of the June quarterly rebalancing, saw its stock slide 2% at the time. AppLovin, meanwhile, had its name dragged through mud by Fuzzy Panda Research, a short seller that asked S&P’s committee in March to block the company from entering the index. When AppLovin was passed over in December in favor of Workday, its shares sank 15%. But both companies hung around long enough to get picked this time. AppLovin replaces MarketAxess while Robinhood takes Caesars’ place Robinhood, the commission-free trading platform, launched on the Nasdaq in 2021. It quickly gained a loyal base of retail traders who pushed meme stocks like AMC Entertainment and GameStop into the headlines. At its annual general meeting in June, a shareholder asked Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s co-founder and CEO, if getting listed on the S&P 500 was part of the plan. “It’s a difficult thing to plan for,” Vlad replied. “I think it’s one of those things that hopefully happens.” He added that he believed the company was eligible. It did happen. And fast. AppLovin, which also went public in 2021, has had a different journey. Its stock has delivered absurd gains: 278% in 2023, followed by a 700% explosion in 2024. As of Friday’s close, shares are up another 51% in 2025, though it’s slowed compared to the last two years. The company sells software that plugs into apps and mobile games to deliver targeted ads. AppLovin didn’t just coast to the top. It made bold moves along the way. Earlier this year, it made an offer to buy the U.S. business of TikTok from ByteDance, the Chinese parent company. The sale is still pending. President Donald Trump has repeatedly extended the sale deadline, with the most recent extension happening in June. Datadog and DoorDash joined earlier while Caesars and MarketAxess exit The S&P 500 already leans heavily toward large tech names. Datadog and DoorDash were both added earlier this year, pushing the index deeper into the software and data services world. The entry of Robinhood and AppLovin just keeps that trend rolling. It’s not random. Companies that are growing fast, pulling in volume, and making noise usually end up on the committee’s radar sooner or later. That’s bad news for MarketAxess and Caesars. The two companies are out, and they’ve been under pressure for months. MarketAxess, which focuses on fixed-income trading, has seen its shares fall 17% year-to-date. Caesars, the casino and resort chain, is down 21% in the same stretch. Neither company has posted the kind of growth or investor interest needed to hold onto a place in the large-cap index. Inclusion in the S&P 500 isn’t just symbolic, as funds that mirror the index must buy the incoming names. That’s why AppLovin and Robinhood rallied within minutes of the news breaking.

They’ve just announced the identification of a staggering 45,000 BTC, valued at approximately $5 billion, that the German government has apparently failed to seize from the defunct illegal movie streaming website, Movie2k. This massive German Bitcoin seizure oversight raises significant questions about asset recovery and enforcement in the digital age. What’s the Latest on the German Bitcoin Seizure? Arkham, a well-known blockchain analytics firm, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their significant findings. Their investigation uncovered a substantial cache of Bitcoin still linked to Movie2k, an illegal streaming platform that ceased operations years ago. This discovery comes after the German government had already seized and subsequently sold a considerable amount of Bitcoin from the same source. In early 2024, German authorities successfully confiscated 50,000 BTC from Movie2k. These funds were then liquidated between June and July of the same year, fetching an average price of $57,900 per Bitcoin. This initial German Bitcoin seizure was widely reported as a major success in combating illicit digital assets. How Did This Massive German Bitcoin Seizure Go Unnoticed? Despite the earlier seizure, Arkham’s meticulous analysis revealed a comparable sum of 45,000 BTC that remains untouched. This amount, worth approximately $5 billion at current market prices, is reportedly distributed across more than 100 different wallets. What makes this situation particularly intriguing is the dormancy of these funds. According to Arkham, these wallets have shown no activity since 2019, suggesting they have been sitting dormant for several years. The firm postulates that since German authorities have not publicly acknowledged these specific assets, they are likely still under the control of the original Movie2k operators. This raises a crucial question about the thoroughness of previous investigations. Key details identified by Arkham: Unseized Amount: 45,000 BTC, valued at roughly $5 billion. Wallet Distribution: Spread across over 100 distinct cryptocurrency wallets. Dormancy Period: Funds have been inactive since 2019. Current Control: Likely still held by Movie2k operators, as no public statements from Germany indicate otherwise. What Are the Implications of This German Bitcoin Seizure Revelation? The revelation of such a large, unseized sum has several potential implications. Firstly, it highlights the persistent challenges law enforcement faces in tracking and confiscating digital assets, even years after an operation has been shut down. Blockchain analytics firms like Arkham play a vital role in bridging these gaps with their specialized tools and expertise. Furthermore, the sheer volume of 45,000 BTC represents a significant potential supply shock to the market if these funds were to be moved or sold. While they have been dormant, any future activity could impact Bitcoin’s price. The possibility of another substantial German Bitcoin seizure also looms, as authorities may now be compelled to investigate Arkham’s claims more thoroughly. This situation also underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring in the crypto space. Even after initial successes, illicit funds can remain hidden, waiting for an opportune moment to be moved. It serves as a stark reminder for both authorities and the wider crypto community about the need for vigilance. Conclusion: The Unfolding Saga of the German Bitcoin Seizure Arkham’s discovery of an additional $5 billion in unseized Bitcoin from Movie2k is a significant development. It challenges the narrative of complete asset recovery and emphasizes the complex, ever-evolving nature of tracking digital wealth. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to mature, the capabilities of blockchain analytics firms become increasingly indispensable for transparency and enforcement. The world watches to see how German authorities will respond to this compelling new information regarding the remaining German Bitcoin seizure assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Movie2k? Movie2k was a popular, albeit illegal, website that offered free streaming of movies and TV shows. It was shut down by authorities years ago. 2. Who is Arkham? Arkham is a blockchain analytics firm specializing in tracing and identifying cryptocurrency transactions and wallet ownership, often assisting in investigations related to illicit funds. 3. How much Bitcoin did Germany previously seize from Movie2k? German authorities seized 50,000 BTC from Movie2k in early 2024, which they later sold for an average of $57,900 per Bitcoin. 4. What is the value of the unseized Bitcoin identified by Arkham? Arkham identified 45,000 BTC, which is valued at approximately $5 billion at current market prices. 5. Why is this unseized Bitcoin significant? It highlights the ongoing challenges in seizing digital assets, could potentially impact the Bitcoin market if moved, and demonstrates the crucial role of blockchain analytics in uncovering hidden funds.

A revised draft of a pivotal US crypto bill , known as the Digital Asset Market Structure Act (CLARITY), has recently emerged from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. This development, highlighted by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, signals a significant step towards clearer regulatory waters for the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry. Many in the crypto community are keenly watching these legislative movements, hoping for a framework that fosters innovation while ensuring consumer protection. What Does This Crucial US Crypto Bill Draft Propose? The latest iteration of the CLARITY bill introduces several groundbreaking provisions that could reshape how digital assets are classified and regulated in the United States. Perhaps the most anticipated aspect is its explicit stance on certain crypto activities. Here are the key takeaways from the new draft: Exclusion of Staking from Securities: Crucially, the draft bill proposes that staking, a popular method for earning rewards by holding cryptocurrencies, would not be categorized as a security. This provides much-needed relief and clarity for participants and developers in proof-of-stake networks. Airdrops Are Not Securities: Similarly, the distribution of free tokens, known as airdrops, would also be exempt from securities definitions. This clarification is vital for many decentralized projects that use airdrops for community building and initial distribution. DePIN Exemptions: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), which leverage blockchain to build and operate real-world infrastructure (like decentralized wireless networks or energy grids), would also be exempt from traditional securities laws. This could unlock immense potential for innovation in these hybrid digital-physical sectors. These exclusions are monumental, offering a pathway for crypto projects to operate with greater certainty, potentially reducing the regulatory burden that has often stifled growth. Why is This US Crypto Bill So Significant for the Industry? The implications of this draft US crypto bill extend far beyond just definitions. For years, the lack of a clear regulatory framework in the U.S. has been a major point of contention. Companies and developers have often operated in a gray area, leading to uncertainty and, at times, enforcement actions from regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This proposed legislation aims to bring much-needed clarity, offering several benefits: Fostering Innovation: By clarifying that certain core activities like staking and airdrops are not securities, the bill encourages further development and participation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader crypto ecosystems. Reducing Regulatory Arbitrage: A clear framework could help prevent companies from seeking friendlier jurisdictions overseas, potentially bringing more innovation and investment back to the U.S. Investor Confidence: While the bill focuses on definitions, a clear regulatory environment can indirectly boost investor confidence by reducing the perceived risks associated with the industry. Moreover, the draft outlines a procedure for the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to form a joint advisory committee. This committee would be tasked with making decisions on crypto-related issues and resolving inter-agency disputes, a crucial step towards cohesive federal oversight. What Protections Does This US Crypto Bill Retain? It’s important to note that this revised draft doesn’t start from scratch. It thoughtfully retains several key provisions from previous versions, ensuring a continuity of protective measures for users and the decentralized nature of crypto. These include: Protections for Self-Custody: The bill continues to safeguard the right of individuals to hold their digital assets directly, outside of third-party custodians. This is a fundamental principle for many in the crypto community, emphasizing individual sovereignty over digital wealth. Exemptions for Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The framework also retains exemptions for certain decentralized finance protocols, recognizing their unique structure and operational model. This is critical for the continued growth and innovation within the DeFi space, which relies on automated, permissionless systems. This balanced approach suggests a thoughtful consideration of the industry’s nuances, aiming to regulate without stifling its core principles. However, it is crucial to remember that this is still a draft, and the legislative journey is often complex and lengthy. Staying informed about the ongoing discussions and potential amendments will be key for anyone involved in the digital asset space. A Promising Step for Digital Assets The emergence of this revised US crypto bill draft marks a potentially transformative moment for the digital asset landscape in the United States. By proposing clear definitions for staking, airdrops, and DePIN, and by fostering inter-agency cooperation, the bill aims to usher in an era of greater regulatory certainty. While the path to becoming law is still ahead, this draft offers a compelling vision for how the U.S. could embrace and regulate cryptocurrencies, paving the way for sustained innovation and growth within the industry. It’s a development that every crypto enthusiast and industry professional should watch closely. Frequently Asked Questions About the US Crypto Bill Q1: What is the Digital Asset Market Structure Act (CLARITY)? A1: The CLARITY Act is a proposed US crypto bill by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee designed to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, defining how they should be classified and overseen. Q2: Why is the exclusion of staking and airdrops from securities definitions important? A2: This exclusion provides much-needed legal clarity for two common crypto activities. It reduces regulatory uncertainty for developers and users, potentially encouraging innovation and participation in decentralized networks without fear of being classified as unregistered securities offerings. Q3: What are Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)? A3: DePINs are projects that use blockchain technology to incentivize the building and operation of real-world physical infrastructure, such as wireless networks, energy grids, or data storage, often through token rewards.

If so, you’re likely aware that news from major exchanges can significantly impact the market. Recently, Coinbase made an announcement that has certainly caught the attention of many, adding KTA and NOICE to its official Coinbase listing roadmap . This development is more than just a simple update; it provides a crucial glimpse into the future direction of one of the largest cryptocurrency platforms. For both seasoned investors and newcomers, understanding the implications of such an announcement is key to navigating the fast-paced digital asset landscape. What Does the Coinbase Listing Roadmap Mean for Investors? When an exchange like Coinbase reveals its Coinbase listing roadmap , it offers crucial insight into potential future offerings. This transparency is a big deal for investors and traders alike, providing a heads-up on which assets are currently under consideration for a full listing. It allows the community to research upcoming assets, understand their underlying technology, and assess their potential market impact well before they are available for trading. For KTA and NOICE, this inclusion means they are now on Coinbase’s radar, undergoing necessary reviews and due diligence for a possible future listing. This early signal can influence market sentiment and investment strategies, as potential liquidity and exposure on a major exchange are highly sought after by projects and investors. Meet KTA and NOICE: What We Know So Far While specific, in-depth details about KTA and NOICE are still emerging, their presence on the Coinbase listing roadmap suggests they have met initial criteria for consideration. Typically, assets added to the roadmap are projects with growing communities, innovative use cases, or strong technological foundations. Investors often look for these early signals to understand which projects might gain wider adoption and liquidity in the future. It is an exciting time for the teams behind KTA and NOICE, as this announcement provides significant validation and exposure to a global audience. These projects could represent various sectors within the crypto ecosystem, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming or even new forms of digital identity. The diverse nature of assets on the roadmap reflects the ongoing innovation in the blockchain space. The Rigorous Journey to a Coinbase Listing Being added to the Coinbase listing roadmap is just the first step in a rigorous process. Coinbase is known for its stringent evaluation criteria, ensuring that any asset listed on its platform adheres to high standards of security, compliance, and technological integrity. This process includes thorough technical reviews, legal and compliance checks, and market analysis to ensure the asset meets all regulatory standards and provides value to its users. Only a fraction of the projects considered ultimately make it through this comprehensive vetting. A successful listing on Coinbase can dramatically increase an asset’s liquidity, visibility, and credibility within the broader crypto ecosystem. This exposure often leads to increased trading volume and greater institutional interest, which are vital for a project’s long-term success and adoption. Navigating New Listings: Tips for Crypto Enthusiasts For those interested in KTA, NOICE, or any other assets that appear on the Coinbase listing roadmap , here are some actionable tips to consider before making any investment decisions: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Understand its value proposition and potential risks. Understand the Risks: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile and speculative. Never invest more capital than you can comfortably afford to lose. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Coinbase and the projects themselves for the latest updates regarding listing timelines and developments. Consider Diversification: Avoid putting all your investment capital into a single asset. Spreading investments across different assets can help mitigate risk. These strategies empower you to make informed decisions and participate responsibly in the dynamic world of digital assets. The addition of KTA and NOICE to the Coinbase listing roadmap marks an exciting development in the digital asset space. It underscores Coinbase’s commitment to expanding its offerings and providing users with access to a diverse range of cryptocurrencies. As these projects move closer to potential listings, the crypto community will be watching closely to see their impact on the market and their contributions to the evolving blockchain landscape. This roadmap serves as a beacon, guiding enthusiasts towards the next wave of innovation in the crypto world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Coinbase listing roadmap?

After the success of Bitcoin ETFs and the growing momentum for Ethereum-based products, many believe Solana is a natural candidate for institutional exposure. The prospect has fueled a fresh wave of optimism, sparking discussions about whether this could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin boom. ETFs have already proven transformative for Bitcoin, driving billions of dollars in inflows. Should Solana follow suit, analysts argue it would create a domino effect for other altcoins, signaling that the market is entering a new era of mainstream recognition. Investors, however, are also scanning the horizon for opportunities outside the top tier — and that’s where emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining attention. Solana’s Case for an ETF Solana has established itself as one of the most scalable blockchains in the industry, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second with low fees. Its ecosystem has expanded rapidly, covering decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and gaming applications. The network’s strong fundamentals and institutional partnerships have made it an attractive candidate for an ETF product. If approved, Solana could quickly become a top choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to altcoins. The Rising Start in the Crypto Market While Solana ETF rumors dominate headlines, early investors are not overlooking smaller opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the most promising presales of 2025. Future listings on top-tier exchanges are expected to unlock mass adoption , and forecasts point to a 45x ROI before the next macro bull rally. The project’s transparent roadmap and audited tokenomics have already attracted thousands of investors, many securing bonus allocations in the earliest rounds. What an ETF Could Mean for SOL Price Market forecasts suggest that a Solana ETF could drive the token price into the $400–$600 range during the current growth cycle. Analysts base this projection on the magnitude of inflows observed with Bitcoin ETFs and the potential for similar enthusiasm around Solana’s unique positioning in the blockchain ecosystem. Could a Solana ETF Trigger an Altcoin Boom? If Solana successfully secures ETF approval, the impact would likely extend beyond SOL itself. Other high-cap projects such as Cardano, Avalanche, and even meme coins could benefit from the increased legitimacy. This “halo effect” could trigger an altcoin season marked by aggressive price surges across the board. Conclusion Speculation about a Solana ETF underscores just how far crypto has come in attracting institutional recognition. While SOL could see significant upside, the ripple effects may spark a broader altcoin boom. For investors seeking diversification, Solana offers scale, while presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide speculative upside unmatched by established assets. The next phase of the bull cycle could be defined by this dynamic pairing of institutional and early-stage growth opportunities.

Related Reading: American Bitcoin, Backed By Trump, Ends Nasdaq Debut Up 17% Data from CoinShares shows that inflows in Q3 2025 reached $177 million, pushing year-to-date totals above $1.2 billion. This sharp rise has positioned Solana as one of the most liquid ecosystems for staking, lending, and DEX activity. One notable whale moved 20,000 SOL from Kraken into Kamino Finance, later borrowing $3 million in USDC for leveraged positions on OKX. This reflects how institutional-scale players are increasingly using Solana’s DeFi ecosystem without selling off their core holdings, adding both liquidity and credibility to the market. SOL's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Why Transactions Are Surging Analysts point to multiple factors behind Solana’s record-breaking DeFi inflows and transaction growth. A key driver is the Alpenglow consensus protocol upgrade, which gained 99% validator approval. The upgrade slashes transaction finality to just 150 milliseconds, making Solana one of the fastest public blockchains. This speed advantage has already lured investors away from Ethereum, where congestion remains a problem. One whale address, previously known for high-value Hyperliquid trades, shifted $7.6 million from ETH into SOL, citing throughput efficiency as the decisive factor. Beyond technical upgrades, Solana has also attracted institutional interest through ETFs and tokenization initiatives, further strengthening its role as a preferred option for DeFi growth in 2025. What This Means for Solana’s Future With whales fueling inflows and Solana’s ecosystem achieving record adoption, market confidence in SOL’s long-term trajectory is strengthening. Transaction surges of this scale often precede deeper liquidity growth and sustained developer activity, two pillars of a healthy DeFi network. However, analysts caution that network activity needs to translate into consistent user adoption to maintain momentum. While speculative capital is accelerating short-term gains, the broader test for Solana will be sustaining real-world use cases beyond whale-led inflows.

51263562,575052,1757120453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51263562.jpeg,Trump Jr.-Linked Firm Targets Dogecoin Mining Crown With $50M War Chest,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-jr-firm-dogecoin-mining-50m-war-chest/,"Nasdaq-listed Thumzup Media Corporation (TZUP) has staked out an aggressive pivot from adtech into crypto infrastructure, unveiling a shareholder letter that details a $50 million all-common stock raise at $10 per share, a pending acquisition of DogeHash Technologies, and an explicit bid to become North America’s leading Dogecoin miner. In the letter , the company says the deal would add 2,500 active Scrypt miners with 1,000 additional rigs on order, framing the move as a step-change in scale for a newly crypto-focused balance sheet. “Ambitious vision to dominate as North America’s leading Dogecoin miner,” the letter states, summarizing the goal line for its capital and M&A strategy. Thumzup’s $50 Million Dogecoin Mining Push The Trump family connection is not incidental to the capital stack behind this pivot. In July, a Thumzup shelf registration identified Donald J. Trump Jr. as a selling stockholder for 350,000 shares—disclosure that formalized his equity link to the company. The fundraising that now underwrites Thumzup’s crypto expansion was handled by Dominari Securities; notably, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump joined the advisory board of Dominari Holdings, Dominari Securities’ parent, earlier this year, according to filings and contemporaneous reporting. Regulatory filings show the DogeHash deal is structured as a change-of-control transaction. Under an August 19 Agreement and Plan of Merger, Thumzup will be renamed Dogehash Technologies Holdings, Inc.; at closing, it will issue 30.7 million restricted common shares to DogeHash shareholders, subject to shareholder approval under Nasdaq rules (including the 19.99% issuance threshold), Nasdaq’s own approval, a fairness opinion, and standard closing conditions. “The combined company aims to become the world’s leading Dogecoin mining platform,” the 8-K states. Media coverage has suggested the post-merger ticker could be “XDOG,” though that symbol has not been codified in the SEC filing. While Thumzup’s letter reads unabashedly bullish on scrypt economics, the revenue math it presents is explicitly illustrative. Citing Bitmain ’s specifications for L9-class miners (16 GH/s, ~3,360W), the company models that 3,500 units could produce annual revenue of about $22.7 million at $0.22 per DOGE, scaling to ~$103.2 million if DOGE were to trade at $1. “Actual results may vary,” the letter cautions. It also emphasizes the plan to expand the fleet with proceeds from the $50 million offering, which it says left the firm with “more than $50 million in cash and [a] relatively small burn rate.” The shareholder letter also situates Thumzup’s pivot in a broader policy moment, crediting a more crypto-forward US stance and laying out a treasury strategy that began with $1 million in Bitcoin purchases in January and a second $1 million allocation later that month. However, those themes are presented as the company’s own framing of tailwinds; the binding facts for investors remain the capital raise, the structure and conditions of the DogeHash merger, and the operational footprint Thumzup intends to assemble around Dogecoin and Litecoin mining . On Thursday in Europe, Dogecoin was changing hands near $0.2198, a level that—if sustained—would anchor Thumzup’s own “current-price” scenario toward the lower end of its revenue illustration. “With the capital we already have, we believe we will be able to grow that business and drive significant value for our shareholders,” CEO Robert Steele writes, closing a letter that—if investors approve the share issuance and Nasdaq clears the control changes—would recast Thumzup as a public-market vehicle for Dogecoin-first industrial mining.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin Mining|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MINING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 01:00:53

Despite this, its price remains under pressure, struggling to stay above the $0.35 level. Investors are split between excitement over broader accessibility and frustration with the lack of immediate upside. Interestingly, as Pi continues its careful rollout, newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining major attention from early investors due to their rapid community growth and aggressive ROI projections, creating a sense of FOMO in the market. Adoption First, Price Later Pi Network’s latest integration comes through Onramp Money, allowing direct purchases in more than 60 countries. Users can now buy Pi using popular services such as Alipay, Maya, and GCash, giving its community easier access than ever before. While this is a milestone for accessibility, the token’s price tells a different story. Sellers remain in control, with Pi losing over 80% of its value in the past six months. A Controlled Rollout Strategy Unlike projects that rush onto exchanges, Pi has chosen a slower, compliance-driven path. Supply is distributed through foundation wallets to regulated partners like Onramp, Banxa, and TransFi, which collectively support more than 170 payment methods worldwide. This model is designed to steer tokens toward real-world usage in apps, peer-to-peer transactions, and commerce rather than encouraging quick speculative trading. A New Crypto Gem Captures Investor Buzz While Pi focuses on adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is creating waves with its explosive entry into the market. Analysts highlight its exponentially growing community and ambitious growth projections , with early backers already eyeing life-changing returns. The project’s scarcity-driven model has drawn parallels to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, but with a stronger focus on real-world use cases. For some investors, the fear of missing out on what could become a breakout story is already setting in. Institutional Interest in Pi Pi’s careful approach has begun to attract attention from institutions. In Europe, a Pi-based exchange-traded product (ETP) recently launched, signaling traditional finance may be warming up to its compliance-first strategy. Supporters argue that this puts Pi in a unique position, with the infrastructure being built before speculation takes over. The Market Reality Despite these moves, Pi remains stuck below $0.35. Attempts to rally have been short-lived as steady selling pressure outweighs weak buying interest. The Pi Core Team maintains that long-term fundamentals will eventually support price growth, but for now, patience is required. Conclusion The Pi Network’s latest listing underscores its steady expansion, even if prices remain flat for now. For investors, this highlights the divide between projects focused on adoption and those driving hype cycles. With MAGACOIN FINANCE drawing strong attention for its explosive growth potential , the question becomes which path will deliver bigger rewards in the coming months.

The update came Friday, with a new provision inside the draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025. The goal? Draw a hard line. Stocks that get tokenized onto a blockchain won’t sneak through commodity loopholes anymore. The update isn’t coming out of nowhere. Cynthia Lummis, the Republican senator from Wyoming, told CNBC a day earlier that the Senate wants the bill finalized fast. “We want this on the president’s desk before the end of the year,” she said. That means President Donald Trump, who’s back in the White House and already signed the stablecoin bill into law in July. The House and Senate both cleared that bill over the summer. But for crypto firms like Coinbase and Ripple, this new one is the heavyweight fight, the one that defines what’s a security and what’s not. The House already passed its version of the market structure bill in July. The Senate is still working on theirs. Once both versions are done, they’ll need to get merged before the final copy hits Trump’s desk. That’s where the friction starts. Senate plans committee votes and full vote by November Right now, Cynthia says the Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote later this month on the part of the bill that deals with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is planning to vote in October. A full floor vote could happen as early as November, Cynthia confirmed . The Democrats in the Senate haven’t signed on yet. But Cynthia claims conversations are happening. “There have been efforts to pair Democrats and Republicans on certain sub-issues within the bill to make sure that there’s, to the greatest extent possible, substantial bipartisan agreement on key issues,” she said. Even if every Republican backs the bill, at least seven Democrats need to join to get it across the line. A spokesperson from the Senate Banking Committee reportedly told CNBC that the current version of the bill “reflects feedback from hundreds of stakeholders on a wide range of questions.” This feedback helped shape the line-by-line regulatory split between securities and commodities, especially for assets moving onchain. While the Senate is trying to define boundaries, Galaxy Digital, a Nasdaq-listed crypto company, is already out here testing them. On Wednesday, Galaxy announced that its SEC-registered GLXY shares can now be tokenized directly on a public blockchain using the Opening Bell platform, built by crypto startup Superstate. Galaxy said that shareholders can now tokenize their equity and transfer it to approved wallets, as long as they pass KYC. These tokenized shares could also be traded on DeFi platforms using Automated Market Makers, giving them more liquidity and flexibility. Superstate claims that this isn’t a synthetic or wrapped token, these are direct equity issuances onchain. Galaxy tokenizes SEC-registered shares through Superstate platform The Opening Bell platform launched back in May and started with support for Solana. It claims to be the first platform offering SEC-registered public shares directly on blockchain infrastructure, without the need for intermediaries or token wrappers. Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy, said the goal is to bring what works in crypto into the traditional markets. In his words: “We’re proud to be working with Superstate to help lay the groundwork for an onchain capital market that bridges traditional equities with next-generation infrastructure. Our goal is a tokenized equity that brings the best of crypto — transparency, programmability, and composability — into the traditional world. And we’re taking part in building a model that can scale, not just for Galaxy, but for the market more broadly.” Last month, Galaxy said it had started working with Superstate to explore tokenization of its GLXY shares.

Statistics Canada reported Friday that the economy shed 66,000 jobs in August, largely in part-time positions. Professional and technical services led the declines, while trade-sensitive sectors such as transportation, warehousing, and manufacturing also posted steep job losses. Economists raise odds of rate cut CIBC senior economist Andrew Grantham said the latest data shows the weakness is no longer confined to sectors hit by U.S. tariffs. “The weaker than expected employment report saw financial markets pricing in a greater probability of a September interest rate cut, resulting in a decline in bond yields,” he told clients. The Bank of Canada’s next policy decision is set for Sept. 17. The central bank has kept its key rate at 2.75% over the past three meetings, citing trade uncertainty and sticky inflation. However, the jobs report adds to last week’s data showing GDP contracted by 1.6% annually in the second quarter, with only a slight 0.1% rebound estimated for July. August marked a second straight month of job losses, following a decline of 41,000 in July. The number of unemployed rose by 34,000, pushing the layoff rate to 1%, up from 0.9% a year earlier. BMO chief economist Douglas Porter noted the economy has lost 38,500 jobs since the trade war began in January, including 58,100 manufacturing roles. Inflation pressures shape policy outlook Inflation could be the deciding factor. The consumer price index rose 1.7% in July, though core measures remained elevated, with a three-month average of CPI-trim and CPI-median at 2.4%. RBC economist Claire Fan said the August inflation report, due a day before the rate decision, will “bear an unusual amount of weight” in shaping policy. Meanwhile, Canada’s employment rate fell 0.2 points to 60.5%in August, while annual wage growth eased to 3.2%. Youth unemployment stood at 14.5%, with summer student joblessness at 17.9%—the highest since 2009. Regionally, Alberta’s unemployment rate rose to 8.4%, while B.C.’s climbed to 6.2%. Windsor (11.1%), Oshawa (9%), and Toronto (8.9%) remained the hardest-hit cities. U.S. moves to reopen USMCA talks amid tariff tensions On related developments, the U.S. is preparing to launch talks on renegotiating its largest free trade pact , the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is set to launch public consultations on revising the deal within the next month, a step required by Oct. 4 under the 2020 implementation law. According to people familiar with the matter, a request for input from companies and unions could come as early as this week. However, Trump’s team has previously signaled an imminent release before delaying it. The beginning of consultations will be the first official act in what is likely to be a month-long process to renegotiate a deal that Trump signed in 2020, which contains a mandatory six-year review. Following a petition for comments, the administration must hold at least one public hearing and brief Congress on the deal in January 2026, before holding the first official trilateral USMCA review meeting by July 1, 2026. The USMCA was promoted as a signature trade achievement of Trump’s first term, replacing the 1992 North American Free Trade Agreement, which he had criticized on the campaign trail for shifting U.S. factories and jobs to other countries, especially Mexico. Still, in his second term, Trump has undercut the USMCA by imposing — and later scaling back — steep tariffs on Canada and Mexico, claiming they were warranted due to drug trafficking through both countries. He initially levied a 25% tariff shortly after taking office, before exempting goods that met the pact’s rules. According to a January report, the tariffs were also intended to boost U.S. leverage in renegotiation and push talks forward more quickly. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

One of the most successful projects is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a decentralized lending protocol that is quickly gaining increased popularity because of its innovative approach to DeFi sustainability and optimizing yields. MUTM is at its sixth presale stage and will increase by 14.29 percent to $0.04 in the seventh stage. The project has raised more than $15.4 million and already registered more than 16,040 investors. As the ADA price movement generates discussions on where it will be in the market, Mutuum Finance has an opportunity to take over a portion of the attention as the traditional player wobbles. Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast as Bulls Look for Momentum Currently, ADA is trading at around $0.83 with solid ground above the support range of $0.80, which countless times has served as a key level to subsequent pullbacks. According to analysts, assuming that ADA can break out of the $0.95-$1.00 range, and gain above, it may in the next few weeks roll out a short-term surge towards $1.05, which would correspond to a potential 20-25% gain. When looking further forward, into late 2025, estimates are more optimistic: certain models may see average prices of $0.75-$1.07 in the month, whilst others may see a breakout to $1.30-$1.50 should institutional interest such as an ETF approval come to fruition. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is still in presale. Stage 6 tokens are sold at a price of $0.035 and the price of Stage 7 will increase by 14.29 percent and will reach $0.04. Interest in investment is also high and the sum of funds raised has exceeded above 15.4 million and the number of individuals with tokens has exceeded above 16,040. This turns MUTM into one of the most competent in the DeFi market. Community Giveaway and Leaderboard Rewards Mutuum finance continues to entice more investors with its mega $100,000 giveaway . Participation is open with a $10k reward to ten individuals. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance is also currently operating a bug bounty program of $50,000 USDT in collaboration with CertiK. To ensure that the platforms are safe and reliable, the participants may be incentivized to discover the weak areas, which can be classified into four categories: critical, major, minor, and low. Oracle Infrastructure and Price Discovery The project uses Chainlink to get accurate market prices and connects them with the value of USD and tokens like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Additional tools like fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and in-chain metrics help provide reliable and timely prices for managing collateral and handling liquidations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining ground fast as an emerging DeFi competitor, although Cardano (ADA) is looking at a tentative recovery. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, and Stage 7 will increase 14.29% to $0.04, providing early buyers with a high upside potential. With a growing confidence in the market, the project has increased funds raised and attracted over 16,040 investors in excess of 15.4M. MUTM offers the security, scalability and long-term growth positioning with a $100K community giveaway, $50K CertiK bug bounty, and solid oracle-based price infrastructure. Stage 6 is currently open to ensure that you are allocated before the next price surge.

The total value of these trillion-dollar companies now stands at $21 trillion, with Google at the center of the momentum. The biggest surge came after US District Judge Amit Mehta handed down a ruling in Google’s antitrust case. Instead of breaking up the company or forcing it to offload its Chrome browser, Mehta ordered a narrower remedy; Google has to share its search data with rivals. That news sent Alphabet shares up 9% on Wednesday alone. Apple surged too, because the ruling lets them keep their deal with Google, where Alphabet pays billions to remain the default search engine on iPhones. Broadcom lands OpenAI deal while Alphabet shrugs off EU fine Alphabet ended the week up more than 10%. Apple added 3.2%. Nasdaq climbed 1.1%. Analysts from Wedbush Securities said the ruling “removed a huge overhang” from Google’s stock and cleared a “black cloud worry” over Apple. They said it also opens the door for a larger AI deal between Apple and Google, involving the Gemini model. The Department of Justice had been going after Big Tech since 2020. Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta all faced lawsuits over market power. A year ago, Google lost the DOJ trial, a case many saw as the biggest since Microsoft’s in the 1990s. But Mehta’s ruling this week wasn’t as severe as expected. He said the rise of generative AI had reshaped the market, with new players like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity competing with Google in ways traditional search didn’t allow. Mehta said these AI technologies “may yet prove to be game changers.” On Friday, Alphabet faced another legal hit, this time from Europe. The company was fined €2.95 billion ($3.45 billion) by the European Union for anti-competitive behavior in the ad tech market. But investors didn’t care. Shares held up. While OpenAI influenced Google and Apple indirectly, it drove a direct move in Broadcom’s stock. After the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings on Thursday, CEO Hock Tan told analysts that Broadcom had signed a $10 billion deal with a new customer. Several analysts identified the customer as OpenAI, as Cryptopolitan reported . The Financial Times also reported a deal between the two. Broadcom, which already supplies custom AI chips to Google, Meta, and ByteDance (TikTok’s parent), gained 13% this week. Its stock is now up 120% over the last year, bringing the company’s market value to about $1.6 trillion. Barclays analysts wrote that the company “is firing on all cylinders” and kept their buy rating while raising their price target. Nvidia and Microsoft slide, Tesla gains after Musk bonus proposal While others gained, Nvidia fell 4%, its fourth straight weekly drop. There was no clear reason behind the decline, but that didn’t stop the slip. Still, Nvidia remains the world’s most valuable company at over $4 trillion. The stock is up 56% in the past year. Microsoft also dipped this week, continuing a five-week losing streak. The company’s shares are still up 21% over the last 12 months, but the recent stretch has been red. Tesla has had a rough year, with shares down 13% in 2025. Sales have slipped for multiple quarters, and cheaper electric cars from China have added more pressure. The company’s aging EV lineup hasn’t helped either. But this week, Tesla reversed the trend. Shares rose 5%, mostly due to Friday’s news that the company wants to bring back a massive pay plan for CEO Elon Musk. The plan, potentially worth up to $1 trillion, includes 12 payout stages. The first one doesn’t activate unless Tesla nearly doubles in value to hit a $2 trillion market cap. Chairwoman Robyn Denholm spoke with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and said the plan is meant to keep Musk, who is still the world’s richest person, “motivated and focused on delivering for the company.” As all this unfolded, the eight trillion-dollar tech companies swelled to make up 36% of the S&P 500.

51263564,575385,1757124007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51263564.jpeg,Tether Eyes Gold Mining As New Frontier For Crypto Profit Deployment,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-eyes-gold-mining-as-new-frontier-for-profit/,"Tether, the issuer of the market’s largest stablecoin by trading volume, USDT, is reportedly in discussions to invest in gold mining. The company aims to channel its substantial cryptocurrency profits into the metals market. According to a recent Financial Times report , Tether is exploring opportunities across the entire gold supply chain, including mining, refining, trading, and royalty companies. Gold As Foundational Asset Paolo Ardoino , Tether’s CEO, has expressed a strong affinity for gold, referring to it as “natural Bitcoin.” In a speech earlier this year, he articulated a perspective that contrasts with the common view of Bitcoin as “digital gold,” instead emphasizing that gold represents “a foundational asset.” Per the report, Tether’s interest in gold has surprised many within the traditional mining sector, raising questions about the company’s strategy and its potential for success. One mining executive remarked on Tether’s unconventional approach, suggesting that while the company appreciates gold, it lacks a clear strategy for navigating this established industry. As one of the most profitable entities in the cryptocurrency space, Tether boasts a market capitalization of $168 billion. The company generated $5.7 billion in profits in the first half of this year and is also known as one of the largest holders of US Treasuries, earning interest from these investments to support its stablecoin. Tether has already made significant strides in the gold market, holding $8.7 billion worth of gold bars in a Zurich vault, which serves as collateral for its stablecoin issuance. Blue Gold Joins Tether In Bridging Crypto And Gold Markets Recently, Tether Investments, the arm responsible for managing the company’s profits, acquired a minority stake in the gold royalty company Elemental Altus for $105 million. This investment was complemented by an additional $100 million infusion into Elemental following its merger with rival EMX. Juan Sartori, who leads business initiatives at Tether, told the Financial Times that these investments are part of a broader strategy to enhance the company’s exposure to gold. In addition to its investments in gold royalties, the crypto company has also engaged in discussions with Terranova Resources, a gold mining investment vehicle based in the British Virgin Islands, although no deal has materialized. The stablecoin issuer’s foray into gold also includes the XAUt token , a cryptocurrency backed by physical gold, though its market presence is relatively modest compared to USDT. The report highlights that other firms, such as Blue Gold, are also exploring the intersection of cryptocurrency and gold. The gold mining company plans to introduce digital tokens linked to its future gold output, reflecting a belief that gold-backed tokens could gain global traction.

With solid foundations and increasing traction, ADA, XRP, and ETH continue to be three of the most talked-about assets. For traders who are looking ahead, the real question is which undiscovered treasures might overtake them as market leaders in the upcoming cycle. Portfolios that combine well-known brands with early-stage projects have a history of outperforming. Analysts are increasingly pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a culturally driven presale that is emerging as one of the most intriguing newcomers, in addition to the industry mainstays. ADA: governance-driven resilience Cardano’s long development arc is finally converging on one of its boldest goals: full community governance. The Voltaire upgrade will introduce treasury management and on-chain voting, creating a framework where ADA holders directly shape the network’s future. While Cardano has faced criticism for its deliberate pace, this governance model could cement it as the most decentralized Layer 1 in operation. Analysts believe this long-term approach gives ADA resilience against speculative hype cycles, making it a reliable hold beyond 2025. XRP: bridging global finance Ripple’s XRP continues to secure its place in global financial infrastructure. With regulatory clarity in the U.S. finally improving, partnerships with payment providers and banks are scaling. XRP’s role as a bridge asset for cross-border payments remains its defining feature, allowing instant settlement across currencies without the need for pre-funded accounts. Recent whale accumulation and renewed institutional demand highlight the growing belief that XRP could reclaim its past highs. For investors seeking exposure to utility-driven adoption, XRP remains a staple. ETH: the backbone of Web3 Ethereum is the undisputed leader in smart contracts, NFTs, and decentralized finance. The approval of spot ETH ETFs in 2025 brought a flood of institutional money, reinforcing its credibility. At the same time, Layer 2 ecosystems like Arbitrum and Optimism are expanding Ethereum’s reach, ensuring scalability for mainstream adoption. With billions in total value locked and thousands of developers building applications, ETH is more than just an altcoin — it is infrastructure for the digital economy. Analysts argue that Ethereum’s dual role as both an asset and a platform ensures its long-term prominence. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the hidden gem narrative The hidden gem of this cycle, according to many traders, is MAGACOIN FINANCE . While ADA, XRP, and ETH anchor portfolios with proven utility, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings something different: cultural momentum paired with unusual legitimacy. Passed audits from CertiK and HashEx have given it a level of trust absent in most meme-inspired tokens. Investors are particularly drawn to the PATRIOT50X bonus code , which allows early buyers to boost allocations by 50%, fueling rapid presale sellouts. Analysts say forecasts point to 35x potential upside , with some comparisons to SHIB’s early mania phase. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is that it isn’t just hype – its structural credibility suggests staying power. For investors searching for the next breakout name beyond ADA, XRP, and ETH, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the hidden gem everyone is talking about. Diversification strategy for 2025 Balancing established players with high-upside newcomers is the essence of crypto investing. ADA offers governance depth, XRP provides enterprise utility, ETH anchors the ecosystem, and MAGACOIN FINANCE brings asymmetric potential. Together, this mix allows investors to weather volatility while still capturing explosive growth if the hidden gem narrative materializes. Analysts suggest that portfolios built on this balance are better positioned to outperform as markets enter the next phase of adoption. Conclusion The altcoins to watch in 2025 extend beyond the majors. ADA, XRP, and ETH remain foundational assets , each with its own strengths, but the addition of MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights the power of uncovering hidden gems before they go mainstream. For investors willing to diversify, the combination of established credibility and emerging cultural momentum could define the winners of the next cycle.

Related Reading: American Bitcoin, Backed By Trump, Ends Nasdaq Debut Up 17% The token, which debuted in late 2024, now has a market capitalization of close to $710 million. That figure matters because it signals real capital backing the push, even if the coin still sits well below the largest stablecoins. Fintech Partners Open Doors Ripple’s rollout leans on three major fintech partners: Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card. These platforms already serve millions of users across the continent. According to company statements, the partnerships give RLUSD instant rails into retail and business flows without Ripple having to build consumer trust from scratch. Ham Serunjogi, CEO of Chipper Cash, said RLUSD is “uniquely positioned to accelerate institutional blockchain adoption across Africa and beyond.” That line frames the push as aimed more at banks and big payments firms than at casual traders. 1/ The next chapter for $RLUSD starts in Africa. → https://t.co/6gRqrdNwSW We’re proud to bring our trusted, USD-backed stablecoin to the continent with new partners @chippercashapp, @VALRdotcom, and @YellowCard_App. 🌍 Together, we’ll unlock new potential for cross-border… — Ripple (@Ripple) September 4, 2025 Humanitarian Pilots Take Center Stage Based on reports, Ripple is also linking RLUSD to humanitarian work in Kenya. Mercy Corps Ventures is running pilot programs that use the stablecoin to power blockchain-based insurance products for drought and rainfall risks. These pilots are small. But they are meant to show how stablecoins can back practical financial services where climate shocks hit farming communities. For many African users, access to reliable, low-cost payment rails matters more than the token’s total market value. Listings And Institutional Aims RLUSD has been listed on a growing set of exchanges, including Gemini, Kraken, Bitso, Bitstamp, Bullish, LMAX, Uphold, Mercado Bitcoin, Independent Reserve, and CoinMENA. That distribution lets institutions tap RLUSD for payments, settlement, and collateral management. Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple, said demand is growing across payments, tokenization, and collateral markets. The listings show Ripple wants the coin to be usable on familiar trading and custody platforms, which can shorten the path to institutional adoption. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally On-Chain Activity Shows Momentum, But Gaps Remain Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show rising activity. Artemis data points to monthly transaction volumes climbing from almost $120 million in July to $194 million in August. That jump is healthy for a newcomer. Yet it is still small when compared with established stablecoins that process billions each month on Ethereum and Tron. Based on these numbers, RLUSD is gaining traction but has a long way to go if it hopes to match the liquidity and daily flows of market leaders.

While an ADA-based exchange-traded fund could bring new institutional flows into the ecosystem, major investors are not waiting around. Instead, many whales are diversifying into altcoins with far higher upside potential before the next bull market fully ignites. ADA’s Steady Growth, But Slower Returns Cardano remains a cornerstone in the altcoin landscape, with upgrades like Hydra scaling and ongoing network improvements helping to maintain confidence. However, price action has been less exciting compared to other fast-moving tokens. As ETF rumors circulate, traders are questioning whether ADA will outperform or simply lag behind rivals in the coming rally. A New Altcoin Steals the Spotlight Amid this shift, analysts have placed ADA and MAGACOIN FINANCE among the 5 Best Altcoins to Buy before the bull run starts — but MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight. Its presale has already attracted thousands of early investors, making it one of the best crypto opportunities to buy this year. Momentum is building as allocation rounds sell out quickly, and projections suggest returns of up to 22,000% are possible for early movers. Whales Chasing Bigger Multiples The contrast between ADA’s measured growth and the explosive community-driven demand for MAGACOIN FINANCE reflects a broader trend: whales are moving beyond established names to chase tokens with sharper trajectories. This dynamic mirrors past cycles where coins like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN surged from niche plays into mainstream headlines. Key Takeaways for Investors A Cardano ETF could bring institutional inflows, but approval is still uncertain. ADA continues to grow steadily but lacks the explosive returns some traders want. MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is gaining traction, with thousands already invested. Whales are rotating capital into newer altcoins with higher potential multiples. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 22,000% ROI for early backers. Investors are preparing for a bull market where both ADA and emerging tokens play major roles. What’s Next for ADA and Altcoins If a Cardano ETF gets the green light, ADA could see a surge in institutional buying, potentially lifting its market cap significantly. But until then, investors chasing high multiples are likely to keep rotating into presales and newer altcoins with viral growth potential. Conclusion In summary, ADA remains a strong long-term contender with ETF buzz fueling speculation, but the real frenzy is happening in emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. With thousands already securing their positions early, it’s becoming the altcoin everyone is watching as the bull run nears.

Stellar is holding near its $0.39 support level, with the possibility of a rebound if buying pressure builds. Ethena, on the other hand, has reported $500 million in revenue and $11.7 billion in supply, though questions remain about the long-term sustainability of its model. In the middle of these mixed signals, BlockDAG is pushing forward with achievements that are rare ahead of a launch. Its X1 app has already attracted 3 million miners, a milestone that demonstrates wide-scale adoption and growth. The presale has raised over $395 million, and with its upcoming global Deployment Event in Singapore, the project is gaining strong visibility. A new flat-rate presale price of $0.0013 gives BlockDAG (BDAG) a clear edge in attracting attention as the best crypto to buy right now. Stellar Holds at $0.39 With Breakout Potential Stellar (XLM) is sitting at a key support level near $0.39, and traders are debating whether it can maintain its footing. A breakdown could send the price toward $0.36, reflecting added pressure for holders. Current volume and RSI levels point to indecision, with the market waiting for a clear signal. Longer term, technical analysis suggests the possibility of a bull flag breakout with a target near $1.80. That would represent gains of more than 350% if realized. While uncertainty dominates the short-term outlook, the potential upside keeps Stellar firmly on trader watchlists. Ethena Expands Rapidly While Facing Key Risks Ethena Labs has reported another impressive update, revealing more than $500 million in revenue and $11.7 billion in USDe supply. The synthetic stablecoin has quickly become one of the largest in circulation, using a delta-neutral hedging model that earns from staking rewards and futures funding. This design has earned Ethena the label of an “internet bond.” Still, sustainability is being questioned as the model relies heavily on favorable futures markets. To reduce exposure, Ethena has added Bitcoin as a backing asset, broadening liquidity and diversifying collateral. For now, the story is one of fast growth but with elevated structural risks. BlockDAG’s 3 Million Miners Redefine Presale Success BlockDAG has established itself as a standout project by showing real adoption before its official launch. The X1 mining app has surpassed 3 million active users, demonstrating how well its Proof of Engagement model connects with a global audience. Rather than relying on speculation, BlockDAG has created a loyal community that forms a strong base for future growth and credibility. The presale has already raised over $395 million, making it one of the largest and most successful campaigns of 2025. With a new flat-rate price set at $0.0013, BlockDAG has simplified access and removed bonus tiers to ensure fairness and transparency. Early backers who entered at $0.001 are already seeing strong returns, and analysts project long-term gains that could reach $1 or higher if adoption continues to accelerate. BlockDAG is also preparing for a major global Deployment Event in Singapore, designed to showcase its technology, ecosystem, and growing community to the world. This event marks a pivotal step in the project’s roadmap, signaling its readiness to scale and positioning it as one of the top bullish crypto coins to watch in 2025. Alongside these milestones, BlockDAG has completed audits from both CertiK and Halborn and continues to engage its growing community through features like Buyer Battles. These elements highlight a project that blends adoption, visibility, and advanced security. With its presale success and scalable framework, BlockDAG is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy right now. Key Takeaways Stellar and Ethena both highlight the balance of opportunity and uncertainty in today’s market. Stellar depends on holding its $0.39 support level while traders watch for a potential rally toward $1.80. Ethena has shown strong expansion with $500 million in revenue, yet its reliance on futures markets raises questions about how sustainable that growth will be during tougher conditions. BlockDAG presents a clearer picture of progress. With 3 million miners, more than $395 million raised in presale, and tokens now priced at $0.0013, it offers visibility that competitors lack. Its upcoming global Deployment Event in Singapore further strengthens its case, positioning BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy right now.

51264099,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=800755,1757124162,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51264099.jpeg,"Trump removes tariffs on key metals, targets silicone instead",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-gold-graphite-tungsten-uranium-tariffs/,"Trump issued a new executive order Friday, removing import tariffs on gold bullion, graphite, tungsten, uranium, and other critical metals, while slapping silicone products with new levies. The directive takes effect Monday, and it follows recommendations from U.S. officials and is tied to the ongoing “national emergency” Trump declared when he first triggered his broad country-level tariff agenda in April. This change comes after a ruling by U.S. Customs and Border Protection caused a wave of panic among gold traders by indicating bullion would be taxed. That triggered confusion across the commodities markets. Trump’s decision also makes it easier for Washington to carry out new trade frameworks with other countries. These include deals Trump signed with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, which now no longer need individual executive orders to go live. Trump removes tariffs on key metals, targets silicone instead The metals being dropped from tariff lists are all used in tech, energy, and defense supply chains. Tungsten is crucial for industrial tools and military hardware. Graphite is central to electric batteries and aerospace parts. Uranium fuels nuclear reactors. Gold, despite being seen mostly as a reserve asset, plays a role in electronics and is a major safe haven for investors. The White House order says removing these tariffs is necessary to support U.S. manufacturing and protect supply chains. But while Trump is giving relief to those materials, he’s also turning up the heat on other sectors. Silicone products, as well as resin and aluminum hydroxide, are now subject to new reciprocal tariffs. These materials are more widely available and are not seen as vital to national security. By hitting them, Trump aims to increase leverage in trade talks without choking essential supply lines. The new policy also opens the door to exempt other goods the U.S. can’t produce, mine, or grow. That includes specific aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals, specialty spices, coffee, and rare metals. Under the updated procedure, the U.S. Trade Representative and the Commerce Department will now have power to roll out trade agreements without waiting for direct orders from Trump. Some pharmaceuticals are also getting relief. Drugs like pseudoephedrine, antibiotics, and other medicines that were caught in a separate trade investigation by Commerce are now being pulled out of the tariff list. Gold jumps after ruling reversal, market bets on rate cuts Gold prices shot up immediately. Spot gold climbed 1.4% to $3,596.55 per ounce by Friday afternoon, after reaching a record high of $3,599.89 earlier in the day. U.S. gold futures for December closed 1.3% higher at $3,653.30. The metal has already surged 37% this year, building on a 27% gain in 2024. The rally is being driven by a weaker dollar, central bank purchases, lower interest rates, and widespread market uncertainty. “Gold makes new highs; bulls are looking at the clearly weakening trend of employment translating into multiple rate cuts,” said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader. “The outlook is undoubtedly bullish for gold as labour concerns override inflation for the short, probably medium term,” he added, but warned that prices are still “too far away from 4,000 unless there is a massive dislocation.” The U.S. labor market is showing signs of strain. August job growth slowed sharply, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. Markets are now expecting a 90% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut this month and a 10% chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Gold, which doesn’t earn interest, tends to attract more investors when rates are falling and global risks are high. Trump’s ongoing pressure on the Federal Reserve is adding to the volatility. He recently tried to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, which raised alarms about the Fed’s independence. Analysts say this kind of interference could push the central bank further toward easing. Even with all the excitement in the market, China and India, the biggest gold buyers, are pulling back. Demand for physical gold dropped this week because of the sky-high prices. Meanwhile, gold reserve data from China’s central bank is due Sunday. Sure it won’t reflect September’s price surge, but traders are watching it closely to see if central bank demand has started to cool. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

On Thursday, Trump told European officials to halt oil purchases from Russia, but didn’t give them a deadline, according to Reuters, which first reported the development from Copenhagen on September 5. On Friday, Dan Jorgensen, who handles the EU’s energy policies, made it clear in an interview that Washington hasn’t asked him to fast-track the deadline. “Not only has Putin weaponised energy against us, blackmailed member states, we are actually also indirectly helping finance Putin’s war, and that needs to stop. And if President Trump agrees to that, then that is only a welcome support, because that is certainly our main objective,” Jorgensen said. Right now, the European Union is finalizing legal rules to formally ban oil and gas imports from Russia within the next three years. These imports have been one of Russia’s biggest cash flows since its full invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and that money has gone straight into funding its war effort. Hungary and Slovakia resist, want gas and oil to keep flowing Not every EU country is on board. Hungary and Slovakia are still bringing in about 200,000 to 250,000 barrels of Russian oil every day through the Druzhba pipeline. That’s around 3% of the entire bloc’s oil needs. They’re also buying Russian gas and aren’t happy about Brussels’ timeline, warning that this cut-off could jack up energy prices and trigger shortages in their countries. Robert Fico, the prime minister of Slovakia, stood his ground during a press conference on Friday after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He refused to comment on Trump’s remarks but insisted that “reliable supplies were needed,” pointing out that several European nations are still buying Russian gas and U.S. liquefied natural gas to meet their energy needs. Jorgensen confirmed that talks are ongoing with both Hungary and Slovakia. However, he said their support isn’t required to push the plan through. “If, for domestic reasons, there are countries that don’t feel that they can support it, then this is not something that demands unanimity,” he said. He didn’t say whether Brussels plans to offer financial support or legal protections to win them over. The current phase-out proposal doesn’t need unanimous agreement. It just needs a reinforced majority from member states, and EU diplomats expect that group of energy ministers to approve the plan at their next meeting, happening sometime next month. US and EU to discuss massive gas purchase, Kremlin silent While all this is going down in Europe, the Kremlin hasn’t responded to Trump’s warning. Meanwhile, Jorgensen is getting ready to meet with U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright in Brussels next week. At the top of the agenda? A massive EU promise to buy $250 billion worth of U.S. energy each year under an ongoing U.S.-EU trade deal. Plenty of analysts have called that target unrealistic, saying the EU doesn’t have much power over what private energy companies choose to import. Jorgensen didn’t disagree. “It’s clear that our role is to facilitate. The EU is not a gas trader,” he said. Still, there are talks about ways to make it work. One option on the table is pooling demand, having European companies band together to order gas from the U.S. in bulk. It’s not locked in, but it’s being discussed as a way to help both sides stick to the deal. While Europe slashes its dependence on Russian oil, gas imports from Russia are still significantly higher. This year, about 13% of the EU’s gas is expected to come from Russia, a drop from 45% before the war began, but still a big number. Outside of Europe, Washington has started punishing countries that keep buying Russian fuel. India has been hit with new tariffs from the United States for its continued oil imports from Russia, and India fired back by accusing the West of being hypocrites.

Backed by strong adoption, DeFi integrations, and growing corporate treasuries, excitement is building among traders. Yet, while Binance Coin attracts long-term believers, another rising star, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is beginning to stir up hype as one of the most discussed cryptos making waves in the market. BNB Price Prediction 2025: Why Traders See $1,000 as Realistic The push toward the BNB $1000 target is not random speculation—it’s tied to adoption trends and real money entering the ecosystem. A standout example is CEA Industries , which has expanded its holdings to over 388,888 BNB , worth more than $330M, making it the largest corporate BNB treasury. This institutional move highlights strong BNB long term potential. Market watchers point out that BNB has already pushed near $900 in past cycles, and with DeFi expansion plus massive user activity, a run toward Binance Coin price forecast levels of $1,000 doesn’t look far-fetched. Analysts on X are calling this move “programmed since long,” with some predicting 1100+ BNB/USD in this bull cycle. BNB price analysis by Crypto King This mix of deep liquidity, corporate interest, and a bullish technical setup has reinforced the belief that Binance Coin price prediction models could see triple digits become history soon. For those studying BNB market analysis, the signs suggest institutional demand could be the force that drives BNB into four figures. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Crypto Generating Speculative Hype While BNB’s crypto price prediction for 2025 is grabbing headlines, the chatter across trading groups is increasingly shifting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its unique mission and fast-growing presence have made it one of the most talked-about new tokens. Traders fear missing out on a potential early-stage breakout, drawing parallels to how big names started before explosive moves. What stands out is the timing—BNB is being viewed as a large-cap bet, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a fresh opportunity for high-growth speculators. For those asking, “Will BNB reach $1000 by 2025?”, the conversation often turns to what could be the next rising project riding the same wave of attention. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in, feeding both curiosity and anticipation. Final Thoughts: From BNB’s $1,000 Goal to New Market Contenders The outlook for BNB price prediction and analyst insights shows confidence in the $1,000 milestone, driven by corporate accumulation, a strong DeFi presence, and user adoption. The BNB coin future looks promising as institutional players treat it like a digital treasury asset, strengthening the case for the BNB $1000 price target explained by analysts. At the same time, attention is shifting beyond the giants. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as the new exciting crypto to watch, with investors considering it the next major breakout.

This recent development, totaling a substantial $162 million on September 5, signals a notable shift in investor behavior within the institutional crypto landscape. For many, understanding these movements is crucial to grasping the broader market sentiment and potential future trends for Bitcoin. What’s Driving These Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows? According to data from TraderT, the collective net outflow of $162 million on September 5 saw several key players contribute significantly to the withdrawals. BlackRock’s IBIT, a prominent fund, led these movements with $64.95 million in outflows. Following closely were Bitwise’s BITB, which experienced $49.65 million in withdrawals, and Grayscale’s GBTC, seeing $47.33 million exit its coffers. Interestingly, no U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF reported any net inflows for the day, highlighting a broad-based withdrawal trend rather than a simple rebalancing between funds. These figures represent a clear pause, if not a reversal, in the previously strong accumulation seen in these investment vehicles. When we talk about “net outflows,” it means that more money was withdrawn from these ETFs than was invested. This metric is a powerful indicator of institutional confidence and short-term market sentiment, particularly for an asset like Bitcoin that is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance through these regulated products. Why Do Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Matter for the Crypto Market? The consistent recording of Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows carries significant weight for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Historically, the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs was hailed as a landmark moment, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. They offered institutional investors and retail traders a regulated, accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the underlying asset. Therefore, sustained withdrawals from these funds can signal a shift in institutional appetite or a broader cautious outlook. Here’s why these outflows are important: Market Sentiment: Consecutive outflows can dampen overall market sentiment, potentially leading to increased selling pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price. Institutional Confidence: They might suggest that some institutional players are taking profits, rebalancing their portfolios, or becoming more risk-averse in the short term. Liquidity Impact: While $162 million might seem small compared to Bitcoin’s overall market cap, sustained outflows can affect liquidity, especially if they persist over a longer period. Moreover, these movements often create a ripple effect. When major institutional products like BlackRock’s IBIT see significant withdrawals, it can influence the perceptions and decisions of other large-scale investors, potentially amplifying market trends. Navigating the Future Amidst Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Understanding the context behind these Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows is crucial for investors. While two days of outflows might not signify a long-term bearish trend, they certainly warrant close monitoring. Possible reasons for these withdrawals could include broader market risk-off sentiment, profit-taking after recent gains in Bitcoin’s price, or portfolio rebalancing as institutions adjust their asset allocations. It is also important to remember that market cycles are dynamic, and periods of withdrawal are a natural part of any investment landscape. What should investors watch for next? Continued Trends: Observe if the outflow trend persists for several more days or weeks, indicating a more entrenched shift. Bitcoin Price Action: Monitor how Bitcoin’s spot price reacts to these institutional movements. Significant drops could confirm a negative correlation. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic indicators, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical events can also influence institutional investment decisions in risk assets like Bitcoin. For those looking to make informed decisions, staying updated on these institutional flows is paramount. While short-term fluctuations are common, consistent trends in Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows can provide valuable insights into the health and direction of the institutional crypto market. In conclusion, the recent $162 million in Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows , marking a second straight day of withdrawals, serves as a critical data point for the cryptocurrency market. While not a definitive indicator of a prolonged downturn, it underscores the need for investors to remain vigilant and understand the various factors influencing institutional capital flows into digital assets. These movements highlight the evolving nature of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance and the continuous interplay between institutional sentiment and market performance. Staying informed and adaptable will be key for navigating the dynamic crypto landscape ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without having to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: What does “net outflow” mean for an ETF? A net outflow occurs when the total value of shares redeemed (sold back to the fund) by investors exceeds the total value of new shares purchased. It indicates more money is leaving the fund than entering it. Q3: How do Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows impact Bitcoin’s price? While not a direct one-to-one correlation, significant and sustained Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows can contribute to negative market sentiment and potentially increase selling pressure on Bitcoin, which could lead to a decrease in its spot price. Q4: Is this a common occurrence for ETFs? ETFs, including those for traditional assets, regularly experience both inflows and outflows as investors adjust their portfolios. However, consecutive days of significant net outflows, especially from newly launched products like Spot Bitcoin ETFs, warrant attention. Q5: What are the main reasons for these recent Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows? The exact reasons can vary, but common factors include profit-taking by investors after price gains, portfolio rebalancing, broader macroeconomic concerns leading to risk-off sentiment, or shifts in institutional investment strategies. Q6: Should individual investors be concerned by these outflows? Individual investors should view these outflows as one data point among many. It’s important to conduct your own research, consider your personal financial goals, and understand that short-term market fluctuations are normal. These outflows primarily reflect institutional activity. If you found this analysis insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

Ethereum has overtaken Bitcoin in key usage metrics, signaling a potential top for Bitcoin this cycle and stronger fundamentals for ETH. After a significant rally, I am downgrading the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) to 'hold,' seeing Ethereum as the better long-term investment. With yet another month in 2025 complete, we grind increasingly closer to decision time for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Bitcoin ETFs like the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (BATS: EZBC ). I've covered EZBC for Seeking Alpha in the past and happen to like the fund for its designed purpose; specifically, providing exposure to Bitcoin through what is probably a more familiar financial product for the broader investment community. The fund functions essentially identically to most of the other Bitcoin ETFs in the US market and offers a competitive fee. Data by YCharts To this point, the legitimacy of EZBC as a viable Bitcoin product isn't really the point of this update. We have seen over the last year that EZBC holds up just as well as the market-leading ETF product and is superior to futures-based alternatives. Rather, in this article we will take an updated look at Bitcoin's capital flow story as well as on-chain metrics through August to determine whether or not network fundamentals are showing any meaningful progress. Capital Flows Now Favor ETH Of course, on-chain utility is just one part of the story. The demand for BTC from DATs and ETF investors has been enormous in 2025. But it should be noted that investors are now starting to favor ETH over BTC. Consider the change in share of net flow dominance that we just witnessed in August: Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin -$301 $20,797 $166,721 Ethereum $3,955 $12,086 $37,856 Multi-asset -$4.4 $113 $7,619 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $388.8 $1,240 $3,277 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $307.0 $1,396 $2,659 Total $4,376 $35,527 $219,876 BTC Dominance -6.9% 58.5% 75.8% ETH Dominance 90.4% 34.0% 17.2% Source: CoinShares/Bloomberg, as of August 30th Through the end of August, full month net flows for Bitcoin were negative by over $300 million. By itself, that isn't a huge problem but the reason I see a potential issue is because the outflow is generally exclusive to Bitcoin. Solana and XRP both saw YTD flows grow dramatically in August. Almost $4 billion was poured into ETH during the month - which was a 50% increase in the year-to-date net flows for ETH from the end of July in just a single month. You can see from the dominance calculations in the table above that BTC's YTD flow dominance has fallen down to 58%. To be sure, August was a large outlier. But it is arguably a continuation of a trend that started in July: Through July 2025 (CoinShares/Bloomber) Where ETH net flows were almost at parity with BTC in July, August was decidedly an overweight ETH month. ETH is benefiting from both surging acquisitions by investors as well as improved on-chain fundamentals. Similar to the investment net flow story, Bitcoin's on-chain metrics in August also showed deterioration. On Chain Metrics Through August Bitcoin DAAs (Token Terminal) Monthly DAAs continue to trend flat-to-down for Bitcoin with 10.8 million active addresses during August. That was actually up 2.9% year over year but still well below highs from 2021 and 2023. Where DAAs have largely held up against averages through the first 7 months of 2025, transactions have been falling: Bitcoin Metrics August 2024 July 2025 August 2025 YoY MoM DAAs* 10.5 10.7 10.8 2.9% 0.9% Transactions* 18.5 13 14.1 -23.8% 8.5% Fees* $20.73 $16.42 $13.20 -36.3% -19.6% Avg Tx Fee $1.08 $1.28 $0.96 -11.1% -25.0% Source: Token Terminal, *figures in millions Transactions fell to 14.1 million in August. While that was up 8.5% from July, it was down by 24% year over year; coupled with the 11% dip in average transaction fee, monthly fees paid to miners fell to just $13.2 million in August. That was down 36.3% year over year and just under 20% from July. Share of Transferred Value (CoinMetrics) The other thing to consider is dollar-denominated transferred value. I've stacked ETH vs BTC transferred value shares in the chart above. After bottoming out at 27% share of transferred value in May, ETH rocketed up to 53% share of transferred value at the end of August. I see two major signals here. First, I believe it is indicative of Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in an important fundamental metric given the stark differences between the two assets in several other key metrics. And second, it could also be seen as an indication that Bitcoin's top is either close or already here for this cycle. During the 2017 bull run, ETH's share of transferred value peaked at 50%. In 2021 it hit 58%. At 53% currently, I think Bitcoiners would be wise to consider the possibility that the gains have been had for 2025. Final Thoughts There is perhaps an argument to be made that on-chain fundamentals don't really matter; that somehow, Bitcoin is a special asset that simply needs to be held to let supply/demand produce higher prices in perpetuity. After all, a major takeaway from the block size war last decade was that narratives can change and Bitcoin is more 'Digital Gold' than a decentralized 'peer to peer' money system. If that is true, then capital flows into the asset might really be the only thing that matters. Yet, I have long argued that assertion is false. And that all of the hoarding through ETFs and/or DATs will ultimately lead to network security issues down the line. Regardless, I've been willing to look beyond my own opinions of Bitcoin and simply follow the market instead. But the market is singing a different tune today. Where Bitcoin previously dominated all other digital assets through investor net flows, Ethereum is seemingly taken its turn. Importantly, beyond simply benefiting from investment demand, Ethereum has terrific fundamentals as well through usage and stablecoin transfer volume. This is not to say that I'm exiting my Bitcoin position entirely. Frankly, I have Bitcoin that I will likely never sell. But I think Ethereum is the better long term investment at this point in time. After an 82% rally from my initial coverage, I'm downgrading EZBC to 'hold.'",BTC-USD|EZBC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-06 02:32:01

If you’ve been tracking the performance of Spot ETH ETFs , you’re likely aware of the recent, rather dramatic, development. On September 5th, these investment vehicles experienced their second-largest single-day net outflow on record, totaling a staggering $444 million. This substantial withdrawal highlights the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and raises important questions about investor sentiment towards Ethereum-backed funds. What Triggered the Massive Spot ETH ETFs Outflow? The substantial $444 million net outflow from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs on September 5th wasn’t just a minor blip; it was the second-largest withdrawal event ever recorded for these products. This significant movement of capital indicates a notable shift in investor behavior, prompting market analysts to delve deeper into its underlying causes. Several key players were at the forefront of this outflow: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the pack with a massive $308 million shed. This single withdrawal accounted for the majority of the day’s total, underscoring its significant impact. Grayscale’s ETHE: Saw substantial withdrawals of $51.77 million, indicating broader market participation in the selling pressure. Fidelity’s FETH: Experienced outflows amounting to $37.77 million, further contributing to the overall negative sentiment. Grayscale’s Mini ETH Fund: Also registered a notable outflow of $32.62 million, suggesting that even newer or smaller funds were not immune to the trend. Understanding the specific drivers behind these individual fund withdrawals is crucial for comprehending the broader market dynamics affecting Spot ETH ETFs . Are Investors Losing Confidence in Spot ETH ETFs? While a single day’s outflow doesn’t necessarily dictate a long-term trend, such a significant event does raise questions about investor confidence in Spot ETH ETFs . Several factors could contribute to such a large-scale withdrawal, including broader market corrections, shifts in macroeconomic policy, or even specific news related to the Ethereum network itself. For instance, investors might be reacting to: Profit-taking: After periods of growth, some investors might choose to realize their gains, leading to outflows. Risk aversion: Global economic uncertainties or regulatory concerns could prompt investors to move capital out of perceived higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Alternative investments: New opportunities or a perceived safer haven might draw funds away from existing positions. It’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly interconnected. A downturn in Bitcoin or broader equities can often cascade into other digital assets, including Ethereum. Therefore, assessing the context of this outflow requires looking beyond just the Ethereum ecosystem. What Does This Outflow Mean for the Future of Spot ETH ETFs? The $444 million outflow, while substantial, should be viewed within the larger context of the evolving digital asset landscape. While it represents a significant withdrawal, the long-term prospects for Spot ETH ETFs remain a topic of intense debate among financial experts. Institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, suggesting a foundational interest that may withstand short-term volatility. Looking ahead, here are some actionable insights and considerations: Market Resilience: The ability of the market to absorb such large outflows and recover will be a key indicator of its maturity. Regulatory Landscape: Ongoing developments in cryptocurrency regulation, particularly in the U.S., will heavily influence investor sentiment and the appeal of these products. Ethereum’s Development: Continued innovation and stability within the Ethereum network itself will be vital for maintaining and attracting investor interest. Diversification: Investors often use ETFs as a tool for diversification. Understanding their overall portfolio strategy is key to interpreting these movements. This event serves as a crucial reminder of the inherent volatility in the crypto market. However, it also underscores the growing institutional presence and the increasing sophistication of investment vehicles like Spot ETH ETFs . Navigating Volatility: Key Takeaways for Spot ETH ETFs Investors For those invested in or considering Spot ETH ETFs , understanding the ebb and flow of capital is paramount. While large outflows can appear alarming, they are a natural part of dynamic markets. Long-term perspectives often emphasize the underlying technology and its potential, rather than focusing solely on daily price movements. Key takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and Ethereum network developments. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Long-Term View: Consider the long-term potential of Ethereum and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. In conclusion, the recent $444 million outflow from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs on September 5th was a significant event, marking the second-largest on record. While led by major players like BlackRock and Grayscale, this withdrawal highlights the ongoing volatility and evolving investor sentiment within the digital asset space. Far from signaling an end, it serves as a powerful reminder that while the journey of cryptocurrency adoption may have its bumps, the underlying interest and institutional infrastructure continue to develop. Investors are encouraged to remain informed and consider a balanced perspective when navigating these dynamic markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Spot ETH ETFs?

They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. 2. Why did Spot ETH ETFs see such a large outflow on September 5th? The exact reasons can be multifaceted, but common factors include profit-taking by investors, a general increase in market risk aversion due to broader economic conditions, or a shift of capital to other investment opportunities. This particular outflow was the second-largest on record, suggesting a significant market reaction. 3. Which funds were most affected by this outflow? The outflows were primarily led by BlackRock’s ETHA, which saw a $308 million withdrawal. Other significant contributors included Grayscale’s ETHE ($51.77 million), Fidelity’s FETH ($37.77 million), and Grayscale’s mini ETH fund ($32.62 million). 4. Does this outflow indicate a long-term bearish trend for Ethereum? A single day’s outflow, even a large one, does not necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. While it suggests a period of selling pressure or reduced confidence, the long-term outlook for Ethereum and Spot ETH ETFs depends on broader market sentiment, regulatory developments, and the continued evolution of the Ethereum network. 5. How should investors react to such significant market movements? Investors are generally advised to remain informed, maintain a diversified portfolio, and consider their long-term investment goals rather than reacting impulsively to short-term market fluctuations.

Specifically, the regulatory body has pushed back its review deadline for Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF application to November 8. This development marks another chapter in the ongoing saga of bringing mainstream investment vehicles to the digital asset space. For many, a spot ETF represents a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies like Polkadot (DOT). What Does This Grayscale Spot DOT ETF Delay Mean for Investors? When the SEC extends a review period, it signals that they require more time to thoroughly evaluate the proposal. This is a common occurrence for complex financial products, especially those involving novel assets like cryptocurrencies. For Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF , this means the commission is likely digging deeper into various aspects of the fund. They are scrutinizing market structure, investor protection measures, and the underlying Polkadot ecosystem itself. While frustrating for those eager for approval, it underscores the SEC’s cautious approach. Why Is the SEC Taking Its Time with Spot DOT ETFs? The SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors and ensure fair and orderly markets. When it comes to spot crypto ETFs, the commission often cites concerns about potential market manipulation, liquidity, and the custody of digital assets. Unlike futures-based ETFs, a spot ETF holds the actual cryptocurrency. This introduces unique challenges for regulators. Polkadot, with its innovative parachain architecture and staking mechanisms, presents a distinct set of considerations compared to more established assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The SEC needs to understand how a Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF would manage these complexities within a regulated framework. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of a Spot DOT ETF? The approval of a Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF could unlock several significant advantages for the broader market, alongside some inherent challenges. Benefits: Increased Accessibility: A spot ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Polkadot without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. This simplifies the investment process. Institutional Adoption: It could attract substantial capital from institutional investors, who often prefer regulated, easily tradable products. Enhanced Price Discovery: Greater participation from diverse investor groups could lead to more efficient and robust price discovery for DOT. Regulatory Clarity: An approval would set a precedent, potentially paving the way for other altcoin spot ETFs. Challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: The SEC’s ongoing concerns about market integrity remain a significant barrier. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings, and an ETF would expose investors to this volatility within a traditional investment vehicle. Competition: The market for crypto investment products is growing, and any new ETF would face competition from existing funds and direct crypto purchases. What’s Next for Grayscale’s Spot DOT ETF and Investors? The new deadline of November 8 now becomes a critical date on the crypto calendar. Investors and enthusiasts will be closely watching for any further announcements from the SEC. While extensions can be disheartening, they are not necessarily indicative of an eventual rejection. Often, they simply mean the regulatory body is conducting its due diligence thoroughly. For those interested in the Polkadot ecosystem, this period offers an opportunity to deepen their understanding of DOT’s technology and its potential market impact. Actionable Insight: Stay informed by following official SEC announcements and reputable crypto news sources. Understand that regulatory decisions can significantly influence market sentiment and asset prices. Conclusion: The extended review period for Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF highlights the cautious yet evolving relationship between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency space. While the wait continues, this process is crucial for establishing robust frameworks that protect investors and foster innovation. The outcome of this decision will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of institutional engagement with altcoins and the broader digital asset market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot ETF? A: A spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) holds the underlying asset directly. In this case, a spot DOT ETF would hold actual Polkadot (DOT) tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to DOT’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency itself. Q2: Why is the SEC extending the deadline for Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF? A: The SEC typically extends review periods for complex financial products to allow more time for thorough evaluation of market structure, investor protection, and the unique characteristics of the underlying asset, in this case, Polkadot. Q3: How does a spot DOT ETF differ from a futures DOT ETF? A: A spot DOT ETF directly holds Polkadot tokens, reflecting its current market price. A futures DOT ETF, however, invests in futures contracts that bet on Polkadot’s future price, rather than holding the asset itself. Q4: What impact could a Grayscale spot DOT ETF approval have on Polkadot (DOT)? A: Approval could significantly boost DOT’s visibility and liquidity, attracting more institutional investment and potentially leading to increased demand and price appreciation. It would also lend further legitimacy to the Polkadot ecosystem. Q5: Is an extension a bad sign for the approval of Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF? A: Not necessarily. While it prolongs the wait, extensions are a standard part of the SEC’s review process for novel financial products. It simply indicates that the commission requires more time for due diligence.

Generally investors who remain calm and stick to good strategies are the ones who recover the best. As the list of emerging projects grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE has garnered attention with its robust tokenomics and forward-looking ecosystem design, reminiscent of the early stages of today’s most-established digital assets. 1. Stay Calm and Stick to Your Plan The biggest mistake during a crash is panic selling. In past cycles, many investors with this attitude have lost their share of gains by cutting and holding on at the wrong times. Volatility is not a bug–it’s in crypto’s DNA. With a solid core of project fundamentals, development team, and long-term vision unharmed, a price dip can be a temporary setback without discrediting a project’s potential. Maintaining integrity in line with your original thesis can see you through the turbulence and be poised for recovery. 2. Buy the Dip Like It’s a Clearance Sale A crash is one of the best opportunities to establish long-term positions. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a straightforward but powerful strategy: invest a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of the price. When markets fall, you’re able to buy more units with your money, which reduces your average entry price. Instead of worrying about “catching the bottom,” DCA assures you progressively build strong assets at a discount. Quality projects on good fundamentals become much more appealing when they’re priced 50% cheaper than they were a few months ago. 3. Use Stablecoins or Staking for Flexibility If you don’t want to risk buying more during a crash, there are still options for how to approach your portfolio. Using stablecoins to keep a certain percentage of your capital helps protect against further downturns while ensuring that you retain sufficient liquidity to re-enter the market. At the same time, token staking or participating in DeFi programs enables you to earn passive rewards, even during market downturns. This way, you increase your token count while awaiting the next bullish wave. A Revolutionary New Opportunity Arises Amid this strategic approach, one project that is gaining traction is MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its strong tokenomics and long-term utility and scalability for holders. Its meteoric presale success and fast growing community reflect the early momentum that helped drive other mainstream assets before they became household names. Early movers are already positioning themselves seeing that today’s crash prices could well be tomorrow’s launchpad. Conclusion Crypto markets test investors’ patience, but they also offer a stage for disciplined strategies to stand out. Whether it’s navigating through tranquil confidence, acquiring discounted assets, or generating yield on the sidelines, downturns can be powerful stepping stones for long-term wealth. As projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE continue to make waves with their solid fundamentals and growth prospects, astute investors are leveraging the storm to position themselves for the next bull market.

The rumors alone can fuel a massive rally of more than 50%. Investors are now debating whether meme coins, once dismissed as speculative jokes, are stepping into a new era of institutional legitimacy. The sharp price reaction underscores the cultural power of meme coins. With communities numbering in the millions, Dogecoin and SHIB are unlike any other assets in the crypto market. Analysts say that if ETF products ever materialize, it would be a turning point not only for these tokens but for the broader meme coin ecosystem. Meanwhile, attention is also drifting toward new opportunities, with presale tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as alternatives for investors chasing early-stage growth. Dogecoin’s Case for an ETF Dogecoin, originally created as a joke, has since become a household name in crypto. It has been endorsed by celebrities and has even been integrated into payment systems. While no ETF application has been confirmed, the speculation is enough to remind investors of DOGE’s resilience. Price forecasts suggest DOGE could hit $0.60–$0.75 if ETF momentum continues. Shiba Inu’s Ecosystem Expansion Shiba Inu is more than just a meme. Its Shibarium layer-2 network and growing DeFi applications have expanded its use cases significantly. SHIB’s community-driven model means any ETF speculation is quickly amplified across social platforms. Analysts believe SHIB could rise to $0.00005–$0.00008 this cycle if institutional interest grows. Greater Opportunities in 2025 While Dogecoin and SHIB dominate the meme coin category, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention with its explosive presale growth. Mirroring Shiba Inu’s explosive run from its early cycle entry , MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most discussed low-cap opportunities. Its tokenomics are designed for scalability and sustainability, and thousands of investors have already secured allocations ahead of expected exchange listings.With $13 million raised in record time, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract investors, while analysts speculate it could be a game-changer for the crypto industry. Could Meme ETFs Actually Happen? Skeptics argue that ETFs tied to meme coins may never gain regulatory approval due to their volatility. However, with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs paving the way, analysts believe nothing is off the table. Even if meme coin ETFs remain speculative, the conversation alone is enough to ignite significant price movements. Conclusion The potential for a 50% surge Dogecoin and SHIB highlights how much effect an ETF approval could have on the memecoin market. While ETF speculation remains unconfirmed, the hype demonstrates the potential of meme coins to capture institutional attention. At the same time, new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are leveraging similar community-driven momentum to position themselves as the next viral success story. For investors, both meme coins and presale tokens represent high-risk, high-reward bets that could define the next chapter of crypto’s bull cycle.

Despite the pullback, bears have struggled to push the price below the $105,000 support zone, a level that has so far acted as a firm floor for the market. The debate among analysts is intensifying—some are calling for a deeper correction that could reset overheated sentiment, while others see current price action as a prelude to another test of all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Base Turns Neutral-Bearish As Flows Stay Weak Top analyst Maartunn shared fresh insights, describing the current environment as a “major Bitcoin reshuffle.” According to him, old coins are increasingly flowing into ETF wallets, a phenomenon marked by three significant waves: summer 2024, fall 2024, and summer 2025. Unlike past cycles, where such redistribution events typically occurred once before fading, this cycle has shown a repeated pattern of supply rotation. This unusual trend highlights a structural shift in Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Long-term holders appear to be reducing exposure, while ETFs and institutional vehicles continue to absorb supply. Whether this redistribution stabilizes the market or fuels further volatility will be a defining factor for Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months. Old Bitcoin Supply Unlocks: Market Dynamics In Focus According to Maartunn, a significant movement of 7,626 BTC aged between three to five years has recently taken place. This type of activity is notable because it signals long-term holders deciding to release dormant coins back into circulation. Historically, such events often coincide with heightened market uncertainty and shifts in investor behavior, reinforcing the narrative that old supply continues to play a decisive role in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. Despite this selling pressure, Bitcoin has managed to hold above the $110,000 level, showing resilience in the face of profit-taking from long-term holders. This stability is encouraging, as it demonstrates that buyers are stepping in to absorb supply, though the strength of that demand remains in question. Some market participants are pointing to ETF inflows as the primary reason Bitcoin has avoided a sharper correction. ETFs, by nature, act as a consistent demand sink, channeling institutional capital into Bitcoin through regulated frameworks. However, the risk remains that without robust new demand, the selling pressure from newly unlocked coins could begin to outweigh buying interest. If this happens, recent holders may face the brunt of volatility. For now, the market appears to be balancing between long-term holders’ profit-taking and institutional accumulation. This emerging dynamic highlights how Bitcoin’s current cycle differs from previous ones—ETF participation and repeated redistribution of old coins are reshaping the market structure. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether ETF inflows are strong enough to offset the increased activity of older supply and keep Bitcoin on a bullish path.

The chart highlights a rebound from the $109K–$110K demand zone, which has acted as short-term support during the past week. However, BTC now faces resistance as it tests the 50-day moving average (blue line at $111,661) and the 100-day moving average (green line at $114,382). These levels represent key barriers for bulls attempting to reclaim higher ground. The broader picture shows BTC still lagging behind its all-time high near $124,500, marked by the yellow resistance line. Despite multiple attempts, Bitcoin has struggled to generate enough momentum to retest this level, largely due to persistent selling pressure and cautious sentiment among traders. The red 200-day moving average at $114,746 sits just above current price action, creating a cluster of resistance levels that could limit upside in the near term.

Conversely, failure to sustain above $110K could see BTC revisiting lower supports around $106K–$108K. For now, consolidation dominates, with bulls needing fresh demand to push beyond resistance.

51265788,575437,1757127645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51265788.jpeg,Justin Sun Faces Backlash After Urging WLFI to Unfreeze Tokens,https://bitcoinist.com/justin-sun-face-backlash-urging-wlfi-unfreeze-token/,"Tron founder Justin Sun has once again found himself at the center of crypto controversy, this time over his frozen holdings in World Liberty Financials (WLFI). The project blacklisted Sun’s wallet last week, freezing nearly 595 million WLFI tokens worth over $100 million at the time. Sun has since taken to social media, urging the team to unlock his assets and warning that such actions undermine investor trust. Why Were Sun’s WLFI Tokens Frozen? The dispute began after blockchain data revealed a wallet linked to Sun transferred nearly $9 million worth of WLFI tokens to an exchange. Shortly afterward, WLFI’s team blacklisted the address, effectively freezing his tokens. Market observers claimed the move was designed to stop potential dumping that could further destabilize the token’s price, which has already lost more than 60% of its value since launch. WLFI debuted at $0.46 but now trades near $0.18, raising concerns about whale activity and the project’s governance. Critics argue the blacklisting contradicts the very principles of decentralization that blockchain projects are supposed to uphold. Sun Denies Dumping Allegations In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) , Sun rejected claims of market manipulation, stating the transfers were merely “small deposit tests” and not intended for selling. He called the freeze “unreasonable” and insisted that all investors should be treated equally. “Tokens are sacred and inviolable, this should be the most basic value of any blockchain,” Sun wrote. He added that unilateral freezes risk eroding confidence in WLFI, a project he supported early with both capital and strategic backing. On-chain analysis from firms like Nansen has also suggested Sun was not directly responsible for WLFI’s sharp price decline, instead linking the sell-off to large market-maker activity. Governance Concerns and Market Outlook The standoff between Sun and WLFI has amplified investor concerns about centralization and transparency within the project. Critics warn that blacklisting wallets without clear communication risks damaging WLFI’s credibility, especially at such an early stage. In an attempt to stabilize prices, the WLFI team has announced a buyback-and-burn program, including the destruction of 47 million tokens. However, uncertainty remains high as the dispute with Sun continues and market volatility weighs on investor sentiment. For now, Sun is pressing WLFI to restore his rights and unlock his frozen tokens, while the broader crypto community debates whether the project can recover trust, or whether this controversy marks the start of deeper governance challenges.

In a dramatic turn, crypto liquidations surged past an astonishing $216 million within just 24 hours, leaving many traders reeling. This sudden downturn predominantly impacted those holding long positions, underscoring the high risks involved in perpetual futures trading. What Are Crypto Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Understanding crypto liquidations is crucial for any market participant. Essentially, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. This mechanism is designed to prevent a trader’s balance from falling below zero, but it can lead to significant losses for the individual. When the market moves sharply against a leveraged position, especially long positions betting on price increases, these forced closures amplify selling pressure. This can create a cascading effect, driving prices down further and triggering even more liquidations across the market. Who Felt the Brunt of the Recent Crypto Liquidations? The past 24 hours painted a clear picture of where the pain was concentrated. Here’s a breakdown of the most affected assets: Bitcoin (BTC): Saw a massive $110 million in liquidations. A significant 59.23% of these were long positions, indicating a strong belief in upward price movement that was brutally unmet. Ethereum (ETH): Not far behind, ETH experienced $101 million in liquidations. Long positions accounted for 56.82%, showing similar bullish sentiment being caught off guard. Ethena (ENA): This relatively newer asset also faced substantial pressure, with $5.81 million liquidated. Again, long positions represented 54.71% of the total, highlighting a broader market trend. These figures demonstrate a widespread impact across major cryptocurrencies and newer projects alike, all suffering from aggressive market reversals and significant crypto liquidations . Navigating the Volatility: Lessons from Recent Crypto Liquidations Such significant crypto liquidations serve as a powerful lesson for traders. They highlight the double-edged sword of leverage. While leverage can amplify gains, it equally magnifies losses, making risk management paramount. Many traders, especially those new to perpetual futures, often underestimate the speed at which market conditions can change. One key takeaway is the importance of setting realistic stop-loss orders. These automated tools can help limit potential losses by closing a position once a certain price threshold is breached. Moreover, avoiding excessive leverage is a fundamental principle for sustainable trading, ensuring that even large price swings don’t immediately wipe out an entire portfolio. What Can Traders Do to Mitigate Risks? In the face of such market events, adopting a disciplined approach is vital. Here are some actionable insights: Prudent Leverage: Use leverage sparingly and understand its implications fully. Higher leverage means smaller price movements can lead to liquidation. Diversification: Spreading investments across different assets can help cushion the blow if one asset performs poorly. Stop-Loss Orders: Implement these to automatically close positions at a predetermined loss level, protecting capital. Market Analysis: Stay informed about market trends, technical indicators, and fundamental news that could influence price action. Emotional Control: Avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed, especially during periods of high volatility. These strategies are not foolproof but can significantly reduce exposure to catastrophic losses during events like the recent wave of crypto liquidations . The recent wave of crypto liquidations , totaling over $216 million, underscores the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the allure of quick gains is strong, the reality of significant losses is equally potent. This event serves as a critical reminder for all participants to prioritize robust risk management, educate themselves on market mechanics, and approach leveraged trading with extreme caution. Staying informed and prepared is the best defense against the market’s unpredictable swings.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto liquidations? A1: Crypto liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange because their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level, typically due to adverse price movements. Q2: Why were long positions hit hardest in this event? A2: Long positions bet on an asset’s price increasing. When the market experiences a sudden downturn or significant price drop, these positions are the first to suffer losses and face liquidation as the price moves against their bullish expectation. Q3: How can traders avoid liquidation? A3: Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, setting effective stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and employing sound risk management strategies to protect against unexpected market volatility. Q4: Does this mean the crypto market is in a downturn? A4: Significant crypto liquidations often indicate high volatility and selling pressure, which can be a sign of a short-term downturn or correction. However, the long-term trend requires broader analysis of market fundamentals and sentiment beyond a single 24-hour event. Q5: What role does leverage play in liquidations? A5: Leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. While it allows traders to control larger positions with less capital, it also increases the risk of liquidation, as even small price movements against a highly leveraged position can quickly deplete a trader’s margin.

Set to be the first-ever exchange-traded fund offering direct exposure to Dogecoin (DOGE), the move opens the door for both retail and institutional investors to gain access to the performance of the popular meme coin through traditional markets. DOGE’s Wall Street Debut Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas weighed in on the announcement and said that Rex appears ready to launch its Dogecoin ETF as early as next week under the ’40 Act, similar to its recently launched SSK, which is a US-listed ETF that gives investors exposure to Solana (SOL). According to Balchunas, Dogecoin is likely to be the first product rolled out, given the newly filed effective prospectus. However, he also highlighted that the filing references other potential offerings tied to Trump, XRP, and Bonk, and added that Rex may have additional crypto-themed ETFs in the pipeline. Meanwhile, the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) read , “The Fund’s investments in DOGE and DOGE futures contracts and swap agreements expose the Fund to the risks associated with an investment in DOGE because the price of these derivatives is substantially based on the price of DOGE. DOGE is a relatively new innovation and is subject to unique and substantial risks. The market for DOGE is subject to rapid price swings, changes, and uncertainty.” Dogecoin’s Rebound Signs? Over the last month, Dogecoin climbed more than 8%, reaching $0.216. The uptick was partly driven by CleanCore Solutions’ new Dogecoin treasury. The Nebraska-based manufacturer of aqueous ozone cleaning systems has become the first public company to hold DOGE as its primary treasury reserve. The firm announced a $175 million private placement, with backing from upwards of 80 institutional and crypto-native investors. Meanwhile, popular analyst Ali Martinez spotted that the TD Sequential indicator, which previously identified the top, has now flashed a buy signal for DOGE. This suggests that selling pressure may have exhausted in the short term, which could set the stage for a rebound.

Data from Santiment shows ADA’s bullish-to-bearish commentary ratio slumped to 1.5:1 this week — the lowest in five months. The sentiment dip coincided with a 5% rebound, suggesting traders who sold into frustration may have helped mark a local bottom. Historically, ADA rallies have tended to begin when retail sentiment is weakest. Santiment flagged a similar setup in mid-August, when a 2:1 ratio aligned with a surge. Conversely, euphoric spikes — like the 12.8:1 ratio earlier this summer — have preceded sharp pullbacks. Sentiment extremes matter because crypto markets are unusually sensitive to retail psychology. When optimism peaks, the crowd often buys into tops. When pessimism sets in, larger players use the selling pressure to accumulate. That pattern has been visible across multiple assets this year, including bitcoin and XRP. For Cardano, the shift suggests whales could use current weakness to build positions, especially if retail continues to capitulate. The crowd-versus-price divergence remains one of crypto’s more reliable short-term trading signals.

Blockchain data shows wallets holding more than 10 million XRP added over 600 million tokens in August alone. Analysts interpret this as a strong signal that large investors see upside potential ahead of a major catalyst: a potential U.S. ETF approval. Historically, whale accumulation has preceded significant rallies, and this activity suggests that $6 XRP may be back on the table sooner than many expected. At the same time, smaller investors searching for exponential ROI are looking toward presale markets, with MAGACOIN FINANCE increasingly seen as a high-beta counterpart to XRP’s institutional-driven momentum. ETF speculation intensifies The possibility of an XRP ETF has dramatically shifted sentiment. Analysts argue that approval could trigger billions in inflows, replicating the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year. Ripple’s growing partnerships with banks and payment providers further strengthen the case, demonstrating that XRP is more than speculative – it’s embedded in cross-border payment infrastructure. Technical picture strengthens On the charts, XRP has maintained support above $5.10, consolidating before its next move. Analysts highlight that a breakout above $5.60 could unlock momentum buying, paving the way for $6. RSI indicators remain balanced, suggesting room for growth. With whale buying underpinning technicals, the conditions align for a significant rally. XRP whales are building positions ahead of ETF decisions, signaling conviction. Retail investors, meanwhile, are chasing the presales that could multiply portfolios. A projected 70x multiplier has made MAGACOIN FINANCE a presale darling , with momentum building across major Telegram groups. Its dual audits from CertiK and HashEx provide rare legitimacy, separating it from meme coins that thrive on hype alone. Analysts say whale flows into XRP mirror retail flows into MAGACOIN FINANCE, both driven by expectations of outsized returns. As ETF approvals shape XRP’s future, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping its own as the high-beta presale defining 2025’s retail frenzy. Building a balanced portfolio Analysts stress that combining XRP’s utility-driven adoption with MAGACOIN FINANCE’s cultural-driven momentum allows portfolios to capture both institutional and retail dynamics. XRP provides stability and regulatory clarity, while MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers the exponential upside that only presales can offer. Conclusion With whales accumulating and ETF approval potentially around the corner, XRP’s $6 target is back in focus . But retail energy is gravitating toward presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its 70x projections and audit-backed legitimacy. Together, these assets highlight the dual forces – institutional and retail – that are shaping the 2025 cycle.

Today’s buyers want projects that combine real-world use, easy access, and long-term growth. While legacy coins like XRP and Chainlink continue to make the news, their pace is slowing as regulatory headwinds and scaling limits weigh them down. BlockDAG is taking a different path, turning the crypto script on its head. With more than 3 million users mining through its X1 Miner App and nearly $400M raised in presale funding, BlockDAG has also reset its token price to $0.0013 during the BDAG Deployment Event a move designed to ensure fairness and accessibility by replacing bonus tiers with one flat rate. This shift from passive speculation to active participation makes it one of the most compelling projects in today’s market. Chainlink: Strong for Enterprises, Weak for Retail Chainlink (LINK) is cementing its position in enterprise adoption with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 certifications, along with partnerships involving SWIFT, ICE, and J.P. Morgan. Recently, LINK surged over 12% to $27.80 on whale accumulation and higher trading volumes. After consolidating near $24, this breakout signaled renewed interest among larger holders. Yet Chainlink has not introduced simple tools like mobile mining apps or retail-friendly staking systems, unlike newer projects that thrive on participation. This lack of direct engagement for everyday users limits LINK’s ability to maintain momentum in a competitive space where platforms with millions of active participants are setting new standards. Although Chainlink remains vital in data infrastructure for blockchains, it struggles to keep pace with rivals that are focused on building accessible ecosystems. In a market where user adoption drives valuation, its limited outreach leaves retail audiences on the sidelines. XRP Settles After SEC Case But Retail Growth Lags XRP’s long battle with the SEC has finally ended, with both parties dropping their appeals. The outcome keeps the original ruling in place, along with a $125 million fine and an injunction. While this provides legal clarity, it has not ignited retail excitement. XRP is trading between $2.94 and $2.95, according to TradingView, with little sign of a breakout. Though institutional players remain engaged and Ripple continues to focus on banking solutions, XRP has not developed tools that invite mass participation. Key features such as accessible staking, retail-friendly mining, or a thriving dApp ecosystem are still absent. This leaves XRP heavily dependent on its role in cross-border payments rather than community-driven growth. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is hitting milestones that highlight genuine traction, such as 3 million users on its mining app, making XRP’s limited retail reach even more striking. Without ecosystem expansion, XRP risks falling behind projects actively driving adoption. BlockDAG X1 Miner Hits 3M Users & Accelerates Growth BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has crossed 3 million active users, turning crypto mining into something anyone can do from a smartphone. By removing expensive hardware from the equation, it has made mining widely accessible, showing that mass adoption is not an ambition but a reality. BlockDAG’s presale has now reached nearly $400M, with the token price reset to $0.0013 under the new flat-rate model from the BDAG Deployment Event. This adjustment simplified access for buyers while ensuring equal opportunity across the board. At its core, BlockDAG operates on a hybrid Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) framework. This design enables speeds of up to 15,000 transactions per second while maintaining the reliability of PoW validation. Unlike traditional blockchains, its parallel architecture ensures faster throughput without compromising security or decentralization. BlockDAG’s broader ecosystem is also expanding fast. Over 19,300 X-series mining rigs, including the X10, X30, and X100, are already in use. More than 4,500 developers are actively building on the network, powering over 300 decentralized applications. Tools like Dashboard V4 and the BlockDAG Academy enhance transparency and user education, boosting trust and adoption at every level. Key Insights Chainlink continues to evolve its oracle services and XRP holds its position in institutional payments, but neither has matched the tangible adoption milestones that excite today’s buyers. Neither has reached the scale or accessibility of BlockDAG, whose X1 App has already surpassed 3 million users and whose presale reset to $0.0013 reflects a fairer model for all participants. With nearly $400M raised, over 25.5 billion coins sold, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem, BlockDAG stands apart.

Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally MemeCore’s Meteoric Rise According to reports, M hit a fresh all-time high of $1.69 Friday before easing back to $1.60, while 24-hour volume climbed past $53 million. At the time of writing, M was up 250% in the weekly timeframe, data from Coingecko shows. That follows July lows near $0.036, a move that translates into roughly a 3,750% gain in about 90 days. Traders piled in quickly. A lot of money followed. Market Moves Outpaced Fundamentals Price action has been wild. Momentum indicators show parabolic behavior and the RSI has flashed extreme overbought readings, signaling the run may be stretched. Based on technicals, the token has swept through resistance levels since mid-August and is trading in territory where a fast reversal is possible. Some traders say M is being propelled by hype and big marketing plays more than by on-chain usage today. Event-Driven Hype And Community Stunts Reports have disclosed that MemeCore rented Seoul’s Lotte World for the final night of Korea Blockchain Week, an attention-grabbing move that pushed social interest higher. The project pitches itself as the first Layer-1 built for meme culture and uses a Proof of Meme consensus model alongside community-focused tokenomics. Those features have been shouted about in the community, and they help explain why momentum traders have shown up in force. Bulls Point To Network Story; Bears Point To Liquidity Risk Supporters highlight the promise of a meme-driven economy as reasons for continued upside. If consolidation holds above $1, a push toward $2 is floated by optimistic traders. But risks are clear. If $1 support gives way, liquidation cascades could accelerate downside toward $0.40–$0.50. Liquidity outside major centralized exchanges looks thin, and event-driven spikes can reverse quickly. Memecore Price Forecast And Sentiment Snapshot Meanwhile, based on current projections, MemeCore’s price is predicted to fall by 23% to about $1.19 by October 5, 2025. Market sentiment is still labeled Bullish by some indicators, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at 48, which is neutral.

The firm plans to deploy the fund’s proceeds to purchase BTC over the next six months. Sora Ventures Launches Massive Bitcoin Treasury Fund Speaking at Taipei Blockchain Week, Sora Ventures announced its goal of raising up to $1 billion for BTC acquisitions within the next six months. The firm has already secured $200 million in initial commitments from regional partners. Sora’s new fund follows the trend of individual Bitcoin treasury firms that have gained prominence in Asia over the past year or so, such as Japan’s Metaplanet , Hong Kong’s Moon Inc., Thai firm DV8, and South Korea-based BitPlanet, to name a few. However, unlike the aforementioned firms – which hold BTC directly on their balance sheets – Sora’s treasury fund will operate as a central pool of institutional capital. Its dual purpose is to support existing Bitcoin treasury firms and foster the development of similar entities worldwide. The fund seeks to position Bitcoin as a global reserve asset by creating synergies between Asian and international treasury players. To achieve this, Sora’s management team plans to onboard additional institutional partners. Sora’s strategy underscores the shift in Bitcoin adoption from North America toward Asia. While companies like Strategy – formerly MicroStrategy – have led BTC adoption in North America, Asia is increasingly becoming a focal point. Jason Fang, founder and Managing Partner at Sora Ventures, commented: Asia has been one of the most important markets for the development of blockchain technology and Bitcoin. We have seen a rise in interest from institutions investing in Bitcoin treasuries in the US and EU, while in Asia efforts have been relatively fragmented. This is the first time in history that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage. Notably, Sora Ventures has previously backed this trend. In 2024, the firm invested in Metaplanet to support its $6.5 million BTC allocation, and earlier this year, it acquired both Moon Inc. and DV8. Will BTC Rise In The Coming Months? Sora’s announcement of a near $1 billion Bitcoin purchase has reignited bullish sentiment, with many expecting fresh all-time highs. To recall, BTC’s most recent peak was $124,128 on August 14. Meanwhile, total BTC holdings of publicly-listed companies recently surpassed 1 million BTC, highlighting growing institutional confidence in the asset as a store of value. With Sora’s initiative, this figure is expected to rise even further. Adding to the momentum, recent reports suggest that institutional adoption is accelerating so quickly that Bitcoin miners are struggling to meet demand. At press time, BTC trades at $110,852, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|asia|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|DV8|Metaplanet|north america|Sora Ventures|Taipei blockchain week,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 04:00:30

With the broader crypto market heating up and investor optimism on the rise, ADA has become a key focus among altcoins with strong fundamentals. At the same time, investors are seeking additional opportunities beyond ADA, with many diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-growing project gaining traction ahead of altcoin season. ADA’s Position in the Market Cardano has steadily positioned itself as one of the top blockchain networks, backed by strong community support and ongoing development. Analysts suggest that ADA’s low transaction costs and ecosystem growth could drive renewed demand as the bull market matures. Despite facing resistance at key levels, sentiment around ADA remains bullish as long as Bitcoin maintains upward momentum. Technical and Fundamental Catalysts Several factors could contribute to ADA’s climb: Expanding use cases for smart contracts Strong developer activity within its ecosystem Increasing network participation and staking growth Broader market inflows as institutional players explore altcoins If these conditions align with a favorable macro environment, ADA’s price could realistically challenge the $5 target, potentially delivering significant upside for holders. The Project that Captures Early Investors While ADA looks promising, smart money is also moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project already generating buzz with its early-stage sellouts and rapid community expansion. Analysts are comparing its momentum to early-stage giants like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN, but with more real utility backing its growth. Early projections highlight that a $10,00 allocation could potentially grow into $50,000 or more , making it one of the most sought-after plays before altseason fully kicks in. The Road Ahead for ADA ADA’s path to $5 won’t be without challenges, with potential hurdles including regulatory shifts, Bitcoin dominance, and competition from rival Layer-1 networks. Still, if the market maintains its bullish structure, Cardano could see its strongest rally in years. For investors, combining established altcoins like ADA with emerging opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE could be a strategy to maximize potential returns in this cycle. Conclusion Cardano’s possible push toward $5 highlights its resilience and growth potential in the ongoing bull market. However, the spotlight is also shifting toward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offers high-risk, high-reward potential for early participants. Both established and emerging tokens could play a vital role for investors aiming to capture the biggest gains before the bull cycle ends.

Cybersecurity firm HiddenLayer disclosed Thursday that attackers can weaponize a so-called “CopyPasta License Attack” to inject hidden instructions into common developer files. The exploit primarily affects Cursor, an AI-powered coding tool that Coinbase engineers said in August was among the team's AI tools. Cursor is said to have been used by “every Coinbase engineer.” How the attack works The technique takes advantage of how AI coding assistants treat licensing files as authoritative instructions. By embedding malicious payloads in hidden markdown comments within files such as LICENSE.txt, the exploit convinces the model that these instructions must be preserved and replicated across every file it touches. Once the AI accepts the “license” as legitimate, it automatically propagates the injected code into new or edited files, spreading without direct user input. This approach sidesteps traditional malware detection because the malicious commands are disguised as harmless documentation, allowing the virus to spread through an entire codebase without a developer’s knowledge. In its report, HiddenLayer researchers demonstrated how Cursor could be tricked into adding backdoors, siphoning sensitive data, or running resource-draining commands — all disguised inside seemingly innocuous project files. “Injected code could stage a backdoor, silently exfiltrate sensitive data or manipulate critical files,” the firm said. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on Thursday that AI had written up to 40% of the exchange’s code, with a goal of reaching 50% by next month. However, Armstrong clarified that AI-assisted coding at Coinbase is concentrated in user interface and non-sensitive backends, with “complex and system-critical systems” adopting more slowly. 'Potentially malicious' Even so, the optics of a virus targeting Coinbase’s preferred tool amplified industry criticism. AI prompt injections are not new, but the CopyPasta method advances the threat model by enabling semi-autonomous spread. Instead of targeting a single user, infected files become vectors that compromise every other AI agent that reads them, creating a chain reaction across repositories. Compared to earlier AI “worm” concepts like Morris II , which hijacked email agents to spam or exfiltrate data, CopyPasta is more insidious because it leverages trusted developer workflows. Instead of requiring user approval or interaction, it embeds itself in files that every coding agent naturally references. Where Morris II fell short due to human checks on email activity, CopyPasta thrives by hiding inside documentation that developers rarely scrutinize. Security teams are now urging organizations to scan files for hidden comments and review all AI-generated changes manually. “All untrusted data entering LLM contexts should be treated as potentially malicious,” HiddenLayer warned, calling for systematic detection before prompt-based attacks scale further.

Most larger-cap alts have failed to post any significant gains, aside from HYPE, which has jumped to over $47, and ENA, which has risen by 13%. BTC Stopped at $113.5K The primary cryptocurrency tried to break out at the end of the previous business week, but the bears were quick to intercept the move and halt it in its tracks. As such, the asset fell from $113,500 to under $107,500 within a day or so. The following 48 hours were painful as well, as bitcoin failed to recover any of the losses and marked a new multi-week low of $107,100 on September 1. The bulls finally tried to step up at this point, and after some shaky performance, drove BTC out of this local bottom to over $111,500 by Tuesday. Another rejection followed suit, but this time it was less painful, and bitcoin slipped to $109,000. The asset went on the offensive once again on Friday, surging toward $113,500 after a weak jobs report in the US. That was another short-lived rally, though, as BTC lost almost all gains immediately in a drop to $110,400, which left over $300 million in liquidations. It has calmed at around $111,000 ever since, with its market cap at just over $2.2 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts at 56.5%. BTCUSD.

ENA follows suit, with a 13% surge that has taken it to $0.73. PUMP and HYPE are next, with 10% and 4.5%, respectively.

IT ‘Oopsie’ Wipes Gensler’s Texts The SEC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) has shared the final report detailing the findings of its review of the Office of Information Technology’s (IOT) actions that led to the loss of former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s text messages between 2022 and 2023. According to the September 3 report, the OIT implemented a “poorly understood and automated policy” in August 2023 that caused “an enterprise wipe of Gensler’s government-issued mobile device.” Seemingly, Gensler’s government-issued device was erroneously flagged as inactive and had not been backed up for nearly a year. OIT “hastily performed a factory reset,” which deleted text messages stored on the device and the device’s operating system logs between October 18, 2022, and September 6, 2023. The incident was worsened after a series of “additional OIT actions, deficiencies, and missed opportunities, including a lack of backups and procedures that failed to consider record retention requirements for Capstone officials (such as Gensler),” the report explained. The regulatory agency reportedly worked to recover or recreate the deleted text messages but was “unable to collect or determine the entire universe,” including some federal records . The review found that around 38% of the recovered text conversations were mission-related and concerned matters directly involving SEC senior staff and/or Commissioners at the time, making them records. Among the recovered messages, the SEC retrieved a May 2023 conversation involving Gensler, his staff, and the Director of the Division of Enforcement about when the SEC would file an action against certain crypto asset trading platforms and their founders. Crypto Leaders Call Out Prior SEC Leadership On Thursday, crypto industry leaders and participants commented on the previous SEC leadership’s “mistake” and the implications. Nate Geraci, chairman and president of The ETF Store, stated , “Think about everything that happened in crypto during this time. Basically FTX collapse thru Grayscale spot btc ETF lawsuit. Makes you think.” Many noted that the period of the deleted texts also overlaps with part of “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” the SEC’s enforcement actions against multiple crypto exchanges, the release of the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), and anti-crypto policies from other regulatory agencies. In an X threat, Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal criticized the prior leadership for the apparent hypocrisy after “all the lecturing (…) about data preservation. All the haranguing. All the self-righteousness.” The CLO affirmed that “this isn’t some ‘oops’ moment. This was a destruction of evidence relevant to pending litigation.” The IOG report noted that the loss of the former chairman’s text messages may impact the SEC’s response to certain Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. It’s worth noting that Coinbase submitted a FOIA request in March asking how much the regulatory agency had spent on crypto-related enforcement actions. As reported by Bitcoinist, the crypto exchange sought the supporting documentation used to create the current and past annual budget and performance reports. Additionally, it inquired about the number of employees and third-party contractors who worked on these investigations and enforcement actions, and “know more about the previous SEC’s infamous ‘Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit’ within the Enforcement Division.” “We all deserve better, especially from ‘leaders’ who see fit to smear others and cast aspersions so freely,” Grewal concluded.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Coinbase CLO|crypto industry|crypto record|Gary Gensler SEC|Operation Chokepoint 2.0|Paul Grewal|SEC crypto crackdown|US SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 05:00:33

However, just a day after its debut, the token’s price plummeted, sparking intense speculation regarding its major investors, particularly Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain. Alleged Manipulation By Justin Sun Market expert Quinten Francois provided insights into the WLFI launch, which initially priced at $0.20, reaching a market capitalization of $1 billion. Despite the excitement surrounding the launch, which generated billions in trading volume, the token’s value continued to decline. Interestingly, this downturn occurred even as the community seemed to hold onto their tokens rather than sell them. Francois speculated that exchanges might have offloaded part of their holdings, estimated at 2.8%. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts The XRP Price If 10% Of Global Assets Are Tokenized Allegations have surfaced that Justin Sun engaged in dubious tactics by channeling WLFI through his exchange, HTX. He reportedly offered users a 20% annual percentage yield (APY) for depositing WLFI, allowing him to offload a significant portion of his own holdings under the guise of user staking. Allegations suggest that this maneuver not only enabled him to profit from the situation but also that he intended to cover any withdrawals or sell-offs with his own tokens, further complicating retail investors’ returns. As Bitcoinist reported on Thursday, Sun’s alleged manipulation led to the freezing of his wallet address. As a result, there is growing concern among experts that WLFI could ultimately face a trajectory toward zero. Could The WLFI Price Plummet To Zero? In a recent social media post, user OxPunisher outlined the patterns of manipulation associated with Sun, referencing his history of questionable trades between 2018 and 2020, which reportedly resulted in $31 million in illicit profits. This ongoing saga continued into 2024, when Sun withdrew $732 million worth of Bitcoin from USDD collateral, and in late 2024, he invested $30 million into WLFI just as the SEC paused his case, further raising alarms among investors. Related Reading: First US Dogecoin ETF Could Debut Next Week—How Will It Impact Price? The narrative surrounding WLFI appears precarious at best. The expert asserts that without Justin Sun’s liquidity strategies the token’s value could collapse. Moreover, without the backing of high-profile figures like President Donald Trump, the narrative that initially attracted investors may lose its momentum entirely. This situation has led OxPunisher to believe that this situation can result in panic selling and a shift toward safer investment options by the platform’s investors, which could further increase the WLFI’s sell-off and downtrend seen in the past few days.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/institutions-are-quietly-loading-xrp-heres-the-latest/,"X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a well-followed voice in the crypto community, recently highlighted an important development for XRP and its growing institutional presence. Commenting on a corporate filing, he revealed that Monex Group has increased its ownership in 3iQ, the Canadian firm behind the country’s first spot XRP ETF . His remarks reflect the rapid growth of assets managed by the company and the role XRP is playing in its strategy. BREAKING Institutions are loading $XRP exposure, aggressively Monex increased its stake in 3iQ, the same firm behind Canada’s XRP ETF. AUM? Up 39% YoY. XRP? Core to their strategy From $32M→ $50M→ $148M+ in just months Monex isn’t buying shares They’re buying $XRP future pic.twitter.com/cKwJo2MvIA — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) September 4, 2025 Monex Deepens Its Investment in 3iQ On September 4, 2025, Monex Group confirmed that it had acquired additional shares of 3iQ Digital Holdings through its wholly owned subsidiary. The filing shows Monex bought over 4.1 million shares, bringing its total to more than 12.1 million. This move raised Monex’s ownership of voting rights in 3iQ to approximately 97.8%, solidifying its control of the firm. Since Monex became the majority owner in April 2024, 3iQ has broadened its digital asset offerings, including the launch of the Solana ETF in April 2025 and the XRP ETF in June 2025. According to the filing, 3iQ’s assets under management climbed from CAD 1.085 billion at the end of June 2024 to CAD 1.51 billion a year later, reflecting a 39% increase. This growth has been closely tied to the success of its crypto products, with XRP now considered a central part of the portfolio. The XRP ETF’s Strong Early Performance 3iQ launched the XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ) on June 18, 2025, becoming the first of its kind in North America. The ETF debuted with a management fee of 0% for the first six months, offering a unique incentive to attract investors, and from the outset, investor interest was strong. Within a few days, assets under management exceeded CAD 32 million, making it the largest XRP-focused ETF in Canada at the time. Less than a month after launch, the fund had already passed $50 million in client assets. The pace of growth has continued. As of September 3, 2025, the ETF managed over CAD 152 million ($110.3 million). This rapid rise demonstrates that institutional and retail demand for regulated XRP exposure is stronger than many expected.

The expansion of Monex’s stake in 3iQ and the surge in ETF inflows point to a growing recognition of the digital asset’s role in the broader digital asset landscape.

While XRP continues to battle the bears under the $3 price mark amid broader market uncertainty, analyst EGRAG believes the token could prevail in the long run. For context, XRP dropped 25% from its July peak of $3.65 to around $2.7 earlier this month.EGRAG Is Convinced XRP Will Reach Double DigitsDespite having recovered from this low, it still trades below the $3 region, currently changing hands at $2.82. While most analysts believe XRP is capable of recovering from this bearish spell, some like Crypto Rover suggest its next upward push could only reach levels such as $4, which could mark its top.However, EGRAG disagrees with this idea. According to him , if XRP ever recovers from this bearish price action to surpass the previous $3.66 peak, its target for this cycle would be much higher than $4. EGRAG believes it is either $3.66 already marked the cycle top, or XRP still has the potential to reach levels between $22 and $27.Double Bottom Pattern Strengthens this ConvictionNow, in his latest analysis , he presented another technical pattern that strengthens the case for an XRP rally toward the $22 region. Specifically, XRP appears to have already broken out of a multi-year double bottom formation that began as far back as 2018.For the uninitiated, a double bottom structure typically occurs when an asset collapses to a local bottom, recovers from this initial bottom, and then drops to a low level similar to the initial bottom before eventually rebounding to higher levels.With XRP, the formation of the pattern began in early 2018. According to data from EGRAG's chart, XRP formed the first bottom when it slumped from the $3.31 peak in January 2018 to a floor price of $0.1140 in March 2020 before recovering to a high of $1.9669 by April 2021. XRP Double Bottom Structure | EGRAG Crypto Meanwhile, the second bottom structure materialized as XRP dropped from the $1.9669 peak in April 2021 to a low of $0.2870 in June 2022 on the back of the Terra ecosystem implosion, and then rebounded to the $1.95 high by November 2024 amid the broader market uptrend triggered by the U.S. elections .These price movements essentially formed the double bottom structure, with the neckline sitting around $1.95 to $2. XRP eventually broke above the neckline when it soared past $2 in December 2024. This push helped validate the structure, setting the stage for greater heights.XRP Eyeing $22 to $27 TargetHowever, since January 2025, XRP's price action has failed to push forward, forming a months-long parallel channel between $2 and $3.6. EGRAG's chart points out that once XRP breaks above this channel, a rally to higher levels could emerge. The analyst sets the same $22 to $27 target for this imminent break.Meanwhile, in the short term, market watcher Dom recently sounded a warning while analyzing the XRP/USOIL chart. According to him, XRP is currently hanging by a thread, and the bulls need to step in; otherwise, it could drop to 7-month lows.

If you’ve been following the market, you might have noticed a buzz around companies joining forces or acquiring competitors. This isn’t just chatter; the numbers confirm a monumental shift in the industry. What’s Driving This Unprecedented Crypto M&A Boom? According to insights from crypto data analytics firm Messari, the total volume of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the crypto industry has skyrocketed to an astonishing $11.98 billion this year. This figure is more than triple the annual transaction value recorded over the past four years, marking a significant milestone. But what exactly is fueling this remarkable growth in Crypto M&A ? Messari’s analysis points to several key factors that are converging to create this fertile ground for deals: Market Maturation: The crypto industry is no longer in its infancy. Established projects and companies are seeking to consolidate, streamline operations, and expand their market share, leading to more strategic acquisitions. Increased Institutional Investor Interest: Big players from traditional finance are increasingly looking to enter the crypto space. Acquiring existing crypto firms provides a quicker and less risky entry point, bringing significant capital and expertise into the ecosystem. Improved Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape is becoming clearer in many jurisdictions. This reduced uncertainty makes it safer and more attractive for companies to engage in large-scale transactions, fostering confidence in Crypto M&A deals. How Does Crypto M&A Benefit the Ecosystem? This wave of Crypto M&A isn’t just about big numbers; it brings substantial benefits to the entire digital asset ecosystem. When companies merge or acquire others, it often leads to enhanced services, stronger platforms, and greater innovation. Here are some of the positive impacts we are seeing: Innovation and Efficiency: Mergers can combine complementary technologies and teams, leading to faster development of new products and services. This can result in more efficient operations and a better user experience for users and investors alike. Consolidation and Stability: As the market matures, some consolidation is natural. It can lead to fewer, but stronger, players, which might bring more stability and trust to the crypto landscape. This also helps in weeding out less viable projects. Access to Capital and Talent: Acquisitions often provide smaller, innovative companies with the capital and resources they need to scale, while larger entities gain access to specialized talent and cutting-edge technology. This synergy is vital for long-term growth in Crypto M&A . What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Crypto M&A? While the current surge in Crypto M&A is exciting, it’s not without its challenges. Navigating complex legal frameworks, integrating diverse corporate cultures, and valuing intangible digital assets can be intricate processes. However, these challenges also present unique opportunities for growth and refinement within the industry. Looking forward, we can anticipate: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Continued regulatory developments will play a crucial role. Clearer guidelines could further accelerate M&A activity, while fragmented or restrictive policies might pose hurdles. Staying informed on these changes is key for any entity involved in Crypto M&A . Strategic Partnerships: Beyond outright acquisitions, we may see an increase in strategic partnerships and joint ventures, allowing companies to leverage each other’s strengths without full integration. This flexibility can drive innovation in new areas. Focus on Niche Markets: As the crypto space diversifies, M&A activity might increasingly focus on specific niche markets like DeFi, NFTs, or GameFi, where specialized expertise and technology are highly valued. The near $12 billion in Crypto M&A volume this year is a powerful testament to the industry’s rapid evolution and growing significance. It signals a shift from speculative novelty to a more established and integrated financial sector. This trend, driven by market maturity, institutional embrace, and regulatory progress, is reshaping the competitive landscape and paving the way for a more robust and innovative future for digital assets. The journey of crypto is just beginning, and M&A activity is clearly a major part of its next chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Crypto M&A? Crypto M&A refers to mergers and acquisitions within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, where one company acquires another, or two companies combine to form a new entity. These deals involve digital asset companies, platforms, or related service providers. 2. Why is Crypto M&A increasing now? The increase is attributed to market maturation, where the industry is growing beyond its initial speculative phase. Additionally, increased interest from institutional investors and improved regulatory clarity are making these transactions more feasible and attractive. 3. What are the benefits of Crypto M&A for the industry? Benefits include fostering innovation, increasing efficiency through combined resources, consolidating the market for greater stability, and providing access to capital and specialized talent for growing projects. 4. Are there any risks associated with Crypto M&A? Yes, challenges include navigating complex legal and regulatory frameworks, integrating different corporate cultures and technologies, and accurately valuing intangible digital assets. These factors require careful due diligence. 5. What does the future hold for Crypto M&A? The future likely involves continued growth, potentially with a focus on strategic partnerships and niche market acquisitions. Ongoing regulatory developments will significantly shape the pace and direction of future Crypto M&A activity.

While the crypto market has entered a downturn, some investors remain optimistic that the bull run is far from over. Interestingly, as market watchers anticipate higher prices in this cycle, asset manager Bitwise is already projecting Bitcoin's potential price in the next 10 years.Bitwise Predicts Bitcoin to Hit $2.97M in 2035Specifically, in one of its recent reports, Bitwise predicted that Bitcoin could grow to a price between $1.3 million and $2.97 million by 2035, a decade from now. According to the report, in a base case scenario, the Bitcoin price would trade at $1,306,740 by 2035. Meanwhile, it could reach as high as $2.97 million in a bull case.With Bitcoin currently changing hands at around $111,000, either of the two cases would translate to an impressive growth for the premier crypto asset over the next decade. However, what's more exciting is how this could impact the broader crypto market, spilling into altcoins like XRP.This is typically due to the correlation between Bitcoin and the crypto market. This correlation can be a bittersweet experience for altcoins, as they usually drop with Bitcoin during market uncertainties , but appreciate with the firstborn crypto when it stages a recovery campaign. As a result, Bitwise's future outlook for Bitcoin bodes well for altcoins, especially top ones like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, which remain closely aligned with Bitcoin. For instance, data from Macroaxis shows that Bitcoin and XRP have a near-perfect correlation coefficient of 0.91 over the past three months. Bitcoin and XRP Price Correlation Macroaxis Bitcoin and XRP Price Correlation | Macroaxis Notably, this shows that both assets have moved together within this period, showing almost no diversification. If this pattern persists over the years and Bitcoin hits $2.97 million, XRP will likely claim higher prices. For context, Bitcoin would need to surge 2,575% from its current price to reach the $2.97 million target from Bitwise .Possible XRP Price if BTC Hits $2.97MToday, XRP trades for $2.83. If it replicates a similar 2,575% upsurge, the price will rise to $75.7, marking a new all-time peak. However, it is unlikely that XRP will trail Bitcoin's price movements so closely due to the slight deviations both assets face during these rallies. Specifically, XRP often surges at a higher pace during periods of market growth. For instance, over the past three months, while both assets have had a close price correlation, Bitcoin is up 6%. Meanwhile, XRP has gained by a massive 30%, outperforming BTC by exactly 5x.Supposing this deviation in price performance drops to around 2x in the future, XRP would soar to a price of $151.4 when Bitcoin claims a $2.97 million value. Interestingly, Telegaon analysts expect XRP to surpass this $151 price level, but they predict this could happen in 2040, five years later.

Indeed, in a crowded market filled with so many projects, answering that question is hard. However, analysts’ spotlight on Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) has pushed them to the forefront of the conversations as breakout altcoin contenders. While leaders like Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate headlines, investors’ attention is already shifting to DOT and AVAX. In this conversation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also surfacing as part of a growing list of top altcoin opportunities to watch in Q4 2025. Polkadot Shows Steady Progress Polkadot has rolled out several ecosystem updates in recent weeks. The creation of Polkadot Capital Group aims to bring more institutional adoption, while Gavin Wood’s return as CEO has energized developers. The Polkadot 2.0 upgrades, already showing testnet speeds of 143,000 transactions per second, give the network a technical edge. Despite its current range near $3.80, Polkadot price prediction points to $10 as a possible year-end target. Government-backed tokenization projects and new staking rewards are also fueling interest. For now, DOT remains an undervalued Layer 0 asset with plenty of room to grow. Avalanche Expands Real-World Utility Avalanche continues to add real-world use cases. Visa has integrated AVAX for stablecoin payments, giving it a foothold in global finance. Daily transactions jumped 170% year over year, fueled by gaming, NFTs, and tokenized assets. The network also reduced fees by more than 40% and plans further scalability upgrades later this year. Avalanche forecast shows short-term stability between $23 and $25, with bullish targets above $60 if adoption accelerates. Institutional funds and staking demand reinforce Avalanche’s role as one of the more utility-driven blockchains in 2025. A Rising Altcoin Contender Rises on Analysts’ Watchlists MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising on analysts’ radar as an undervalued pick for investors seeking high ROI altcoins in 2025. The project is an early-stage project with a lot of traction and more room to grow in the coming years. Experts spotlighting the token say its low entry price makes it a compelling pick for retail and whale investors. Already, a growing segment of the crypto market is rapidly accumulating the token ahead of the market recovery. With analysts’ coverage increasing and demand going through the roof, the token may be one of the best crypto investments to hold in 2025. Outlook DOT and AVAX are positioned as two of the undervalued gems for investors. The two tokens continue to benefit from growing adoption and evolving upgrades. The forecast for the two tokens suggests higher upside play in 2025 should the bear pressure reduce. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains firmly in the spotlight as the hidden gem that is reshaping the altcoin market. For investors hunting for top altcoin opportunities this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE, DOT, and AVAX are the names to keep on your radar.

The launch adds to Itaú’s growing crypto lineup, complementing its Bitcoin ETF and retirement plan with digital-asset exposure. Ex-Hashdex executive João Marco Braga da Cunha will oversee the new unit. He even commented, “The crypto asset segment has unique characteristics for generating alpha. It’s a relatively new market that creates major opportunities due to its volatility.” Itau’s new crypto arm will focus on bond-like products Itaú Asset lets users directly trade 10 crypto pairs via its mobile platform, featuring assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and USD Coin, while providing in-house custody. Now, the firm is expanding its crypto division , saying its new crypto unit will work on solutions, including bond-like products as well as higher-volatility plays like derivatives and staking-based vehicles. It will also function under Itaú Asset’s mutual funds structure, which manages upwards of 117 billion reais across 15 desks. So far, Itaú has appointed Cunha, who previously directed portfolio management at Hashdex, to run the division, supervising the development of fixed-income-style products and higher-risk crypto strategies. His experience with ETFs and funds positions him well to shape offerings for Brazil’s emerging crypto market. Brazil ranks 10th in global crypto adoption Brazil has taken to crypto products in the last few months. Chainalysis places Brazil in 10th place in its 2024 ranking of global crypto adoption. The country’s crypto momentum is primarily backed by government policy. In 2023, it rolled out a nationwide crypto law, creating a framework for virtual asset companies and assigning regulatory authority to the central bank. Itaú Unibanco even introduced crypto trading for individual investors in December 2023, shortly after the law took effect, initially supporting Bitcoin and Ether. Brazil’s securities regulator also authorized the nation’s debut spot XRP ETF from Hashdex in February 2025. Soon after, Braza Bank announced a project to release a real-linked stablecoin using the XRP Ledger. At that time, Marcelo Sacomori, the CEO of Braza Group, noted the stablecoin would be a game-changer for global financial markets. Created for foreign currency payments, the asset is tailored to increase the stability and effectiveness of cross-border operations. The Latin country is already emerging as a case study in how a clear regulatory framework can integrate crypto into traditional banking systems. Itaú’s ability to launch compliant custody services also reassures investors and signals the industry’s maturation. Combined with rising adoption rates across Latin America, this momentum positions Brazil as a hub for crypto innovation and a magnet for future investment. However, despite progress, there are still open questions around regulation. In June, Brazil overhauled its tax rules, scrapping the progressive system in favor of a flat 17.5% tax on crypto capital gains. The reform also removed the long-standing rule that allowed up to 35,000 reais ($6,500) in monthly tax-free sales and broadened taxation to cover self-custody, offshore assets, DeFi activity, NFTs, and staking rewards. The executive order drew swift criticism and was repealed before the month ended. Get seen where it counts.

Stablecoin Exchange Reserve Has Witnessed A Rise Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has talked about the latest trend in the combined Exchange Reserve of the Ethereum and Tron-based stablecoins . The “ Exchange Reserve ” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset or group of assets that’s sitting in wallets connected to centralized exchanges. Generally, one of the main reasons why investors deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, so the supply present on them may be looked at as a measure of the “available sell supply” of the cryptocurrency. When Bitcoin or another volatile coin observes an increase in this supply, it’s naturally a bearish sign for its price. The same, however, isn’t true in the case of stablecoins, as they are, by definition, stable around the $1 mark. Instead, inflows of these fiat-tied tokens may actually be a bullish sign for the market. Investors usually park their capital in the form of stables when they temporarily want to avoid volatile markets. Once they have decided it’s time to switch back, they deposit to exchanges and swap into BTC or whatever desired asset. Because of this role of stables, they are sometimes considered as the buy-side liquidity of the sector. Now, here is a chart that shows how the Exchange Reserve has changed for the different ETH and TRON-based stablecoins over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the stablecoins have seen their Exchange Reserve surge recently, implying there has been demand for depositing these tokens into exchange custody. The latest growth has mainly been driven by the two largest stables, USDC and USDT. Following these recent net inflows, the indicator has been able to set a new record of around $68 billion. As for how the various platforms compare in their share of this liquidity, the below chart shared by CryptoQuant breaks it down. From the graph, it’s visible that Binance holds the largest share of the indicator at $44.2 billion (67%). The next largest platform is OKX, having a reserve of just $9 billion. These two exchanges have been the main platforms behind the recent growth in stablecoin liquidity. Over the past month, Binance and OKX have seen stablecoin net inflows of $2.2 billion and $800 million, respectively. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin has failed another attempt at recovery as its price has slumped back down to the $110,700 mark.",Stablecoin|binance|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Stablecoin Exchange Reserve|Stablecoin Liquidity|Stablecoins|Stables,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 06:00:02

Avalanche (AVAX) has been stuck in sideways trading, while Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to gain traction but remains in consolidation. Both projects attract attention, yet neither is offering the blend of community growth, security, and visibility now seen in BlockDAG (BDAG) . BlockDAG presale has now almost hit $400M, sold more than 26 billion coins, and seen over $7.8 million in miner sales with 19,600 miners purchased. Its 25% referral bonus is drawing new participants daily. Alongside independent audits, this approach is shaping BlockDAG as the top crypto to buy right now, while AVAX and HYPE struggle with market clarity. Hyperliquid’s Record Trading Volume but Lingering Uncertainty Hyperliquid has made waves in decentralized trading by setting a daily record of $29 billion in volume. Over the past year, it has processed more than $1.57 trillion in trades. In Q2 2025 alone, revenue crossed $300 million, confirming strong growth. July’s monthly volume reached $319 billion, up 47% from the prior month. Daily fees of $7.7 million continue to support regular buybacks of HYPE, strengthening the system. Whale activity has been part of this rise too, with one major order involving $21 million USDC on a long position at $45. As a result, HYPE’s market value has grown past $10 billion. Institutional confidence is also visible. HYLQ Strategy Corp. holds 30,000 HYPE as part of its reserves. Analysts are now discussing mid-term price targets ranging from $75 to $100, though market caution remains. Avalanche’s Technical Hesitation Limits Momentum Avalanche is currently priced near $23 and continues to move within a tight range. It has been trading between $16 support and $26 resistance for months. Each attempt to push past $26 has failed, leaving AVAX unable to build steady momentum. Short-term charts also show doji candles, reflecting trader indecision. Technically, AVAX sits above its 21-day SMA, a line acting as short-term support. If selling pressure pushes below $21, the next stops could be $20 or even $16. On the other side, holding support and clearing $26 could spark a move toward $36. This stalled chart has left many cautious. Despite a strong development base, Avalanche lacks near-term excitement, especially when compared with projects like BlockDAG that are showing measurable traction. BlockDAG’s Referral Bonus, Major Deployment Event & Security Edge While AVAX shows hesitation and HYPE consolidates, BlockDAG is building strength through measurable adoption, clear incentives, and security focus. The 25% referral bonus is one of its strongest features. It rewards both referrers and new buyers, creating a system where growth is organic and transparent. Unlike short-term campaigns often seen in the market, this setup is built for lasting impact. Moreover, BlockDAG is ready to host a major Deployment Event in Singapore. After withdrawing from Token2049 due to local restrictions on presale promotions, the team opted to launch its own flagship event. Additionally, despite being priced at $0.03 in Batch 30 of its presale, BlockDAG has introduced a new special price of $0.0013 per BDAG until October 1. This rate will remain in effect for the final 30 days leading up to deployment. Security has been treated as a top priority. Independent audits by CertiK and Halborn confirmed the network’s protection measures. Multi-signature systems and parallel Proof-of-Work have been implemented to prevent risks. These safeguards aim to reassure participants in a market often shaken by breaches. Alongside these efforts, BlockDAG’s presale has now raised almost $400M, sold 26 billion coins, and logged $7.8 million in miner sales with more than 19,600 units sold. Early backers from Batch 1, priced at $0.001, have already seen 2,900% ROI. These combined elements show why BlockDAG is gaining ground as the top crypto to buy right now. Key Takeaway Avalanche remains locked in a sideways pattern, with resistance at $26 holding back any breakout. Hyperliquid has posted record trading volume and growing revenue, yet it still faces uncertainty as consolidation continues. BlockDAG, however, is progressing with a clear plan. It has sold more than 26 billion coins, nearly raised $400 million in presale, and sold 19,600 miners with revenue over $7.8 million. Its 25% referral bonus continues to expand its community, while the upcoming deployment event creates massive hype. Independent audits and built-in security measures add another layer of trust. This three-part foundation of incentives, global visibility, and protection places BlockDAG ahead of both AVAX and HYPE. In the race for the top crypto to buy right now, BlockDAG is proving itself as the leader.

At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.216, up 0.34% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Safe Haven Split: Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Turns Negative For First Time In 6 Months Analysts highlight the emergence of a bullish cup-and-handle pattern with an initial target of $0.30, but the long-term projections are even more ambitious, pointing toward a potential 850% rally to $2 if momentum accelerates. A recent whale transfer of 900 million DOGE ($200 million) to Binance temporarily triggered selling pressure, but strong buying support quickly stabilized prices. This recovery is seen by many traders as a sign of institutional and retail. Technical Patterns Hint at Breakout Potential Dogecoin’s technical indicators paint a mixed but promising picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 47, suggesting neutral momentum and leaving room for an upward push. While DOGE trades below short-term moving averages (7, 20, and 50-day), it remains above its 200-day SMA at $0.20, a sign of long-term structural strength. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) still shows mild bearish momentum, but signals of stabilization around $0.21 hint at a potential reversal. Meanwhile, Bollinger Bands indicate DOGE is trading near the lower range, with room to test $0.24 resistance. A confirmed breakout above $0.24 could unlock the path toward $0.30 and, eventually, higher levels if market sentiment improves. DOGE's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Analysts Eye $2 Dogecoin “Super Rally” September could prove decisive for DOGE. Crypto strategists believe the defense of $0.21 support may be the catalyst for a parabolic rally. If bullish momentum sustains, the cup-and-handle breakout pattern could evolve into a multi-stage rally, with $0.30 as the short-term target and $2 as the ultimate bull case scenario. Beyond technicals, regulatory optimism is adding fuel. With the U.S. SEC nearing decisions on crypto ETF approvals, including a potential Dogecoin ETF, analysts see institutional inflows as a major accelerant for future price action.

In its X post , Grayscale marked the first anniversary of the XRP Trust, an investment vehicle that enables accredited investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly purchasing the token.The post highlighted XRP’s strengths, noting that it is the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which is known for its speed and low-cost payments. XRP History on Grayscale For context, Grayscale first introduced the XRP Trust in March 2018, offering accredited investors structured exposure to XRP through a private placement. However, the asset manager dissolved the Trust in January 2021 due to the challenging market conditions stemming from the Ripple case. Following the release of the final judgment, which gave Ripple a partial victory over the SEC, Grayscale relaunched its XRP Trust in September 2024. Strong Performance as NAV Soars Over 400% It has been one year since the company relaunched the investment vehicle. Notably, the Grayscale XRP Trust has recorded an impressive performance since its relaunch a year ago. In just one year, the Trust’s net asset value (NAV) per share has surged from its initial $10.85 to the current rate of $55.79, marking a 414% increase. As of September 5, the NAV had spiked 2.50% compared to the previous day’s value. Data from Grayscale shows that the company has issued approximately 301,500 shares to investors in the Trust, with each share representing roughly 19.5 XRP. At press time, the Trust had an AUM of $16.82 million. Grayscale XRP Trust performance Grayscale XRP Trust performance Spot ETF Move Despite the remarkable performance of the XRP Trust, Grayscale is pushing to convert the product into a spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). In January, it filed an S-1 document with the SEC to facilitate this conversion. This comes several months after Grayscale successfully converted its Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts into spot ETFs. Now, the company is attempting to do the same for XRP, with shares of the ETF expected to launch on the Nasdaq once approved. However, the SEC has delayed its decision on its potential approval. Recently, Grayscale updated its application to allow authorized participants to redeem and create the ETF shares in XRP, cash, or in-kind. In the meantime, the SEC has a final deadline of October 2025 to decide whether to approve or disapprove Grayscale’s request to convert the XRP Trust into a spot ETF.",Market|Grayscale Crypto News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-09-06 06:06:57

According to Wedson, while BTC prices remain high, miners' earnings are still well below the peaks in 2017 and 2021. Wedson argued that miners have had to invest more in modern equipment due to the rising hash rate, while on-chain transaction volumes have remained low since 2022. He stated that this situation has created additional pressure on the sector. The analyst announced the development of a new indicator called the Mining Equilibrium Index (MEI) to measure mining profitability. The MEI is calculated by comparing the 30-day average revenue/hash ratio with the 365-day average: Above 1.0: above average conditions Below 0.5: associated with stressful conditions, capitulation, or hash rate adjustments. Related News: BREAKING: The Platform Previously Targeted by Germany Is Allegedly Still Holding Over $5 Billion in Bitcoin According to updated data shared by Wedson, the index currently stands at 1.06. While this level is well above the critical 0.5, it's still far from the 2.5 peaks seen in 2017 and 2021. Wedson said the key question for 2025 is whether mining companies can continue to secure the Bitcoin network despite increased competition and operational costs (including employee expenses, electricity, and infrastructure). According to the analyst, miners may be forced to sell some of their reserves if profitability doesn't cover expenses. *This is not investment advice.

One of the most insightful metrics for gauging immediate sentiment is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio . This crucial indicator reveals whether traders are predominantly betting on Bitcoin’s price to rise (long) or fall (short) on major exchanges. Unpacking the Current BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio offers a snapshot of trader positioning, reflecting the collective bullish or bearish bias. When the long percentage is higher, it suggests optimism; conversely, a higher short percentage points to a more cautious or pessimistic outlook. This ratio is derived from the aggregated data across various trading platforms. Currently, the overall 24-hour long/short position ratios for BTC perpetual futures on the world’s top three crypto futures exchanges by open interest present a nuanced picture: Overall: Long 49.72% / Short 50.28% This slight lean towards short positions globally indicates a marginally bearish sentiment among derivatives traders at present. It suggests that, on average, more participants are anticipating a potential downturn or consolidation for Bitcoin. A Closer Look at Top Exchange Data for BTC Perpetual Futures While the overall ratio provides a general sense, examining individual exchange data offers deeper insights into the specific trading behaviors on each platform. Differences can arise due to varying user bases, regional preferences, or even platform-specific events. Here’s how the top exchanges stack up for the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio : Binance: Long 49.23% / Short 50.77% Bybit: Long 50.53% / Short 49.47% Gate.io: Long 48.6% / Short 51.4% Noticeable variations exist. Binance and Gate.io show a stronger bearish bias, with short positions outweighing long positions. Interestingly, Bybit stands out with a slightly bullish tilt, where long positions are marginally dominant. These differences highlight the importance of not just looking at aggregated data, but also understanding the dynamics of specific trading environments. Why Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Matter to Traders? For savvy traders, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio isn’t just a number; it’s a vital tool for market analysis. It can act as a sentiment indicator, helping you understand the prevailing mood among professional and retail derivatives traders. When the market is heavily skewed in one direction, it can sometimes signal a potential reversal. However, it’s crucial to remember that this ratio is just one piece of the puzzle. Overly bullish or bearish sentiment can sometimes lead to crowded trades, making the market vulnerable to sudden liquidations or short squeezes. Therefore, traders often combine this ratio with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for a more comprehensive view. Navigating Market Sentiment with BTC Perpetual Futures Data How can you effectively use this data? Consider the current scenario: an overall slight lean towards shorts. This might suggest caution, but also potential opportunities. If the market continues to drop, short positions could profit. Conversely, if Bitcoin shows unexpected strength, a ‘short squeeze’ could occur, forcing short sellers to buy back, which in turn fuels price increases. Monitoring the changes in the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio over time is equally important. A sudden shift from heavily long to heavily short, or vice versa, often precedes significant price movements. This actionable insight empowers traders to anticipate potential shifts and adjust their strategies accordingly, leading to more informed decisions. The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio serves as a powerful barometer for market sentiment, offering valuable insights into the collective positioning of derivatives traders. While the current data points to a slightly bearish lean overall, individual exchange dynamics present a more detailed picture. By integrating this metric with other analytical tools, traders can gain a significant edge in navigating the often-unpredictable cryptocurrency markets. Stay informed and make data-driven decisions to enhance your trading strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio indicate? The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio indicates the proportion of long (buy) positions versus short (sell) positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts. A ratio above 1 suggests more longs, indicating bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 suggests more shorts, indicating bearish sentiment. Why is the long/short ratio different across exchanges? Differences arise because each exchange has its own user base, liquidity pools, and regional trading preferences. While they often follow similar trends, their specific ratios can vary due to unique trading activity on their platforms. Can the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio predict price movements? While it’s a strong sentiment indicator, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is not a standalone predictor of price movements. Extreme ratios can sometimes signal potential reversals, but it’s best used in conjunction with other technical analysis, on-chain data, and fundamental factors. What are perpetual futures contracts? Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they use a funding rate mechanism to keep the contract price close to the spot price of the underlying asset. How often is this long/short ratio data updated? This data is typically updated frequently, often every few hours or even in real-time by data providers, to reflect the constantly changing market sentiment and trader positions.

Here’s Why October 2025 is the Date,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-15-20-heres-why-october-2025-is-the-date/,"Diana (@InvestWithD), a crypto enthusiast and XRP advocate, recently shared an analysis suggesting that mid-October 2025 could be a defining moment for XRP. Diana’s argument is based on historical cycles, Bitcoin’s halving timelines, and the removal of regulatory restrictions that previously limited XRP’s performance. The Bitcoin Halving Blueprint Diana began her analysis by recalling the 2017 cycle. She explained that Bitcoin’s halving took place on July 9, 2016, with its peak occurring on December 18, 2017, exactly 527 days later. XRP’s cycle top followed just 18 days afterward on January 5, 2018. According to her, “Bitcoin runs first. XRP detonates right after.” The next halving in May 2020 appeared to continue the cycle when Bitcoin peaked on November 10, 2021, 548 days later. However, Diana pointed out that XRP did not follow its usual trajectory, but topped out in April 2021 due to pressure from the SEC lawsuit . Diana argues that the upcoming cycle is fundamentally different. With the SEC lawsuit now over and Ripple pushing forward with new initiatives such as ETFs, RLUSD, and the Thunes partnership , she claims that “the shackles are gone,” and XRP is once again positioned to follow the original timing model. XRP TO $15–$20? HISTORY SAYS OCT 2025 IS THE DATE History, math, and the end of SEC suppression all point to one window: mid-October 2025. This could be XRP’s most savage run yet — let’s break it down. pic.twitter.com/RJ6Z85b6pz — Diana (@InvestWithD) September 4, 2025 The Cycle Math and Potential Targets Using the same calculation that aligned with the 2017 peak, Diana projected the next cycle. She noted that 2024’s Bitcoin halving sets up for a Bitcoin top on September 29, 2025, exactly 527 days later. If the 2017 pattern repeats, XRP would peak 18 days later on October 17, 2025. According to Diana, a conservative outlook would see XRP in the $5 to $7 range. Her base case places XRP between $10 and $15, driven by ETF inflows and growing utility narratives. She also left room for a more aggressive possibility, suggesting XRP could pass $20 if institutional liquidity surges. Why This Time Is Different Diana stressed that the 2025 cycle cannot be compared to 2017. At that time, XRP’s surge came mainly from retail speculation. In her view, the coming cycle has stronger foundations, with SEC clarity, stablecoin projects such as RLUSD, ETF applications, and Ripple’s broader global partnerships . She summarized this as “infrastructure” rather than speculation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 She emphasized that if past patterns repeat, Bitcoin could top in late September 2025, with XRP following in mid-October. She advised caution, noting that profit-taking between October and November may be critical, warning, “Miss the exit window, and you’re food for whales.” Diana closed by highlighting XRP’s seven-year wait. She argued that October 2025 could bring “one explosive setup,” potentially pushing the asset beyond its all-time high. Her base outlook remains $10 to $15.

In a recent and significant development, Kwon has lost a crucial bid to recover a substantial 19.6 billion won (approximately $14.2 million) deposit for a luxurious Do Kwon penthouse in Singapore. This setback comes after the nation’s High Court dismissed his claim, as reported by the local media outlet Singapore Law Watch. What’s the Story Behind the Do Kwon Penthouse Deposit? Before the dramatic collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in May 2022, Do Kwon had committed to purchasing a high-end penthouse. He had already paid roughly half the purchase price, amounting to a hefty 39.2 billion won. However, following the unprecedented market crash that wiped out billions, the property developer took action. They confiscated the significant payment Kwon had made. Consequently, Kwon, through his wife, initiated a lawsuit to reclaim these funds. This legal move aimed to recover the substantial deposit for the Do Kwon penthouse , which had become entangled in the fallout of the Terra-Luna debacle. Why is This Legal Setback Crucial for Do Kwon? This dismissal by the Singapore High Court adds another layer of complexity to Do Kwon’s already extensive legal challenges. It represents a tangible financial loss in the midst of a broader fight for his freedom and reputation. U.S. Indictment: Kwon was indicted in the U.S. in 2023 on nine charges. These charges are directly related to the collapse of his cryptocurrency empire. Investor Losses: The Terra-Luna collapse is estimated to have caused around $40 billion in investor losses globally. This figure underscores the immense scale of the financial devastation. Upcoming Trial: His trial in the U.S. is scheduled to begin on December 11. Every legal outcome, including the ruling on the Do Kwon penthouse deposit, could potentially influence the perception and trajectory of his upcoming court proceedings. Therefore, losing this bid to recover the substantial deposit is not just a financial blow. It also serves as a stark reminder of the legal and financial pressures mounting against the embattled crypto founder. What Are the Broader Implications of the Do Kwon Penthouse Ruling? The Singapore High Court’s decision regarding the Do Kwon penthouse deposit carries implications beyond just this specific case. It highlights the increasing scrutiny and legal accountability faced by figures in the cryptocurrency space. Legal systems worldwide are grappling with how to address the fallout from major crypto events. This ruling suggests that even personal assets and transactions can become subject to intense legal examination, especially when linked to large-scale financial collapses. Moreover, it underscores the challenges individuals face in recovering funds or assets once they become entangled in complex legal and financial disputes across international borders. The outcome could serve as a precedent or at least a point of reference for similar cases involving high-profile crypto figures. The Continuing Saga of Do Kwon’s Legal Battles The dismissal of Do Kwon’s claim to recover his $14.2 million Singapore penthouse deposit marks a significant moment in his ongoing legal saga. It reinforces the difficult position he finds himself in, both financially and legally, as he prepares for his impending trial in the U.S. This ruling is a clear indicator that legal systems are actively working to address the consequences of the 2022 crypto market downturn. For Do Kwon, it’s another challenging chapter in a story that continues to unfold with significant implications for the wider cryptocurrency world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was the total value of the Do Kwon penthouse he was trying to purchase? A1: The total purchase price for the penthouse was 39.2 billion won, which is approximately $28.4 million. Q2: Why did the property developer confiscate Do Kwon’s deposit? A2: The article indicates the developer confiscated the payment after the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in 2022, likely due to a breach of contract or an inability to complete the purchase under the original terms. Q3: Is Do Kwon currently facing other legal charges? A3: Yes, Do Kwon was indicted in the U.S. in 2023 on nine charges related to the Terra-Luna collapse. His trial is scheduled for December 11. Q4: What is the estimated amount of investor losses attributed to the Terra-Luna collapse? A4: The collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem is estimated to have caused around $40 billion in investor losses. Q5: Who filed the lawsuit to reclaim the penthouse deposit? A5: Do Kwon filed the lawsuit through his wife to reclaim the funds for the Do Kwon penthouse deposit. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

However, recent exchange data suggest that a supply crunch may be nearing for ETH. Ethereum Price Stable Amid Exchange Supply Decline According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, during the period between August 16 to September 3, Ethereum’s Binance Exchange Supply Ratio (ESR) saw a sharp decline. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Latest Rally Fueled By Large-Scale Binance Orders, Analyst Says Although ETH’s price has remained in the mid $4,000 range, its ESR tumbled from 0.041 to 0.037 – marking the biggest decline within the observed period – in a matter of just two weeks. It’s worth highlighting that ETH’s price has remained stable all this time, trading close to $4,400 at the end of the period. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, such price behavior can explain two things. First, it signals that investors are withdrawing from exchanges – including Binance – at an accelerated pace. Further, it also shows growing confidence among ETH holders as they opt for self-custody in cold wallets instead of keeping their holdings on exchanges. Arab Chain remarked that a combination of stable price, declining exchange supply, and healthy exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows confirms that sellable supply is dwindling while the demand for the digital asset remains strong. They added: Declines in ESR have historically preceded strong upward moves, as lower exchange liquidity limits sellers’ ability to push prices down. The current ESR levels have fallen back to pre-June figures, suggesting that the market has effectively “flushed out” previous profit-taking activity and is now reaccumulating supply into long-term wallets. ETH Entering A New Bull Cycle? The analyst concluded by saying that if ETH’s ESR continues to fall without a corresponding decline in price, then it would mean that the market is entering a new, institutional investor-led bull cycle. Three metrics in particular support this prediction. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Contract Boom In 2025, Setting Stage For $5,000 Rally The ETH market has seen a recent drop in leverage, meaning there are fewer traders with speculative positioning. Further, most perpetual futures markets show neutral funding rates for ETH contracts. Finally, the on-chain activity by ETH whales has also subsided, meaning long-term holders are not selling. Also worth noting is that the Ethereum blockchain’s fundamentals continue to improve. Latest data shows that as much as 36 million ETH has been staked on the ETH network, further raising the possibility of an ensuing supply shock. Recently, Ethereum daily transactions also hit a 12-month high. Amid these bullish developments, seasoned industry experts are not shying away from giving ambitious ETH price predictions. At press time, ETH trades at $4,295, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-trillion-dollars-is-coming-to-xrp-heres-how/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld recently shared a video in which he examined the Securities and Exchange Commission’s latest initiative on cryptocurrency regulation. According to the Financial expert, the SEC has unveiled a new rulemaking plan designed to reform the way digital assets are regulated in the United States. He emphasized that this development is “insanely massive,” noting that the regulatory update could create new opportunities for institutional involvement in the sector. Rietveld explained that the rulemaking would pave the way for Wall Street to participate in activities such as initial coin offerings, initial decentralized offerings, and large-scale pre-sales of digital tokens. He argued that this regulatory clarity would allow traditional financial institutions to raise capital for their own blockchain-based projects through crypto mechanisms. TRILLIONS COMING IN #XRP ?! pic.twitter.com/xjwjf3U4Tr — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 5, 2025 Integration with Major Blockchains In the video, Rietveld highlighted how these institutional projects will be hosted on existing blockchain infrastructures. He noted that while Ethereum could serve as the initial platform for many token launches, over time, these assets, particularly stablecoins, would extend to other networks. Specifically, he mentioned the XRP Ledger, Solana, and the Binance Smart Chain as ecosystems likely to support the cross-chain expansion of such projects. He pointed to the cross-chain capabilities as a decisive factor that could attract significant inflows into these networks. According to Rietveld, the magnitude of institutional participation enabled by the SEC’s rulemaking could result in “trillions of dollars” flowing into the crypto sector, with XRP positioned as a key network to benefit from this development. Community Reaction and Market Performance While Rietveld expressed strong optimism about the implications of the SEC’s regulatory framework, not all observers shared his outlook. An X user posting under the handle Mars0634 responded to Rietveld’s video by pointing to XRP’s recent price performance, remarking, “Meanwhile in the real world XRP dumping AGAIN.” Market data reflects this skepticism. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $2.81. The asset has declined 5.81% over the past 30 days and has also registered a 1.08% decrease over the past seven days. These figures highlight that despite the broader regulatory developments being discussed, XRP has yet to demonstrate a price reaction that aligns with Rietveld’s projection of major inflows. The new SEC initiative has the potential to reshape the regulatory environment for digital assets and open the door for more active participation from Wall Street in blockchain ventures. If implemented effectively, the changes could expand the role of major blockchain networks, including the XRP Ledger, in supporting tokenized assets and stablecoins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, XRP’s current market performance illustrates the gap between regulatory announcements and immediate price action. While Rietveld projects that the scale of institutional entry could eventually bring trillions into the ecosystem, the asset’s near-term trajectory remains subdued. Whether XRP will capitalize on the anticipated regulatory shift will depend on how quickly institutions move to adopt the frameworks the SEC is putting forward.

Led by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an up-and-coming decentralized lending protocol that is causing some splash with its innovative dual lending strategy the market is gearing up for a run. Today, Stage 6 of the MUTM presale is taking place and costs $0.035. Solana (SOL) still portrays a healthy network usage, and the emergence of new participants but MUTM is attracting attention owing to its ability to transform the crypto-backed lending markets. Solana (SOL) Holds over $200 Above Institutional interests Solana (SOL) is strong after breaking above $200 on growing investor adoption. Recent collaborations and staking action have solidified its ecosystem and future spot ETF applications can further increase its visibility should they be approved later this year. Analysts believe that sustaining momentum in the above trading range may be the gateway to a trend toward the $250 to $300 price levels. However, short-term declines are possible as traders take profits. Meanwhile, investor interest is slowly moving to other upcoming decentralized finance initiatives like Mutuum Finance. Stage 6 Presale Live supported by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is already a part of the DeFi community and has more than 16,100 investors and more than $15.45 million in presale. The project is also operating a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to improve security on the platform and to further encourage community engagement, which has rewards allocated to four risk tiers, such as critical, major, minor, and low. Interest Rate Models When money is abundant, rates are kept low in MUTM; when money is scarce the rates are raised, attempting to make borrowing costly; or, in other words, to push those who had borrowed to make payments. This works well in maintaining a strong protocol while best-serving users. Mutuum Finance Enriches Security Mutuum Finance is applying strict parameters to each asset it supports to make sure it has a high risk profile, including supply, borrowing limits and even collateral limits. The protocol can more readily withstand market volatility via overcollateralization of positions and stabilize undercollateralized positions via incentivized liquidators. The deposits and borrowing restrictions will restrain exposure to illiquid or risky assets and, therefore, restrain insolvency risks. Correlated assets can have greater collateral efficiency and high-risk tokens are limited in the collateral available to them. Mutuum Finance Makes a Giveaway Gamified As part of a $100,000 giveaway , ten lucky investors will be walking away with $10,000. This makes the existing investors, as well as new investors more enthusiastic about the platform. Among the most interesting altcoins as Wall Street continues to increase its exposure to crypto is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is competing on an equal footing with Solana (SOL) due to its novel model of decentralized lending. Stages 6 tokens are pre-sale priced at $0.035, and have raised over $15.45 million and 16,100+ investors in board, both good news. The price of SOL will not fall below $200, and may increase to $250-$300 should institutional momentum persist, but MUTM has a more aggressive growth curve with its two lending protocols, $50,000 bug bounty, and $100,000 giveaway to increase community participation. The project is designed to be scaled and secure with risk controls like overcollateralization and dynamic interest rates. Enter Stage 6 in advance to be guaranteed entry before the following price increase.

51275067,575302,1757143807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51275067.jpeg,Analyst Says All Bitcoin Price Uptrend Are Duds Unless This Happens,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-uptrend-are-duds/,"With the Bitcoin price hitting roadblock after roadblock , the next direction looks to be down, with sell pressure mounting up. There have also been crashes below major support levels, such as $112,000, that continue to hinder the growth of the digital asset. This has turned these former support levels into resistance, and one in particular remains a hindrance to the uptrend. If the resistance at $114,000 continues to hold, then Bitcoin investors may be in for a terrible time. Bitcoin Price Remains At Risk Of Crash According to crypto analyst BitBull, the recent rejection of the Bitcoin price from the resistance before $114,000 is a major source of concern. This has cast a shadow over every recovery that the Bitcoin price has staged recently, with the bears still holding a significant amount of power over the price. In the analysis , BitBull pointed out that the $114,000 level remains the level to beat if there is to be a significant recovery. Specifically, the Bitcoin price would have to reclaim this level on the daily timeframe and hold it before further uptrends can occur. Another problem that the cryptocurrency is facing is the timeframe issue. The crypto analyst also points out that the Bitcoin price would need to reclaim $114,000 to increase its chances of an uptrend. This is because the longer it takes for the price to cross $114,000 on the daily timeframe, the higher the chances that the price will crash further . Until this happens, though, BitBull says any recovery is just a bull trap and could precede the next wave of declines. Where BTC Could Be Headed From Here Another crypto analyst, Mags, has also called out the possibility that the Bitcoin price could see a crash from here. This time around, the level of interest is much lower than the $114,000 that BitBull called out, with Mags explaining that $108,000 is actually the point of interest. This level has served as major support during the recent crash, making it the level to beat for bears if they want to take the Bitcoin price lower. Inversely, it is now the level for bulls to defend against further onslaught, and the demand at this level needs to hold to continue the rally. If bulls are successful and they have $108,000, then the crypto analyst sees the Bitcoin price going higher, and possibly toward new all-time highs. However, in the case of a breakdown and bears taking over the support at $108,000, then the Bitcoin price is expected to crash below $100,000 .",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 07:30:07

The post was accompanied by four attached documents and diagrams described as evidence to support the statement. SMQKE emphasized the scale of this access by referencing RippleNet’s current network of around 200 connected institutions compared to SWIFT’s much larger footprint. RIPPLE INTEGRATION WITH FINASTRA OPENS ACCESS TO 11,000 SWIFT-CONNECTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Documented 4x. https://t.co/ZiU0osD4h5 pic.twitter.com/rjbCGgWl9d — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 5, 2025 Why This Is Significant to Ripple The attached documents contained details about Finastra’s service bureau and its connectivity model. One section quoted Marcus Treacher, former Senior Vice President of Customer Success at Ripple, who described Finastra as an established fintech player working with a majority of the world’s top banks. Treacher stated that the partnership would expand Ripple’s reach and solutions for its partners while also broadening the footprint of RippleNet . He highlighted that the collaboration would enable institutions to transact directly with each other. Another excerpt included in the documentation highlighted the numerical gap between RippleNet and SWIFT . RippleNet was noted to have 200 connected institutions, a figure described as small when compared to the 11,000 institutions connected through SWIFT. The attached note suggested that this deal could benefit both Finastra’s and Ripple’s existing clients by creating a pathway for interoperability. Finastra’s own perspective was also reflected in the material. Ritesh Singh, SVP of FMS at Finastra, was quoted as saying that working with Ripple would allow the company to offer fast and reliable cross-border payments using blockchain technology. He added that this would be particularly useful in regions where the cost of correspondent banking remains high. Diagrams and Connectivity Models The four images included in SMQKE’s post provided diagrams illustrating how Finastra’s systems connect to different payment networks. One diagram showed Finastra’s service bureau linking banks to both Ripple and SWIFT, with a flow of services such as payment processing, sanctions screening, and cash visibility. Another depicted a structure where customer banks’ back-office systems connect through Finastra to both Ripple’s xCurrent cloud and SWIFT messaging. Further diagrams demonstrated correspondent banking flows, showing Ripple and SWIFT as parallel channels accessible through Finastra’s connectivity. The simplified schematic presented by SMQKE indicated a model where a bank’s core system connects via Finastra’s Zurich-based service bureau to both Ripple and SWIFT infrastructures. Interpretation of the Post SMQKE claims that the integration creates a significant extension of Ripple’s potential reach by connecting indirectly to the 11,000 financial institutions that use SWIFT through Finastra. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The post underscores the scale difference between RippleNet’s existing network and SWIFT’s larger system and presents Finastra as a bridge that could allow Ripple to gain broader connectivity. The documentation suggests that Ripple’s blockchain technology could complement Finastra’s existing infrastructure to provide additional efficiency for financial institutions already using SWIFT.

This movement may represent the final phase of the current cycle for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Market analyst CryptoBirb has indicated that this uptrend could last for approximately 50 more days, emphasizing that Bitcoin is now 95% through its cycle, which has spanned 1,017 days since the lows of November 2022. 50 Days Until Possible Bitcoin Peak Historically, Bitcoin’s bull markets have peaked between 1,060 and 1,100 days after significant lows, suggesting a target timeframe for this cycle’s peak could fall between late October and mid-November 2025. The analysis highlights the typical relationship between Bitcoin’s Halving events and subsequent price peaks. Since the last Halving in April 2024, 503 days have passed, with past data showing that price peaks usually occur 518 to 580 days following such events. Related Reading: First US Dogecoin ETF Could Debut Next Week—How Will It Impact Price? As seen in the chart below, Bitcoin is currently 77% to 86% of the way through this timeline, entering what the analyst refers to as the “hot zone”—a period of heightened volatility and potential price movements. However, CryptoBirb cautions that historical trends indicate that after reaching a peak, Bitcoin typically experiences a significant decline, often dropping by 70% to 80% over a 370 to 410-day timeframe. This bearish phase is projected for approximately the first and second quarter of 2026, with a historical probability of a bear market in that year reaching 100%. Before this potential downturn, the analyst expects a final surge, with about 50 days remaining before the market may peak. September, often recognized as a weaker month for Bitcoin, has shown an average decline of 6.17%. Although third quarter statistics can be mixed, with a median increase of 0.80%, the overall average tends to reflect a decline due to larger losses. The typical seasonal pattern suggests that a poor September could be followed by stronger performance in October and November, with September 17 identified as a crucial date to watch by the analyst. Critical Support And Resistance Levels On the technical front, Key support levels are identified at the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) of $95,900 and the 200-week SMA at $52,300. The daily chart reveals further technical insights, including a 200-day breakout point at $111,000 and a 200-day SMA at $101,000. CryptoBirb has identified local support between $107,700 and $108,700, while resistance sits at $113,000 to $114,100. Related Reading: XRP Price Could See 20% Bounce To $3.4 If This Trendline Holds Looking ahead, both short-term and long-term trading trailers are currently in a bearish mode. CryptoBirb asserts that if Bitcoin falls below the critical levels of $107,000 to $108,000, bearish sentiment could intensify, potentially leading to secondary corrections in the range of 20% to 30%. Fortunately, cryptocurrency miners appear to be faring well, with the mining cost established at $95,400, suggesting a healthy market environment with minimal capitulation risk. Lastly, the analyst cautions against the potential for a market peak leading into the altcoin season in October and November. CryptoBirb suggests to mark calendars for October 22, as it could be a pivotal date in Bitcoin’s cycle. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $112,886, down nearly 11% from all-time high levels.

Backed by a $200 million commitment from regional partners and investors, the fund aims to acquire $1 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next six months. BTC Treasury Fund Unlike existing individual treasury firms in Asia, such as Japan’s Metaplanet, Hong Kong’s Moon Inc., Thailand’s DV8, and South Korea’s BitPlanet, which hold Bitcoin directly on their own balance sheets, the Sora Ventures fund will serve as a centralized pool of institutional capital. The main objective of the company is to support these existing firms while also encouraging the development of new BTC treasuries worldwide. In its official press release, Sora Ventures also said that the fund will focus on creating “synergies between regional and international treasuries” to strengthen BTC’s role as a reserve asset across markets. Sora Ventures’ management team has been tasked with guiding the fund and bringing in new institutional investors and collaborators to strengthen Asia’s Bitcoin treasury network. The initiative will help connect existing and emerging treasury firms, increase available capital, and foster a more integrated ecosystem for corporate BTC holdings across the region. Asia in Bitcoin Big League While the largest Bitcoin treasuries and corporate adoption have historically been US-centric, Asia is now stepping up as a major player in institutional Bitcoin markets. On that aspect, Sora Ventures founder and Managing Partner Jason Fang commented, “Asia has been one of the most important markets for the development of blockchain technology and Bitcoin. We have seen a rise in interest from institutions investing in Bitcoin treasuries in the U.S. and EU, while in Asia, efforts have been relatively fragmented. This is the first time in history that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage.” Metaplanet continues to lead as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, as it recently added 1,009 BTC to reach a total of 20,000 BTC. Meanwhile, another Asian player, Taiwan-listed WiseLink, became the first company in the country to adopt a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy.

His words have sparked interest in crypto forecasts, making Ethereum (ETH) a long-term cornerstone of the market. But behind the scenes, whales are turning their attention to an entity they think may have a bigger short-term upside: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This DeFi system is still only $0.035 in its ongoing presale, but many are talking about it as the next big cryptocurrency in private circles. This isn’t because of hype, but because its economic design directly links token demand to genuine revenue streams. Joe Lubin predicts 100x Ether amid Wall Street adoption Joseph Lubin, one of the founders of Ethereum (ETH), predicted that Ether (ETH) would rise 100X by August 31, 2025, making it the world’s main currency, surpassing Bitcoin. The price of ETH is about $4,400, and the trading volume in the last 24 hours was $37.07 billion. Lubin is optimistic about the future of Ethereum (ETH) because he thinks that Wall Street will adopt its decentralised architecture, with financial institutions staking ETH, running validators, and connecting DeFi and layer-2 networks. Technical indications reveal that ETH is testing support at $4,150, with resistance at $4,500 and an RSI of 48. Institutional inflows, such as $341 million in ETF investments and a $160 billion stablecoin supply, make people feel good. Social media reflects excitement over Ethereum (ETH)’s programmability. If $4,868 clears, analysts think the price will reach $5,200, although there are concerns from macroeconomic factors like US tariffs. If it drops below $4,150, it might test $3,950. Why whales look beyond Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has been seen as the best platform for decentralised apps for a long time, and many investors will keep ETH as a long-term bet. But whales know that timing is key. Ethereum (ETH) is growing at the rate it is now because institutions are slowly starting to use it. This means that the price may not go up for years. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to debut with a live beta platform, Layer-2 scaling, and lending features that will start bringing in funding transactions right away. The choice is becoming clear for whales who want to make money quickly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Layer-2 infrastructure will be faster and cost less than typical Layer-1 chains. That means that both regular traders and institutions will have an easier time borrowing and lending. The mechanics of the project are what really interest big investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will show off stable-rate borrowing, penalties for liquidation, and Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) when it launches. These features aren’t just extras; they’re ways to make money that will keep adding value to the protocol treasury, which will make people want to buy MUTM tokens more in the long run. This is why whales are buying into the presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now raised $15.4 million in Phase 6, with more than 16,000 holders taking part. One-third of the current allocation is gone at $0.035, and the following phase will raise the price by 15%. Anyone who bought in earlier is already seeing gains of more than 100%, while anyone who buys now is getting tokens before the price goes up even more. The CertiK audit also gave Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a Token Scan Score of 95.00, which adds to the project’s trustworthiness. It already has more than 12,000 Twitter followers. Treasury growth and 100x ambitions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a number of ways to bring value into its treasury. Every liquidation on the platform will send penalty fees directly into this pool, ensuring that even during market downturns, the system grows stronger. This makes the system stronger even when the market is down. That treasury will serve as both a safety net and a store of value over time, which will help future token demand. Another characteristic that will help with adoption is Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE). When borrowers use correlated assets like stablecoins, they can get larger loan-to-value ratios without putting the whole system at risk. This will make people borrow more money, which means more fees will be collected. More borrowers means more money for the treasury, which will make it stronger. This will create a feedback cycle that encourages rising token prices. Stable-rate borrowing is perhaps the best thing about it for businesses. Funds and corporate treasuries need things to be predictable, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s methodology will let them lock in payback costs with confidence. As more people borrow money, the interest income will grow the protocol treasury even more, which will make MUTM more valuable and in more demand.. Ethereum (ETH) still depends on things outside of its control, like ETF approvals or changes in regulations. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building its own engines that will increase the value of its tokens. Every loan, every sale, and every transaction will help it develop. Whales that are used to positioning themselves ahead of big rallies will find this structure to be a good reason to allocate a lot of money. Prices of cryptocurrencies will always go up and down, but whales pay less attention to short-term noise and more attention to long-term revenue models. This is why they are choosing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) over waiting for the next wave of Ethereum (ETH). The project’s protocol performance is directly linked to token demand, which gives investors access to a compounding mechanism instead of just market sentiment. The timing is really important for anyone who wants to invest in crypto right now. The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already 33% sold in this phase, and the price will go up in Phase 7, making it more expensive to get in. The $100,000 giveaway that is still going on is another reason for people to buy now. Whales are getting out of the way before the next phase starts because they know that when predicted exchange listings and stablecoin integration happen, the chance to buy MUTM at low prices will be gone. Ethereum (ETH) has a bright future, but this cycle’s best chance is elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a DeFi ecosystem where every activity by a user makes the treasury stronger and increases the demand for tokens. It is being marketed as the breakthrough project with 100x upside potential because it is scalable, has predictable borrowing, and is backed by the treasury. Whales are already buying, and it’s up to normal investors to determine if they will follow before the window shuts.

But traders are starting to talk about different things. Ethereum (ETH) is getting bigger and older, so the chances of it growing at the same rate as it did in the past are getting smaller. Prices of cryptocurrencies keep going up and down, and the crypto fear and greed index shows that the market is feeling a mix of emotions. Now, though, people are paying attention to a new presale project that is quickly gaining traction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $15.4 million during its ongoing presale. This shows that people are already interested in the project and believe in it before it officially launches. ETH slows, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) accelerates Ethereum (ETH) has been the driving force behind decentralized banking for years, but traders know that it is no longer in the early stages where gains happen swiftly. When you look at how ETH is doing now compared to how it was in the past, it’s easy to see why smaller-cap projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are getting so much attention. ETH’s value is already in the hundreds of billions, therefore, it needs a lot of new money to double. In contrast, MUTM is still in its presale phase 6, with only 33% of tokens sold so far. The price will go up by 15% to $0.04 after that. This is when early believers can get in before a project is fully developed. The $15 million amount also says a lot. In the past, ETH relied largely on institutional and venture finance to help it grow. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being constructed directly by the community through presale fundraising. This grassroots influx builds decentralization from the start, giving investors a strong basis with shared goals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a network effect on top of credit markets and stablecoin stability, just like ETH’s utility was the engine of its network effect. A stablecoin linked to $1 is at the centre of its model. Unlike other assets that can cause panic during a crypto meltdown, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will stabilise borrowing and lending through overcollateralization and rates that change according to governance. For example, if the stablecoin goes above $1, governance would cut borrowing rates to encourage borrowing and increase supply, which would bring the peg back in line. If it goes below, increased rates and chances to make money through arbitrage will fix the problem. Chainlink oracle data will make sure that price discovery happens, and there will be backup oracles to make sure that it stays reliable. This is similar to how Ethereum (ETH)’s DeFi protocols make sure that asset valuations are clear. Managing liquidity will also make the system stronger. Rates for borrowing will change depending on how much is used, which will keep everything running smoothly and in balance. When there is a lot of demand for borrowing, interest rates go up. This encourages new deposits and keeps liquidity from running out. When demand goes down, rates go down, which makes borrowing more appealing. This dynamic keeps capital moving throughout the platform and pays lenders interest rates that are in line with market realities. Roadmap and the ETH comparison The $15.36 million that came in during the presale isn’t just a short-term number; it’s a deep number that will help the plan move ahead. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has come up with a four-phase plan to grow its platform. Phase 1 has already been about presale and building the primary components. In Phase 2, the development of its core contracts and front-end apps will move forward. In Phase 3, the project will start beta testing on the testnet and get ready for outside security audits. Phase 4 will be the actual launch, with listings on exchanges and further integrations, which will keep up with rising demand. People who remember Ethereum (ETH) trading between $20 and $40 in its early days may recognize this path. The traders who got in at that period have seen their investments grow a lot. The tale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is similar. People who bought in at Phase 1 of the presale for $0.01 are already up 3.5X as the project moves through Phase 6. The listing price is expected to be $0.06, so Phase 6 buyers at $0.035 are still getting a good deal before the market becomes more popular. Conclusion Ethereum (ETH)’s growth rates are slowing down, but that doesn’t make it any less important. It does, however, give investors the chance to invest in projects that are still in their early stages and have a lot of potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $15.36 million, and its operation is based on lending using stablecoins, transparent oracles, and incentives for liquidity. Many people are already saying that it is one of the best prospects in the current market cycle. This is being called the “ETH-like moment” of today for traders who are looking beyond the short-term ups and downs of crypto prices. As the crypto market grows and investors seek certainty before 2026, the initiatives that combine usefulness with community-driven acceptance are the ones that are really taking off. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already proven that it belongs in this discourse. The fact that ETH’s growth has slowed down doesn’t mean that the era of exponential growth tales is over; it just means that the next chapter has begun.

For traders, understanding these movements, especially the potential for significant events like Bitcoin liquidation , is absolutely crucial. Recent analysis highlights a fascinating scenario: a recovery in Bitcoin’s price to $114,000 could unleash a staggering $2.52 billion in short position liquidations across major futures exchanges. This isn’t just a number; it’s a potential catalyst for intense market volatility, making it vital for every crypto enthusiast to pay attention. What is Bitcoin Liquidation and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Bitcoin liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin balance falls below the minimum required level to maintain the position, typically due to adverse price movements. Imagine you’ve borrowed funds to amplify your trading power; if the market moves against you significantly, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for both you and the platform. Margin Trading: Traders use borrowed funds (leverage) to open larger positions than their capital would normally allow. Risk Amplification: While leverage can magnify profits, it also dramatically increases potential losses. Automatic Closure: When a position reaches a certain loss threshold, the exchange automatically closes it to prevent the trader’s balance from going negative. This forced closure is the liquidation. Understanding liquidation events is key because they can create a domino effect, exacerbating price movements. Large-scale liquidations often fuel further price swings, leading to what’s known as a “short squeeze” or “long squeeze.” The $114K Bitcoin Liquidation Scenario: A Short Squeeze Spectacle The current market sentiment is highly sensitive to price triggers. Should Bitcoin’s value climb towards the $114,000 mark, we could witness a significant market event. Data suggests that approximately $2.52 billion (equivalent to 3.5 trillion Korean Won) in short positions would be liquidated at this level. A short position is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. When the price instead rises sharply, these short positions become unprofitable, and exchanges are forced to close them. This scenario is often referred to as a “short squeeze.” Here’s how it works: Traders who bet against Bitcoin (short sellers) face mounting losses as the price rises. To close their losing positions, these traders must buy Bitcoin back, which adds further buying pressure to the market. This additional buying pressure pushes the price even higher, triggering more liquidations, and creating a powerful upward momentum. Such a massive Bitcoin liquidation event could provide a strong bullish impulse, potentially propelling BTC’s price beyond the initial trigger point as the market absorbs these forced buy orders. What Happens if Bitcoin Drops? The Long Liquidation Threat Below $107K Conversely, the market presents risks in the other direction as well. While the potential for a short squeeze is exciting, a downside movement could be equally impactful. If Bitcoin’s price were to drop below $107,000, the market could see an estimated $5.1 billion (7.1 trillion Korean Won) in long positions liquidated. A long position is a bet that an asset’s price will rise. When the price falls sharply, these long positions become unprofitable. To close their losing positions, these traders must sell Bitcoin, which adds selling pressure to the market. This is known as a “long squeeze” or simply long liquidation. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading at $110,798.88, reflecting a 1.78% dip over the past 24 hours. This current price point sits right in the middle of these two critical liquidation thresholds, highlighting the extreme sensitivity and potential for volatility in the near term. Traders must therefore be prepared for scenarios in both directions, as significant Bitcoin liquidation cascades can dramatically alter market dynamics within a short period. Navigating Bitcoin Liquidation: Strategies for Savvy Traders For those participating in the crypto markets, understanding these liquidation levels isn’t just academic; it’s a critical component of risk management and strategic planning. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Liquidation Heatmaps: Tools that visualize potential liquidation levels can offer insights into areas of high market sensitivity. Manage Leverage Wisely: High leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Use it cautiously and understand your risk tolerance. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level, helping to limit potential losses and prevent forced liquidation. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data to anticipate potential price movements that could trigger significant Bitcoin liquidation events. The crypto market is unforgiving, and being caught on the wrong side of a large liquidation event can be costly. Proactive risk management is always the best defense. In conclusion, the potential for a Bitcoin liquidation cascade, whether from a surge to $114,000 or a dip below $107,000, underscores the inherent volatility and high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency trading. These thresholds represent not just price points, but significant psychological and financial barriers that could unleash billions in forced position closures. For traders and investors alike, staying informed and employing robust risk management strategies are paramount to navigating these turbulent waters successfully. The market is currently poised at a critical juncture, and understanding these dynamics will be key to anticipating its next dramatic move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a short squeeze in Bitcoin trading? A short squeeze occurs when the price of Bitcoin rises sharply, forcing traders who bet on a price drop (short sellers) to buy back BTC to cover their positions. This forced buying further pushes the price up, creating a rapid upward movement. Q2: How does leverage impact Bitcoin liquidation? Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with less capital. While it can amplify profits, it also magnifies losses. With high leverage, even small adverse price movements can lead to a trader’s margin falling below the required level, triggering a rapid liquidation. Q3: Are liquidation events predictable? While the exact timing is difficult to predict, analysts can identify “liquidation zones” where large volumes of short or long positions are clustered. Tools like liquidation heatmaps help visualize these potential trigger points, allowing traders to anticipate areas of high market sensitivity. Q4: What is the difference between a long position and a short position? A long position is a bet that an asset’s price will increase, so a trader buys with the expectation to sell higher. A short position is a bet that an asset’s price will decrease, so a trader sells borrowed assets with the expectation to buy them back cheaper later. Q5: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? Traders can protect themselves by using appropriate risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, monitoring their margin levels, and diversifying their portfolios. Understanding market dynamics and potential liquidation levels is also crucial. Did this article shed light on the dramatic potential of Bitcoin’s price movements?

The report showed that the U.S. economy added just 22,000 jobs in August, far below the forecast of 75,000. Hilton explained that this weaker-than-expected outcome highlights a “dramatically slowing U.S. labor market.” According to Hilton, the slowdown carries significance beyond employment figures. He argued that the results strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates during its upcoming meeting on September 17 . XRP Holders! We Got Great News Today! pic.twitter.com/cbWAXnX88i — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 5, 2025 Why It Matters for XRP Hilton acknowledged that many crypto holders may not closely follow the Fed’s policy decisions, but he emphasized that such moves directly affect digital assets. He stated that interest rate cuts provide conditions that can support cryptocurrencies by easing financial pressures in traditional markets. Lower rates often drive investors toward alternative assets, and Hilton linked this dynamic to the potential for XRP to benefit. Hilton linked the jobs report with other recent data, such as inflation figures, and argued that these signals give the Federal Reserve little choice but to move toward policy easing . In his view, this environment is favorable for digital assets in general and for XRP specifically. Positive Technical Signals for XRP Turning to XRP, Hilton noted that the token has been trading in a consolidation range for an extended period. He explained that XRP has moved sideways for 47 days, remaining between $2.8 and $3.35. He described $2.8 as the support level that has held firm, with XRP moving slightly above and below this point in recent weeks. Hilton connected this consolidation to prior trading patterns, suggesting that such periods often precede renewed momentum. While he did not issue a specific price prediction in the video, he highlighted the importance of monitoring XRP’s support levels as the broader macroeconomic backdrop shifts.

He maintained that an easy policy environment positions XRP to gain in the long run. Although the jobs report was seen as a disappointment in broader economic circles, Hilton sees it as a catalyst for policy change which will benefit XRP holders who have been waiting through a prolonged consolidation phase. Like many other experts, Hilton anticipates a major breakout for XRP in the short term. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

People are talking about anything from meme tokens to big-cap assets, but the real crypto investing forums are starting to focus on one name: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This initiative is getting attention for its fundamentals, which analysts say are setting the stage for a 1900% return on investment before the next cycle. This is different from the noise that causes short-term frenzies. Why investors are shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ethereum (ETH) has already shown that utility-driven tokens can take over as demand for the network grows. But today, the upside of ETH is smaller than it used to be. People who keep an eye on crypto pricing realise that the days of getting rapid multiples on blue-chip assets are coming to an end. At the same time, startups like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are coming up with fresh ideas that fix problems that older DeFi platforms had. The Stable Interest Rate Model is what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) work. When you borrow money from a traditional lending site, you might be subject to unanticipated changes that make it hard to get yourself ready. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will let people lock in the costs of paying back loans, which will provide both individual and institutional borrowers with confidence in their plans. While the stable rate begins higher than the floating market average, the payoff is peace of mind and higher capital inflows. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will adjust rates whenever the floating market goes up more than 10% over stable levels to keep gaps from hurting liquidity providers. This balancing act keeps lenders safe while demand for loans stays high, which puts money directly back into the ecosystem. This stability isn’t only for comfort; it will also lead to long-term confidence that will lead to increased borrowing, which will give lenders stable streams of income and make the platform’s token economy stronger. MUTM is built to expand without relying on speculative hype cycles, thanks to mechanics like these. Risk management meets scalable growth The way Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set up makes it less likely to fail during a crypto meltdown, like other DeFi projects have in the past. Borrowers must always put up more collateral than they borrow, and when the collateral gets too low, liquidators are more likely to step in. They buy assets at a discount to pay off loans, which keeps the platform running smoothly. This strategy keeps toxic debt from sticking around, so the organisation is solvent even when the crypto fear and greed index fluctuates wildly in unexpected markets. Deposit and borrow limits also make this more stable. These are like protective ceilings that keep any one token from flooding the system with too much exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will include Restricted Collateralization Mode for higher-risk assets. This would let people borrow money only under very rigorous circumstances. On the other hand, Enhanced Collateral Efficiency will give more advantageous limitations to stable, linked assets, such as large stablecoins. The protocol is creating one of the most risk-balanced lending environments the industry has ever seen by adding these layers. Investors are paying attention to how seriously Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is handling safety. Reserve factors will take some of the borrower’s interest, making a buffer pool in case of defaults or market extremes. Many people think that this type of forward-looking design will lead to more use and returns that are similar to those seen in the early days of Ethereum (ETH), but with better security. Presale momentum builds urgency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already generated $15.4 million in just six rounds of its presale. Phase 6 is now online at $0.035, and 33% of it has already sold out. The following phase will raise the price by 15% to $0.04. People who backed the project in Phase 1 for $0.01 are already up 3.5X their money, and the listing at $0.06 would put them at a full 500% unrealized profit. For purchasers in September, time is really important—this is their final chance to get a lower price before the change to Phase 7 pricing. The presale has attracted more than 16,100 holders, and a CertiK manual and static audit gave it a token scan score of 95. With a $50,000 bug bounty program and a strong social media presence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming a project that people trust and want to use. Analysts who say there will be a 1900% return on investment aren’t just making it up; they’re linking the dots between rising capital inflows, a solid presale basis, and technological solutions that fix genuine DeFi problems. The verdict for September traders As people on forums talk about what the best deal is before the end of the month, the answer is becoming increasingly in clarity. Ethereum (ETH) is still the most popular, although it grows more slowly. Meme coins go up and down with the enthusiasm, but they crash when sentiments shift. On the other side, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing how to make long-term profits: a presale that has already brought in millions, a steady interest strategy that changes how borrowing works, and layered safeguards that promise to keep the firm strong in unstable markets. September is a key month for traders looking for chances to make life-changing profits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is winning polls and talks because it combines risk management with the possibility for huge growth. Phase 6 is almost halfway done, and the next price spike is coming up. A lot of people now think that MUTM is the greatest cryptocurrency to buy this month because of that combination and the fact that it is most likely to reach the 1900% goal.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to $857.4 in the past 24 hours. If traders continue buying tokens, the BNB price might see a further jump, and the next target could be above $873. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,654.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $857.4, but it may find resistance around $873. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.41 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $1000 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,654.04 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-06 08:45:00

The company successfully raised an impressive $175 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, specifically earmarked for establishing a Dogecoin treasury . This significant fundraise signals a growing trend of corporate adoption of digital assets, and it’s certainly making waves. What is Driving CleanCore’s Vision for a Dogecoin Treasury? CleanCore Solutions had previously disclosed its intentions to invest in Dogecoin (DOGE), and this latest funding round brings those plans to fruition. The $175 million PIPE deal saw participation from several prominent players in the financial and crypto sectors. These included Mosaics, Pantera Capital, GSR Markets, FalconX, Borderless Capital, and Mythos. This diverse group of investors highlights the broad interest in CleanCore’s strategy. It suggests a belief in the long-term potential of integrating digital currencies into corporate financial structures. This isn’t just about holding crypto; it’s about a strategic allocation within a dedicated Dogecoin treasury . Forging Key Alliances for the Dogecoin Treasury A crucial aspect of CleanCore’s venture is its collaborative approach. The company has established its Dogecoin treasury in close partnership with two significant entities: the Dogecoin Foundation and House of Doge. These collaborations are vital, offering legitimacy and expertise to the initiative. Moreover, Marco Margiotta, the CEO of House of Doge, is set to join CleanCore as its Chief Investment Officer (CIO). This appointment brings seasoned crypto leadership directly into CleanCore’s executive team. It underscores the seriousness and strategic depth behind their commitment to this new digital asset strategy. Navigating Market Sentiments: The Initial Reaction to a Corporate Dogecoin Treasury It’s important to note that CleanCore’s initial announcement of its Dogecoin investment plans on September 2 was met with a sharp decline in its stock price. This reaction reflects the market’s initial caution and, perhaps, skepticism towards unconventional corporate treasury strategies. However, securing a substantial $175 million investment from reputable firms post-announcement indicates a different sentiment among institutional players. It suggests that while retail markets might react impulsively, sophisticated investors see potential in pioneering a Dogecoin treasury , even amidst volatility. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of a Dogecoin Treasury? Establishing a Dogecoin treasury presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. On the benefit side, CleanCore could tap into the vibrant Dogecoin community, enhance brand visibility, and potentially benefit from the asset’s price appreciation. It positions the company as an innovator in the corporate finance landscape. Benefits: Innovation: Positions CleanCore at the forefront of corporate crypto adoption. Community Engagement: Taps into Dogecoin’s large and active community. Potential for Appreciation: Offers exposure to a volatile, yet potentially high-growth, asset. Diversification: Adds a new asset class to the company’s balance sheet. Conversely, challenges include Dogecoin’s notorious price volatility, which could impact CleanCore’s financial statements. Regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies also pose a risk, as the landscape is constantly evolving. Furthermore, managing public perception and shareholder expectations will be crucial. Challenges: Price Volatility: Dogecoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically. Regulatory Uncertainty: The crypto regulatory environment is still developing. Public Perception: Managing investor and public reactions to a novel strategy. Operational Complexity: Requires specialized expertise for management. A Landmark Moment for Corporate Crypto Adoption CleanCore Solutions’ successful $175 million fundraise for its Dogecoin treasury marks a significant milestone. This move not only solidifies CleanCore’s position as an innovator but also sets a precedent for how other public companies might integrate digital assets into their financial strategies. It’s a clear signal that cryptocurrencies, even meme coins like Dogecoin, are increasingly being considered as legitimate components of corporate balance sheets, driven by strategic vision and institutional backing. The journey ahead for CleanCore’s Dogecoin treasury will be closely watched, offering valuable insights into the evolving relationship between traditional enterprise and the dynamic world of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a PIPE deal, as mentioned in CleanCore’s fundraise? A: A PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) deal involves the sale of publicly traded company shares or other securities to private investors. It’s a way for public companies to raise capital quickly from a select group of institutional or accredited investors. Q2: Why did CleanCore Solutions choose Dogecoin (DOGE) for its treasury? A: While the company’s full rationale isn’t detailed, choosing Dogecoin could be seen as a bold, innovative move to capture attention, engage with a large community, and potentially benefit from its unique market dynamics and cultural relevance. It differentiates their digital asset strategy. Q3: Who are the key partners involved in establishing CleanCore’s Dogecoin treasury? A: CleanCore Solutions is collaborating with the Dogecoin Foundation and House of Doge to establish and manage its Dogecoin treasury. Additionally, Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, is joining CleanCore as its Chief Investment Officer. Q4: What are the main risks associated with a corporate Dogecoin treasury? A: The primary risks include Dogecoin’s high price volatility, which can lead to significant fluctuations in the treasury’s value. There are also regulatory uncertainties in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, and potential challenges in managing public and investor perception of such an unconventional asset. Q5: How might CleanCore’s Dogecoin treasury impact the broader crypto market? A: This move could serve as a significant precedent, potentially encouraging other publicly traded companies to explore similar digital asset treasury strategies. It adds institutional legitimacy to Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and crypto.

51278073,575697,1757148655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51278073.jpeg,Best Altcoins to Buy as Ethereum Outflows Signal Renewed Accumulation,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-ethereum-outflows-accumulation/,"Ethereum exchanges are drying up quickly as ETH exchange ‘flux’ turns negative for the first time ever. Flux, by the way, calculates the cumulative net flow of ETH across all exchanges. A positive flux means there are more ETH deposits, which simply shows people are selling more ETH and buying less. A negative flux balance, however, indicates more outflows of ETH from exchanges than inflows, suggesting aggressive buying among market participants. Data from CryptoQuant also suggests that the balance of ETH on exchanges has now hit a new rock bottom , indicating strong institutional buying. Recently, Yunfeng Financial Group, backed by Chinese tycoon Jack Ma, bought 10,000 ETH worth $44M as part of its reserve strategy. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest institutional holder of ETH, added around 153,000 tokens , taking their stash past the $8B mark with 1.86M ETH in holdings. BitMine, in fact, now holds 1.5% of the total ETH supply. Additionally, three ICO-era whales recently moved $645M worth of Ethereum to a new staking address . These 150,000 ETH were originally bought for just $0.31, and instead of booking $643M in gains, these whales chose to stake the tokens for steady yields. This highlights how institutions increasingly view Ethereum as a yield-generating asset rather than just a speculative bet. Let’s dig into ETH’s technical charts to understand how the next few weeks could pan out. We’ll also suggest the best altcoins to buy now to make the most of this momentum. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Awaiting a Breakout After surging 139% since the beginning of May and teasing the $5K level on August 24, Ethereum has now entered a symmetrical triangle pattern, with key support at around $4,000. A symmetrical triangle typically signals the continuation of a strong bull run. A breakout here could see $ETH quickly reclaim previous highs and march toward $5,500 and beyond. According to Bitbull, a crypto trader with 67K followers on X, $ETH is holding a rising trendline on the daily timeframe. And as long as it doesn’t break below, $ETH remains a good buy . More importantly, as $ETH rises, so does the broader altcoin market, which often delivers astronomical returns. If you’re looking to make the most of Ethereum’s upcoming rally, here are a few cryptocurrencies worth watching right now. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Supercharging the Bitcoin Blockchain with Solana-Like Performance Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the best crypto to buy now thanks to its game-changing mission to improve Bitcoin’s real-world utility. $HYPER is building the first true Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, aimed at turbocharging the network with lightning-fast speeds, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 compatibility. Why’s this important? Because beyond its appeal as an investment vehicle, Bitcoin doesn’t provide much value to core crypto users: it’s painfully slow, congested, and expensive. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), $HYPER will let developers build smart contracts and decentralized applications on Bitcoin itself. Additionally, a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge will let you interact with Hyper’s Web3 environment by converting your native Bitcoin into Layer-2-compatible tokens. You can then use these wrapped $BTC tokens to engage in high-speed DeFi trading, NFTs, lending, staking, and DAOs – all without leaving the Bitcoin blockchain. Buy $HYPER now while it’s still in presale and available at some of its lowest-ever prices. At the moment, 1 $HYPER is priced at just $0.012865, and the project has already raised a whopping $14.1M from early investors. Plus, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could hit $0.32 by year-end – a staggering 2,400% gain for early buyers. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website for more information. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Hype-Driven Meme Coin Gunning for 1000x Returns If you think you’ve leaned a little too much on the cautious side and stacked only mainstream, utility-driven altcoins, consider Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . It’s a new meme coin in presale , fronted by a bulked-up, angrier, and potentially more profitable version of Dogecoin. Maxi is, in fact, Dogecoin’s distant cousin – but the two are anything but close. Dogecoin’s success and ‘cute’ vibe ruined Maxi’s childhood, as his family members were too busy hyping Doge to pay him any attention. Looking for revenge, Maxi found solace in the gym and in front of the charts. He built up his muscles and his crypto brain, crafting both a robust personality and a creative plan to overthrow Doge as the best meme coin on the planet. The plan? Aggressive marketing. Think PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and social media blitzes. In fact, the project’s developers have reserved a whopping 40% of the total $MAXI supply for marketing purposes. And despite not having any ‘revolutionary’ utility, holding $MAXI could still be extremely rewarding. You’ll get access to holder-only events, like weekly trading competitions and leaderboard prizes. Currently in presale, $MAXI has already pulled in over $1.88M from early investors, with each token priced at just $0.000256. Check out Maxi Doge’s official website for more information. 3. Tutorial ($TUT) – Viral Altcoin Capable of Riding Crypto’s Renewed Momentum Tutorial ($TUT) emerged as one of the top trending cryptos in the June–July rally, gaining a whopping 200%. And now, with another run-up on the cards, the token is again showing signs of a potential explosive move to the upside. It’s up over 16% in the past week, currently trading around $0.06886 – just one big green candle away from its all-time highs. Beyond that, there’s really no resistance stopping the token from going absolutely bonkers and potentially becoming the next 1000x crypto . What’s driving its momentum? Hype and community backing, of course – but $TUT is also one of the few tokens that hits the sweet spot between popularity and utility. As the name suggests, Tutorial is an education-based crypto offering easy-to-understand lessons on topics like setting up a crypto wallet , writing smart contracts, and trading on decentralized exchanges , helping newbies learn the ropes of crypto and blockchain. Wrapping Up Ethereum exchanges are drying up at a record pace, signaling a never-before-seen interest from deep-pocketed players looking to load up as much of the ‘digital silver’ as possible. This trend, combined with a potential interest rate cut in September, could send $ETH and other altcoins straight to the moon. If you want to capitalize on this rally, consider loading up on low-cap, high-upside tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Tutorial ($TUT). That said, kindly remember that the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. This article is not financial advice. Always do your own research before investing.

According to its press release, the agency mentioned that it is taking the fight against fraud to a new height, formulating a cross-border task force to strengthen the efforts of the Division of Enforcement. In addition, the agency will help them take the fight to the individuals and entities targeting United States residents, combating cross-border fraud that harms investors. SEC announces formation of cross-border task force In its press release, the agency mentioned that the cross-border team will be charged to initially focus on investigating potential US federal securities law breaches on the part of foreign-based companies. This will include potential market manipulations such as pump-and-dump and ramp-and-dump schemes. Pump-and-dump schemes are situations where the team behind an investment, or in some cases, a token, uses false or misleading rumors to create a buying rush that pushes the price of the token up. When the price of the token has attained the highest possible figure, the team then sells their portion of the token, which in turn pulls the price of the token down, making it useless for regular investors. Over the last few months, several regulators, including the United States Commodity Futures and Trading Commission ( CFTC ), have warned traders and investors, especially those in the crypto industry, about a series of pump-and-dump schemes. The agency has warned retail traders, who are often the victims in this case, to avoid investments that look like such schemes, giving them clear ways to identify such investments. Although the commission has warned investors about the need for due diligence and carefulness when patronizing projects in the crypto space, it noted that the task force will not hesitate to go after those who breach its rules. In addition, it said its task force will be charged to focus its enforcement on gatekeepers, especially auditors and underwriters, who help these companies gain access to the United States capital markets. Task force to focus on securities law violations According to the agency, the task force will also examine potential securities law violations related to companies from foreign jurisdictions such as China, where governmental control and other factors pose unique risks to investors. Speaking about the new development, Paul Atkins, the SEC Chairman, said the United States welcomes companies around the world seeking access to the US capital markets. “But we will not tolerate bad actors – whether companies, intermediaries, gatekeepers, or exploitative traders – that attempt to use international borders to frustrate and avoid U.S. investor protections. This new task force will consolidate SEC investigative efforts and allow the SEC to use every available tool to combat transnational fraud,” he added. Atkins also noted that he has ordered that he has directed other SEC divisions and offices to join hands in this battle. “I have also directed the staff in other SEC divisions and offices, including the Divisions of Corporation Finance, Examinations, Economic and Risk Analysis, and Trading and Markets, as well as the Office of International Affairs, to consider and recommend other actions that would better protect U.S. investors, including new disclosure guidance and any necessary rule changes,” he said. Division of Enforcement Director Margaret Ryan also talked about the task force and what is expected of the individuals who will make up the group. “The Cross-Border Task Force will leverage the Division of Enforcement’s resources and expertise to combat international market manipulation and fraud. We are pleased to be part of this critical effort to enforce the federal securities laws and protect U.S. investors,” she said. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

51279582,https://invezz.com/?p=2863721,1757149200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"BTC price stuck despite Fed cut bets; altcoins M, IP, PUMP show some strength",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/06/btc-price-stuck-despite-fed-cut-bets-altcoins-m-ip-pump-show-some-strength/,"Bitcoin’s price action over the past week has been anything but steady, with the leading cryptocurrency bouncing between $107,414 and $113,225. The broad trading range confirms the uncertainty prevailing across global markets, where macroeconomic signals have largely dictated investor sentiment. The total crypto market cap slipped about 2% over the week, settling at $3.899 trillion by Friday’s close. Although there were flickers of optimism during mid-week trading, enough to briefly push the Crypto Fear and Greed Index into “greed” territory, the mood ultimately cooled. By week’s end, the index had slipped back to a neutral reading of 48, as traders weighed the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut this month. Altcoins, meanwhile, posted mixed results. Most top-tier assets ended the week with only modest moves, with gains mostly concentrated in a handful of outperformers. Why is the Bitcoin price stuck? Bitcoin did manage to gather some momentum mid-week, climbing steadily after a clean bounce off the $110,000 support level. That technical rebound sparked a short-lived rally, with BTC/USD briefly pushing to new September highs near $113,400. But just as quickly as the rally came, it faded. Bitcoin shed nearly $3,000 within an hour as profit-taking and fresh macro data sapped the upward push. At the centre of this tug-of-war is the Federal Reserve. Traders are currently pricing in more than a 90% probability that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points at its upcoming policy meeting on September 17. That looming decision has already sparked a mild risk-on tilt across global markets, and Bitcoin, often seen as a high-beta proxy for speculative appetite, was among the early beneficiaries. Lower borrowing costs typically create a more favourable backdrop for risk assets, and BTC has historically responded quickly to even hints of monetary easing. The current sentiment is further reinforced by expectations of not just one, but at least two rate cuts by the end of 2025. That kind of dovish policy trajectory is exactly the sort of macro setup in which Bitcoin tends to flourish. ETF inflows this week added fuel to the optimism. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $332.7 million on Tuesday alone, the highest in two weeks, according to CoinGlass. It was a telling signal that institutional capital hasn’t lost interest, just waiting for the right macro cue. However, markets were jolted by the latest US nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data, which came in significantly below expectations. Only 22,000 jobs were added in August, well under the forecasted 75,000. The dollar stumbled on the weak labour readout, while gold surged to new all-time highs, classic moves in anticipation of policy easing. Yet Bitcoin, curiously, failed to fully capitalise. Despite the data aligning with a rate-cut narrative, BTC’s reaction was underwhelming. Prices dipped shortly after brushing September highs, a move that left many traders scratching their heads. While the labour market data supports the case for looser monetary policy, which is typically bullish for crypto, the lacklustre price response suggests the market is still searching for conviction. As trading resource The Kobeissi Letter pointed out, this was the second-lowest jobs report since July 2021, with downward revisions on prior months adding to the bleak picture. Will Bitcoin price go up? Zooming out, despite the late-week downturn that was unfolding at the time of publication, Bitcoin’s trajectory over the past 7 days has been upward. However, the question now remains whether this trend will continue or we will see a price reversal. To gauge that, analysts were observing certain critical areas that could potentially influence the upcoming direction. One key zone under scrutiny is the 200-period moving average on the 4-hour chart—both the simple (SMA) and exponential (EMA) varieties. Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades flagged this level as a crucial barometer for momentum in the short to mid-term. In a post on X, he noted that these moving averages have acted as stubborn resistance for weeks and are now being retested again. “These have both acted as resistance for the past few weeks and are now being tested again,” he wrote, hinting that a decisive break above could shift sentiment. Fellow market watcher ZYN echoed the sentiment, pointing specifically to the $113,000 region as the threshold to beat. BTC/USDT – 1-day price chart. Source: ZYN on X. “This is a very crucial level to reclaim for more upside,” he noted, adding that bulls would “be fully back” if Bitcoin could establish support above that zone. That area—just before the NFP print—was widely considered the short-term battleground for control. But not everyone is convinced that BTC may be out of the woods yet. Bearish takes are still circulating, with some voices warning that the recent rally may have been more technical than trend-setting. Investor and market analyst Ted Pillows reiterated his view that Bitcoin could slide further, especially if current support levels fail to hold. Ted @TedPillows · Follow $BTC has been stuck in a range for months now.I’m expecting a retest of $100K-$102K level before reversal.Also, if this level doesn’t hold, BTC could go around $92K-$94K CME gap level. 6:21 pm · 5 Sept 2025 207 Reply Copy link Read 118 replies Gaps in CME futures trading have historically acted like gravity wells, often pulling prices toward them when broader sentiment turns risk-averse. And while gaps aren’t guaranteed to fill, they tend to loom large in technical forecasts, particularly during periods of heightened volatility. When looking at the weekly liquidation heatmap for the BTC/USDT trading pair on Binance, some key support and resistance levels start to come into focus. Heavy liquidation clusters can be seen forming just below the $111,000 level and again around $108,000, areas where both long and short positions were recently wiped out. Binance BTC/USDT Weekly Liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. These bands of historical liquidations often act as soft support or resistance zones moving forward, as traders are cautious about re-entering positions too aggressively in areas of recent forced exits. One particularly active region sits around $110,000, which aligns with the area Bitcoin bounced from earlier this week. This level now acts as a psychological and technical anchor. Should BTC revisit this zone and hold, it could serve as a launchpad for another retest of the upper end of the range. On the flip side, downside liquidity continues to build between $106,000 and $103,500, with visible liquidation interest thickening near $104,000. If sellers manage to push price through the $108K–$110K soft floor, Bitcoin could be drawn into that zone, where aggressive liquidation of leveraged long positions could cascade into a deeper dip. To the upside, multiple heat pockets are visible near $113,500 to $114,000, which is where Bitcoin recently topped out before its abrupt drop. If BTC can reclaim and consolidate above $113K, a move toward $115,000 or even $117,000 isn’t off the table, but it will require strong bullish momentum and fresh catalysts, likely from macroeconomic data or institutional flows. At press time, Bitcoin was trading above the $110k support area, with a little over 2.6% in profits booked over the past 7 days. Altcoin market recap The total market cap of all altcoins rose to a weekly high of $1.75 trillion before settling at $1.69 trillion, up 4.3% over the week. Ethereum traded sideways this week as bulls and bears battled for control, with the price fluctuating between $4,250 and $4,450. As of press time, the leading altcoin by market cap was trading at $4,282, down about 1% on the week, with a market cap of $516.5 billion. Other large-cap altcoins like XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tron (TRX) also posted similar losses ranging between 1-3% in the last 7 days. MemeCore (M) stood out as the leading gainer of the week with triple-digit gains of 242%, far outpacing Story (IP) and Pump.fun (PUMP), which recorded gains of 31.6% and 30.4% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap MemeCore: MemeCore’s skyrocketing gains this week stem from investor hype and heavy community marketing around Korea Blockchain Week. An X post from a community member revealed that the project rented out Seoul’s iconic Lotte World theme park for the final night of the event. The park would be open to all KBW attendees and certified community testers. However, pulling off such a costly arrangement suggests the project is deploying significant capital to build cultural relevance. As many of these attendees also hold M tokens, community members are likely ramping up their holdings on the belief that the success of the theme park experience could largely depend on the token’s performance. Story : The primary catalyst behind Story’s rally today stems from the official launch of Poseidon’s first application, a training data collection app for physical AI operations. IP’s gains were also supported after Aria Protocol Labs and the Aria Foundation, both tied to the Story-based IP tokenisation platform Aria, revealed they had secured $15 million through their recent combined seed and strategic funding rounds. Finally, community-driven activity has added fuel to the rally. With more than 1,000 tokens deployed on ip.world as of press time, the IP coin narrative is spreading rapidly as it gains grassroots adoption. Pump.fun : PUMP’s rally this week was fueled by Pump.fun’s aggressive buyback of nearly $12.2 million worth of tokens from the open market over the past week. More broadly, its gains were supported by Pump.fun’s newly introduced strategic overhaul, Project Ascend, unveiled earlier this month. The initiative aims to empower creators on the platform while targeting scaling the ecosystem by 100x over the coming months.

Bitcoin Coin Days Destroyed Shot Up Alongside Earlier ETF Net Inflows As explained by CryptoQuant author Maartunn in a new post on X, Bitcoin has been observing major reshuffles related to old tokens and the spot ETFs. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that trade on traditional platforms and allow investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset like BTC without having to directly own the asset. The BTC spot ETFs launched in the US in January 2024. Since then, the funds have generally enjoyed growth, with a few periods involving a particularly sharp burst of inflows. The main attraction of the ETFs is that investors unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency world can invest into BTC in a form that’s convenient to them. Related Reading: Safe Haven Split: Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Turns Negative For First Time In 6 Months When a trader invests into such a vehicle, the fund buys an equivalent amount of the cryptocurrency on the client’s behalf. This reflects as an on-chain movement into the wallets associated with the ETF. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the 30-day Bitcoin spot ETF netflow since the start of 2024. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin spot ETF netflow has seen a few phases of extremely positive values. These naturally correspond to a high amount of demand for the ETFs. Interestingly, there is a pattern common among these large waves of inflows. From the chart, it’s visible that the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) gave distribution signals alongside the netflow spikes. The CDD is an on-chain indicator that measures the total number of coin days that are being “destroyed” in transactions across the BTC network. A coin day is a quantity that one BTC accumulates after staying dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a token dormant for some number days is moved, its coin days counter returns back to zero. The coin days that it had previously been carrying are said to be destroyed. Generally, spikes in this metric correspond to activity from the diamond hands of the network. These HODLers tend to accumulate a massive amount of coin days with their patience, so when they finally break their silence, large-scale destruction of coin days takes places. The three major Bitcoin ETF net inflow waves of Summer 2024, Fall 2024, and Summer 2025 all accompanied a distribution signal from the CDD, which suggests a rotation of coins happened from the veteran hands to new demand coming through these vehicles. Related Reading: Dogecoin Signal That Nailed The Top Says It’s Time To Buy Since the latest such wave, the ETF netflow has calmed down to the neutral level, meaning demand has gone cold. “ETF inflows are key,” notes Maartunn. “Without strong new demand, selling pressure from new holders could increase.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $110,500, up 2% over the past week.

The plan may add XRP payments to Wetour’s overseas platform. But it’s not automatic. The change depends on future business steps and getting regulatory approval. Access For 60 Million Members Under the deal, Wetour will focus first on premium chauffeur and airport transfer services. PhoenixMiles members could get access to Wetour’s platform, which now shows XRP as a payment option and also accepts Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Webus has also moved to use more altcoins. In June it filed with the SEC for a $300 million treasury reserve and said it plans to use the XRP Ledger for cross-border payments. XRP: Real Use & Limits Fans say the XRPL settles transactions in three to five seconds and fees are under one cent. Those features are why travel companies and loyalty programs might try the tech for vouchers, token rewards, and fast payments. But XRP payment support doesn’t always mean people will use the token for daily purchases. Attorney Bill Morgan notes the cautious wording, but he thinks it shows real progress. He said, “For me, it shows adoption of XRP.” Big Number Vs. Actual Use Case Sixty million is a big headline. It gets attention. But access is not the same as active use. Many loyalty programs have members who rarely travel or never use partner services. Wetour’s focus on higher-end transport and promo coupons means early use might only be by some members, not all 60 million. That can still matter. Pilot programs usually start small and grow if people use them. Rules & Business Checks The announcement says the integration depends on future business steps and regulatory sign-off. That matters now because payments and loyalty schemes touch local rules, cross-border compliance, and payment systems. A wide rollout will need those issues cleared, and it could take time. This is a notable step for XRP in travel and loyalty programs, but it’s early and conditional. Webus’ earlier moves — the planned $300 million treasury and XRPL plans — make the idea more believable than a one-time press claim.

51280699,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=135712,1757149867,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png,Here’s XRP Price If It Becomes the First Coin Held by Top 10 Central Banks,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/09/06/heres-xrp-price-if-it-becomes-the-first-coin-held-by-top-10-central-banks/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-xrp-price-if-it-becomes-the-first-coin-held-by-top-10-central-banks,"A new analysis explores the potential XRP price if the world’s top 10 central banks allocate a portion of their combined $13 trillion in reserves to the coin. The results show that even a modest level of adoption at this scale could propel XRP to new heights.XRP's Current Market PositionNotably, XRP is currently trading at around $2.81, with a circulating supply of approximately 59.4 billion tokens. This gives it a market cap of about $172.3 billion, making it one of the largest digital assets in circulation. Despite this substantial valuation, the entry of central banks could completely reshape XRP’s trajectory.Allocation Scenarios from $130B to $822B in XRPIf the top 10 central banks—including those in China, Japan, Switzerland, India, Russia, the United States, and others—were to allocate just 1% of their reserves (around $130 billion) to XRP, its market cap would rise to over $302 billion. This would push the token’s price to approximately $5.09.A 3% allocation, representing $390 billion, would drive XRP’s value to about $9.47. At the upper end, a 5% allocation equal to $650 billion would result in a market cap of more than $822 billion, translating to a token price near $13.84.Extended Outlook at 10%Looking beyond modest allocations, a 10% commitment from central bank reserves, roughly $1.3 trillion, could raise XRP’s market cap to $1.47 trillion. In this scenario, XRP price could climb to around $22.58 per coin, nearly eight times its current value. Speculative prices for XRP on goverment allocation Speculative prices for XRP on government allocation However, it is important to note that these figures are based on basic market cap arithmetic, assuming that central bank inflows would translate directly into increased valuation.In reality, such massive buying pressure from institutions of this size would likely create a multiplier effect , potentially driving XRP’s price well beyond these projections.Even a $1 billion government allocation could trigger significant market reactions, making inflows of $130 billion to $1.3 trillion far more impactful than the raw numbers might suggest.Consider the market frenzy that would likely follow an announcement that the U.S. government is purchasing $1 billion worth of XRP.But Is There Any Chance These Governments Will Hold XRP?The idea of governments holding XRP is compelling, especially amid a global push for crypto innovation and adoption at the governmental level , which has reached unprecedented momentum this year.The U.S. government has signed into law a bill on stablecoins, marking a historic milestone for crypto legitimacy. Furthermore, the government is working toward establishing a national crypto reserve that could hold up to 1 million BTC, along with a diversified crypto stockpile including XRP, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana.However, the U.S. has not expressed readiness to purchase any cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin.In countries like Russia and China, most discussions around crypto have focused on Bitcoin and stablecoins, often viewed as tools to promote their local currencies.Regarding Bitcoin, institutional FOMO remains high. Governments that currently hold BTC show no signs of selling. Notably, countries such as the U.S., China, the U.K., Ukraine, Bhutan, El Salvador, and four others collectively hold 517,298 BTC—worth over $56.76 billion.In essence, the current institutional focus is overwhelmingly on Bitcoin, while altcoins like XRP remain in the background.TakeawayThis analysis highlights the potentially outsized impact of institutional adoption on XRP, particularly at the highest level. However, the scenario of governments allocating between $130 billion and $1.3 trillion into XRP remains highly speculative.As it stands, Bitcoin is the more likely candidate for such large-scale government adoption.

The SEC is getting ready to approve XRP spot ETFs, and the industry is excited about what this may imply for institutional adoption. Once the green light is given, analysts think that big investors will put money into Ripple’s ecosystem, which will add another chapter to its tale. Wall Street is interested in ETFs, while retail traders are looking for something else. People in forums, Telegram groups, and Discord communities aren’t talking about institutions; they’re talking about which inexpensive crypto has the best possibility of making 100X its value by 2026. More and more, the answer is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale DeFi initiative that costs only $0.035. SEC nears approval of XRP spot ETFs The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is said to be close to giving the go-ahead for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as of September 4, 2025. This would raise the price of XRP to about $2.86, with a trading volume of $6.2 billion in 24 hours. The chances of approval are 95% because the SEC dropped its case against Ripple in August 2025, confirming that XRP is not a security for retail sales. Applications from firms like Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale are under review, with final decisions expected by October 2025. Technical indicators show XRP testing $2.80 support, with RSI at 53 and resistance at $3.00. Social media reflects strong optimism, fueled by whale accumulation of $1 billion. Analysts project a $3.64 target if $3.00 clears, but macro pressures like U.S. tariffs pose risks. A drop below $2.80 could test $2.65. Retail focus shifts to MUTM It’s not hard to see why people are drawn to it. XRP’s price of $2.80 shows that it is stable, but that also suggests that it won’t increase as quickly in the future. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is a unique combination of usefulness, scalability, and a low entry price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is different from other speculative tokens that are only based on hype. It has established a whole system around borrowing and lending that will go live with the launch of its token. That includes a beta version of its platform, which means that users will be able to utilize a functional product right now instead of having to wait years for it to be finished. MUTM’s Layer-2 architecture is what makes it so appealing. Transactions will be quicker and cheaper than on existing Layer-1 networks, which have problems with congestion and excessive costs. This implies that regular clients will have cheaper and smoother interactions. This means that institutions may grow without giving up security. That mix will be the foundation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ecosystem, where its lending engine, stablecoin mechanisms, and liquidity protections all work together. This design has already gotten a lot of attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $15.4 million in Phase 6 of its presale, and more than 16,100 people now possess the currency. At $0.035, 33% of the supply for this phase has already sold. The price will go up by 15% in Phase 7. The project has passed a complete CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 95.00. It also initiated a giveaway of $100,000 to anyone who bought tokens in a specific window. For investors who got in early, gains are already well over 100%. Buyers who get in now are making sure they get in before the next leg up. Mechanics that justify 100x The way Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set up makes it more than just a risky play. With the project’s Stable Interest Rate Model, borrowers will be able to lock in their payback expenses. This level of predictability draws in not just individual traders but also treasuries and funds that want to manage long-term risk without abrupt shocks. The system will rebalance whenever variable rates go up more than 10% over stable rates. This makes sure that lenders are always paid fairly. The reserve factor also sends some of the borrower’s interest to a treasury pool. This treasury acts as a safety net when markets are unstable, and over time, it will increase the value of tokens. Deposit and borrow caps give another layer of security by making sure the protocol doesn’t go too far with risky or illiquid tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stable even when the rest of the market goes down by carefully setting limitations. This way of doing things is important in a place that is often unstable. Like XRP needs ETF clearance to get institutional flows, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a system that will create demand naturally through real use. The plan shows a staggered deployment, starting with beta testing when the token is listed and then expanding to further DeFi connections. Each phase builds on a proven framework, which keeps projects from making mistakes by moving too quickly without risk controls. For traders who want to know the difference between hype and conviction, this tiered strategy is the key. These are the basic facts that analysts are using to make their predictions of a 100x return on investment by 2026: actual usefulness from launch, built-in protections that make people feel protected, and listings on Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC are all expected. The outcome is a project that has the same type of early-stage confidence that Ethereum’s early investors had. Before it’s too late The crypto market moves quickly, and history suggests that regular investors often wish they had invested sooner. XRP’s ETF clearance will definitely make headlines and affect crypto prices in the short term, but traders looking for life-changing returns are already buying MUTM in presale. The urgency is clear: this is the final opportunity for investors to get in before a planned 15% price rise, and more than a third of the stock is already gone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) doesn’t simply guarantee growth; it also has a whole economic plan to keep it going. It is setting itself up to be the breakout DeFi project of this cycle with its Layer-2 backbone, dependable borrowing mechanics, and strong reserve safeguards. If you’re thinking about investing in crypto for 2026, the decision is becoming apparent. As the SEC makes its final judgment on XRP’s ETF, individual traders are buying into the presale that analysts claim may provide them a 100x return on their investment. XRP may stay in the news because of its stability, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to take over the future of DeFi.

Key Takeaways: A new AI coding exploit can silently spread malware across entire codebases using hidden markdown instructions. Coinbase’s preferred tool, Cursor, is among several AI assistants shown to be vulnerable. CEO Brian Armstrong’s aggressive AI rollout has sparked backlash from developers and security experts. According to cybersecurity firm HiddenLayer , the flaw allows attackers to stealthily inject malicious code that can spread across an entire organization’s codebase with minimal user interaction. The attack, dubbed the “CopyPasta License Attack,” exploits how AI tools interpret common developer files like LICENSE.txt and README.md. AI Code Assistants Exposed to Malware via Hidden Markdown By embedding harmful instructions in markdown comments, often hidden from rendered views, attackers can manipulate AI code assistants into propagating malware without developers realizing. “Injected code could stage a backdoor, exfiltrate sensitive data, or manipulate critical systems, all while remaining buried deep inside files,” HiddenLayer said in a Thursday report. The firm demonstrated the exploit using Cursor, the AI coding assistant reportedly adopted by every Coinbase engineer as of February. HiddenLayer said similar vulnerabilities were present in other tools including Windsurf, Kiro, and Aider. The concern comes just a day after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong claimed that AI now writes up to 40% of the company’s code, a figure he aims to push to 50% next month. The announcement drew criticism from cybersecurity experts, developers, and crypto insiders who warned of the risks tied to mandated AI adoption. “This is a giant red flag for any security-sensitive business,” said Larry Lyu, founder of decentralized exchange Dango. Carnegie Mellon professor Jonathan Aldrich called the policy “insane,” adding that he would not trust Coinbase with his funds after hearing it. ~40% of daily code written at Coinbase is AI-generated. I want to get it to >50% by October. Obviously it needs to be reviewed and understood, and not all areas of the business can use AI-generated code. But we should be using it responsibly as much as we possibly can. pic.twitter.com/Nmnsdxgosp — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 3, 2025 Delphi Consulting’s Ashwath Balakrishnan called the push “performative and vague,” while Bitcoiner Alex Pilař stressed that Coinbase, as a major crypto custodian, should prioritize security over AI adoption metrics. Armstrong has defended the move , saying AI-generated code must still be reviewed and is not used in all parts of the business. In a blog post, Coinbase’s engineering team clarified that AI use is more common in front-end and less-sensitive systems, while “system-critical exchange systems” remain more cautiously managed. However, Armstrong admitted during a podcast with Stripe co-founder John Collison that he had enforced AI onboarding at Coinbase, going as far as firing engineers who refused to use the tools. “I went rogue,” Armstrong said. “They got fired.” TIME Names Coinbase a 2025 ‘Disruptor’ Among Most Influential Companies As reported, TIME has recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , labeling the crypto exchange a “disruptor” for its significant role in shaping US digital asset policies and markets. TIME noted the exchange as a key driver behind the industry’s policy efforts and predicted Coinbase could become the central hub for crypto trading in the US. Beyond the US, Coinbase is broadening its reach in Europe, securing a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator.

51280161,https://invezz.com/?p=2864077,1757150687,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Memecoins like PEPE and DOGE are volatile while MUTM signals a $1 much faster,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/06/memecoins-like-pepe-and-doge-are-volatile-while-mutm-signals-a-1-much-faster/,"There are always waves of euphoria during bull cycles, and this year, memecoins like PEPE and DOGE are once again flooding social media with huge profits and heartbreaking losses. They can become viral quickly, but they don’t have any core use cases, which makes them dangerous for investors who want steady growth. People who want to make money quickly are asking a more direct question: which project offers both speed and usefulness? Analysts say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale DeFi currency that costs $0.035, is the solution more and more often. They think it will reach $1 far faster than any memecoin. Why traders are pivoting from memes to utility Chasing memes like DOGE or PEPE is always exciting. But the price fluctuations in crypto may quickly wipe out novice investors before they can do anything. Investors are now choosing projects with actual infrastructure because they want short-term profits that will last. This is what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) different. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already collected $15.4 million in its presale, which has brought in more than 16,100 holders and a CertiK audit with a high Token Scan Score of 95. The price right now in Phase 6 is $0.035, and because 33% of this phase has been sold, it’s evident that things are moving. The price will go up by 15% in the following phase, which means that time is running out to get allocations for less than $0.04. This traction is more than just a pose; it shows that more people believe in a technology that will actually provide DeFi functionality. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is different from memecoins since it has real mechanisms that will be in place at launch, while memecoins are based only on community jokes and guesswork. Analysts think that $1 is an early milestone rather than a far-off fantasy because of that difference in basis. Why $1 is on the horizon for MUTM Features that immediately lead to acceptance and value creation are the basis of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s approach. The project works on Layer-2 scaling, which means that transactions are faster and far cheaper than they are on Ethereum Layer-1, which is quite busy. This is a very important benefit for traders who are upset that fees are cutting into their short-term gains. Second, incentives for liquidation that take into account liquidity make the system self-balancing. Liquidations put money back into the protocol treasury if debtors are at risk of default. That process keeps operations consistent even when markets are turbulent, which gives investors confidence and brings additional money into the system. Third, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has an agenda for the future that goes beyond only lending and borrowing. The project wants to introduce a native stablecoin, which would make it a useful financial instrument in the real world. Stablecoins have always been a big part of DeFi ecosystems, and this new feature will help Mutuum Finance (MUTM) develop even faster as more people utilize it. The figures show that there is a chance. for the current price of $0.035, an early investor from Phase 1 who bought in for $0.010 is now up over 250%. When Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gets closer to $0.06, those early investments will have already gone up 6X. In the middle of the term, a run to $1 means a return on investment of more than 55X for those who are still entering Phase 6. On the other hand, chasing DOGE pumps is more about timing viral tweets than making long-term money. This is why experts who are interested in short-term crypto investments are calling MUTM one of the few chances that mixes speculative upside with genuine mechanics. Memecoins can go up and down rapidly, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a system that becomes stronger with every transaction. Final words It’s easy to see why it’s so important: prices go up when Phase 6 ends. That implies that merchants who wait will have to pay more for the same amount. The coin will soon reach a far larger audience than just early presale buyers, thanks to listings on Binance, Kraken, and other tier-one exchanges. This will create a wave of liquidity that short-term investors want to grab at the ground level. If you pay close attention to crypto forecasts, the picture is becoming clearer. Memecoins like PEPE and DOGE will always be fun to watch, but they don’t have the infrastructure to keep their value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is racing toward $1 with its $15.4 million presale, audited structure, and development plan. When looking for a cryptocurrency to buy now that can make you money quickly, MUTM stands out as the safer, wiser, and quicker choice.

In 2025, there is no single “best” AI detector OR AI Checker , as the ideal choice depends on your specific use case, required accuracy, and budget. The field is highly dynamic, with new models and detection tools being released constantly. The most trusted and highly-regarded AI detectors as of September 2025 are: GPTZero , Originality.ai , and Winston AI . These tools are consistently cited for their high accuracy and specialized features. Top AI Detectors and Their Best Use Cases GPTZero : This is widely considered the top choice for educators and academic institutions . It is praised for its high accuracy and low false-positive rate, meaning it is less likely to incorrectly flag human-written text as AI-generated. A key feature is its ability to provide sentence-by-sentence analysis , which gives users a clear breakdown of where AI may have been used. In summer 2025, it released a new model trained on advanced language models like GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 , further improving its ability to detect the latest AI outputs. Originality.ai : Best for content marketers, SEO professionals, and digital publishers . It’s specifically designed to detect AI content that has been edited or “humanized” to evade detection. The tool offers a suite of features including plagiarism checks, readability scores, and a website scanner to check an entire site for AI content. It updated its model in June 2025 to improve its accuracy on the latest AI models and humanizer tools, boasting a 99%+ accuracy rate and a low false-positive rate of 0.5% . Winston AI : A strong contender for professional teams and educators who need robust integrations. Winston AI claims an impressive 99.98% accuracy rate for detecting content from models like ChatGPT and Google Gemini . It also offers Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to scan text from images and documents, as well as a plagiarism checker and readability score. It integrates with platforms like Google Classroom and WordPress , streamlining workflows for its users. Copyleaks : Geared toward enterprises and academic institutions . This tool provides a comprehensive solution with multi-language support and the ability to detect paraphrased AI content. Its robust API and enterprise-grade features make it a go-to for large-scale content integrity management. Key Considerations and Limitations It is crucial to understand that no AI detector is 100% accurate . These tools work based on probabilities and can sometimes produce false positives (flagging human text as AI) or false negatives (failing to detect AI text). The accuracy of a detector can also vary based on the text’s length, topic, and writing style. The best practice is to use AI detectors as a supplementary tool and always apply your own human judgment, especially in high-stakes situations like academic submissions or professional publishing. Always cross-check results with multiple tools to get a more reliable assessment.

According to reports, the team is a small but influential group of researchers that shapes how the firm’s AI models interact with people. In a memo released in August, Mak Chen, OpenAI’s chief research officer, mentioned that the team, which consists of about 14 researchers, has been directed to join the Post Training team. The latter is a research group responsible for improving the company’s AI models after their initial pre-training. As part of the reorganizations, the Model Behavior team will now report to OpenAI’s Post Training lead, Max Schwarzer. According to reports, the founding leader of the Model Behavior team, Joanne Jang, is moving on to start a new project under OpenAI. In a recent interview, Jang mentioned that she is building a new research team called OAI Labs. She added that the team will be responsible for “inventing and prototyping new interfaces for how people collaborate with AI.” OpenAI reorganizes its Model Behavior team The Model Behavior team has been one of the most important research groups to OpenAI , helping the company shape the personality of its AI models and reducing sycophancy, a situation that occurs when AI models simply agree with and reinforce the beliefs of their users. This situation is harmful because it helps users affirm even beliefs that are unhealthy and pose harm to them, instead of offering a balanced response. The team has also worked on navigating political bias in model responses, helping OpenAI define its stance when it comes to AI consciousness. In the memo sent to staff, Chen mentioned that this is the perfect time to bring the work of OpenAI’s Model Behavior team closer to the core model development. This way, the company is affirming that the personality of its AI is now seen as an important factor in how the technology evolves. In the past few months, OpenAI has faced scrutiny and criticism over the behaviors of its AI models. Users have strongly objected to the personality changes the company made to GPT-5 , which the company said showed lower rates of sycophancy but seemed colder to some of its users. The complaint led OpenAI to restore access to some of its legacy models, including the GPT-4o. The company also released a new update to make the newer GPT-5 responses feel friendlier without an increase in sycophancy. AI firms face criticism over model sycophancy OpenAI and other AI model developers have to walk a fine line to ensure their chatbots are friendly but not too sycophantic. Last month, parents of a 16-year-old boy dragged OpenAI to court over the alleged role of ChatGPT in their son’s suicide. According to court documents, the teenager, Adam Raine, confided in ChatGPT (specifically a version powered by GPT-4o) about his suicidal plans and thoughts in the months leading up to his death. The lawsuit alleges that the model failed to push back on his suicidal ideas. The Model Behavior team has been on every OpenAI model since GPT-4, including several models and the GPT-5. Before starting the research unit, Jang had previously worked on projects like Dall-E 2, OpenAI’s early image-generation tool. Last week, she announced on X that she was leaving the team to “begin something new at OpenAI.” The former leader of the Model Behavior unit has been with the firm for about four years. 🧪 i’m starting oai labs: a research-driven group focused on inventing and prototyping new interfaces for how people collaborate with ai. i’m excited to explore patterns that move us beyond chat or even agents — toward new paradigms and instruments for thinking, making,… — Joanne Jang (@joannejang) September 5, 2025 According to reports, Jang is expected to serve as the general manager of OAI Labs, which will be directly under Chen for now. However, she added that it is still early days, and it is unclear what those novel interfaces will be. “I’m really excited to explore patterns that move us beyond the chat paradigm, which is currently associated more with companionship, or even agents, where there’s an emphasis on autonomy,” said Jang. Jang also added that she has been thinking of AI systems as instruments for doing all sorts of things, including connecting, learning, and thinking. When asked if OAI Labs is expected to collaborate on novel interfaces with Jony Ive, the former Apple design chief who just joined OpenAI on a family of AI hardware devices, Jang said she is open to all sorts of ideas. However, she added that she is likely going to start with research because that’s an area she is more familiar with.

MUTM has attracted the attention of both institutional players and retail clients looking for strong DeFi yields and a creative approach to decentralized lending. Meanwhile, old players, like Cardano (ADA), are also developing their ecosystem through continuous growth of the network and cooperation. Cardano (ADA) Resilience Cardano (ADA) is at approximately $0.82, and is well within its $0.78-$0.82 support zone- a foundation that has been very effective during the recent market turbulence. Analysts point out that one of the primary areas of resistance can be found in the area of $0.88. A decisive break of the level would initiate a move towards $1.00 perhaps even $1.20. It is noted, that ADA can reach a trade range of at least $0.80 to $1.30 with the average of $1.14 being most likely to increase by about 60% of the present level. Meanwhile, longer run forecasts lie between the more conservative end-of-year forecasts of $0.90 to the more aggressive potential highs of about $2.05 assuming positive ecosystem dynamics like ETF support. As such, there is also a direction shift toward investment in new DeFi applications such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Ongoing Mutuum Finance is in its 6th round of presale and its tokens are at a current price of $0.035, 16.17 percent higher than in the previous stage. The market certainly is interested with the more than 16100 invested holders and almost $15.45 million raised already. In order to improve platform security further, a USDT Bug Bounty Program has been established together with CertiK, and is valued at $50,000 USDT. This program reports these vulnerabilities as critical, important, minor and occasional. Management Security and Risk The parameters assigned to the assets guaranteed by Mutuum Finance are typically those that are inherent to the risk profile of the asset, such as supply limits, borrowing limits, and collateral limits. The protocol will thus hedge market volatility by overcollateralising positions and will serve as an incentive to liquidators to stabilise undercollateralised positions. The deposits and borrowing limits also limit risk exposure to risky or liquid assets and lessen the likelihood of becoming bankrupt too. The collateral use constraint of risky tokens can be extremely small, and the correlated assets will be collateral efficient. Community Building participation $100,000 Mutuum Finance has announced a $100,000 giveaway as part of its plan to build and market an active user base. To allow new entrants to join and invest in the project, $10000 MUTM tokens shall be issued to ten holders. Key Metrics and Protections MUTM is a platform constructed on the basis of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and the objective limitation of borrowing and collateral and offload liquidation constraints to hazardous employment and compensating liquidators. The reserve factor is a proxy to reflect what really matters in order to deliver what is termed as a buffer against default and severe market conditions and more risky assets are given more reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be one of the most promising cryptos to invest in Q4 2025, and its decentralized lending offerings are attracting institutional and retail investors. Stage 6 tokens are worth $0.35 and is up 16.17% to the last stage having over 16,100 holders and nearly 15.45M raised.

According to the Tron founder, he intends to allocate $10 million toward unspecified altcoins, with the remaining amount directed to the newly launched WLFI. We believe U.S.-listed crypto stocks are an undervalued opportunity. I will market buy $10 million worth of ALTS and $10 million worth of WLFI. @worldlibertyfi @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @ZachWitkoff @zakfolkman @WatcherChase — H.E. Justin Sun 👨‍🚀 (Astronaut Version) (@justinsuntron) September 5, 2025 The timing of the move is notable, as WLFI remains under heavy scrutiny following recent controversies related to its high-profile launch. Notably, following the launch, Sun revealed that more than $75 million of his WLFI holdings had been frozen after the project blacklisted over 270 wallets. WLFI defended the decision, claiming the affected accounts were linked to phishing scams and compromised credentials. Critics, however, argue the move undermines the platform’s claims of decentralization. Sun’s defense Interestingly, Sun, who is an advisor to the project rejected accusations of market manipulation, explaining the transfers were merely “small deposit tests” and not sales. He called the freeze “unreasonable” and urged equal treatment for all investors. To this end, on-chain analysis from Nansen supported his stance, attributing WLFI’s sharp decline to large market-makers rather than Sun. “I call on the team to respect these principles, unlock my tokens, and let’s move forward together toward the success of World Liberty Financials,” he said. Launched in 2024 with strong backing from President Donald Trump and his family, WLFI has experienced extreme volatility since its debut. The token opened above $0.30 but has since lost nearly half its value, trading around $0.18–$0.19.

These tools are driving a shift from simple automation to AI agents that can plan, reason, and act on complex goals with minimal human intervention. Top Agentic AI Platforms for Enterprise Development For companies looking to integrate agentic AI into their existing systems, the following platforms offer robust, scalable, and secure solutions. Microsoft AutoGen: An open-source framework designed for building conversational, multi-agent systems. It stands out for its enterprise-grade reliability and ability to facilitate collaboration between specialized AI agents. AutoGen is designed for seamless integration within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. IBM Watsonx Orchestrate: This platform automates complex enterprise workflows using natural language. It is built on IBM’s foundation models and focuses on providing an AI-powered solution for compliance-heavy industries such as banking and healthcare, with a strong emphasis on governance and audit trails. LangGraph: As an extension of the LangChain framework, LangGraph provides a graph-based approach for building sophisticated, multi-agent workflows. Its key features include advanced state management and fine-grained control over agent interactions, making it ideal for applications that require precise control and complex decision-making. Top Frameworks for Multi-Agent Collaboration For developers and teams focused on building custom, collaborative AI agents, these frameworks are leaders in their field. CrewAI: This popular open-source framework is known for its simplicity and quick deployment. It allows developers to build collaborative, role-based AI agents that can work together as a “crew” to accomplish tasks, mirroring a human team dynamic. CrewAI is often the top choice for rapid prototyping and projects requiring multi-agent teamwork. Adept AI: With its ACT-1 model, this platform enables AI agents to interact directly with software interfaces. Instead of relying on APIs, it observes human demonstrations to perform tasks across various applications like spreadsheets and CRMs, making it a powerful tool for automating workflows without requiring direct code access. Cognosys: This platform specializes in creating fully autonomous, browser-native AI agents. These agents can perform a wide range of web-based tasks by directly interacting with web interfaces, making them effective for automating online workflows. Key Trends in Agentic AI in 2025 The agentic AI landscape is rapidly evolving, driven by several key trends that are shaping how these technologies are being developed and deployed. Rise of Multi-Agent Systems: There is a significant shift toward using multiple, specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex problems, a strategy that is becoming mainstream in 2025. Integration with RPA: Agentic AI is adding cognitive intelligence to existing robotic process automation ( RPA ) platforms like UiPath , enabling more dynamic and adaptable workflows that can respond in real time. Focus on Governance and Ethics: As agent autonomy increases, so does the need for oversight. Leading agentic systems are prioritizing features like explainability, audit trails, and guardrails to ensure responsible and compliant deployment, particularly in regulated industries. The development of agentic AI marks a significant move toward a future where AI systems can perform complex, end-to-end tasks autonomously, fundamentally changing business operations and software development.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-army-fears-coinbase-price-manipulation-heres-what-happened/,"Crypto investor Stern Drew has raised serious concerns regarding Coinbase’s recent handling of its XRP reserves. In a detailed analysis shared on social media, Drew pointed to data from XRPScan showing that Coinbase reduced its XRP holdings from 780 million to 199 million within weeks. This represents a 69% decrease, effectively removing the exchange from the position of the fifth-largest holder and pushing it to the lower end of the top ten. Drew emphasized that such a significant reduction could not be regarded as standard selling behavior, suggesting that it appeared to be deliberate manipulation. COINBASE IS MANIPULATING XRP XRPScan data shows Coinbase cut its stash from 780M → 199M XRP in weeks – a 69% slash. Once the 5th-largest holder, they’re now barely in the top 10. This isn’t normal selling. It looks like coordinated manipulation. Let’s decode pic.twitter.com/yGrxPRku2l — Stern Drew (@SternDrewCrypto) September 5, 2025 Outflows and Trading Patterns According to Drew, Coinbase’s selloffs accounted for approximately 581 million XRP, valued at nearly $300 million at current market prices. He stated that 40% of these outflows were routed through over-the-counter desks connected to New York institutions, while the timing of the transactions coincided with nearly every notable dip in XRP’s price. Drew further noted that 72 percent of the selling activity occurred during low-liquidity hours, specifically between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. UTC. He added that Coinbase allegedly fragmented the flows across multiple exchange wallets in a way that disguised the full scale of the movements. These actions, he claimed, suppressed potential rallies, particularly at points where XRP was approaching key resistance levels around $1.20. Alleged Motivations Behind the Strategy Drew proposed three possible motivations behind Coinbase’s actions. The first was external pressure from groups tied to what he referred to as “ETHGate,” citing Coinbase’s links with ConsenSys and the Ethereum Foundation. The second, he argued, was Wall Street positioning, where institutional players could benefit from driving retail investors out before accumulating XRP at lower prices. The third potential motivation highlighted by Drew was the possibility of using XRP price pressure as leverage in U.S. policy and regulatory negotiations, particularly with Ripple remaining central to ongoing discussions around digital assets. Data Correlations and Institutional Flows To support his claims, Drew referenced his team’s modeled “XRP Suppression Index,” which measured the relationship between Coinbase’s selloffs and XRP price caps. He stated that the index showed a 0.87 correlation, a level he described as highly significant, while no similar activity was observed with other exchanges. He also highlighted that part of the offloaded XRP reportedly ended up with wallets linked to BlackRock custodianship services. Another portion was moved to Hong Kong-based OTC desks hours before Ripple’s announcement regarding its Asia corridor. Drew argued this pattern suggested insider awareness that retail investors did not possess. Wider Market Implications In his analysis, Drew suggested that if Coinbase is indeed intentionally suppressing XRP, the implications extend beyond individual traders. He outlined that such actions could serve to protect banks tied to SWIFT from liquidity shocks, preserve Ethereum’s market position against XRP’s growing institutional use , and slow what he described as XRP’s “multiplier effect” during key market events. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Drew concluded his thread by warning that Coinbase’s reduction of its XRP reserves should be interpreted as more than routine exchange management. In his view, the scale and timing indicate that XRP poses a structural challenge to established systems. He added that while such suppression can influence price movements in the short term, it cannot be maintained indefinitely, suggesting that XRP could experience significant gains once these pressures subside.

His latest pick is Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , a Layer 2 crypto that fuses meme culture with real blockchain power. With its presale live in September and analysts already whispering about 1000% potential, $LBRETT is quickly climbing the ranks of trending cryptocurrencies and carving out a lane as the next big crypto play. Dogecoin Drops 16% as SEC ETF Decision Looms Large Dogecoin has slipped into a make-or-break zone, falling about 16% from its August peak of $0.25. The token is now hovering near levels not seen since early August, with traders nervously eyeing what could be a defining moment for its price action. Dogecoin price analysis. Source: Crypto.news Much of the buzz centers on the looming SEC decision regarding Dogecoin exchange-traded funds . Bitwise faces an October 18 deadline, while Grayscale and 21Shares follow in November and January. If approved together, these funds could spark fresh momentum, echoing earlier moves seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Dogecoin ETF Odds. Source: Polymarket Traders are divided but cautiously optimistic. Polymarket data shows an 80% chance of approval, up from just 44% in June. Even so, DOGE’s inflows would likely fall short of Ethereum and Bitcoin. Still, if Dogecoin ETFs attract only 3% of its market cap, that would represent a solid $3 billion boost. Layer Brett Blends Meme Spirit With Layer 2 Blockchain Power Instead of being just another meme token chasing short-lived hype, Layer Brett feels like a revolution with a smiley face. The project takes the wild, unpredictable spirit of memes and fuses it with the strength of a full Layer 2 blockchain. It’s the escape route from slow Layer 1 congestion, and it’s already drawing crypto investors who want both fun and function. Onboarding couldn’t be simpler. Instead of complicated exchange processes, all you need to do is connect MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load ETH, USDT, or even use a fiat card, and you’re in. For newcomers who often find crypto intimidating, LBRETT’s zero KYC and level of simplicity is a real game-changer. Layer Brett is also serious about transparency. Every action is visible on-chain, so holders know exactly what’s happening with their tokens. In an industry where trust is everything, $LBRETT proves that clear, decentralized tracking is built into the DNA of the project. Security is another pillar. Thanks to its advanced Layer 2 architecture, $LBRETT functions like a digital fortress, guarding against exploits and hacks that have plagued other altcoins. Investors can feel confident knowing their assets aren’t just growing—they’re protected. Conclusion Dogecoin just stumbled with a 16% dip, and with ETF approvals still uncertain, the entire meme coin space feels like it’s walking on eggshells. That’s exactly why Layer Brett is turning heads. It’s not relying on hype alone. It is combining meme culture with the strength of a true Layer 2 blockchain. At the moment, the presale is priced at $0.0055 and edging toward $0.0058, with investors already contributing close to $3 million. Early stakers can still lock in high rewards, though they’ll shrink as more participants rush in. With such momentum building around the crypto presale, why sit back when you can jump in? Layer Brett is still in presale, but it won’t be forever. Get in now before prices rise and rewards drop.

Developed by the team behind the online IDE StackBlitz , it is designed for both experienced developers seeking to accelerate their workflow and non-technical users looking to create working prototypes. Unlike most AI code assistants that provide snippets, Bolt AI ‘s key differentiator is its ability to build a fully functional, end-to-end application—including the frontend, backend, and database—in a matter of minutes, all without requiring any local setup. How Bolt AI Works Bolt AI uses a generative AI agent to translate text instructions into code that runs directly within its browser-based development environment, powered by WebContainers . Prompt-to-App Generation : A user describes their app idea in a chat window (e.g., “Build a CRM with contact notes and a Kanban board”). The AI then generates the entire application, including the front-end ( React with Tailwind CSS ), the back-end ( Node.js ), and the database schema ( Prisma with PostgreSQL ). Browser-Native Environment : The entire development process, from code generation to a live preview, happens within the user’s browser, eliminating the need for local installations or complex configuration. Iterative Development : Users can either edit the generated code manually within the built-in editor or continue to refine the application by giving additional prompts to the AI. One-Click Deployment : Once satisfied, users can deploy the live application directly from the platform via integrations with services like Vercel or export the source code for full ownership. Key Differentiators: Bolt AI vs. Other Tools Bolt AI is fundamentally different from other AI tools in its approach to application development. It occupies a unique position in the market, bridging the gap between traditional AI code assistants and no-code platforms. Bolt AI vs. AI Code Editors (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI) : Focus : Bolt AI focuses on generating a complete, production-ready application from scratch , whereas tools like GitHub Copilot are designed to assist an experienced developer by providing context-aware code completion and suggestions within their existing codebase. Target User : Bolt AI is built for both developers who need to rapidly prototype and beginners with no coding experience. AI code editors are strictly for experienced developers. Output : Bolt AI generates a fully functional, full-stack application . AI code editors generate code snippets or functions that a developer must integrate into a larger project. Bolt AI vs. No-Code Platforms (e.g., Bubble, UI Bakery) : Focus : Bolt AI is a code-first tool that generates standard, portable code that developers can own and edit. No-code tools are visual-first , using a drag-and-drop interface to build an application within their proprietary ecosystem. Flexibility : Bolt AI provides access to the raw code, offering more flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in. No-code platforms often make it difficult to export and migrate applications. Backend : Bolt AI generates real backend logic and a database schema, giving users a true full-stack solution from a single prompt. No-code tools often have their own built-in, simplified backend and database that are not externally portable. In essence, Bolt AI streamlines the entire development process by removing the tedious initial setup and boilerplate coding, allowing users to go from an idea to a deployable app faster than ever before.

This new entrant in the crypto market merges the playful essence of meme culture with robust Layer 2 blockchain technology. With the buzz around its presale this September, financial pundits are hinting at a potential 1000% surge in value, positioning $LBRETT as a trendsetter in the evolving crypto landscape. Dogecoin's Current Market Struggles Recently, Dogecoin experienced a significant drop, declining nearly 16% from its previous high. This downturn has traders on edge as they anticipate the upcoming SEC decisions on potential Dogecoin ETFs. This period is crucial as it could dictate the future trajectory of DOGE's valuation. See Dogecoin's historical data Key to the Dogecoin discourse is the SEC's pending decision on ETFs linked to DOGE, expected later this year and early next year. Market optimism varies, but there's hope that approval could propel Dogecoin's market cap significantly higher, much like earlier seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Further insights on Dogecoin ETFs Despite the tumultuous market sentiments, the Polymarket odds show a rise in confidence with an 80% chance of ETF approval, a stark increase from earlier predictions. Explore more on Dogecoin ETF odds at Polymarket The Rise of Layer Brett Shifting focus from the traditional meme token model, Layer Brett introduces a promising blend of humor and high functionality. Its inception represents not just a meme or a fad but a structured Layer 2 solution aimed at decongesting the slower Layer 1 networks. The platform ensures easy onboarding, requiring users merely to connect their wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, a straightforward approach that appeals to crypto novices. The transparency and security protocols are rigorous, maintaining a transparent ledger of transactions and providing robust protection against potential security threats. Layer Brett's ongoing presale has already attracted nearly $3 million in investments, with the price per token gradually nearing $0.0058. It's a crucial time for investors to get involved before the potential surge post-presale.

The caution stems from analyst PlanC’s argument that relying on past halving cycles to predict price peaks is statistically flawed. PlanC compared it to the coin toss fallacy, warning traders that BTC’s history doesn’t guarantee a repeat. “There’s no statistical evidence for a Q4 peak,” he said, “market conditions have changed so much since previous cycles. Bitcoin ETF and corporate treasury holdings have changed the game, old cycle based forecasts are useless.” [ ASK A QUESTION LIVE: https://t.co/pSG4Cr3R6J ] PlanC’s analysis identifies a disconnect between bullish Q4 Bitcoin price predictions and statistical probability.

Easier monetary conditions historically benefit Bitcoin, which loves a weaker dollar and lower borrowing costs. “Labor market weakness gives the Fed room to cut rates,” one strategist said, highlighting how this macro backdrop may reduce downside risks for BTC. While short-term caution remains, a dovish Fed could help steady Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Short- and Long-Term Technical Outlook The Bitcoin price prediction is neutral, as indicated by the 4-hour chart, which shows BTC forming an ascending triangle with resistance at $113,400 and higher lows since late August. The 50-SMA at $110,021 is supporting price action, and the 200-SMA at $112,606 is the pivot. RSI is at 50, showing consolidation with mild bullish divergence; momentum is stabilizing. BTC/USD Daily Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC breaks above $113,400 on strong volume, upside targets at $115,400 and $117,150 come into play. Failure at resistance could drag prices back toward $108,770 support. BTC/USD Weekly Price Chart – Source: Tradingview From a long-term view, BTC remains inside a rising weekly channel. The next major resistance sits near $134,500, with Fibonacci levels projecting potential gains toward $171,000 and even $231,000 if momentum accelerates. Support between $95,000 and $100,000 should attract buyers, keeping the broader uptrend intact. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $14.1 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012865—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $12.67, with a possible maximum trading value of $13.51 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $20.26 and $21.95, with an average price of $21.11. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ripple Token XRP Price $2.80 (-1.08%) Market cap $167.42B Trading volume (24-hour) $5.89B Circulating supply 59.61B XRP All-time high $3.65 on July 18, 2025 All-time low $0.002802 on Jul 7, 2014 24-hour high $2.88 24-hour low $2.81 XRP price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 5.18% 50-day SMA $3.07 200-day SMA $2.50 Sentiment Neutral Fear and greed index 48 (Neutral) Green days 9/30 (30%) XRP price analysis: XRP struggles to maintain $2.8 TL;DR Breakdown XRP price analysis confirmed a mixed trend as the price decreased to $2.80. Cryptocurrency lost 1.08% of its value. XRP may find support around $2.75. On September 6, 2025, XRP price analysis revealed a mixed trend, with a bearish bias clearly noted. The coin’s price is currently trading at $2.80 after a slight depreciation. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost 1.08% of its worth in the last 24 hours. This creates a risky environment for intraday traders, as the altcoin is slowly shedding value once again after a small recovery observed yesterday. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP confirms a mixed trend with bearish pressure. The XRP/USD price has depreciated to $2.80 in the last 24 hours. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies the presence of selling pressure, as the market seems unwilling to accept a price above $2.80. XRP/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the volatility. The Bollinger bands are contracting, but the indicator’s arms are still far apart, leading to high volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $3.10. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $2.69. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 43.43 in the past 24 hours. The descending curve on the RSI graph reflects a rising selling momentum. If the bearish momentum continues to intensify, further downside is possible. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of the XRP coin also confirmed a bearish trend in the market, as the sellers have stepped in to prevent losses, which is suppressing the price below $2.80. The XRP/USD value has recently decreased to $2.80 in the past few hours, and it is now trending below its moving average. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands are maintaining their distance, as the volatility is mild. This mild volatility signifies lesser market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $2.87, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $2.78, securing the support. This trend indicates a narrow range for price oscillation. The RSI indicator is trending near the center of the neutral region. Its value has decreased to 46.72 in the last four hours. This decrease is represented by a downward RSI curve. Sellers have been ruling the market for the last four hours. This has resulted in instability for traders.

Ripple price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events, as the price movement is minimal. The coin’s value has decreased to a low of $2.80 over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost up to 1.08 percent of its value. Technical indicators give neutral signals, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, bringing the price to $2.80 during the day. The RSI decreased to 43.43 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.22 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $21.95 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported on Canary Capital’s updated S-1 for XRP spot ETF with SEC. The ETF will hold XRP directly and trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange if it gets approval. This move is also perceived as a major milestone for XRP, making it to the mainstream in US markets. XRP price prediction September 2025 According to XRP price prediction, in September 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.39. The average trading price is expected to be $2.92 for the month, while the lowest it can go, as per XRP cost estimation, is $2.40, considering the current XRP sentiment. Period Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) September 2025 $2.40 $2.92 $3.39 XRP price prediction 2025 The XRP price prediction for 2025 suggests that the price could reach a maximum of $5.07 by the end of the year, considering its technological utility and enhancement of cross-border payments.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In September, XRP is trending near the $2.8 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-06 10:00:00

Both tokens have seen steady interest, but neither has sparked the explosive price action that traders are looking for in today’s crypto market. That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping up. With its presale nearing $400 million, BlockDAG is doing more than just selling coins, it’s positioning itself for one of the boldest crypto entries of 2025. Early participants have already achieved a 2,900% return on investment (ROI), and excitement continues to build as adoption expands. Compared to HYPE and DOT, BlockDAG is shaping up as the coin with the greatest potential for big returns. BlockDAG Nears $400M Presale: A Game-Changer BlockDAG has flipped the script with a presale that’s attracting global attention. Rather than relying on hype alone, it’s delivering measurable traction before launch, positioning itself as one of the top crypto picks for Q4. The presale has nearly raised $400 million, showing momentum is far from slowing. Over 25 billion coins have been sold, with the current flat price set at $0.0013. Early buyers from Batch 1 at $0.001 are already seeing returns of 2,900%. With projections pointing toward a $1 long-term price, today’s participants still have substantial upside as BlockDAG moves closer to its official debut. Whale buyers are driving the price higher, too. Recently, two big holders entered the leaderboard with buys of $4.4 million and $4.3 million. This has ignited fierce competition among major buyers. Retail buyers are also getting in quickly, knowing that this type of presale opportunity won’t come around again. With over 3 million active users on the X1 miner app and thousands of X10 miners already shipped worldwide, it’s clear that BlockDAG is not just a concept; it’s a project already delivering both products and momentum. For traders chasing profits, the real draw is its rapid adoption and strong ROI potential, positioning BlockDAG as one of the best crypto picks heading into 2025. HYPE Market Trend: Liquidity Focus with Room for Growth The Hyperliquid (HYPE) market has caught a lot of attention in recent weeks. Traders are watching its liquidity-focused design and how it’s gaining ground on decentralized exchanges. While the price has remained stable, some analysts believe there could be more upside if trading volumes continue to increase. However, HYPE has yet to make a massive price move, and some consider it a slow-burning option for long-term holders, rather than a short-term profit-maker. As a result, some traders are treating HYPE as a mid-term play, which makes it attractive to those who prefer a steadier approach. However, for those looking to make quick profits, HYPE may not be the best choice. Its potential for big returns feels more distant when compared to fast-moving presales like BlockDAG, which is offering instant multipliers and rapid growth. Traders looking for short-term high returns might want to keep their eyes on HYPE’s progress but consider stronger opportunities for immediate gains. Polkadot Market Prediction: Watching Resistance Levels Polkadot (DOT) has been hovering between $3.82 and $3.93, with traders keeping an eye on whether it can break through the $4.37 resistance. The technical indicators show a neutral outlook, with the relative strength index (RSI) sitting around 46. Bollinger Bands also suggest DOT is nearing oversold territory. Analysts predict a near-term push toward $4.15, with the broader range expected to be between $3.97 and $4.30. Looking at the longer term, the Polkadot (DOT) market prediction for 2025 covers a wide range of scenarios, from conservative estimates between $2.60 and $4.40, to more bullish forecasts that see DOT hitting $13.90 or higher. Some even expect DOT to break $50 by 2025, depending on whether key resistance points fall. At present, all eyes are on whether DOT can break through the $4.37 mark and begin a new rally. Summing Up: Why BlockDAG Is the Top Pick Right Now The Hyperliquid (HYPE) market has shown steady movement, with traders waiting for the next breakout in decentralized finance. Polkadot (DOT), on the other hand, is sitting near key resistance levels, with potential for a price surge if it can break past the $4.37 mark. While both of these assets show promise, neither is drawing the kind of attention that BlockDAG is right now. With nearly $400 million raised in its presale and a flat price of $0.0013, BlockDAG is rewriting the rules of early-stage crypto investing. Early buyers from Batch 1 at $0.001 have already secured gains of 2,900%, and momentum continues to build. For those asking what the best crypto to buy now is, the answer is clear: BlockDAGwhere the final window before launch could deliver some of 2025’s biggest profits.

MUTM’s Early Growth Mirrors Solana’s 2021 Breakout Surge,https://timestabloid.com/is-this-the-next-defi-crypto-to-explode-mutms-early-growth/,"Every cycle, a handful of tokens break out of obscurity and become defining stories in crypto. In 2021, Solana (SOL) was one of those names, climbing from under $1 to more than $200 within a year and turning early believers into millionaires. The lesson was clear: explosive growth comes when utility meets a low entry price. Now in 2025, analysts are asking whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be on the verge of a similar breakout, as its presale momentum, DeFi mechanics, and early adoption arc echo Solana’s breakout surge. Solana’s 2021 Breakout Solana’s rise wasn’t an accident, the network delivered something the market was hungry for—fast, scalable transactions and low fees. Combined with a booming NFT scene and rapid developer adoption, it became a go-to alternative to Ethereum when congestion was at its peak. Early participants who bought in below $1 witnessed life-changing returns when SOL touched $200+ during the bull run. The core takeaway is that Solana had utility from the outset. It wasn’t just another token with a vague roadmap; it launched with real functionality that attracted developers and users almost immediately. That’s the parallel many analysts are drawing with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) today. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. So far, the project has already raised more than $15.4 million and brought in over 16,100 holders, signaling strong investor conviction. Beyond the numbers, Mutuum Finance is a DeFi protocol built around lending, borrowing, and liquidating, uniting all three functions within one ecosystem. Lenders supply assets to earn yield, borrowers access overcollateralized loans, and liquidators help maintain balance by securing collateral at discounted rates when positions fall below safety thresholds. Those who entered early at $0.01 in Phase 1 are already up 250%, underscoring why analysts emphasize the importance of getting in before each price stage closes. At the current $0.035 price, investors are positioning themselves for nearly 100% gains by launch, and with analysts predicting that MUTM will surge well beyond its listing value once trading begins, the potential for even greater returns post-launch is what continues to drive growing demand. To illustrate the opportunity, consider a $1,200 investment at today’s $0.035 price. That secures about 34,300 MUTM tokens. At the $0.06 listing price, this position would already be worth roughly $2,100, delivering a near 100% gain before the market even reacts. Once MUTM climbs to $0.70 in the post-launch rally, that same holding would surge to around $24,000. Looking further ahead, at a long-term target of $2.50, the investment expands to more than $85,700, highlighting why analysts believe early entry into MUTM offers the kind of asymmetric upside rarely seen in established cryptocurrencies. To put it simply: early entry into Mutuum Finance isn’t just about catching a trend; it’s about locking in gains ahead of time, much like early Solana buyers did in 2021. Product Utility at Launch One of the strongest arguments for Mutuum Finance is its beta launch aligned with token listing. That means lending and borrowing markets will be live on day one, giving MUTM immediate use. This is a rare move in presale projects, which often launch tokens months before their products go live. By contrast, Mutuum Finance’s approach gives it a credibility boost with both investors and exchanges. Tokens with live products at listing are far more likely to be considered for top-tier exchange listings, which dramatically expand visibility and liquidity. This mirrors Solana’s early trajectory, where strong product utility made it easier for exchanges, developers, and investors to rally around the project. Tokenomics That Drive Structural Demand Beyond timing, Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics are designed to generate ongoing demand and align user activity directly with value creation. mtTokens with yield growth: Whenever users deposit assets like ETH or USDC into Mutuum’s lending pools, they receive mtTokens (such as mtETH or mtUSDC) on a 1:1 basis. Unlike static deposit receipts, mtTokens are dynamic: their redemption value steadily increases as borrowers pay interest into the pool. For example, depositing 1,000 USDC mints 1,000 mtUSDC, which may later be redeemed for 1,050 USDC after interest accrual. The key difference is that these mtTokens are ERC-20 compatible, meaning they can be transferred to another wallet, traded on secondary markets, or even integrated into DeFi platforms, all while continuing to accumulate yield. Dynamic interest rates: Borrowing costs inside Mutuum Finance are determined by utilization rates, the percentage of a pool currently in use. When pools are flush with liquidity, interest rates stay relatively low, encouraging borrowing and ensuring deposited capital is actively deployed. When liquidity is scarce, rates increase, incentivizing borrowers to repay their loans while attracting new deposits from lenders seeking higher yields. For those who prefer certainty, stable rate borrowing is also available, offering fixed repayment costs at a slightly higher entry rate. To prevent imbalances, Mutuum employs a rebalance mechanism, which adjusts stable rates if they drift too far from variable ones, keeping terms fair while protecting overall liquidity. This dual-rate system gives short-term traders flexibility and long-term borrowers predictability. Together, these mechanics ensure that as platform activity grows, token demand scales alongside it, a structural advantage that meme-driven tokens and weaker presales lack. Mutuum Finance ties usage, rewards, and demand into a closed loop, strengthening its long-term growth potential. Security and Confidence Investor trust is a major factor in separating sustainable protocols from short-lived experiments. Mutuum Finance has already completed a CertiK audit with a 95/100 score, validating its smart contracts. On top of this, a bug bounty program incentivizes independent developers to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Together, these measures provide a security foundation that builds confidence in MUTM’s long-term viability. In the same way Solana’s performance metrics earned developer trust in 2021, Mutuum is laying the groundwork for confidence through code integrity and proactive testing. The Next Breakout Candidate? Solana’s story in 2021 proved that when a project combines functionality with accessibility, explosive growth follows. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appears to be crafting a similar path: a presale with strong momentum, a beta launch aligned with listing, tokenomics that create consistent demand, a revenue-generating stablecoin, and audited security. At $0.035, MUTM offers an entry point that larger caps like Solana no longer provide. For investors asking whether this is the next DeFi crypto to explode, analysts increasingly argue that Mutuum Finance may be poised to deliver the kind of breakout gains that defined Solana’s rise just a few years ago.

Expert Shares How Crypto ETFs, Treasuries Could Change The Market",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/corporate-altcoin-season-expert-crypto-etfs-treasuries/,"Bloomberg Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) analyst James Seyffart shared his perspective on the long-awaited altcoin season and how it may differ from previous cycles following the boom of Digital Asset Treasuries and institutional adoption. Related Reading: WLFI Token Controversy: Justin Sun Denies Selling Rumors Following Address Blacklist Altseason Already Here? In a recent interview with Jay Hamilton from Milk Road, James Seyffart, senior analyst and ETF expert at Bloomberg, reaffirmed his stance that the four-year cycle theory has “lost a lot of value,” at least for this cycle. “I’m one of those people not necessarily saying this time is different, but I don’t think we’re going to, you know, peak in later this year and then drop 80%. I just don’t think that’s going to happen anymore,” he stated. The analyst previously explained that with institutional adoption and treasury companies, the cycle’s amplitude will reduce significantly, adding that this theory has gotten “muted” and “It won’t be as strict as on the money, where everything collapses in November or December.” During the Thursday interview, he affirmed that, unlike the previous cycle, the market appears to be experiencing what could be considered a “corporate” altcoin season, driven by institutional adoption, Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs), and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Seyffart considers that DATCOs are “taking a lot of steam” from any potential traditional altcoin season, as “they’ve been on absolute fire.” Based on this, he suggested that in the short term, the highly anticipated altcoin season is occurring on public markets through institutions: The thing is, I just think right now this market is becoming a little more institutionalized (…). I just don’t think altcoins are going to run in the same way it has in years past. Largely because the money that’s mostly driving the performance of things like Bitcoin and ETH right now is institutional money. Altcoin ETFs Demand Won’t Match BTC, ETH The ETF expert asserted that neither institutional money nor the long-awaited approval of multiple altcoin-based ETFs will fuel a rally like the BTC or ETH-based products had at launch, despite the evident interest in the investment products. “Anyone who thinks like, ‘oh, Bitcoin ETFs took in 40 billion, (…) XRP ETF is going to take in the same amount’ or whatever. That’s just not how this is going to work. These are longer tail assets,” he added. Recently, Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg claimed that the XRP spot ETFs could hit $5 billion worth of inflows in their first month. He pointed out that after BTC, XRP is the most recognized token among Wall Street investors, which could drive significant adoption from the start and even outperform Ethereum ETFs. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Redemption Controversy Over? Hoskinson Shares IOG Audit Results Seyffart explained that there will be demand for the altcoin-based investment products, and “there will probably be multiple products for each of these assets to do well.” He pointed out that they will not capture the same institutional capital as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, “but they’ll be trading vehicles.” However, the Bloomberg analyst expects basket products that combine multiple assets to attract significantly more interest from institutional capital, arguing that investment advisors prefer asset diversification.

Its growing reputation for providing straightforward assessments has made its predictions a reference point for traders and analysts alike. With XRP holding near the $2.80 level as of early September, attention has turned to how Grok expects the token to perform by the end of the month. XRP’s Current Position XRP has maintained relative stability in recent weeks, trading within a narrow range despite broader volatility in the cryptocurrency market. The digital asset’s current price of around $2.82 reflects a balance between bullish expectations of institutional adoption and bearish caution tied to regulatory uncertainty. Market participants continue to monitor whether XRP can break decisively above the $3 mark, a level that many analysts view as critical for further upward momentum. Some research firms have suggested that a rally to the $3.20 to $3.40 zone is achievable if buying pressure accelerates. Others, however, have warned of possible retracements toward $2.50 should support levels weaken. This divergence in outlook underscores the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s short-term trajectory. Grok’s Prediction Amid these competing views, Grok has released its own assessment for XRP’s end-of-month performance. The AI platform projects that XRP will trade near $2.65 on September 30, 2025, placing its forecast on the more conservative side of current predictions. Grok explained its reasoning by stating, “XRP is likely to close September near $2.65, reflecting modest downward pressure but without signs of a sharp correction.” By positioning its outlook slightly below the present trading range, Grok suggests that XRP may experience mild declines over the coming weeks rather than significant gains. This contrasts with the more optimistic targets from analysts who believe that sustained momentum could push the token above $3 before the end of the month.

Broader market conditions remain central to this outcome, with Bitcoin’s direction, institutional activity, and regulatory clarity all influencing sentiment. While bullish scenarios remain possible, Grok’s cautious approach highlights the challenges XRP faces in breaking higher within the short timeframe of the month’s end.
