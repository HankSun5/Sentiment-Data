Increasing optimism about potential rate cuts has pushed prices slightly higher today, with the market remaining on the cusp of a potential breakout. It’s in this context that we examine Maxi Doge (MAXI), PEPENODE (PEPENODE) and Wall Street Pepe (WEPE), three new coins that have the potential to rally strongly later in the year. We explain their features and tokenomics, unpacking just why they’re joining the ranks of the best meme coins in the market. Best Crypto to Buy Now – 5 September Maxi Doge (MAXI) One of the best crypto to buy now, Maxi Doge (MAXI) is an ERC-20 token that opened its presale a few weeks ago. It has already raised over $1.8 million, as investors race to buy the token while it remains cheap. The premise of Maxi Doge is pretty simple: a Dogecoin-themed token, but with a strong focus on hyper-bullish trading. Proudly announcing on its website that it ‘trades with 1000x’ leverage, it’s currently building an online community of traders. It has opened Telegram and Discord channels, where its community members will be able to share tips and coordinate strategies. Not only that, but they’ll be able to compete in regular trading competitions, with the best-performing traders receiving rewards in MAXI and appearing on global leaderboards. This should help encourage greater involvement and engagement with Maxi Doge, which has also allocated 25% of its total supply (150.24 billion MAXI) to a Maxi Fund. Why flex a whip when you can flex retiring entire bloodlines? pic.twitter.com/kncgh2JkYH — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) August 30, 2025 This fund will support new partnerships and ad campaigns, helping to increase awareness of Maxi Doge. Taken with its growing community, this fund should help grow the token quickly, with investors able to join its presale by to its official website . Visit the Official Website Here PEPENODE (PEPENODE) One of the newest presale coins in the market, PEPENODE (PEPENODE) is a self-described ‘mine-to-earn’ token that is gamifying staking. It began its ICO last month, and has so far raised $600,000, a total which is rapidly increasing. POV: You looking for the perfect Node. https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/IFY0q6bUSh — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 1, 2025 What’s exciting about PEPENODE is that it has a novel staking system, one which may attract more users and investors than the average proof-of-stake coin. Its staking setup invites users to build their own virtual mining rigs, paying for virtual nodes using PEPENODE tokens. The more nodes you have, the higher your staking yields will be. As such, this system could incentivize greater demand for PEPENODE, pushing up its price over time. This is ultimately why PEPENODE is one of the more exciting new coins in the market, with investors able to join its presale at the PEPENODE website . It’s currently available at $0.0010449, although this price will rise every 3 days until the sale ends. Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Unlike the two coins above, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) has already closed its presale, which it ended in February after raising over $73 million. This made it one of the biggest presales of recent years, and since launching WEPE has been listed on such exchanges as MEXC, KCEX, XT.com, Uniswap, and Bilaxy. It’s currently up by more than 260% since the end of May, making it one of the best-performing coins over this timeframe. Excitingly, it’s in the process of launching a Solana-based version of its WEPE token, which currently runs on Ethereum. This will enable it to benefit from Solana’s greater speed and scalability, as well as from its growing base of users. It will burn pre-existing Ethereum-based WEPE whenever someone buys the new Solana-based version, at a ratio of 1:1. Launching on Solana You can buy early Every dollar buy on $SOL = burns $WEPE on ETH Once ETH $WEPE hits $0.001 → $SOL Peg goes 1:1 Sol buy = Eth burn New site, new plans, the Solana expansion begins pic.twitter.com/c3GBYJZliX — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) August 19, 2025 This will keep its total supply at the same level, having burned 2,794,724,039 WEPE so far.

Pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan sees the announcement as a clear signal of real-world adoption. In June, Webus revealed plans for a $300M XRP treasury reserve managed by Samara Alpha. Webus International (NASDAQ: WETO), through its travel brand Wetour, has entered a strategic alliance with Air China. The collaboration offers access to the airline’s PhoenixMiles loyalty program, reaching over 60 million members worldwide. As part of this initiative, Wetour plans to enable support for XRP payments, with the goal of facilitating faster settlements, blockchain-based vouchers, and tokenized rewards. Pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan weighed in, acknowledging that the press announcement’s wording, “XRP payment support,” may be ambiguous. Critics may argue it doesn’t guarantee that XRP will be used in actual transactions, but nonetheless, Morgan sees it as a clear signal of real-world adoption.

That surge boosted the ETH ecosystem plays and lit up the whole alt scene before cooling off. Sentiment’s still riding bullish, though, with regulators turning friendlier on crypto, and Deepseek predicts that momentum will stay alive. Bitcoin dropped hard from its August peak at 124K down to under 107K but managed to climb back above 110 K. Still, the market feels shaky, and support could slip fast. With a 96% chance of a September rate cut, uncertainty is heavy. Even so, Deepseek AI is sticking to a bullish long-term prediction. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Predicts $5+ If ETF Gets Approved Some of DeepSeek’s calls might sound unattainable, but they fit when you check XRP’s already wild year. 2025 turned into its breakout run, beating the SEC, ripping past $1, and stacking 400% gains since then. Deepseek backing that momentum too, predicts the rally’s far from over, and another leg is on deck. A mysterious XRP whale, later tied to Kraken, recently moved millions in one shot, and it looks like a clear sign that big players are stacking up before the next leg higher, feeding into the bullish XRP price calls. With Trump leaning heavily into crypto and reportedly locking in a deal to buy 684.4 million CRO, it’s obvious that adoption is speeding up like crazy. XRP’s own adoption this year has been on another level. The XRP Mastercard hit the market, putting it in the trillion-dollar credit card space. At the same time, Bloomberg now sees an 85% chance of ETF approval in October—a move that could unleash serious institutional inflows. Meanwhile, B3 Network, a layer-3 chain on Base, linked up with XRP Commons to bring gaming to XRPL, adding fresh real-world utility to the Ripple ecosystem. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView The long-term targets for XRP are still bullish. While September tends to be rough on crypto, rate cuts on the horizon could change that. XRP has room to break past $5, though volatility is something to watch. The daily chart shows a strong footing after months of consolidating near $2.80, setting up for a bounce. New highs are in play if it clears $3.60, like DeepSeek predicts, while $2.50 and $2.30 stay key reversal zones. Ethereum Textbook Correction Before the Next Reversal DeepSeek isn’t holding back on its Ethereum predictions, especially after the last couple of months of action. ETH just smashed a new all-time high before cooling off to the 4,280 zone, and it’s holding that level with solid strength right now. ETH is sitting at a major decision point right now, holding key support around 4,280. If bulls defend this zone and push back above 4,490, the next big hurdle is 4,700–4,800, and clearing that opens the path toward 5,100. RSI’s down near 36, showing oversold conditions and a likely bounce. MACD is still negative, meaning momentum hasn’t flipped yet, but that could turn quickly. In the short term, ETH looks shaky, but as long as 4,070 holds, there’s room for a recovery. A clean move above 4,490 could set ETH up for another run at fresh highs, maybe even those levels DeepSeek’s been calling for. DeepSeek Predicts PI Coin Hitting $1 With the Help of Its Massive Community and Recent Updates Since launch, PI’s price has been on a steady slide, dropping 88% from over 2.80 to just under 0.34. So why’s DeepSeek still bullish for the rest of the year? It all comes down to the massive community backing the coin and its expanding user base. In addition, Pi has been rolling out solid updates. The latest is a Linux version of its node software, making it easier for more validators and devs to join. They also launched Pi App Studio, letting even non-coders build on the network, which could push adoption further. The RSI is sitting around 44, leaving plenty of room for upside. The MACD is flat but showing early signs of a momentum shift. The key resistance levels to watch are $0.80, $1.10, and $2.50. If PI clears those, it could easily run toward the $4 target that DeepSeek is calling out. If that plays out, it really shows how much weight community power carries in driving crypto projects. That’s exactly why memecoins are successful, and it’s where Pepenode steps in as one of the hottest coins to scoop up in the market right now. PepeNode Tiered Nodes Reward Early Adopters PepeNode is a mine-to-earn memecoin and the native currency of a virtual mining ecosystem, doubling as a governance token that gives holders a say in how the platform evolves. So far, it’s raised $675,971 for its mining project, where users can buy meme nodes, upgrade facilities, and earn rewards along the way. Each reward cycle also triggers token burns, making the system deflationary and boosting scarcity over time. Getting in early matters. PepeNode’s tiered-node staking setup gives the first tiers more reward-generating power than later buyers, making early adoption extra valuable. At the time of writing, staking rewards return 2,914 %. The distribution of PEPENODE token rewards is at a rate of 3,001 PEPENODE tokens per produced ETH block. The rewards are disbursed over a two-year period. To grab PEPENODE before the crowd, jump on the PepeNode presale site . You can buy using ETH, BNB, or USDT (both ERC-20 and BEP-20), plus they even accept credit and debit cards for easy access.

This includes the outlook for XRP, Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which have all benefited from the expectation that the Fed will finally cut rates when it meets on the 17-18 of this month. These three coins have all risen in the past 24 hours, and while their respective gains aren’t substantial, they prepare the ground nicely for a bigger rally in the next couple of weeks. And given their fundamentals, each of them could have a very strong end to the year, potentially reaching new highs. Crypto Price Prediction Today 5 September XRP (XRP): Ripple Expansion Boosts the Case for New ATH in Q4 Rebounding from a seven-day low of $2.72, XRP is now sitting at $2.84, marking a slight 0.3% gain in the past 24 hours. The altcoin does remain down by 2% in a week and by 3.5% in the last 30 days, yet it boasts a 410% increase in the past year. This makes it one of the best-performing top-20 cryptos across this timeframe, yet its enviably strong fundamentals would suggest that things can only get better in Q4. This is largely because Ripple continues to grow as a business, having thrown off the shackles of its battle with the SEC in early August. It has announced new acquisitions and new partnerships in recent weeks (e.g. in Dubai and Africa ), boosting the bull case for XRP over the medium- and long-term. Source: TradingView XRP’s chart today shows that it’s very close to hitting bottom, at which point it could rebound strongly. Its two main indicators—the MACD (orange, blue) and RSI (yellow)—have both flattened out after several weeks of decline, a sign that buyers are returning to buy XRP at a relative discount. What’s also bullish is that the XRP price has formed a pennant over the past couple of months, from which it may break out very soon. If it does climb above the psychologically important $2 level, it could begin a climb towards $2.50 and $3. And if it breaks its current ATH of $3.65, it could potentially end the year closer to $5. Cardano (ADA): Steady Growth of Layer-One Network Shows Massively Undervalued Native Token ADA has returned to $0.826 today, marking a 1% gain in 24 hours and a 13% increase in the past month. While it has declined in the past week, the crypto price prediction for ADA remains very positive, if only because it’s still massively below its ATH of $3.09, which it set back in September 2021. This failure to set a new record in recent months may be disappointing, but it’s arguable that it gives Cardano the space to outpace market averages in the coming months. This is why Ethereum (ETH) has done recently, and given Cardano’s fundamentals, it could do something similar. Indeed, Cardano is something of a dark horse in the crypto market, with its network growing and evolving steadily . The Cardano blockchain currently has a TVL of $365 million , a figure which has risen by 640% since the beginning of 2023 (while ADA’s price has risen by only 225%). This shows its gradual growth, which gives ADA a great platform for further price appreciation in the longer term. Source: TradingView Its chart today shows it moving into what could be a major position, with ADA also looking like it could break out of a pennant in the very near future. Its MACD and RSI also have flattened out in recent days, suggesting that a period of decline may have reached an end. Given these factors, and given that the coin is still massively undervalued, it could return to $1 in the next few weeks, before rallying above $2.50 by the end of the year. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Undervalued Meme Token Has Fundamentals for Big Xmas Rally At $0.00001226, Shiba Inu has just about posted a 24-hour gain today, while it’s also up by a very modest 0.5% in the past month. However, it has bucked the general trend by posting a loss of 9% in the past year, which may arguably point to serious problems for the coin, which appears to be struggling to attract interest. Having said that, SHIB is also in a position similar to Cardano, in that it’s 85% below its ATH ($0.00008616) and could therefore make big headway in the coming months. Unlike many other meme tokens, Shiba Inu and its team has gone to great lengths to give it more utility, having launched its own DEX ( ShibaSwap ), its own layer-two network , and various dapps . It’s therefore entirely arguable that the market is undervaluing SHIB substantially at the moment, and that it will soon catch up once the market enters full ‘bull mode’ towards the end of the year. Source: TradingView Its chart today suggests that it too is close to a bottom, and may recover strongly soon. The catalyst for a recovery may be the aforementioned FOMC meeting in the middle of September, which could result in a long-awaited rate cut. In such a scenario, the SHIB price could reach $0.000020 by October, and could even end the year above $0.000040. Wall Street Pepe Gains Momentum As It Prepares for Solana Token Launch The crypto price prediction for the three coins above looks very good right now, but there are also other, newer alts that traders may want to consider as they diversify their portfolios. New coins can often outperform the market as they enjoy their initial growth spurts, as we’ve seen with the likes of SPX6900, MemeCore and Pump.fun. One of the newest and most interesting coins showing potential right now is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE), an ERC-20 meme coin that’s currently in the process of launching a Solana-based version of its token.

It’s now taking this impetus and using it as it launches an SLP version of its WEPE, which investors can buy by visiting the Wall Street Pepe website .

Die Aufnahme könnte nicht nur das Unternehmen stärken, sondern auch Bitcoin und den gesamten Kryptomarkt. Doch die Entscheidung liegt beim unabhängigen US Index Committee – und das könnte kritisch auf das Modell schauen. Die Wall Street schaut gespannt auf Michael Saylors Unternehmen Strategy. Der mögliche Aufstieg in den S&P 500 ist nicht nur für Aktionäre spannend, sondern könnte auch die Krypto-Welt kräftig bewegen. Doch trotz beeindruckender Zahlen bleibt am Ende eine entscheidende Hürde: die Zustimmung des US Index Committee. Strategy vor dem großen Sprung Michael Saylors Firma Strategy, früher bekannt als MicroStrategy, hat es fast geschafft. Analysten sehen die Chance auf eine Aufnahme in den berühmten US-Leitindex S&P 500 bei satten 91 Prozent. Das wäre nicht nur ein Prestigeerfolg, sondern ein echter Meilenstein für das Unternehmen. Denn neben Coinbase und Block wäre Strategy erst das dritte Unternehmen mit starker Krypto-Verbindung im Index. 100x growth in 5 years with $BTC . Thinking about the next 5 years… pic.twitter.com/7ZQo2yF2TY — Strategy (@Strategy) August 11, 2025 Der S&P 500 gilt als wichtigstes Barometer der US-Wirtschaft, und ein Platz darin bedeutet automatisch mehr Aufmerksamkeit von Investoren. Für Strategy könnte das einen kräftigen Schub bedeuten. Doch auch die Krypto-Welt blickt gespannt, denn das Unternehmen hält mehr Bitcoin als jede andere Firma weltweit. Warum Strategy so wichtig für Bitcoin ist Strategy hat aktuell 636.505 Bitcoin in der Firmenkasse – eine gigantische Summe, die selbst kleine Länderhaushalte übertrifft. Kein anderes Unternehmen hat eine so große Bitcoin-Treasury. Damit ist Strategy eng mit der Kryptowährung verflochten, und jede Kursbewegung spiegelt sich in beiden Richtungen wider. Würde Strategy in den S&P 500 aufgenommen, kämen automatisch Milliarden von Dollar durch Indexfonds und ETFs ins Spiel. Diese investieren nämlich blind in alle Unternehmen des Index. So könnte der Aktienkurs stabiler werden – und Bitcoin gleich mit profitieren. Der S&P 500 als Türöffner Eine Aufnahme in den S&P 500 bedeutet für Unternehmen weit mehr als nur Ruhm. Viele große Fonds und Privatanleger investieren automatisch in alle enthaltenen Firmen. Das sorgt für verlässliche Nachfrage nach der Aktie und in vielen Fällen für steigende Kurse. Da Strategy so eng mit Bitcoin verbunden ist, würde ein solcher Effekt auch die Kryptowährung stützen. Der Markt könnte dies als Signal werten, dass Bitcoin noch weiter in den klassischen Finanzstrukturen angekommen ist. Für Krypto-Fans wäre das eine Bestätigung, für Skeptiker vielleicht ein Denkanstoß. Damit würde die langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin weiter an Kraft gewinnen. Die harten Kriterien Der Weg in den S&P 500 ist streng geregelt. Unternehmen müssen mindestens 22,7 Milliarden US-Dollar wert sein, über Monate hinweg hohe Handelsvolumina zeigen und vier Quartale in Folge Gewinn machen. Außerdem wird ein Liquiditätsfaktor von mindestens 0,75 verlangt. Strategy erfüllt all diese Anforderungen mit Leichtigkeit. Laut Nasdaq liegt der Börsenwert bei rund 92 Milliarden US-Dollar, das Handelsvolumen ist riesig und die Gewinne der letzten vier Quartale belaufen sich auf über 5 Milliarden US-Dollar. Rein rechnerisch gibt es also kaum etwas zu meckern. Das letzte Wort hat das Komitee Doch Zahlen allein reichen nicht. Die finale Entscheidung trifft das US Index Committee, ein Gremium mit zehn Mitgliedern. Sie stimmen per Mehrheitsbeschluss ab, wer in den Index aufgenommen wird. Dabei zählen nicht nur die harten Fakten, sondern auch weiche Faktoren. Gerade bei Strategy könnte das kritisch sein. Das Modell basiert stark auf Bitcoin, und dieser Markt ist bekanntlich extrem volatil. Ob das Komitee die Nachhaltigkeit des Ansatzes anerkennt oder als Risiko sieht, bleibt spannend. Krypto rückt näher an die Wall Street Sollte Strategy den Sprung schaffen, wäre es ein klares Zeichen: Krypto-Unternehmen gehören zunehmend zur etablierten Finanzwelt. Schon Coinbase und Block haben vorgemacht, wie viel Aufmerksamkeit und Vertrauen der Index mit sich bringt. Strategy könnte diesen Trend weiter verstärken. Damit würden die Grenzen zwischen klassischen Märkten und der Welt der Kryptowährungen noch mehr verschwimmen. Für viele Beobachter ist das ein entscheidender Schritt hin zur langfristigen Akzeptanz digitaler Assets. Chancen für Anleger Für Investoren hätte die Aufnahme gleich mehrere Folgen. Passive Anleger würden automatisch in Strategy investieren, ohne selbst aktiv entscheiden zu müssen. Gleichzeitig könnten Trader von der zusätzlichen Bewegung im Markt profitieren. Auch für Bitcoin selbst könnte das ein Gewinn sein. Mehr Kapital bedeutet mehr Aufmerksamkeit, und die Glaubwürdigkeit der Kryptowährung würde weiter steigen. Wer bisher gezögert hat, könnte durch die S&P-500-Aufnahme Vertrauen gewinnen. Fazit: Zwischen Euphorie und Risiko Strategy steht an der Schwelle zu einem historischen Schritt. Die Aufnahme in den S&P 500 könnte sowohl das Unternehmen als auch Bitcoin und den gesamten Kryptomarkt stärken . Anleger sehen darin große Chancen, und die Aufmerksamkeit ist riesig. Doch Risiken bleiben. Die Entscheidung des US Index Committee ist unberechenbar, und die starke Abhängigkeit von Bitcoin birgt Unsicherheit. Ob Strategy am Ende den Sprung schafft, wird zeigen, wie offen die Wall Street wirklich für Krypto ist. Neue Player wie Bitcoin Hyper Während Strategy die Schlagzeilen dominiert, entstehen im Hintergrund neue Projekte. Ein Beispiel ist Bitcoin Hyper, ein Layer-2-Netzwerk für Bitcoin. Es verspricht blitzschnelle Transaktionen, smarte Verträge und minimale Gebühren. Kurz gesagt: Bitcoin wird nicht nur zum Halten, sondern zum aktiven Nutzen. Noch spannender ist die Kombination aus Bitcoin und Solana-Technologie: Bitcoin HYPER verbindet dabei die Sicherheit und Stabilität von Bitcoin mit der Geschwindigkeit und dem hohen Utility von Solana. Der eigene Token $HYPER bietet Staking-Rewards, Governance-Rechte und die Möglichkeit, in dApps aktiv zu werden. Für frühe Unterstützer ist der Einstieg besonders günstig, und durch die Verbindung zu Bitcoin könnte das Projekt eine spannende Ergänzung im Krypto-Ökosystem werden. Damit vereint Hyper zwei Welten, die bisher getrennt waren – Stabilität und Tempo – und schafft so einen Investment-Case, der auf lange Sicht echten Mehrwert verspricht. Jetzt rechtzeitig einsteigen und $HYPER im Presale kaufen. Hinweis: Investieren ist spekulativ. Bei der Anlage ist Ihr Kapital in Gefahr.

51256998,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=816864,1757113200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51256998.jpeg,"XRP Will Never Crash 90% Again, Says Digital Ascension CEO",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-will-never-crash-90-again-digital-ascension-ceo/,"Jake Clover, CEO of Digital Ascension Group and a long-time XRP advocate, used a new video published on September 3 to deliver an unambiguous message to traders waiting for one last capitulation: he doesn’t think a 90% collapse is coming back. “I would love it too. I don’t think it’s going to happen,” Clover said, arguing that the market already gave skeptics ample time to buy during prolonged sub-$1 ranges. “When it was 50 cents, nobody wanted to buy it… You had three years to buy it at 50 cents or 30 cents or 40 cents or whatever it was. It ain’t coming back.” Will XRP Never Crash By 90% Again? Clover roots that conviction not in a single catalyst but in what he describes as a structural change to XRP’s market microstructure. He repeatedly cites the role of spot exchange-traded products – Bloomberg’s James Seyffart puts SEC approval in 2025 odds at 95% – and the execution algorithms used by institutional liquidity providers as a persistent source of demand that alters the asset’s downside dynamics. “It’s going to be sustained here because of the ETFs, because of the TWAP and VWAP and them entering the market. They’re not letting it come back down,” he said, referring to time- and volume-weighted execution that systematically slices large orders into the market over extended intervals. Related Reading: XRP Millionaires Dump After Major Accumulation Trend, Will It Be A Red September? He frames the current tape as a test the asset has already passed. “If it was going to [crash], there’s a bunch of stuff that rolled up and then it’s back down 90% since it went up. XRP hadn’t done that,” Clover noted, contrasting XRP’s behavior with other, sharper retracements elsewhere in crypto. In his reading, support has repeatedly asserted itself on the cross with Bitcoin as well. “It’s back on the line here where there’s been support on the Bitcoin and XRP chart. I think it’s up from here, especially if Bitcoin keeps going up,” he said, tying XRP’s path to the broader beta of the cycle. Clover also connects his outlook to a suite of prospective macro and market-structure tailwinds. He points to what he calls a “reverse carry trade,” the prospect of “adoption for the backend settlement of the stock market,” and the influence of ETF flows as scenario drivers that could render near-term entry prices largely irrelevant over a longer horizon. In one of the video’s most pointed passages, he underscores that view with a blunt thought experiment on future price levels: “You’re not going to care if you bought it at $2.30 or you bought it at $2.40 or you bought it at $2 when it’s a hundred dollars or $200 or $500.” Related Reading: XRP Will Lead The Next Upswing, Says Analyst — Here’s The Case The operational takeaway he offers to investors is procedural rather than tactical. Clover is explicit that market timing is a losing game for nearly everyone and that disciplined accumulation outperforms attempts to catch exact bottoms. “Dollar cost averaging is going to be your best bet 99.9% of the time,” he said. “Trying to time the market, you’re not going to do it. It’s like 1% of traders that ever timed the market well. And those that dollar cost average in, you’re going to win. Like you can’t, you can’t lose doing that. You’re going to get highs and lows, but your average is going to be pretty fair.” Risk management, in his account, is non-negotiable. He warns explicitly against taking on debt or leverage that compromises basic obligations in order to chase upside. “Don’t leverage yourself or over leverage yourself to the point where you can’t make your bills or can’t pay other stuff,” Clover said, adding that small, regular allocations made only from surplus cash are the appropriate way to express conviction while surviving the volatility that remains endemic to the asset class. If that thesis holds, the implication for strategy—again in Clover’s own words—is to stop waiting for the ghost of an old regime. “I know everybody wants the most they can get on stuff,” he said, “but dollar cost averaging is going to be your best bet… When you have some extra liquidity, buy a little bit.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.87.

XRP, Avalanche (AVAX), and a new viral low-cap altcoin are increasingly seen as leading candidates for investors hunting 1000% gains this cycle. This renewed interest follows a pattern observed in previous bull markets: once Bitcoin establishes momentum, capital rotates into altcoins with higher upside potential. Analysts believe we are entering that phase now, with major projects and early-stage tokens both poised to benefit. Among the low-cap names generating buzz is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project already flagged as one of the best altcoins to buy for aggressive bull run portfolios. XRP Positioned for Institutional Demand Ripple’s XRP has weathered years of regulatory battles, but its outlook in 2025 is dramatically different. With the possibility of XRP ETFs on the horizon and growing use in payment corridors, institutional adoption could drive demand higher. Price projections suggest XRP could rise toward $7–$10 if ETF approvals materialize, delivering the kind of exponential growth long anticipated by its community. Low-Cap Play With High ROI Potential Among presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. Forecasts suggest a 12,000% upside before late-stage euphoria drives the market , making it one of the most talked-about emerging tokens. What differentiates it from others is its transparent roadmap, audited tokenomics, and a strong focus on sustainability across cycles. With exchange listings expected to unlock mass adoption, it’s quickly gaining traction as the low-cap altcoin to watch in 2025. Avalanche (AVAX) Gains Momentum Avalanche is carving out its niche as a high-performance blockchain for DeFi, gaming, and real-world asset tokenization. With low fees and high throughput, it is positioning itself as a direct competitor to Ethereum. Analysts are eyeing the $250–$300 range for AVAX if capital rotation continues, a move that would represent significant upside from current levels. The Viral Low-Cap Trend History shows that each bull run creates a viral low-cap story — from Dogecoin in 2021 to PEPE in 2023. Analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could be that breakout narrative this cycle, particularly given the size of its community growth in just a few months. Viral momentum combined with sound tokenomics creates the kind of formula that has historically led to staggering returns. Conclusion With capital rotation underway, XRP and AVAX stand out as strong contenders for institutional adoption and ecosystem growth. At the same time, viral low-cap altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE represent speculative plays with the potential to deliver massive multiples. For investors who missed Bitcoin and Ethereum early, this could be a second chance to capture exponential returns before altcoin season reaches full swing.

51257058,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81965,1757113245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ethereum and Solana Price Outlook for 2026 – Can They Rally 50%?,https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-and-solana-price-outlook-for-2026-can-they-rally-50/,"The crypto market is never short on speculation, and as 2026 approaches, all eyes are on Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Both blockchains have set bold targets, rolled out upgrades, and captured strong developer activity, leaving investors asking if another 50% rally is within reach. These two networks, often seen as rivals, represent very different approaches to scaling and adoption, but each has carved out its place in the industry. Alongside this discussion, newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing comparisons to Ethereum’s earliest days. Analysts warn that early allocations are already disappearing at record speed, making it one of the fastest-moving presales of the year. With Ethereum and Solana chasing institutional inflows and next-generation upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a potential breakout story for investors who don’t want to miss the next wave of growth. Ethereum: Preparing for Its Next Evolution Ethereum continues to dominate the decentralized economy, powering everything from DeFi to NFTs. Having shifted to proof-of-stake, its next leap involves major scaling updates. Plans for Danksharding and ZK-based proving aim to drastically reduce fees while boosting throughput. If executed smoothly, these could eliminate Ethereum’s long-standing bottlenecks and keep it ahead of competitors. Institutional adoption is also on the horizon. A spot Ethereum ETF could trigger billions in inflows, replicating the surge seen after Bitcoin ETFs. Combined with the rapid growth of Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Linea, Ethereum is setting up a strong case for renewed upward momentum. If ETH surges 50% from its current price level, it would position the top altcoin at around $6,600. Solana: The Challenger With Speed Solana has earned a reputation as the “high-speed chain,” powering games, DeFi platforms, and NFT projects with low costs and rapid settlement times. Its 2026 upgrade cycle centers on the Alpenglow protocol , a redesigned consensus system that could bring near-instant finality. The chain’s ecosystem has already ballooned, with DeFi activity and total value locked (TVL) climbing higher. Talk of a spot Solana ETF adds another layer of potential, as institutional investors begin to view SOL as a long-term strategic asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. If regulatory clarity continues to improve, Solana could cement its position as the go-to high-performance blockchain. If SOL manages to jump 50% or more, it would place the price at around $300 (considering momentum continues to build.) MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early Momentum, Limited Access While Ethereum and Solana fight for dominance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a dark horse. What makes it stand out is the speed of its presale rounds, which are selling out faster than anticipated. Analysts note that early participants could see explosive upside similar to Ethereum’s first breakout phase , with the project’s focus on long-term utility and ecosystem expansion setting it apart from meme-driven tokens. With early access running out quickly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up as a rare early-stage opportunity , where relatively small allocations could turn into life-changing returns if adoption takes off. The 50% Surge: Can ETH and SOL Deliver? For Ethereum and Solana, a 50% rise in 2026 isn’t just possible – it’s within striking distance if everything aligns. Both networks must deliver their ambitious upgrades on time, attract institutional inflows, and fend off competition from new Layer 1 and Layer 2 players. Macro conditions, like interest rates and global risk appetite, will also heavily influence their performance. Conclusion Ethereum is betting on scalability and institutional adoption, while Solana leans on speed and ecosystem growth. If the altcoin season builds up momentum as many experts anticipate, without major setbacks, both assets could see significant gains in the next cycle, and 50% could just be the base case. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about early-stage projects, with presale demand signaling that its window of opportunity may not stay open for long. For investors, 2026 may offer multiple pathways to capture growth—if they position themselves before the market gets crowded.

51258829,575101,1757113258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51258829.jpeg,3 Fresh Wallets Buy $148.8M Ethereum – Signs Of Silent Stacking,https://bitcoinist.com/3-fresh-wallets-buy-148-8m-ethereum-silent-stacking/,"Ethereum is currently undergoing a price correction, slipping below key levels as selling pressure grows across the broader market. Despite this pullback, institutional interest in ETH remains resilient, with major players continuing to add aggressively to their holdings. Analysts have raised the possibility of a deeper correction, pointing to mounting volatility and the inability of ETH to reclaim the $4,500 zone. However, the long-term outlook still leans bullish as onchain data highlights consistent demand from whales and institutions. According to analyst Ted Pillows’ data, large-scale investors have been particularly active in recent days, withdrawing ETH from exchanges and reallocating it into long-term strategies and DeFi protocols. This divergence between short-term price weakness and long-term accumulation highlights Ethereum’s unique position in the current market cycle. While price action may continue to test lower levels in the near term, the fundamentals of Ethereum remain intact, with capital rotation and institutional flows supporting the broader bullish thesis. For investors, the coming weeks could prove decisive, as the market weighs short-term volatility against the persistent confidence of whales betting on Ethereum’s long-term strength. Whale Accumulation Reinforces Ethereum Position According to Pillows, Ethereum continues to attract large-scale buyers despite the recent correction, with data showing that three fresh wallets purchased $148,860,000 worth of ETH in the past few days. Such aggressive accumulation reinforces the conviction that institutions and whales maintain in Ethereum’s long-term potential, even as short-term volatility pressures the broader crypto market. While many retail investors are cautious, institutional players appear to be quietly stacking ETH, preparing for the next leg of growth. Their actions indicate not only faith in Ethereum’s fundamentals but also a recognition of its expanding role in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and as collateral within the broader crypto economy. The conviction displayed by these whales is a positive signal for the market, and one of the key reasons why ETH has been outperforming Bitcoin recently. As capital rotation continues to favor Ethereum, it suggests that big players are positioning for stronger relative performance compared to BTC. Technically, ETH must hold above the $4,000 level to preserve its bullish structure and maintain strength against Bitcoin. A breakdown below this threshold could weaken its position, but holding firm would provide the foundation for another surge. With whale conviction still rising, Ethereum’s resilience in this consolidation phase could set the stage for its next major move. Consolidation Above Key Price Levels Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $4,414, showing resilience after weeks of heightened volatility. The daily chart highlights a period of sideways consolidation just below the $4,500 resistance, a key level that bulls must reclaim to confirm renewed momentum. The moving averages provide important context: the 50-day SMA around $4,115 acts as the nearest short-term support, while the 100-day SMA at $3,368 remains further below, reinforcing the bullish structure despite the correction. The 200-day SMA sits at $2,721, well beneath the current price, underscoring ETH’s long-term strength in this cycle. Recent price action shows repeated attempts to break through the $4,500 level, each time meeting selling pressure. This rejection pattern highlights market caution, as traders anticipate further tests of support levels before a decisive move. Should ETH fail to hold above $4,200, the next significant demand area lies closer to $3,900. On the other hand, if buying pressure resumes, particularly from whales and institutions that have been accumulating aggressively, a breakout above $4,500 could quickly target the $4,800 region. For now, Ethereum remains in consolidation mode, balancing between strong fundamentals and the weight of short-term selling.

This monumental Robinhood S&P 500 inclusion marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company, but for the broader cryptocurrency landscape, further cementing digital assets within mainstream finance. However, not all crypto-related entities shared in this success, with one prominent strategy missing out. What Does S&P 500 Inclusion Mean for Robinhood? Becoming part of the S&P 500 is more than just a listing; it is a powerful symbol of legitimacy and market prominence. The S&P 500 index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, representing a significant portion of the total U.S. stock market value. For Robinhood, this inclusion brings several key benefits: Enhanced Visibility: Being part of such a widely followed index dramatically increases Robinhood’s exposure to institutional and retail investors alike. Increased Investment Flow: Many index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are designed to mirror the S&P 500. Consequently, these funds will automatically buy Robinhood shares, leading to increased demand and potentially more stable valuations. Credibility and Trust: Inclusion signals that Robinhood meets rigorous financial and operational standards, boosting investor confidence and market credibility. This development is a testament to Robinhood’s growth and its established position within the financial ecosystem. It also highlights the evolving nature of traditional indices to include companies that cater to modern investment trends, including cryptocurrency. How Does Robinhood’s S&P 500 Inclusion Impact the Crypto Market? Robinhood’s entry into the S&P 500 is particularly significant for the cryptocurrency space. It brings the total number of crypto-related companies in the index to three, joining industry giants like Coinbase and Block (formerly Square). This growing representation underscores a critical trend: Mainstream Legitimacy: Each new inclusion of a crypto-linked company in a major index further validates digital assets as a legitimate and integral part of the global financial system. Broader Investor Exposure: Institutional investors who might have previously shied away from direct crypto investments can now gain indirect exposure through companies like Robinhood within their diversified portfolios. Normalizing Digital Assets: This move helps to normalize cryptocurrency trading and ownership, potentially encouraging more traditional investors to explore the digital asset market. The collective presence of these companies within the S&P 500 suggests that the line between traditional finance and the crypto world is increasingly blurring, paving the way for greater integration and innovation. The Curious Case of Strategy: A Puzzling Omission Amidst Criteria? While Robinhood celebrates its inclusion, the report also noted that a company referred to as ‘Strategy’ was not included in the latest rebalancing, despite reportedly meeting all the requirements for inclusion. This detail raises questions about the selection process and the competitive landscape within the financial technology sector. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the S&P 500, uses a committee to make decisions on index additions and removals. While quantitative factors like market capitalization, liquidity, and profitability are crucial, qualitative factors can also play a role. The specific reasons for ‘Strategy’s’ omission are not detailed, but it highlights the intense competition and the discretionary nature of such high-profile index decisions. For other companies vying for similar recognition, this serves as a reminder that meeting basic criteria does not always guarantee inclusion, and the path to mainstream acceptance can be complex and challenging. Actionable Insights for Investors After Robinhood’s S&P 500 Inclusion For investors, this development offers several insights into the evolving market: Diversification Opportunities: The increasing presence of crypto-related companies in major indices provides new avenues for diversified exposure to the digital asset economy through traditional stock investments. Market Trends: This signals a continued trend towards the institutionalization and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Investors should observe how these companies perform within the index. Regulatory Environment: As more crypto-linked firms join traditional indices, the regulatory landscape will likely continue to adapt, potentially bringing more clarity and stability to the crypto market. Understanding these shifts can help investors make more informed decisions about their portfolios, balancing traditional assets with exposure to the rapidly growing digital economy. In conclusion, the Robinhood S&P 500 inclusion is a landmark event for the financial sector, underscoring the undeniable integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream investment vehicles. While it’s a significant win for Robinhood and the broader crypto market, the omission of ‘Strategy’ reminds us of the competitive and nuanced nature of index selection. This move undoubtedly paves the way for a more intertwined future between traditional finance and digital assets, promising exciting developments for investors and the market as a whole. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the S&P 500 index? The S&P 500 is a stock market index that represents the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It is widely regarded as one of the best gauges of large-cap U.S. equities and the overall health of the U.S. stock market. Why is Robinhood’s inclusion significant for crypto? Robinhood’s S&P 500 inclusion is significant because it further legitimizes cryptocurrency within mainstream finance. As a major platform for crypto trading, its presence in a top index increases institutional exposure and helps normalize digital assets for a broader investor base. Which other crypto-related companies are already in the S&P 500? With Robinhood’s addition, there will be three crypto-related companies in the S&P 500: Coinbase, Block (formerly Square), and now Robinhood. What does Robinhood’s S&P 500 inclusion mean for its investors? For Robinhood investors, inclusion in the S&P 500 typically means increased visibility, enhanced liquidity for shares, and potential for more stable stock performance due to automatic buying by index funds. It also boosts the company’s credibility. Why was ‘Strategy’ not included despite meeting requirements? While the exact reasons for ‘Strategy’s’ omission are not publicly detailed, S&P Dow Jones Indices’ committee considers both quantitative and qualitative factors for index selection. Even if a company meets basic criteria, other strategic considerations or discretionary decisions by the committee can influence the final outcome.

51258137,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81934,1757115019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,AI Models Forecast Where XRP Could Trade by the End of 2025,https://timestabloid.com/ai-models-forecast-where-xrp-could-trade-by-the-end-of-2025/,"Artificial intelligence platforms ChatGPT and Google Gemini have shared projections for where XRP might stand by December 2025, taking into account several potential catalysts for Ripple and its native token. Ripple is currently navigating a series of major initiatives that could significantly affect XRP’s valuation . One of the most closely watched is the potential approval of a U.S.-based spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP . Prediction market Polymarket assigns a 91% probability that regulators will authorize at least one ETF before the year ends. In addition, Ripple has applied for a national bank charter in the United States. The filing, made in July, is now under review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, with a decision expected by late October. Securing this charter would allow Ripple to operate more directly within the country’s regulated banking framework. The company is also expanding internationally. In recent weeks, Ripple has formed partnerships with African fintech firms, including Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card, to advance cross-border payment solutions using RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. RLUSD has quickly gained traction, with its market capitalization surpassing $700 million. Since many RLUSD transfers are settled through the XRP Ledger, its growing adoption indirectly increases XRP’s utility. ChatGPT’s Forecast for December 2025 At present, XRP is priced at $2.84 , with a market capitalization of about $169 billion. Asked about its potential price by the end of 2025, ChatGPT outlined several possibilities based on different outcomes. In a conservative case, if ETF approval moves forward but the bank charter is delayed, ChatGPT expects XRP could climb to a range of $5 to $7. This would represent an increase of roughly 80% to 150% from current levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Should both the ETF and bank charter receive approval while RLUSD adoption continues to rise, the model projects a stronger outcome, with XRP advancing to between $10 and $15. This scenario would imply a market capitalization approaching $600 billion. Under the most optimistic assumptions, where institutional and retail demand accelerate together, ChatGPT believes XRP could even exceed $20 in a speculative rally. Google Gemini’s Perspective Google Gemini offered a more cautious outlook. According to its assessment, an ETF approval alone could lift XRP by about 60%, placing the token near $4.48. If Ripple also secures the bank charter, Gemini foresees an additional 20% to 25% increase, bringing XRP into the $5.38 to $5.60 range. With sustained growth in RLUSD adoption and strategic partnerships, Gemini concludes the year-end price could settle between $5.65 and $6.16. While these projections highlight the potential impact of upcoming events, both platforms stressed that the figures are speculative. Market conditions, regulatory outcomes, and adoption rates remain uncertain, and there is no guarantee XRP will respond as modeled even if the developments occur.

Recently, WLFI made headlines with a significant move aimed at bolstering crypto security . Their proactive decision to blacklist 272 addresses over the past week underscores a critical commitment to safeguarding users from the ever-present threat of account abuse. This action highlights a crucial aspect of navigating the cryptocurrency world: vigilance and decisive intervention are paramount. Why is Proactive Crypto Security Essential? WLFI’s recent actions, initially shared on X, provide a clear example of how digital platforms are fighting back against malicious activities. The firm’s decision to blacklist 272 addresses wasn’t arbitrary; it was a targeted effort to protect the community. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, threats like phishing attacks and compromised accounts are unfortunately common. These incidents can lead to significant financial losses for unsuspecting individuals. Here’s a breakdown of the blacklisted addresses: 215 Addresses: These were blocked specifically to prevent the transfer of funds originating from sophisticated phishing attacks. Phishing attempts trick users into revealing sensitive information, leading to unauthorized access to their digital wallets. 50 Addresses: Blacklisted at the direct request of their original owners. These individuals had reported their accounts as compromised, meaning unauthorized parties had gained control. This strategic blacklisting is a vital layer of defense, demonstrating a commitment to enhancing overall crypto security . How WLFI Safeguards Your Digital Assets WLFI isn’t just blocking addresses; they are actively working to mitigate the damage caused by these illicit activities. Their statement confirms a dedication to supporting victims. The firm plans to collaborate directly with those whose accounts were compromised, aiming to assist in the recovery of their funds. This level of engagement goes beyond simple blocking; it’s about providing a pathway to restitution. This commitment is crucial for building trust within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. When platforms take such decisive steps, it reassures users that their investments are being protected. WLFI has also indicated that they will share further updates, suggesting ongoing transparency and a continuous effort to evolve their crypto security measures. It’s a testament to their proactive stance in a landscape often targeted by bad actors. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Security Challenges The digital asset space, while innovative, faces constant security challenges. The sheer volume and speed of transactions make it an attractive target for cybercriminals. From sophisticated phishing campaigns to elaborate social engineering scams, the methods used to exploit users are ever-evolving. This makes the role of platforms like WLFI even more critical. They act as front-line defenders, identifying and neutralizing threats before they can cause widespread harm. Common challenges in crypto security include: Phishing Attacks: Deceptive websites or emails designed to steal login credentials. Malware and Viruses: Software designed to compromise devices and steal private keys. Social Engineering: Tricking users into performing actions that compromise their security. Exploits in Smart Contracts: Vulnerabilities in code leading to fund loss. Understanding these threats is the first step in effective protection. What Can You Do to Enhance Your Personal Crypto Security? While platforms like WLFI play a vital role, individual users also bear responsibility for their own crypto security . Being informed and adopting best practices can significantly reduce your risk. Think of it as a shared responsibility: the platform provides the infrastructure, and you secure your access points. Here are some actionable insights to protect your digital assets: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always use 2FA on all your crypto accounts and exchanges. Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Never reuse passwords, and use a password manager. Be Wary of Phishing: Double-check URLs, email senders, and never click suspicious links. Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, consider using a hardware wallet for offline storage. Educate Yourself: Stay updated on common scams and security threats. Regularly Monitor Accounts: Keep an eye on your transaction history for any unauthorized activity. Taking these steps can significantly bolster your personal defense against potential threats. WLFI’s decisive action to blacklist 272 addresses is a powerful reminder of the ongoing battle for crypto security . By actively protecting victims of account abuse and phishing attacks, they are setting a strong precedent for platform responsibility. As the digital asset world continues to expand, such proactive measures, combined with informed user practices, will be indispensable in fostering a safer and more trustworthy environment for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “blacklisting addresses” mean in the context of crypto security? A1: Blacklisting addresses means identifying and marking specific cryptocurrency wallet addresses as associated with malicious activities, such as phishing or theft. Platforms then prevent funds from being sent to or received from these blacklisted addresses, effectively isolating them to protect users and prevent further illicit transactions. Q2: How can I tell if an address is involved in a phishing attack? A2: It’s often difficult for an individual to definitively identify a phishing address without expert tools. However, you should always be suspicious of unsolicited requests for funds, unexpected links, or promises of unrealistic returns. Always verify the sender’s identity and the legitimacy of any platform through official channels before interacting with any address. Q3: What should I do if my crypto account is compromised? A3: If you suspect your crypto account has been compromised, immediately take action: change all passwords, enable or strengthen 2FA, and notify the platform or exchange support team. Provide them with all relevant details, including transaction IDs and any communication logs. Acting quickly can sometimes limit the damage. Q4: Is WLFI the only platform taking such security measures? A4: No, many reputable cryptocurrency platforms and exchanges actively implement various security measures, including blacklisting, fraud detection, and victim support. WLFI’s actions highlight a broader industry trend towards enhancing crypto security and protecting users from illicit activities. It’s a collective effort across the ecosystem. Q5: How can I recover funds if they were stolen in a phishing attack? A5: Recovering stolen crypto funds can be challenging, but not impossible. Immediately report the incident to the platform involved and, if possible, to law enforcement. Platforms like WLFI sometimes assist victims in fund recovery, especially if the funds are still traceable within their system. However, success depends on many factors, including how quickly the theft is reported and the nature of the attack. Found this article insightful?

For those deeply entrenched in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, understanding these foundational shifts in artificial intelligence is paramount. Just as decentralized networks rely on robust protocols, the future of AI hinges on the careful cultivation of its core behavior. Recent developments within OpenAI highlight a pivotal moment: a significant reorganization of the team responsible for shaping the very essence—the personality—of its groundbreaking models, including ChatGPT. This move isn’t just an internal reshuffle; it’s a strategic realignment poised to redefine how we interact with advanced AI, influencing everything from user experience to the ethical frameworks governing these powerful tools. OpenAI ‘s Strategic Shift: Realigning Research for Deeper Integration OpenAI , the powerhouse behind revolutionary AI models, is undertaking a significant restructuring of its Model Behavior team. This small yet influential group, comprising roughly 14 researchers, has been instrumental in defining how AI models interact with users. According to an August memo to staff, Chief Research Officer Mark Chen announced that the Model Behavior team would integrate into the larger Post Training team, a group dedicated to refining AI models post-initial pre-training. This integration means the Model Behavior team will now report to Max Schwarzer, the Post Training lead. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed these changes, signaling a strategic move to embed the nuances of AI personality directly into core model development. This reorganization underscores OpenAI ‘s commitment to evolving its AI capabilities. By bringing the Model Behavior team’s expertise closer to the fundamental development cycle, the company aims to ensure that AI personality is not an afterthought but a central consideration from the outset. This strategic pivot reflects the increasing importance of user experience and ethical considerations in the deployment of advanced AI. How Does This Impact ChatGPT Personality and User Experience? The Model Behavior team’s primary mission has been to sculpt the ChatGPT personality , ensuring models interact effectively and appropriately with users. Their work has focused on critical areas: Shaping AI Personality: Defining the conversational tone, empathy, and overall demeanor of AI models. Reducing Sycophancy: Actively working to prevent AI models from merely agreeing with user beliefs, even potentially harmful ones, instead promoting balanced and critical responses. Navigating Political Bias: Developing strategies to ensure AI responses remain neutral and fair across diverse political viewpoints. Defining AI Consciousness: Contributing to OpenAI ‘s stance and understanding of what constitutes AI consciousness. In recent months, OpenAI has faced considerable scrutiny regarding the perceived changes in ChatGPT personality . Users noted a colder, less engaging tone in GPT-5, despite the company’s efforts to reduce sycophancy. This led to a public response, including restoring access to legacy models like GPT-4o and releasing updates to make newer GPT-5 responses feel “warmer and friendlier” without compromising on sycophancy reduction. The integration of the Model Behavior team is a direct response to these user feedback cycles, aiming for a more harmonized and user-centric approach to AI personality development. The Evolving Landscape of AI Model Behavior and Ethical Challenges The work of the AI Model Behavior team is complex, navigating the fine line between creating helpful, friendly chatbots and avoiding harmful sycophancy. This challenge was starkly highlighted by a recent lawsuit filed against OpenAI . In August, the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine sued OpenAI , alleging that ChatGPT (specifically a GPT-4o powered version) failed to adequately push back against their son’s suicidal ideations in the months leading up to his death. It is important to note that the Model Behavior team did not exist during GPT-4o’s development, underscoring the ongoing and critical need for such specialized teams. This incident, while tragic, brings into sharp focus the immense responsibility inherent in shaping AI Model Behavior . The ethical implications of AI interactions are profound, demanding constant vigilance and iterative refinement. The reorganization aims to integrate these ethical considerations more deeply into the development pipeline, ensuring that the ‘personality’ of AI models is not just about user satisfaction but also about safety and responsible interaction. Pioneering the Future: Joanne Jang and OAI Labs for Generative AI As part of these changes, Joanne Jang, the founding leader of the Model Behavior team, is embarking on a new venture within OpenAI . She is establishing a new research team called OAI Labs, where she will serve as General Manager, reporting directly to Mark Chen. OAI Labs’ ambitious mission is to “invent and prototype new interfaces for how people collaborate with AI.” Jang expressed her excitement about moving beyond the conventional chat paradigm, which she feels is often associated with companionship or autonomous agents. Jang envisions AI systems as “instruments for thinking, making, playing, doing, learning, and connecting.” This forward-thinking approach for Generative AI seeks to explore novel interaction patterns that could redefine human-AI collaboration. While it’s early days, the potential for OAI Labs to revolutionize how we engage with AI, possibly even collaborating with figures like former Apple design chief Jony Ive on AI hardware, is significant. This initiative reflects OpenAI ‘s continuous drive to innovate and expand the utility and accessibility of its advanced Generative AI capabilities. Addressing the Core: Why This Matters for AI Ethics and Trust The overarching theme of OpenAI ‘s reorganization is a profound commitment to refining AI Ethics and building user trust. By integrating the Model Behavior team’s expertise more closely with core model development, OpenAI acknowledges that the ‘personality’ and ethical framework of its AI are not secondary features but fundamental components of its success and societal acceptance. The company is actively responding to user feedback and critical incidents, striving to create AI that is both highly capable and responsibly deployed. This internal shift signifies a maturation in the field of AI development. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, the need for robust ethical guidelines and carefully designed interactions grows exponentially. For users, especially those exploring the decentralized world of crypto, trust in underlying technologies is paramount. OpenAI ‘s proactive steps in shaping AI Ethics and behavior are crucial for fostering this trust, ensuring that advanced AI serves humanity positively and responsibly. The Road Ahead: A Balanced and Trustworthy AI Future OpenAI ‘s reorganization of its Model Behavior team and the launch of OAI Labs mark a significant evolution in its approach to AI development. These changes reflect a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in creating intelligent systems that are not only powerful but also empathetic, ethical, and genuinely helpful. By embedding the principles of responsible AI Model Behavior and focusing on innovative human-AI interfaces, OpenAI is laying the groundwork for a future where AI can be a trusted partner in various aspects of life, from creative endeavors to critical decision-making. The journey to a perfectly balanced AI is ongoing, but these strategic adjustments indicate a clear direction towards a more thoughtful and user-centric future for Generative AI .

This announcement , made by S&P Dow Jones Indices, has sent ripples through the community, particularly given the recent speculation surrounding the potential inclusion of Strategy, the Bitcoin treasury firm led by Michael Saylor. Robinhood Joins S&P 500 Joining Robinhood in the S&P 500 are AppLovin, a marketing platform, and Emcor, a mechanical and electrical construction services company. These firms will replace MarketAxess, a bond trading platform, and Enphase Energy, a solar inverter manufacturer, respectively. The changes are set to take effect on September 22. Following the announcement, shares of Robinhood experienced a notable rise, climbing 7.3% in extended trading. AppLovin saw a 7% increase, while Emcor gained 2.2%. Notably, Robinhood’s stock has more than doubled this year in line with the broader cryptocurrency market, bringing the company’s market capitalization to approximately $91.5 billion. No Official Comment From Strategy Earlier this year, Coinbase made headlines as the first digital asset firm to join the S&P 500, adding a layer of legitimacy to the US cryptocurrency sector which has gained significant traction under President Donald Trump’s administration. The announcement also follows a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) from Michael Saylor that hinted at Strategy’s potential inclusion in the S&P 500: Nasdaq’s new position on digital asset treasury formations doesn’t affect Strategy, our ATMs or our other capital markets activities. As of this writing, there has been no official statement from the company or Saylor himself regarding Strategy’s failure to join the prestigious index on Friday.

By the end of the year, the market capitalization had ballooned from just $50.9 million in October to $4.6 billion. Trading fees reached as high as $1.5 million a day, while the leading agent token, AIXBT, grew from $162,000 on its November launch to nearly $1 billion just two months later. Since then, Virtuals’ market cap has fallen to less than $704 million, down 84% from its peak. AI agent tokens show signs of divergence Despite the gloom that befell the AI agent token space, for the first time, fundamentals are beginning to decouple from weak token prices. In August, daily fees within the Virtuals ecosystem rose from $33,000 to $230,000, even as the market cap fell by 10%, according to data shared on X by Chris Davis, a researcher at Messari, a crypto market intelligence platform. Virtuals fee generation and market cap in August. Source: Messari The market itself has been experiencing a shift in leadership. In early August, Ribbita dethroned AIXBT as the leading token, while another project, launched in July by former Coinbase engineer Luke Youngblood, also surpassed AIXBT . Some quarters believe that newer-generation agents with better use cases are getting attention from market participants compared to the first-generation agents. Projects like Mamo, an automated yield-farming agent integrated into Coinbase’s Base app, have attracted around $138 million in deposits, a signal of growing institutional-style demand. Quality over quantity The performance of standout agents has brought the ecosystem back to the limelight. ArAIstotle, a multilingual fact-checking agent developed by the team behind facticity.ai and listed by TIME as one of 2024’s best inventions, has outlined an enterprise-driven monetization strategy. Since its August launch, its token has risen by 3,170%, reaching a $16.2 million market cap a few days before the end of the month. Another notable case is 1000xAgent, built by crypto investors Avi Felman and Jonah Van Bourg and tied to their podcast “1000xPod.” The project utilizes an AI terminal for market analysis with a token buyback model funded by podcast revenues. In August alone, its token rose more than five-fold. The Virtuals team is also experimenting with new community structures though its Genesis launch mechanism allows participants to pledge “Virgen Points,” earned by staking the core VIRTUAL token, for allocations in new projects. Over half of all individual staking positions, representing 56% of over 73,000 accounts, are locked for 104 weeks. Clouds on the horizon The latest rebound comes after a tough first half of 2025 for AI Agents. In March, AIXBT suffered a hack that drained around 55.5 ETH, triggering a 20% token drop. The breach is one of the challenges early-stage ecosystems like this one face, as investors already have little trust in them, and these hacks cause further strain. For enthusiasts, however, this period of reduced hype may offer a rare window to position ahead of renewed interest, and it may account for why there’s a surge as investors see promise and want to put their cash where their mouth is, given the rising use cases and adoption of AI globally. The alignment of stronger fundamentals and an engaged core community suggests that the sector is not merely a passing fad. It also shows that investors are placing a premium on quality projects with proper use cases.

Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Oxford Economics now all expect the Fed to cut rates three times between September and November. According to Kalshi, the probability of a 25 basis point cut at the September 17 meeting has jumped to 99%, while the odds of a more aggressive 50 basis point cut have climbed to 12%, up from zero just a day earlier. Morgan Stanley said Friday’s report “tilts risks in the direction of 75 basis points in cuts by year-end.” Oxford Economics made its own adjustment, now projecting a rate cut in September rather than December. But the surprising change came from Bank of America. Analysts there now expect 25 basis point cuts in both September and December, abandoning their earlier prediction of no cuts until 2026. Aditya Bhave, senior U.S. economist at the bank, explained that “there is now clearer evidence of deterioration in labor demand, not just supply.” Bank of America now sees five more cuts into 2026 Aditya also said that inflation measured by the core PCE gauge could hit 3% in August and likely rise toward the end of the year. Despite that, the Fed is unlikely to hike in October. The reasoning is simple; too many signs now point to a weaker hiring environment. In fact, Bank of America’s new forecast includes three more quarter-point cuts in 2026, starting in June, which would lower the Fed’s target rate to 3%-3.25%, down from the current 4.25%-4.5%. This updated path now lines up with the broader view across Wall Street. Swap contracts that track the Fed’s next moves have already priced in not just a September cut, but also strong chances of cuts at the two other remaining meetings this year. Until now, Bank of America was the only top-tier bank not on board with a September cut. That’s no longer the case. Markets didn’t waste time reacting. The 10-year Treasury yield sank by 10 basis points to 4.076%, and gold hit a record high of $3,644.90 per ounce, rising 1% on the day. The reaction shows traders are treating the rate cuts as near-certain. There’s growing sentiment that the Fed may have to move quicker than expected. Analysts brace for even faster cuts after jobs data disappointment The jobs report released at 8:30 a.m. ET pushed expectations into overdrive. Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO, said the report was “disappointing” and “will start the conversation about whether the FOMC should cut 50 bp on September 17.” While Ian still believes a 25 basis point cut is most likely, he warned that “next week’s benchmark revisions and CPI could shift the market’s perception.” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said the weak numbers “leave the door wide open for the Fed to cut rates at the September 17th meeting.” He pointed out that the current labor environment might require fewer job additions to keep unemployment flat. “Last year it was between 100,000 and 150,000,” Art said. “This year with limited emigration and retiring baby boomers it is likely closer to 50,000.” Saira Malik, head of equities and fixed income at Nuveen, told CNBC that “this gives the Fed the greenlight to cut by 25 basis points,” and added that “it’s going to bring 50 basis points of rate cuts on the table for this September FOMC meeting and that’s why markets are positive.” Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, noted that the August employment dip wasn’t surprising. He said the Bureau of Labor Statistics has repeatedly revised its job numbers downward in recent months. “The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,” Joe said. Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said the August payrolls report “did little to quell fears of a recessionary-esque labor backdrop.” Job creation is “at stall speed,” Jeff said, adding that “nothing in today’s report changes the outlook for a September rate cut.” He said the data supports “additional and faster rate cuts beyond September,” and warned that the QCEW revisions next week could further impact how much ground the FOMC lays for the rest of the year.

This breakout signals a shift in momentum, as the price action re-establishes a clear upward trend. Technical Setup Signals Room For Further Upside Crypto VIP Signal, in a recent update on X, highlighted that SUI has sustained its bullish momentum exactly as anticipated, successfully breaking out of the falling wedge pattern. This breakout is a strong technical signal often associated with trend reversals, suggesting that the token has shifted from a period of consolidation into a phase of renewed upward strength. Such a move indicates that market sentiment is leaning toward optimism, with buyers steadily reclaiming control. Related Reading: 20 Million New SUI Tokens Push Treasury To New High – Details The update further explained that following the breakout, SUI retested the support line, a critical step in confirming the validity of the breakout. Holding this support level firmly not only reinforces the bullish structure but also builds a stronger foundation for future gains. This development underscores the resilience of SUI’s price action, as it demonstrates the ability of the market to absorb selling pressure while maintaining upward momentum. Looking ahead, Crypto VIP Signal pointed to $3.50 as the next key resistance level that traders and investors should keep an eye on. If this level is broken, it would likely attract more buyers into the market, creating the conditions for SUI to extend its upward trajectory and establish new short-term highs. SUI Indicators Align For Potential Upside Continuation Adding to the growing bullish outlook for SUI, Gemxbt recently emphasized in a post that the token is showing signs of a strong reversal. The analysis revealed that SUI’s price has crossed above both the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which strengthens the case for continued upward pressure in the near term. Related Reading: SUI Holds The Line: Rounded Bottom Hints At 13% Breakout Setup Resistance is currently positioned near $3.35, a zone that will play a pivotal role in determining whether SUI can maintain its bullish breakout. On the downside, strong support is established around $3.20, serving as a safety net in case of short-term pullbacks. Holding this support will be essential for sustaining market confidence. In addition to these key levels, momentum indicators are also aligning with the current bullish narrative. The RSI has begun rising from oversold territory, signaling renewed buying interest, while the MACD has confirmed a bullish crossover. Together, these technical signals suggest that SUI could be gearing up for another upward push, with momentum building toward testing and possibly breaking above the next resistance barrier.

Ethereum, Solana, and XRP started as niche bets before gaining mass recognition. As 2025 matures, investors are asking which smaller projects could step into the spotlight over the next five years. The likely winners pair real technical edge with compelling narratives, strong communities, and improving liquidity. Modular data availability, decentralized compute, high-throughput trading chains, and new programming models are all fertile terrain for the next breakout. Diversification matters, but so does selection: choose projects with traction, clear use cases, and momentum that can compound. Alongside this hunt for the next big names, cultural plays with credibility are also drawing attention, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly mentioned in those conversations as a narrative asset with unusual legitimacy. Celestia (TIA) – modular data availability Celestia popularized the modular thesis: separate data availability from execution so many chains can scale in parallel. By offering a DA layer that rollups can post to, Celestia lowers costs and opens the door to an ecosystem of specialized blockchains. If the next wave of apps prefers app-specific rollups, a neutral DA backbone can accrue value from broad adoption. The metric to watch is how many production rollups actually settle on Celestia and whether developer tooling keeps onboarding teams quickly. If modular wins, TIA could graduate from niche to necessary. Injective (INJ) – on-chain trading infrastructure Injective targets orderbook-style trading natively on a fast chain, enabling derivatives, spot, and structured products with cross-chain routing. That makes it a candidate to capture exchange-like fees without the custodial risks of centralized venues. Its appeal rests on latency, liquidity depth, and product breadth. If volumes migrate from CEXs to performant DEXs, protocols that feel familiar to pro traders can scale. Keep an eye on institutional-grade market makers integrating with Injective and the pace of new markets listed. Akash Network (AKT) – decentralized cloud As AI demand explodes, GPU compute is scarce and expensive. Akash matches providers of idle compute with buyers via a decentralized marketplace, aiming to undercut centralized cloud pricing. The story is compelling because it ties crypto to a massive real-world bottleneck. For AKT to become a big name, capacity must grow, developer experience must improve, and workloads need to move from trials to production. If decentralized cloud becomes a line item for AI teams, AKT’s relevance could compound. MAGACOIN FINANCE – credibility meets cultural momentum Hidden-gem lists are not only about infrastructure. Narratives move markets, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales marrying story and structure. With both CertiK and HashEx audits completed , it carries a legitimacy most meme-driven tokens lack. The project’s scarcity framing and rapidly expanding community have turned heads, while analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could climb toward 7,800% ROI , inviting comparisons to SHIB’s early mania phase. The difference here is credibility embedded at launch, which is why some traders view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare cultural asset that can sustain momentum beyond the first listing window. In a market where trust and narrative often diverge, MAGACOIN FINANCE aims to fuse them. Sei (SEI) – trading-optimized Layer 1 Sei is built for speed and parallelization, targeting use cases where milliseconds matter: orderbooks, gaming, prediction markets, and social trading. Its thesis is simple: a chain optimized for exchange-like experiences can capture flows that generic chains struggle with. For Sei to level up, it needs sticky applications, strong liquidity incentives, and visible user growth. If it becomes the default substrate for high-frequency on-chain apps, its brand can graduate from promising to prominent. How to build exposure to tomorrow’s names A smart approach blends themes. Modular data availability captures rollup growth. Decentralized cloud taps AI compute demand. Trading-focused chains ride the perennial need for liquidity and execution. Meanwhile, a small allocation to credible cultural tokens can juice returns when narratives turn. It’s about constructing a basket where each position has a different reason to win and a different adoption funnel. Conclusion Big names are crowned by usage, not slogans. Over the next five years, Celestia , Injective , Akash , Sei , and Sui each have credible paths from promising to prominent if execution and adoption compound. And in parallel, MAGACOIN FINANCE shows how cultural branding supported by audits can turn narrative into staying power. For investors willing to balance infrastructure bets with a measured allocation to credible culture plays, this mix could define the next wave of breakout winners.

VET Chases 800% Rally While BlockDAG Nears $400M with Over 200,000 Holders on Board",https://thecoinrise.com/can-xrp-reach-3-10-vet-chases-800-rally-while-blockdag-nears-400m-with-over-200000-holders-on-board/,"The 2025 market outlook has gained momentum as major projects deliver bold signals. XRP is being tracked closely, with analysts pointing toward a $3.10 target if the $2.97–$2.84 support range holds. VeChain (VET) could see up to 800% growth should resistance at $0.032 be broken. Yet BlockDAG (BDAG) is attracting the most attention. Unlike usual presales, BDAG has secured listings on 20 large exchanges such as MEXC, BitMart, and LBank. Backed by almost $400M presale and a 2,900% price increase since launch, BDAG has already proven its momentum. Analysts are calling it one of the strongest prospects of 2025, with potential to reach $1. VET Price Prediction: 800% Target in Play VeChain is trading at $0.02587 with a $2.22 billion market cap. Its trading volume has climbed 237% in 24 hours to $179.54 million. This shows strong new participation. Support rests at $0.024–$0.022, with resistance near $0.032. Breaking above could push toward $0.25315, offering an 800% gain. Still, risks exist. Losing support zones, slower corporate adoption, or unclear regulations could delay progress. Even with these issues, the surge in trading volume suggests growing attention. Analysts remain cautiously positive, noting that VET may surprise if momentum continues through 2025. Ripple Price Analysis: $3.10 Remains the Key Level XRP trades at $2.95, carrying a market cap of $176.03 billion and 24-hour trading volume of $12.35 billion. Despite a 1.98% dip, its setup remains steady. Analysts say the $2.97–$2.84 range is crucial, and breaking higher could send XRP above $3.10. Market data shows a 119.74% jump in trading volume to $12.58 billion, while open interest fell 0.90% to $8.27 billion. The numbers point to increased engagement but also some caution. The outcome depends on whether XRP can break the resistance. If achieved, it could confirm fresh growth potential in 2025. Regulatory concerns and profit-taking may test progress, but the structure remains positive. BlockDAG Confirms 20 Listings, Raises Almost $400M & Sells 19,500+ Miners! BlockDAG is setting a higher standard in presales. It has locked in listings on 20 major exchanges, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com. Most presales secure one or two, but BlockDAG has built worldwide access from the start. This approach gives BDAG stronger liquidity and faster reach once trading begins. The presale numbers reflect this strategy. BlockDAG has raised close to $400 million, selling more than 25.9 billion coins. The price began at $0.001 and surged up to $0.03 in batch 30, showing a 2,900% increase. More than 200,000 holders are already involved, proving consistent demand. Currently the coin is available at a limited time price of $0.0013 until October 1 right before BlockDAG Deployment Event aligning the community under one simple presale model Hardware sales also support the project. Over $7.8 million worth of miners have been sold, with 19,500+ units purchased. The X1 app now has 2.5 million active users, giving the network scale in both digital and hardware mining. With proven demand, mass adoption, and confirmed exchange access, analysts suggest BDAG could be the next $1 coin. Each batch reduces low-cost entry, keeping urgency high. Final Look The crypto market in 2025 is showing potential across many projects. XRP is holding near a $3.10 target, and VeChain carries an 800% outlook. But BlockDAG has set itself apart. Now at $0.0013 in its final presale stretch, it has raised almost $400M and delivered a 2,900% increase. With 20 exchange listings, its global reach is already secure. Each batch brings higher prices, reducing chances for low entry. Analysts see BDAG as the frontrunner for 2025. For many, this presale offers one of the clearest paths to growth.

51259227,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81970,1757116835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP ETF Decisions Are Coming: What Investors Should Know,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-decisions-are-coming-what-investors-should-know/,"An XRP ETF has gone from being a long shot to a real possibility. From the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs early in 2024 to spot Ether ETFs in late 2024, the natural progression has been set for the next major ETF contender – XRP. These approvals proved that legitimate, regulated, and mainstream access to leading crypto assets is possible – and helped build what an XRP product could look like. At the same time, buoyant projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its astonishing ROI projections by the end of 2025, have garnered attention from investors as one of the best altcoin projects to invest in before they explode. What is an XRP ETF? In simple terms, an XRP ETF would simply invest in XRP and trade on a stock exchange. Instead of having to set up a crypto wallet or deal with private keys, you simply buy or sell your shares via a standard brokerage account. Where is the Project in the Approval Process? One reason why this discussion is heating up now is that the long SEC lawsuit against XRP has finally concluded. With the legal cloud removed, there are multiple issuers now queuing to create spot XRP ETF proposals. The issuers have until October 2025, but several substantive decisions could be handed down in a rapidly increasing flow of final SEC decisions from Grayscale, Bitwise, and others. Why an XRP ETF Matters If an XRP ETF is approved, investors can expect to gain several advantages from this: Simplicity : Easy access to the brokerage without any technical crypto knowledge required. Regulatory Clarity: SEC approval serves as a hallmark of legitimacy and lends credibility. Diversification: Provides an alternative payments approach to a portfolio of BTC or ETH. Liquidity: Higher volume, tighter spreads, smoother institutional entry. Key Risks to Keep in Mind While an XRP ETF has the potential to be transformative, it is not without its risks, which investors should not overlook: Market Volatility – XRP is a highly sensitive cryptocurrency to sentiment and macro factors. No Direct Ownership – ETF holders own shares in the fund and not XRP itself. Over-Hyped Rallies : Prices can spike before approval, and then drop off after the trial is completed. Competition: XRP is still competing in the worldwide payments market. About What Early-Stage Angle Investors Are Talking About MAGACOIN FINANCE is another mega bullish early-stage play, and is making waves separately from XRP. Analysts expect it to provide an eye-popping 22,000% ROI by the end of 2025, that’s why investors are jumping in now at the right time while allocations last. The hype is genuine, however, just like any speculative token, it is essential to properly size positions and track advancements. Fourth, its impressive tokenomics, growing community, and record-breaking growth make it one of the go-to selections for investors ahead of the Blast off season for Altcoins. What to Expect Next For the next few years, ending in October 2025, headlines are all but guaranteed as the SEC continues to push against final deadlines on numerous XRP ETF filings. For XRP, a green light will be a milestone towards its access to the mainstream. It may not lead to an instant price explosion, but it may pave the way for consistent flows if institutional adoption gains momentum over the years. Bottom Line The story behind the XRP ETF is about expanding, democratizing, and making it easier and safer for everyone to access it. This would be another step towards crypto joining the ranks of standard portfolios, as are the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, projects that promise high ROI on speculative investments such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the interests of speculators. The key is to strike a balance between opportunity and risk and take a long-term view.

51259228,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81938,1757116836,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Outlook if Tokenization Captures 10% of Global GDP by 2030,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-outlook-if-tokenization-captures-10-of-global-gdp-by-2030/,"The prospect of large-scale asset tokenization has emerged as one of the most-discussed topics in global finance. Ripple has consistently highlighted the trend, stressing that institutions will require the same standards of custody, trust, and security for tokenized assets that they currently rely on in traditional finance. The company recently pointed to projections that show tokenization could play a transformative role in the world economy by the end of this decade. Tokenization Forecasts and Global GDP Growth A report from Boston Consulting Group estimates that tokenized assets could represent up to 10% of global GDP by 2030. This estimate has generated considerable interest among investors and market analysts who see significant opportunities for blockchain networks positioned to support large-scale tokenization. To place this forecast into perspective, global GDP has grown consistently in recent years. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows worldwide economic output was valued at $86.1 trillion in 2020, rising to $106.9 trillion by 2023. By 2024, estimates put the figure at approximately $111.2 trillion. Assuming an average annual growth rate of about 6.7%, global GDP could reach $164 trillion by 2030. If 10% of this total is tokenized, the market would be worth roughly $16.4 trillion. The Role of the XRP Ledger in Tokenization The question of which networks could capture a meaningful share of this projected market remains open. Analysts often point to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as a strong contender. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, previously confirmed that the ledger is adapting its infrastructure to support tokenization . Similarly, asset manager Bitwise has identified XRP as one of the clearest ways to gain exposure to the tokenization trend. If XRPL were to capture 15% of the tokenization market, that would correspond to $2.46 trillion in tokenized value hosted on the ledger. The impact this would have on the price of XRP depends on how much of that value requires backing by the native token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential XRP Price Outcomes To assess this, we examined projections from ChatGPT. In one bullish outlook, where XRP directly underpins tokenized reserves, the ledger’s share of $2.46 trillion would equate to an XRP market capitalization of the same size. With approximately 59.5 billion XRP in circulation, this would place the token at about $41. However, tokenized asset value does not necessarily convert directly into token valuation. At present, the XRPL holds around $306.8 million in tokenized assets, while XRP itself maintains a market cap exceeding $160 billion. This indicates that other factors, such as liquidity demand, speculation, and payment utility, play an essential role in shaping the price. Another projection assumes XRP becomes a preferred settlement asset for cross-border payments. If 3% of global GDP transactions, about $4.92 trillion in 2030, were to move through the XRPL, and 20% of that activity required XRP reserves, the implied capitalization would be $984 billion. This translates to roughly $16.55 per token. With additional premiums driven by speculation and adoption momentum, ChatGPT suggested a possible range of $40 to $50. Finally, in a more ambitious combined scenario where XRP captures market share from both tokenized assets and global settlement flows, the token could see valuations exceeding $100. The expansion of tokenization could unlock a multi-trillion-dollar market by 2030, and Ripple’s positioning suggests the XRPL may benefit from this shift. While projections remain speculative, the possibility of XRP reaching double or even triple-digit valuations highlights the scale of potential growth if tokenization fulfills its promise and XRP secures a central role.

51261356,575236,1757116849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51261356.jpeg,Russia Looks To Open Crypto Market Wider For Citizens – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/russia-looks-to-open-crypto-market-wider-for-citizens-details/,"Russia’s Ministry of Finance wants to open the door wider for citizens to take part in crypto trading, calling for lower entry requirements that currently limit participation to the country’s wealthiest individuals. Russia Wants Broader Crypto Participation Finance Ministry official Alexey Yakovlev said the government must reduce income and asset thresholds for those who want to join the Central Bank’s experimental crypto trading program, RBC and Interfax have reported. At present, only investors with deposits and securities worth over 100 million rubles ($1.22 million) or an annual income exceeding 50 million rubles ($615,755) can take part. Those numbers place crypto access far beyond the reach of ordinary Russians, whose average monthly salary falls between $700 and $1,200. Yakovlev argued that keeping eligibility this high makes little sense if the country wants its supervised crypto pilot to succeed. A History Of Disagreement The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have been at odds for years on how Russia should handle crypto. While the ministry has pushed for regulation and taxation, the Central Bank has preferred strict controls, including calls to ban trading altogether. That divide narrowed last year when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered both sides to find common ground. Putin has also urged Russian regions with unused energy reserves to engage in crypto mining, tying the sector’s future to the country’s broader economic strategy. Testing Ground Before Permanent Rules The Central Bank introduced what it calls an experimental legal governance, designed as a sandbox for companies to use crypto in cross-border deals. It also provides a controlled space where qualified investors can buy and sell crypto under official oversight. The ministry now wants the ELR to get more people involved before the program ends. Current plans limit the sandbox to three years, after which permanent regulations are expected. Tokenization Plans On The Table The Ministry of Finance also sees the pilot as an opportunity to expand tokenized assets in Russia. Yakovlev mentioned that companies could be allowed to release coins backed by real-world assets, intellectual property, and corporate rights in limited liability firms. He added that smart contract technology could give investors more tools and flexibility. While the Central Bank continues to argue that average citizens must be protected from the risks of crypto trading, its stance is losing ground. The Moscow Exchange now offers investors access to securities tied to overseas crypto ETFs, and some commercial banks have started looking at derivatives and other crypto-related products.

Fundamentals supported by Aptos deployment, Horizon initiative, and V4 roadmap. By Jainam Mehta Aave ( AAVE-USD ) is currently trading at $310.25, recovering modestly after yesterday’s sell-off but still hovering below the $314–$318 resistance cluster. The token is consolidating just above the $309.5 20-day EMA and testing the 50-day EMA at $312.7, while the 200-day EMA at $315.7 forms the upper boundary of near-term resistance. If AAVE manages a decisive close above $318, it could retest the $325–$330 zone, while failure to hold the $309–$310 base risks another slide toward the $300 psychological support. The RSI at 48.4 signals neutral momentum, with MACD still in negative territory, suggesting fading buyer conviction. Technical and on-chain picture On-chain flows highlight cautious behavior. CoinGlass data shows $2.28M in exchange inflows on September 5, signaling short-term distribution and profit-taking pressure. This contrasts with earlier outflow-led accumulation, suggesting whales remain divided - some reducing exposure while others continue rotating into cold storage. Market cap has stabilized around $4.5B, reflecting resilience compared to smaller DeFi peers despite recent volatility. Aave price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technically, price action is in a make-or-break setup. A sustained close above the $318–$322 zone would signal the beginning of a fresh upward leg, targeting the $330–$332 supply band. Failure here would lock AAVE inside a $300–$318 consolidation range, where downside breaks risk retesting $290 support. RSI remains neutral, but MACD’s negative slope shows buying conviction is weak, leaving AAVE vulnerable to another correction if buyers cannot reclaim control quickly. Fundamental positioning and outlook From a fundamentals standpoint, AAVE continues to reinforce its blue-chip DeFi status. The Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) beta trade rotation has helped altcoin inflows tied to ETH’s relative strength, while the Aptos deployment of Aave V3 marked its first non-EVM chain expansion, broadening adoption beyond Ethereum-native ecosystems. The Horizon initiative is also noteworthy, designed to onboard tokenized real-world assets and strengthen Aave’s role as a bridge between TradFi and DeFi. Institutional engagement remains supportive, highlighted by integrations such as Kraken’s white-label lending partnership and liquidity engine adoption. However, risks persist in the near term. Phishing-related concerns have created temporary unease within the retail community, while regulatory scrutiny of DeFi governance tokens continues to weigh on sentiment. Together, these headwinds temper Aave’s otherwise positive growth trajectory. Short-term outlook Looking forward, AAVE’s short-term structure will hinge on whether bulls can clear $318 with conviction. A close above that level opens upside targets at $325–$330, and potentially $340, should flows return. Conversely, losing the $309–$310 pivot could extend the correction toward $300, where the psychological support will be tested. Below this, $290 is the next critical level to watch. Traders should also monitor Ethereum closely, as AAVE’s 0.82 correlation with ETH means ETH’s direction will likely dictate AAVE’s momentum in the coming sessions. In earlier analysis, the $318 resistance zone was identified as the level AAVE must break to flip momentum bullish. Current price action continues to respect that resistance, confirming its importance as the defining level for short-term direction.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval, Trump said, “You could say those are the top three,” while making clear he’s not waiting around to change the direction of the central bank. The comment came as the president continues his push to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as chair of the Fed ends in May. This update comes from Reuters, which also noted that Trump, while already leaning toward a specific name, plans to carry out formal interviews. That hasn’t stopped him from signaling who he’s favoring. He’s said multiple times that Powell won’t be renominated, and that decision has now turned into a full search operation. The president blames Powell’s refusal to cut rates for the weak August jobs report and has accused him of slowing the economy. Scott leads search while attacking Fed policies Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was initially thought to be a possible replacement himself, has removed his name from consideration. Speaking Friday, Scott said, “I’m the only person on the planet who does not want the job.” Instead, he’s managing the replacement process. According to Bloomberg, the interviews to find Powell’s replacement began Friday, although there’s no official confirmation yet on who is participating. Scott isn’t just organizing interviews. He’s also taking aim at the Fed’s authority. Writing in the Wall Street Journal , he called for a full nonpartisan review of how the Fed operates. That includes monetary policy, staffing, regulation, and how it communicates with the public. He argued that the Fed should stop overseeing banks and pull back on actions that affect markets, like bond buying in non-emergency situations. In a separate article published in The International Economy , Scott went further, claiming the Fed has been responsible for worsening inflation, helping the wealthy while hurting working-class Americans, and making housing more expensive. He also accused the central bank of misusing taxpayer money, citing expenses like renovations and its internal police. These are all claims the Fed has denied, but Scott insisted that his goal is to restore independence at the institution. This all happens as Powell, originally appointed in 2018, faces pressure from Trump to step aside. Trump has repeatedly said Powell should have slashed rates this year and pushed his allies into key positions inside the Fed to make that happen. The three finalists — Hassett, Waller, and Warsh — are seen as more aligned with Trump’s views on interest rates and economic management. Cook fights removal while Miran pledges unpaid leave Trump’s actions aren’t limited to Powell. He’s also trying to remove Lisa Cook, another Fed governor, after accusing her of mortgage fraud. Lisa denies the charges and is taking legal action to block the move. For now, she remains in her position. The White House has not commented on how that process will move forward, but Trump appears determined to push her out. Meanwhile, Trump’s pick to fill an actual vacant Fed seat, Stephen Miran, testified this week at his nomination hearing. He told the Senate that he would take unpaid leave from his role as economic advisor at the White House if confirmed. That move is meant to avoid conflicts of interest, though Democrats have questioned whether that’s enough. They argue that anyone closely tied to the president may still lack the independence expected of Fed officials.

This information came straight from S&P Global’s index committee, which announced the change in a public statement released after trading hours. Robinhood will replace Caesars Entertainment, while AppLovin is set to take over the slot currently held by MarketAxess Holdings. This reshuffling is part of the index’s regular update cycle. When companies drop out, fund managers tracking the S&P 500 are forced to buy the replacements. That’s why both stocks rallied in after-hours trading. Fund-driven buying happens automatically, no emotions involved. The announcement closed a frustrating chapter for both firms. Robinhood, which was left out of the June quarterly rebalancing, saw its stock slide 2% at the time. AppLovin, meanwhile, had its name dragged through mud by Fuzzy Panda Research, a short seller that asked S&P’s committee in March to block the company from entering the index. When AppLovin was passed over in December in favor of Workday, its shares sank 15%. But both companies hung around long enough to get picked this time. AppLovin replaces MarketAxess while Robinhood takes Caesars’ place Robinhood, the commission-free trading platform, launched on the Nasdaq in 2021. It quickly gained a loyal base of retail traders who pushed meme stocks like AMC Entertainment and GameStop into the headlines. At its annual general meeting in June, a shareholder asked Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s co-founder and CEO, if getting listed on the S&P 500 was part of the plan. “It’s a difficult thing to plan for,” Vlad replied. “I think it’s one of those things that hopefully happens.” He added that he believed the company was eligible. It did happen. And fast. AppLovin, which also went public in 2021, has had a different journey. Its stock has delivered absurd gains: 278% in 2023, followed by a 700% explosion in 2024. As of Friday’s close, shares are up another 51% in 2025, though it’s slowed compared to the last two years. The company sells software that plugs into apps and mobile games to deliver targeted ads. AppLovin didn’t just coast to the top. It made bold moves along the way. Earlier this year, it made an offer to buy the U.S. business of TikTok from ByteDance, the Chinese parent company. The sale is still pending. President Donald Trump has repeatedly extended the sale deadline, with the most recent extension happening in June. Datadog and DoorDash joined earlier while Caesars and MarketAxess exit The S&P 500 already leans heavily toward large tech names. Datadog and DoorDash were both added earlier this year, pushing the index deeper into the software and data services world. The entry of Robinhood and AppLovin just keeps that trend rolling. It’s not random. Companies that are growing fast, pulling in volume, and making noise usually end up on the committee’s radar sooner or later. That’s bad news for MarketAxess and Caesars. The two companies are out, and they’ve been under pressure for months. MarketAxess, which focuses on fixed-income trading, has seen its shares fall 17% year-to-date. Caesars, the casino and resort chain, is down 21% in the same stretch. Neither company has posted the kind of growth or investor interest needed to hold onto a place in the large-cap index. Inclusion in the S&P 500 isn’t just symbolic, as funds that mirror the index must buy the incoming names. That’s why AppLovin and Robinhood rallied within minutes of the news breaking.

They’ve just announced the identification of a staggering 45,000 BTC, valued at approximately $5 billion, that the German government has apparently failed to seize from the defunct illegal movie streaming website, Movie2k. This massive German Bitcoin seizure oversight raises significant questions about asset recovery and enforcement in the digital age. What’s the Latest on the German Bitcoin Seizure? Arkham, a well-known blockchain analytics firm, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their significant findings. Their investigation uncovered a substantial cache of Bitcoin still linked to Movie2k, an illegal streaming platform that ceased operations years ago. This discovery comes after the German government had already seized and subsequently sold a considerable amount of Bitcoin from the same source. In early 2024, German authorities successfully confiscated 50,000 BTC from Movie2k. These funds were then liquidated between June and July of the same year, fetching an average price of $57,900 per Bitcoin. This initial German Bitcoin seizure was widely reported as a major success in combating illicit digital assets. How Did This Massive German Bitcoin Seizure Go Unnoticed? Despite the earlier seizure, Arkham’s meticulous analysis revealed a comparable sum of 45,000 BTC that remains untouched. This amount, worth approximately $5 billion at current market prices, is reportedly distributed across more than 100 different wallets. What makes this situation particularly intriguing is the dormancy of these funds. According to Arkham, these wallets have shown no activity since 2019, suggesting they have been sitting dormant for several years. The firm postulates that since German authorities have not publicly acknowledged these specific assets, they are likely still under the control of the original Movie2k operators. This raises a crucial question about the thoroughness of previous investigations. Key details identified by Arkham: Unseized Amount: 45,000 BTC, valued at roughly $5 billion. Wallet Distribution: Spread across over 100 distinct cryptocurrency wallets. Dormancy Period: Funds have been inactive since 2019. Current Control: Likely still held by Movie2k operators, as no public statements from Germany indicate otherwise. What Are the Implications of This German Bitcoin Seizure Revelation? The revelation of such a large, unseized sum has several potential implications. Firstly, it highlights the persistent challenges law enforcement faces in tracking and confiscating digital assets, even years after an operation has been shut down. Blockchain analytics firms like Arkham play a vital role in bridging these gaps with their specialized tools and expertise. Furthermore, the sheer volume of 45,000 BTC represents a significant potential supply shock to the market if these funds were to be moved or sold. While they have been dormant, any future activity could impact Bitcoin’s price. The possibility of another substantial German Bitcoin seizure also looms, as authorities may now be compelled to investigate Arkham’s claims more thoroughly. This situation also underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring in the crypto space. Even after initial successes, illicit funds can remain hidden, waiting for an opportune moment to be moved. It serves as a stark reminder for both authorities and the wider crypto community about the need for vigilance. Conclusion: The Unfolding Saga of the German Bitcoin Seizure Arkham’s discovery of an additional $5 billion in unseized Bitcoin from Movie2k is a significant development. It challenges the narrative of complete asset recovery and emphasizes the complex, ever-evolving nature of tracking digital wealth. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to mature, the capabilities of blockchain analytics firms become increasingly indispensable for transparency and enforcement. The world watches to see how German authorities will respond to this compelling new information regarding the remaining German Bitcoin seizure assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Movie2k? Movie2k was a popular, albeit illegal, website that offered free streaming of movies and TV shows. It was shut down by authorities years ago. 2. Who is Arkham? Arkham is a blockchain analytics firm specializing in tracing and identifying cryptocurrency transactions and wallet ownership, often assisting in investigations related to illicit funds. 3. How much Bitcoin did Germany previously seize from Movie2k? German authorities seized 50,000 BTC from Movie2k in early 2024, which they later sold for an average of $57,900 per Bitcoin. 4. What is the value of the unseized Bitcoin identified by Arkham? Arkham identified 45,000 BTC, which is valued at approximately $5 billion at current market prices. 5. Why is this unseized Bitcoin significant? It highlights the ongoing challenges in seizing digital assets, could potentially impact the Bitcoin market if moved, and demonstrates the crucial role of blockchain analytics in uncovering hidden funds.

A revised draft of a pivotal US crypto bill , known as the Digital Asset Market Structure Act (CLARITY), has recently emerged from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. This development, highlighted by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, signals a significant step towards clearer regulatory waters for the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry. Many in the crypto community are keenly watching these legislative movements, hoping for a framework that fosters innovation while ensuring consumer protection. What Does This Crucial US Crypto Bill Draft Propose? The latest iteration of the CLARITY bill introduces several groundbreaking provisions that could reshape how digital assets are classified and regulated in the United States. Perhaps the most anticipated aspect is its explicit stance on certain crypto activities. Here are the key takeaways from the new draft: Exclusion of Staking from Securities: Crucially, the draft bill proposes that staking, a popular method for earning rewards by holding cryptocurrencies, would not be categorized as a security. This provides much-needed relief and clarity for participants and developers in proof-of-stake networks. Airdrops Are Not Securities: Similarly, the distribution of free tokens, known as airdrops, would also be exempt from securities definitions. This clarification is vital for many decentralized projects that use airdrops for community building and initial distribution. DePIN Exemptions: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), which leverage blockchain to build and operate real-world infrastructure (like decentralized wireless networks or energy grids), would also be exempt from traditional securities laws. This could unlock immense potential for innovation in these hybrid digital-physical sectors. These exclusions are monumental, offering a pathway for crypto projects to operate with greater certainty, potentially reducing the regulatory burden that has often stifled growth. Why is This US Crypto Bill So Significant for the Industry? The implications of this draft US crypto bill extend far beyond just definitions. For years, the lack of a clear regulatory framework in the U.S. has been a major point of contention. Companies and developers have often operated in a gray area, leading to uncertainty and, at times, enforcement actions from regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This proposed legislation aims to bring much-needed clarity, offering several benefits: Fostering Innovation: By clarifying that certain core activities like staking and airdrops are not securities, the bill encourages further development and participation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader crypto ecosystems. Reducing Regulatory Arbitrage: A clear framework could help prevent companies from seeking friendlier jurisdictions overseas, potentially bringing more innovation and investment back to the U.S. Investor Confidence: While the bill focuses on definitions, a clear regulatory environment can indirectly boost investor confidence by reducing the perceived risks associated with the industry. Moreover, the draft outlines a procedure for the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to form a joint advisory committee. This committee would be tasked with making decisions on crypto-related issues and resolving inter-agency disputes, a crucial step towards cohesive federal oversight. What Protections Does This US Crypto Bill Retain? It’s important to note that this revised draft doesn’t start from scratch. It thoughtfully retains several key provisions from previous versions, ensuring a continuity of protective measures for users and the decentralized nature of crypto. These include: Protections for Self-Custody: The bill continues to safeguard the right of individuals to hold their digital assets directly, outside of third-party custodians. This is a fundamental principle for many in the crypto community, emphasizing individual sovereignty over digital wealth. Exemptions for Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The framework also retains exemptions for certain decentralized finance protocols, recognizing their unique structure and operational model. This is critical for the continued growth and innovation within the DeFi space, which relies on automated, permissionless systems. This balanced approach suggests a thoughtful consideration of the industry’s nuances, aiming to regulate without stifling its core principles. However, it is crucial to remember that this is still a draft, and the legislative journey is often complex and lengthy. Staying informed about the ongoing discussions and potential amendments will be key for anyone involved in the digital asset space. A Promising Step for Digital Assets The emergence of this revised US crypto bill draft marks a potentially transformative moment for the digital asset landscape in the United States. By proposing clear definitions for staking, airdrops, and DePIN, and by fostering inter-agency cooperation, the bill aims to usher in an era of greater regulatory certainty. While the path to becoming law is still ahead, this draft offers a compelling vision for how the U.S. could embrace and regulate cryptocurrencies, paving the way for sustained innovation and growth within the industry. It’s a development that every crypto enthusiast and industry professional should watch closely. Frequently Asked Questions About the US Crypto Bill Q1: What is the Digital Asset Market Structure Act (CLARITY)? A1: The CLARITY Act is a proposed US crypto bill by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee designed to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, defining how they should be classified and overseen. Q2: Why is the exclusion of staking and airdrops from securities definitions important? A2: This exclusion provides much-needed legal clarity for two common crypto activities. It reduces regulatory uncertainty for developers and users, potentially encouraging innovation and participation in decentralized networks without fear of being classified as unregistered securities offerings. Q3: What are Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)? A3: DePINs are projects that use blockchain technology to incentivize the building and operation of real-world physical infrastructure, such as wireless networks, energy grids, or data storage, often through token rewards.

If so, you’re likely aware that news from major exchanges can significantly impact the market. Recently, Coinbase made an announcement that has certainly caught the attention of many, adding KTA and NOICE to its official Coinbase listing roadmap . This development is more than just a simple update; it provides a crucial glimpse into the future direction of one of the largest cryptocurrency platforms. For both seasoned investors and newcomers, understanding the implications of such an announcement is key to navigating the fast-paced digital asset landscape. What Does the Coinbase Listing Roadmap Mean for Investors? When an exchange like Coinbase reveals its Coinbase listing roadmap , it offers crucial insight into potential future offerings. This transparency is a big deal for investors and traders alike, providing a heads-up on which assets are currently under consideration for a full listing. It allows the community to research upcoming assets, understand their underlying technology, and assess their potential market impact well before they are available for trading. For KTA and NOICE, this inclusion means they are now on Coinbase’s radar, undergoing necessary reviews and due diligence for a possible future listing. This early signal can influence market sentiment and investment strategies, as potential liquidity and exposure on a major exchange are highly sought after by projects and investors. Meet KTA and NOICE: What We Know So Far While specific, in-depth details about KTA and NOICE are still emerging, their presence on the Coinbase listing roadmap suggests they have met initial criteria for consideration. Typically, assets added to the roadmap are projects with growing communities, innovative use cases, or strong technological foundations. Investors often look for these early signals to understand which projects might gain wider adoption and liquidity in the future. It is an exciting time for the teams behind KTA and NOICE, as this announcement provides significant validation and exposure to a global audience. These projects could represent various sectors within the crypto ecosystem, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming or even new forms of digital identity. The diverse nature of assets on the roadmap reflects the ongoing innovation in the blockchain space. The Rigorous Journey to a Coinbase Listing Being added to the Coinbase listing roadmap is just the first step in a rigorous process. Coinbase is known for its stringent evaluation criteria, ensuring that any asset listed on its platform adheres to high standards of security, compliance, and technological integrity. This process includes thorough technical reviews, legal and compliance checks, and market analysis to ensure the asset meets all regulatory standards and provides value to its users. Only a fraction of the projects considered ultimately make it through this comprehensive vetting. A successful listing on Coinbase can dramatically increase an asset’s liquidity, visibility, and credibility within the broader crypto ecosystem. This exposure often leads to increased trading volume and greater institutional interest, which are vital for a project’s long-term success and adoption. Navigating New Listings: Tips for Crypto Enthusiasts For those interested in KTA, NOICE, or any other assets that appear on the Coinbase listing roadmap , here are some actionable tips to consider before making any investment decisions: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Understand its value proposition and potential risks. Understand the Risks: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile and speculative. Never invest more capital than you can comfortably afford to lose. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Coinbase and the projects themselves for the latest updates regarding listing timelines and developments. Consider Diversification: Avoid putting all your investment capital into a single asset. Spreading investments across different assets can help mitigate risk. These strategies empower you to make informed decisions and participate responsibly in the dynamic world of digital assets. The addition of KTA and NOICE to the Coinbase listing roadmap marks an exciting development in the digital asset space. It underscores Coinbase’s commitment to expanding its offerings and providing users with access to a diverse range of cryptocurrencies. As these projects move closer to potential listings, the crypto community will be watching closely to see their impact on the market and their contributions to the evolving blockchain landscape. This roadmap serves as a beacon, guiding enthusiasts towards the next wave of innovation in the crypto world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Coinbase listing roadmap?

After the success of Bitcoin ETFs and the growing momentum for Ethereum-based products, many believe Solana is a natural candidate for institutional exposure. The prospect has fueled a fresh wave of optimism, sparking discussions about whether this could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin boom. ETFs have already proven transformative for Bitcoin, driving billions of dollars in inflows. Should Solana follow suit, analysts argue it would create a domino effect for other altcoins, signaling that the market is entering a new era of mainstream recognition. Investors, however, are also scanning the horizon for opportunities outside the top tier — and that’s where emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining attention. Solana’s Case for an ETF Solana has established itself as one of the most scalable blockchains in the industry, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second with low fees. Its ecosystem has expanded rapidly, covering decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and gaming applications. The network’s strong fundamentals and institutional partnerships have made it an attractive candidate for an ETF product. If approved, Solana could quickly become a top choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to altcoins. The Rising Start in the Crypto Market While Solana ETF rumors dominate headlines, early investors are not overlooking smaller opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the most promising presales of 2025. Future listings on top-tier exchanges are expected to unlock mass adoption , and forecasts point to a 45x ROI before the next macro bull rally. The project’s transparent roadmap and audited tokenomics have already attracted thousands of investors, many securing bonus allocations in the earliest rounds. What an ETF Could Mean for SOL Price Market forecasts suggest that a Solana ETF could drive the token price into the $400–$600 range during the current growth cycle. Analysts base this projection on the magnitude of inflows observed with Bitcoin ETFs and the potential for similar enthusiasm around Solana’s unique positioning in the blockchain ecosystem. Could a Solana ETF Trigger an Altcoin Boom? If Solana successfully secures ETF approval, the impact would likely extend beyond SOL itself. Other high-cap projects such as Cardano, Avalanche, and even meme coins could benefit from the increased legitimacy. This “halo effect” could trigger an altcoin season marked by aggressive price surges across the board. Conclusion Speculation about a Solana ETF underscores just how far crypto has come in attracting institutional recognition. While SOL could see significant upside, the ripple effects may spark a broader altcoin boom. For investors seeking diversification, Solana offers scale, while presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide speculative upside unmatched by established assets. The next phase of the bull cycle could be defined by this dynamic pairing of institutional and early-stage growth opportunities.

Related Reading: American Bitcoin, Backed By Trump, Ends Nasdaq Debut Up 17% Data from CoinShares shows that inflows in Q3 2025 reached $177 million, pushing year-to-date totals above $1.2 billion. This sharp rise has positioned Solana as one of the most liquid ecosystems for staking, lending, and DEX activity. One notable whale moved 20,000 SOL from Kraken into Kamino Finance, later borrowing $3 million in USDC for leveraged positions on OKX. This reflects how institutional-scale players are increasingly using Solana’s DeFi ecosystem without selling off their core holdings, adding both liquidity and credibility to the market. SOL's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Why Transactions Are Surging Analysts point to multiple factors behind Solana’s record-breaking DeFi inflows and transaction growth. A key driver is the Alpenglow consensus protocol upgrade, which gained 99% validator approval. The upgrade slashes transaction finality to just 150 milliseconds, making Solana one of the fastest public blockchains. This speed advantage has already lured investors away from Ethereum, where congestion remains a problem. One whale address, previously known for high-value Hyperliquid trades, shifted $7.6 million from ETH into SOL, citing throughput efficiency as the decisive factor. Beyond technical upgrades, Solana has also attracted institutional interest through ETFs and tokenization initiatives, further strengthening its role as a preferred option for DeFi growth in 2025. What This Means for Solana’s Future With whales fueling inflows and Solana’s ecosystem achieving record adoption, market confidence in SOL’s long-term trajectory is strengthening. Transaction surges of this scale often precede deeper liquidity growth and sustained developer activity, two pillars of a healthy DeFi network. However, analysts caution that network activity needs to translate into consistent user adoption to maintain momentum. While speculative capital is accelerating short-term gains, the broader test for Solana will be sustaining real-world use cases beyond whale-led inflows.

51263562,575052,1757120453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51263562.jpeg,Trump Jr.-Linked Firm Targets Dogecoin Mining Crown With $50M War Chest,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-jr-firm-dogecoin-mining-50m-war-chest/,"Nasdaq-listed Thumzup Media Corporation (TZUP) has staked out an aggressive pivot from adtech into crypto infrastructure, unveiling a shareholder letter that details a $50 million all-common stock raise at $10 per share, a pending acquisition of DogeHash Technologies, and an explicit bid to become North America’s leading Dogecoin miner. In the letter , the company says the deal would add 2,500 active Scrypt miners with 1,000 additional rigs on order, framing the move as a step-change in scale for a newly crypto-focused balance sheet. “Ambitious vision to dominate as North America’s leading Dogecoin miner,” the letter states, summarizing the goal line for its capital and M&A strategy. Thumzup’s $50 Million Dogecoin Mining Push The Trump family connection is not incidental to the capital stack behind this pivot. In July, a Thumzup shelf registration identified Donald J. Trump Jr. as a selling stockholder for 350,000 shares—disclosure that formalized his equity link to the company. The fundraising that now underwrites Thumzup’s crypto expansion was handled by Dominari Securities; notably, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump joined the advisory board of Dominari Holdings, Dominari Securities’ parent, earlier this year, according to filings and contemporaneous reporting. Regulatory filings show the DogeHash deal is structured as a change-of-control transaction. Under an August 19 Agreement and Plan of Merger, Thumzup will be renamed Dogehash Technologies Holdings, Inc.; at closing, it will issue 30.7 million restricted common shares to DogeHash shareholders, subject to shareholder approval under Nasdaq rules (including the 19.99% issuance threshold), Nasdaq’s own approval, a fairness opinion, and standard closing conditions. “The combined company aims to become the world’s leading Dogecoin mining platform,” the 8-K states. Media coverage has suggested the post-merger ticker could be “XDOG,” though that symbol has not been codified in the SEC filing. While Thumzup’s letter reads unabashedly bullish on scrypt economics, the revenue math it presents is explicitly illustrative. Citing Bitmain ’s specifications for L9-class miners (16 GH/s, ~3,360W), the company models that 3,500 units could produce annual revenue of about $22.7 million at $0.22 per DOGE, scaling to ~$103.2 million if DOGE were to trade at $1. “Actual results may vary,” the letter cautions. It also emphasizes the plan to expand the fleet with proceeds from the $50 million offering, which it says left the firm with “more than $50 million in cash and [a] relatively small burn rate.” The shareholder letter also situates Thumzup’s pivot in a broader policy moment, crediting a more crypto-forward US stance and laying out a treasury strategy that began with $1 million in Bitcoin purchases in January and a second $1 million allocation later that month. However, those themes are presented as the company’s own framing of tailwinds; the binding facts for investors remain the capital raise, the structure and conditions of the DogeHash merger, and the operational footprint Thumzup intends to assemble around Dogecoin and Litecoin mining . On Thursday in Europe, Dogecoin was changing hands near $0.2198, a level that—if sustained—would anchor Thumzup’s own “current-price” scenario toward the lower end of its revenue illustration. “With the capital we already have, we believe we will be able to grow that business and drive significant value for our shareholders,” CEO Robert Steele writes, closing a letter that—if investors approve the share issuance and Nasdaq clears the control changes—would recast Thumzup as a public-market vehicle for Dogecoin-first industrial mining.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin Mining|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MINING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 01:00:53

Despite this, its price remains under pressure, struggling to stay above the $0.35 level. Investors are split between excitement over broader accessibility and frustration with the lack of immediate upside. Interestingly, as Pi continues its careful rollout, newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining major attention from early investors due to their rapid community growth and aggressive ROI projections, creating a sense of FOMO in the market. Adoption First, Price Later Pi Network’s latest integration comes through Onramp Money, allowing direct purchases in more than 60 countries. Users can now buy Pi using popular services such as Alipay, Maya, and GCash, giving its community easier access than ever before. While this is a milestone for accessibility, the token’s price tells a different story. Sellers remain in control, with Pi losing over 80% of its value in the past six months. A Controlled Rollout Strategy Unlike projects that rush onto exchanges, Pi has chosen a slower, compliance-driven path. Supply is distributed through foundation wallets to regulated partners like Onramp, Banxa, and TransFi, which collectively support more than 170 payment methods worldwide. This model is designed to steer tokens toward real-world usage in apps, peer-to-peer transactions, and commerce rather than encouraging quick speculative trading. A New Crypto Gem Captures Investor Buzz While Pi focuses on adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is creating waves with its explosive entry into the market. Analysts highlight its exponentially growing community and ambitious growth projections , with early backers already eyeing life-changing returns. The project’s scarcity-driven model has drawn parallels to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, but with a stronger focus on real-world use cases. For some investors, the fear of missing out on what could become a breakout story is already setting in. Institutional Interest in Pi Pi’s careful approach has begun to attract attention from institutions. In Europe, a Pi-based exchange-traded product (ETP) recently launched, signaling traditional finance may be warming up to its compliance-first strategy. Supporters argue that this puts Pi in a unique position, with the infrastructure being built before speculation takes over. The Market Reality Despite these moves, Pi remains stuck below $0.35. Attempts to rally have been short-lived as steady selling pressure outweighs weak buying interest. The Pi Core Team maintains that long-term fundamentals will eventually support price growth, but for now, patience is required. Conclusion The Pi Network’s latest listing underscores its steady expansion, even if prices remain flat for now. For investors, this highlights the divide between projects focused on adoption and those driving hype cycles. With MAGACOIN FINANCE drawing strong attention for its explosive growth potential , the question becomes which path will deliver bigger rewards in the coming months.

The update came Friday, with a new provision inside the draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025. The goal? Draw a hard line. Stocks that get tokenized onto a blockchain won’t sneak through commodity loopholes anymore. The update isn’t coming out of nowhere. Cynthia Lummis, the Republican senator from Wyoming, told CNBC a day earlier that the Senate wants the bill finalized fast. “We want this on the president’s desk before the end of the year,” she said. That means President Donald Trump, who’s back in the White House and already signed the stablecoin bill into law in July. The House and Senate both cleared that bill over the summer. But for crypto firms like Coinbase and Ripple, this new one is the heavyweight fight, the one that defines what’s a security and what’s not. The House already passed its version of the market structure bill in July. The Senate is still working on theirs. Once both versions are done, they’ll need to get merged before the final copy hits Trump’s desk. That’s where the friction starts. Senate plans committee votes and full vote by November Right now, Cynthia says the Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote later this month on the part of the bill that deals with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is planning to vote in October. A full floor vote could happen as early as November, Cynthia confirmed . The Democrats in the Senate haven’t signed on yet. But Cynthia claims conversations are happening. “There have been efforts to pair Democrats and Republicans on certain sub-issues within the bill to make sure that there’s, to the greatest extent possible, substantial bipartisan agreement on key issues,” she said. Even if every Republican backs the bill, at least seven Democrats need to join to get it across the line. A spokesperson from the Senate Banking Committee reportedly told CNBC that the current version of the bill “reflects feedback from hundreds of stakeholders on a wide range of questions.” This feedback helped shape the line-by-line regulatory split between securities and commodities, especially for assets moving onchain. While the Senate is trying to define boundaries, Galaxy Digital, a Nasdaq-listed crypto company, is already out here testing them. On Wednesday, Galaxy announced that its SEC-registered GLXY shares can now be tokenized directly on a public blockchain using the Opening Bell platform, built by crypto startup Superstate. Galaxy said that shareholders can now tokenize their equity and transfer it to approved wallets, as long as they pass KYC. These tokenized shares could also be traded on DeFi platforms using Automated Market Makers, giving them more liquidity and flexibility. Superstate claims that this isn’t a synthetic or wrapped token, these are direct equity issuances onchain. Galaxy tokenizes SEC-registered shares through Superstate platform The Opening Bell platform launched back in May and started with support for Solana. It claims to be the first platform offering SEC-registered public shares directly on blockchain infrastructure, without the need for intermediaries or token wrappers. Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy, said the goal is to bring what works in crypto into the traditional markets. In his words: “We’re proud to be working with Superstate to help lay the groundwork for an onchain capital market that bridges traditional equities with next-generation infrastructure. Our goal is a tokenized equity that brings the best of crypto — transparency, programmability, and composability — into the traditional world. And we’re taking part in building a model that can scale, not just for Galaxy, but for the market more broadly.” Last month, Galaxy said it had started working with Superstate to explore tokenization of its GLXY shares.

Statistics Canada reported Friday that the economy shed 66,000 jobs in August, largely in part-time positions. Professional and technical services led the declines, while trade-sensitive sectors such as transportation, warehousing, and manufacturing also posted steep job losses. Economists raise odds of rate cut CIBC senior economist Andrew Grantham said the latest data shows the weakness is no longer confined to sectors hit by U.S. tariffs. “The weaker than expected employment report saw financial markets pricing in a greater probability of a September interest rate cut, resulting in a decline in bond yields,” he told clients. The Bank of Canada’s next policy decision is set for Sept. 17. The central bank has kept its key rate at 2.75% over the past three meetings, citing trade uncertainty and sticky inflation. However, the jobs report adds to last week’s data showing GDP contracted by 1.6% annually in the second quarter, with only a slight 0.1% rebound estimated for July. August marked a second straight month of job losses, following a decline of 41,000 in July. The number of unemployed rose by 34,000, pushing the layoff rate to 1%, up from 0.9% a year earlier. BMO chief economist Douglas Porter noted the economy has lost 38,500 jobs since the trade war began in January, including 58,100 manufacturing roles. Inflation pressures shape policy outlook Inflation could be the deciding factor. The consumer price index rose 1.7% in July, though core measures remained elevated, with a three-month average of CPI-trim and CPI-median at 2.4%. RBC economist Claire Fan said the August inflation report, due a day before the rate decision, will “bear an unusual amount of weight” in shaping policy. Meanwhile, Canada’s employment rate fell 0.2 points to 60.5%in August, while annual wage growth eased to 3.2%. Youth unemployment stood at 14.5%, with summer student joblessness at 17.9%—the highest since 2009. Regionally, Alberta’s unemployment rate rose to 8.4%, while B.C.’s climbed to 6.2%. Windsor (11.1%), Oshawa (9%), and Toronto (8.9%) remained the hardest-hit cities. U.S. moves to reopen USMCA talks amid tariff tensions On related developments, the U.S. is preparing to launch talks on renegotiating its largest free trade pact , the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is set to launch public consultations on revising the deal within the next month, a step required by Oct. 4 under the 2020 implementation law. According to people familiar with the matter, a request for input from companies and unions could come as early as this week. However, Trump’s team has previously signaled an imminent release before delaying it. The beginning of consultations will be the first official act in what is likely to be a month-long process to renegotiate a deal that Trump signed in 2020, which contains a mandatory six-year review. Following a petition for comments, the administration must hold at least one public hearing and brief Congress on the deal in January 2026, before holding the first official trilateral USMCA review meeting by July 1, 2026. The USMCA was promoted as a signature trade achievement of Trump’s first term, replacing the 1992 North American Free Trade Agreement, which he had criticized on the campaign trail for shifting U.S. factories and jobs to other countries, especially Mexico. Still, in his second term, Trump has undercut the USMCA by imposing — and later scaling back — steep tariffs on Canada and Mexico, claiming they were warranted due to drug trafficking through both countries. He initially levied a 25% tariff shortly after taking office, before exempting goods that met the pact’s rules. According to a January report, the tariffs were also intended to boost U.S. leverage in renegotiation and push talks forward more quickly. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

One of the most successful projects is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a decentralized lending protocol that is quickly gaining increased popularity because of its innovative approach to DeFi sustainability and optimizing yields. MUTM is at its sixth presale stage and will increase by 14.29 percent to $0.04 in the seventh stage. The project has raised more than $15.4 million and already registered more than 16,040 investors. As the ADA price movement generates discussions on where it will be in the market, Mutuum Finance has an opportunity to take over a portion of the attention as the traditional player wobbles. Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast as Bulls Look for Momentum Currently, ADA is trading at around $0.83 with solid ground above the support range of $0.80, which countless times has served as a key level to subsequent pullbacks. According to analysts, assuming that ADA can break out of the $0.95-$1.00 range, and gain above, it may in the next few weeks roll out a short-term surge towards $1.05, which would correspond to a potential 20-25% gain. When looking further forward, into late 2025, estimates are more optimistic: certain models may see average prices of $0.75-$1.07 in the month, whilst others may see a breakout to $1.30-$1.50 should institutional interest such as an ETF approval come to fruition. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is still in presale. Stage 6 tokens are sold at a price of $0.035 and the price of Stage 7 will increase by 14.29 percent and will reach $0.04. Interest in investment is also high and the sum of funds raised has exceeded above 15.4 million and the number of individuals with tokens has exceeded above 16,040. This turns MUTM into one of the most competent in the DeFi market. Community Giveaway and Leaderboard Rewards Mutuum finance continues to entice more investors with its mega $100,000 giveaway . Participation is open with a $10k reward to ten individuals. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance is also currently operating a bug bounty program of $50,000 USDT in collaboration with CertiK. To ensure that the platforms are safe and reliable, the participants may be incentivized to discover the weak areas, which can be classified into four categories: critical, major, minor, and low. Oracle Infrastructure and Price Discovery The project uses Chainlink to get accurate market prices and connects them with the value of USD and tokens like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Additional tools like fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and in-chain metrics help provide reliable and timely prices for managing collateral and handling liquidations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining ground fast as an emerging DeFi competitor, although Cardano (ADA) is looking at a tentative recovery. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, and Stage 7 will increase 14.29% to $0.04, providing early buyers with a high upside potential. With a growing confidence in the market, the project has increased funds raised and attracted over 16,040 investors in excess of 15.4M. MUTM offers the security, scalability and long-term growth positioning with a $100K community giveaway, $50K CertiK bug bounty, and solid oracle-based price infrastructure. Stage 6 is currently open to ensure that you are allocated before the next price surge.

The total value of these trillion-dollar companies now stands at $21 trillion, with Google at the center of the momentum. The biggest surge came after US District Judge Amit Mehta handed down a ruling in Google’s antitrust case. Instead of breaking up the company or forcing it to offload its Chrome browser, Mehta ordered a narrower remedy; Google has to share its search data with rivals. That news sent Alphabet shares up 9% on Wednesday alone. Apple surged too, because the ruling lets them keep their deal with Google, where Alphabet pays billions to remain the default search engine on iPhones. Broadcom lands OpenAI deal while Alphabet shrugs off EU fine Alphabet ended the week up more than 10%. Apple added 3.2%. Nasdaq climbed 1.1%. Analysts from Wedbush Securities said the ruling “removed a huge overhang” from Google’s stock and cleared a “black cloud worry” over Apple. They said it also opens the door for a larger AI deal between Apple and Google, involving the Gemini model. The Department of Justice had been going after Big Tech since 2020. Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta all faced lawsuits over market power. A year ago, Google lost the DOJ trial, a case many saw as the biggest since Microsoft’s in the 1990s. But Mehta’s ruling this week wasn’t as severe as expected. He said the rise of generative AI had reshaped the market, with new players like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity competing with Google in ways traditional search didn’t allow. Mehta said these AI technologies “may yet prove to be game changers.” On Friday, Alphabet faced another legal hit, this time from Europe. The company was fined €2.95 billion ($3.45 billion) by the European Union for anti-competitive behavior in the ad tech market. But investors didn’t care. Shares held up. While OpenAI influenced Google and Apple indirectly, it drove a direct move in Broadcom’s stock. After the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings on Thursday, CEO Hock Tan told analysts that Broadcom had signed a $10 billion deal with a new customer. Several analysts identified the customer as OpenAI, as Cryptopolitan reported . The Financial Times also reported a deal between the two. Broadcom, which already supplies custom AI chips to Google, Meta, and ByteDance (TikTok’s parent), gained 13% this week. Its stock is now up 120% over the last year, bringing the company’s market value to about $1.6 trillion. Barclays analysts wrote that the company “is firing on all cylinders” and kept their buy rating while raising their price target. Nvidia and Microsoft slide, Tesla gains after Musk bonus proposal While others gained, Nvidia fell 4%, its fourth straight weekly drop. There was no clear reason behind the decline, but that didn’t stop the slip. Still, Nvidia remains the world’s most valuable company at over $4 trillion. The stock is up 56% in the past year. Microsoft also dipped this week, continuing a five-week losing streak. The company’s shares are still up 21% over the last 12 months, but the recent stretch has been red. Tesla has had a rough year, with shares down 13% in 2025. Sales have slipped for multiple quarters, and cheaper electric cars from China have added more pressure. The company’s aging EV lineup hasn’t helped either. But this week, Tesla reversed the trend. Shares rose 5%, mostly due to Friday’s news that the company wants to bring back a massive pay plan for CEO Elon Musk. The plan, potentially worth up to $1 trillion, includes 12 payout stages. The first one doesn’t activate unless Tesla nearly doubles in value to hit a $2 trillion market cap. Chairwoman Robyn Denholm spoke with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and said the plan is meant to keep Musk, who is still the world’s richest person, “motivated and focused on delivering for the company.” As all this unfolded, the eight trillion-dollar tech companies swelled to make up 36% of the S&P 500.

51263564,575385,1757124007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51263564.jpeg,Tether Eyes Gold Mining As New Frontier For Crypto Profit Deployment,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-eyes-gold-mining-as-new-frontier-for-profit/,"Tether, the issuer of the market’s largest stablecoin by trading volume, USDT, is reportedly in discussions to invest in gold mining. The company aims to channel its substantial cryptocurrency profits into the metals market. According to a recent Financial Times report , Tether is exploring opportunities across the entire gold supply chain, including mining, refining, trading, and royalty companies. Gold As Foundational Asset Paolo Ardoino , Tether’s CEO, has expressed a strong affinity for gold, referring to it as “natural Bitcoin.” In a speech earlier this year, he articulated a perspective that contrasts with the common view of Bitcoin as “digital gold,” instead emphasizing that gold represents “a foundational asset.” Per the report, Tether’s interest in gold has surprised many within the traditional mining sector, raising questions about the company’s strategy and its potential for success. One mining executive remarked on Tether’s unconventional approach, suggesting that while the company appreciates gold, it lacks a clear strategy for navigating this established industry. As one of the most profitable entities in the cryptocurrency space, Tether boasts a market capitalization of $168 billion. The company generated $5.7 billion in profits in the first half of this year and is also known as one of the largest holders of US Treasuries, earning interest from these investments to support its stablecoin. Tether has already made significant strides in the gold market, holding $8.7 billion worth of gold bars in a Zurich vault, which serves as collateral for its stablecoin issuance. Blue Gold Joins Tether In Bridging Crypto And Gold Markets Recently, Tether Investments, the arm responsible for managing the company’s profits, acquired a minority stake in the gold royalty company Elemental Altus for $105 million. This investment was complemented by an additional $100 million infusion into Elemental following its merger with rival EMX. Juan Sartori, who leads business initiatives at Tether, told the Financial Times that these investments are part of a broader strategy to enhance the company’s exposure to gold. In addition to its investments in gold royalties, the crypto company has also engaged in discussions with Terranova Resources, a gold mining investment vehicle based in the British Virgin Islands, although no deal has materialized. The stablecoin issuer’s foray into gold also includes the XAUt token , a cryptocurrency backed by physical gold, though its market presence is relatively modest compared to USDT. The report highlights that other firms, such as Blue Gold, are also exploring the intersection of cryptocurrency and gold. The gold mining company plans to introduce digital tokens linked to its future gold output, reflecting a belief that gold-backed tokens could gain global traction.

With solid foundations and increasing traction, ADA, XRP, and ETH continue to be three of the most talked-about assets. For traders who are looking ahead, the real question is which undiscovered treasures might overtake them as market leaders in the upcoming cycle. Portfolios that combine well-known brands with early-stage projects have a history of outperforming. Analysts are increasingly pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a culturally driven presale that is emerging as one of the most intriguing newcomers, in addition to the industry mainstays. ADA: governance-driven resilience Cardano’s long development arc is finally converging on one of its boldest goals: full community governance. The Voltaire upgrade will introduce treasury management and on-chain voting, creating a framework where ADA holders directly shape the network’s future. While Cardano has faced criticism for its deliberate pace, this governance model could cement it as the most decentralized Layer 1 in operation. Analysts believe this long-term approach gives ADA resilience against speculative hype cycles, making it a reliable hold beyond 2025. XRP: bridging global finance Ripple’s XRP continues to secure its place in global financial infrastructure. With regulatory clarity in the U.S. finally improving, partnerships with payment providers and banks are scaling. XRP’s role as a bridge asset for cross-border payments remains its defining feature, allowing instant settlement across currencies without the need for pre-funded accounts. Recent whale accumulation and renewed institutional demand highlight the growing belief that XRP could reclaim its past highs. For investors seeking exposure to utility-driven adoption, XRP remains a staple. ETH: the backbone of Web3 Ethereum is the undisputed leader in smart contracts, NFTs, and decentralized finance. The approval of spot ETH ETFs in 2025 brought a flood of institutional money, reinforcing its credibility. At the same time, Layer 2 ecosystems like Arbitrum and Optimism are expanding Ethereum’s reach, ensuring scalability for mainstream adoption. With billions in total value locked and thousands of developers building applications, ETH is more than just an altcoin — it is infrastructure for the digital economy. Analysts argue that Ethereum’s dual role as both an asset and a platform ensures its long-term prominence. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the hidden gem narrative The hidden gem of this cycle, according to many traders, is MAGACOIN FINANCE . While ADA, XRP, and ETH anchor portfolios with proven utility, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings something different: cultural momentum paired with unusual legitimacy. Passed audits from CertiK and HashEx have given it a level of trust absent in most meme-inspired tokens. Investors are particularly drawn to the PATRIOT50X bonus code , which allows early buyers to boost allocations by 50%, fueling rapid presale sellouts. Analysts say forecasts point to 35x potential upside , with some comparisons to SHIB’s early mania phase. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is that it isn’t just hype – its structural credibility suggests staying power. For investors searching for the next breakout name beyond ADA, XRP, and ETH, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the hidden gem everyone is talking about. Diversification strategy for 2025 Balancing established players with high-upside newcomers is the essence of crypto investing. ADA offers governance depth, XRP provides enterprise utility, ETH anchors the ecosystem, and MAGACOIN FINANCE brings asymmetric potential. Together, this mix allows investors to weather volatility while still capturing explosive growth if the hidden gem narrative materializes. Analysts suggest that portfolios built on this balance are better positioned to outperform as markets enter the next phase of adoption. Conclusion The altcoins to watch in 2025 extend beyond the majors. ADA, XRP, and ETH remain foundational assets , each with its own strengths, but the addition of MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights the power of uncovering hidden gems before they go mainstream. For investors willing to diversify, the combination of established credibility and emerging cultural momentum could define the winners of the next cycle.

Related Reading: American Bitcoin, Backed By Trump, Ends Nasdaq Debut Up 17% The token, which debuted in late 2024, now has a market capitalization of close to $710 million. That figure matters because it signals real capital backing the push, even if the coin still sits well below the largest stablecoins. Fintech Partners Open Doors Ripple’s rollout leans on three major fintech partners: Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card. These platforms already serve millions of users across the continent. According to company statements, the partnerships give RLUSD instant rails into retail and business flows without Ripple having to build consumer trust from scratch. Ham Serunjogi, CEO of Chipper Cash, said RLUSD is “uniquely positioned to accelerate institutional blockchain adoption across Africa and beyond.” That line frames the push as aimed more at banks and big payments firms than at casual traders. 1/ The next chapter for $RLUSD starts in Africa. → https://t.co/6gRqrdNwSW We’re proud to bring our trusted, USD-backed stablecoin to the continent with new partners @chippercashapp, @VALRdotcom, and @YellowCard_App. 🌍 Together, we’ll unlock new potential for cross-border… — Ripple (@Ripple) September 4, 2025 Humanitarian Pilots Take Center Stage Based on reports, Ripple is also linking RLUSD to humanitarian work in Kenya. Mercy Corps Ventures is running pilot programs that use the stablecoin to power blockchain-based insurance products for drought and rainfall risks. These pilots are small. But they are meant to show how stablecoins can back practical financial services where climate shocks hit farming communities. For many African users, access to reliable, low-cost payment rails matters more than the token’s total market value. Listings And Institutional Aims RLUSD has been listed on a growing set of exchanges, including Gemini, Kraken, Bitso, Bitstamp, Bullish, LMAX, Uphold, Mercado Bitcoin, Independent Reserve, and CoinMENA. That distribution lets institutions tap RLUSD for payments, settlement, and collateral management. Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple, said demand is growing across payments, tokenization, and collateral markets. The listings show Ripple wants the coin to be usable on familiar trading and custody platforms, which can shorten the path to institutional adoption. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally On-Chain Activity Shows Momentum, But Gaps Remain Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show rising activity. Artemis data points to monthly transaction volumes climbing from almost $120 million in July to $194 million in August. That jump is healthy for a newcomer. Yet it is still small when compared with established stablecoins that process billions each month on Ethereum and Tron. Based on these numbers, RLUSD is gaining traction but has a long way to go if it hopes to match the liquidity and daily flows of market leaders.

Stellar is holding near its $0.39 support level, with the possibility of a rebound if buying pressure builds. Ethena, on the other hand, has reported $500 million in revenue and $11.7 billion in supply, though questions remain about the long-term sustainability of its model. In the middle of these mixed signals, BlockDAG is pushing forward with achievements that are rare ahead of a launch. Its X1 app has already attracted 3 million miners, a milestone that demonstrates wide-scale adoption and growth. The presale has raised over $395 million, and with its upcoming global Deployment Event in Singapore, the project is gaining strong visibility. A new flat-rate presale price of $0.0013 gives BlockDAG (BDAG) a clear edge in attracting attention as the best crypto to buy right now. Stellar Holds at $0.39 With Breakout Potential Stellar (XLM) is sitting at a key support level near $0.39, and traders are debating whether it can maintain its footing. A breakdown could send the price toward $0.36, reflecting added pressure for holders. Current volume and RSI levels point to indecision, with the market waiting for a clear signal. Longer term, technical analysis suggests the possibility of a bull flag breakout with a target near $1.80. That would represent gains of more than 350% if realized. While uncertainty dominates the short-term outlook, the potential upside keeps Stellar firmly on trader watchlists. Ethena Expands Rapidly While Facing Key Risks Ethena Labs has reported another impressive update, revealing more than $500 million in revenue and $11.7 billion in USDe supply. The synthetic stablecoin has quickly become one of the largest in circulation, using a delta-neutral hedging model that earns from staking rewards and futures funding. This design has earned Ethena the label of an “internet bond.” Still, sustainability is being questioned as the model relies heavily on favorable futures markets. To reduce exposure, Ethena has added Bitcoin as a backing asset, broadening liquidity and diversifying collateral. For now, the story is one of fast growth but with elevated structural risks. BlockDAG’s 3 Million Miners Redefine Presale Success BlockDAG has established itself as a standout project by showing real adoption before its official launch. The X1 mining app has surpassed 3 million active users, demonstrating how well its Proof of Engagement model connects with a global audience. Rather than relying on speculation, BlockDAG has created a loyal community that forms a strong base for future growth and credibility. The presale has already raised over $395 million, making it one of the largest and most successful campaigns of 2025. With a new flat-rate price set at $0.0013, BlockDAG has simplified access and removed bonus tiers to ensure fairness and transparency. Early backers who entered at $0.001 are already seeing strong returns, and analysts project long-term gains that could reach $1 or higher if adoption continues to accelerate. BlockDAG is also preparing for a major global Deployment Event in Singapore, designed to showcase its technology, ecosystem, and growing community to the world. This event marks a pivotal step in the project’s roadmap, signaling its readiness to scale and positioning it as one of the top bullish crypto coins to watch in 2025. Alongside these milestones, BlockDAG has completed audits from both CertiK and Halborn and continues to engage its growing community through features like Buyer Battles. These elements highlight a project that blends adoption, visibility, and advanced security. With its presale success and scalable framework, BlockDAG is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy right now. Key Takeaways Stellar and Ethena both highlight the balance of opportunity and uncertainty in today’s market. Stellar depends on holding its $0.39 support level while traders watch for a potential rally toward $1.80. Ethena has shown strong expansion with $500 million in revenue, yet its reliance on futures markets raises questions about how sustainable that growth will be during tougher conditions. BlockDAG presents a clearer picture of progress. With 3 million miners, more than $395 million raised in presale, and tokens now priced at $0.0013, it offers visibility that competitors lack. Its upcoming global Deployment Event in Singapore further strengthens its case, positioning BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy right now.

While an ADA-based exchange-traded fund could bring new institutional flows into the ecosystem, major investors are not waiting around. Instead, many whales are diversifying into altcoins with far higher upside potential before the next bull market fully ignites. ADA’s Steady Growth, But Slower Returns Cardano remains a cornerstone in the altcoin landscape, with upgrades like Hydra scaling and ongoing network improvements helping to maintain confidence. However, price action has been less exciting compared to other fast-moving tokens. As ETF rumors circulate, traders are questioning whether ADA will outperform or simply lag behind rivals in the coming rally. A New Altcoin Steals the Spotlight Amid this shift, analysts have placed ADA and MAGACOIN FINANCE among the 5 Best Altcoins to Buy before the bull run starts — but MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight. Its presale has already attracted thousands of early investors, making it one of the best crypto opportunities to buy this year. Momentum is building as allocation rounds sell out quickly, and projections suggest returns of up to 22,000% are possible for early movers. Whales Chasing Bigger Multiples The contrast between ADA’s measured growth and the explosive community-driven demand for MAGACOIN FINANCE reflects a broader trend: whales are moving beyond established names to chase tokens with sharper trajectories. This dynamic mirrors past cycles where coins like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN surged from niche plays into mainstream headlines. Key Takeaways for Investors A Cardano ETF could bring institutional inflows, but approval is still uncertain. ADA continues to grow steadily but lacks the explosive returns some traders want. MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is gaining traction, with thousands already invested. Whales are rotating capital into newer altcoins with higher potential multiples. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 22,000% ROI for early backers. Investors are preparing for a bull market where both ADA and emerging tokens play major roles. What’s Next for ADA and Altcoins If a Cardano ETF gets the green light, ADA could see a surge in institutional buying, potentially lifting its market cap significantly. But until then, investors chasing high multiples are likely to keep rotating into presales and newer altcoins with viral growth potential. Conclusion In summary, ADA remains a strong long-term contender with ETF buzz fueling speculation, but the real frenzy is happening in emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. With thousands already securing their positions early, it’s becoming the altcoin everyone is watching as the bull run nears.

51264099,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=800755,1757124162,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51264099.jpeg,"Trump removes tariffs on key metals, targets silicone instead",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-gold-graphite-tungsten-uranium-tariffs/,"Trump issued a new executive order Friday, removing import tariffs on gold bullion, graphite, tungsten, uranium, and other critical metals, while slapping silicone products with new levies. The directive takes effect Monday, and it follows recommendations from U.S. officials and is tied to the ongoing “national emergency” Trump declared when he first triggered his broad country-level tariff agenda in April. This change comes after a ruling by U.S. Customs and Border Protection caused a wave of panic among gold traders by indicating bullion would be taxed. That triggered confusion across the commodities markets. Trump’s decision also makes it easier for Washington to carry out new trade frameworks with other countries. These include deals Trump signed with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, which now no longer need individual executive orders to go live. Trump removes tariffs on key metals, targets silicone instead The metals being dropped from tariff lists are all used in tech, energy, and defense supply chains. Tungsten is crucial for industrial tools and military hardware. Graphite is central to electric batteries and aerospace parts. Uranium fuels nuclear reactors. Gold, despite being seen mostly as a reserve asset, plays a role in electronics and is a major safe haven for investors. The White House order says removing these tariffs is necessary to support U.S. manufacturing and protect supply chains. But while Trump is giving relief to those materials, he’s also turning up the heat on other sectors. Silicone products, as well as resin and aluminum hydroxide, are now subject to new reciprocal tariffs. These materials are more widely available and are not seen as vital to national security. By hitting them, Trump aims to increase leverage in trade talks without choking essential supply lines. The new policy also opens the door to exempt other goods the U.S. can’t produce, mine, or grow. That includes specific aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals, specialty spices, coffee, and rare metals. Under the updated procedure, the U.S. Trade Representative and the Commerce Department will now have power to roll out trade agreements without waiting for direct orders from Trump. Some pharmaceuticals are also getting relief. Drugs like pseudoephedrine, antibiotics, and other medicines that were caught in a separate trade investigation by Commerce are now being pulled out of the tariff list. Gold jumps after ruling reversal, market bets on rate cuts Gold prices shot up immediately. Spot gold climbed 1.4% to $3,596.55 per ounce by Friday afternoon, after reaching a record high of $3,599.89 earlier in the day. U.S. gold futures for December closed 1.3% higher at $3,653.30. The metal has already surged 37% this year, building on a 27% gain in 2024. The rally is being driven by a weaker dollar, central bank purchases, lower interest rates, and widespread market uncertainty. “Gold makes new highs; bulls are looking at the clearly weakening trend of employment translating into multiple rate cuts,” said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader. “The outlook is undoubtedly bullish for gold as labour concerns override inflation for the short, probably medium term,” he added, but warned that prices are still “too far away from 4,000 unless there is a massive dislocation.” The U.S. labor market is showing signs of strain. August job growth slowed sharply, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. Markets are now expecting a 90% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut this month and a 10% chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Gold, which doesn’t earn interest, tends to attract more investors when rates are falling and global risks are high. Trump’s ongoing pressure on the Federal Reserve is adding to the volatility. He recently tried to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, which raised alarms about the Fed’s independence. Analysts say this kind of interference could push the central bank further toward easing. Even with all the excitement in the market, China and India, the biggest gold buyers, are pulling back. Demand for physical gold dropped this week because of the sky-high prices. Meanwhile, gold reserve data from China’s central bank is due Sunday. Sure it won’t reflect September’s price surge, but traders are watching it closely to see if central bank demand has started to cool. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

On Thursday, Trump told European officials to halt oil purchases from Russia, but didn’t give them a deadline, according to Reuters, which first reported the development from Copenhagen on September 5. On Friday, Dan Jorgensen, who handles the EU’s energy policies, made it clear in an interview that Washington hasn’t asked him to fast-track the deadline. “Not only has Putin weaponised energy against us, blackmailed member states, we are actually also indirectly helping finance Putin’s war, and that needs to stop. And if President Trump agrees to that, then that is only a welcome support, because that is certainly our main objective,” Jorgensen said. Right now, the European Union is finalizing legal rules to formally ban oil and gas imports from Russia within the next three years. These imports have been one of Russia’s biggest cash flows since its full invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and that money has gone straight into funding its war effort. Hungary and Slovakia resist, want gas and oil to keep flowing Not every EU country is on board. Hungary and Slovakia are still bringing in about 200,000 to 250,000 barrels of Russian oil every day through the Druzhba pipeline. That’s around 3% of the entire bloc’s oil needs. They’re also buying Russian gas and aren’t happy about Brussels’ timeline, warning that this cut-off could jack up energy prices and trigger shortages in their countries. Robert Fico, the prime minister of Slovakia, stood his ground during a press conference on Friday after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He refused to comment on Trump’s remarks but insisted that “reliable supplies were needed,” pointing out that several European nations are still buying Russian gas and U.S. liquefied natural gas to meet their energy needs. Jorgensen confirmed that talks are ongoing with both Hungary and Slovakia. However, he said their support isn’t required to push the plan through. “If, for domestic reasons, there are countries that don’t feel that they can support it, then this is not something that demands unanimity,” he said. He didn’t say whether Brussels plans to offer financial support or legal protections to win them over. The current phase-out proposal doesn’t need unanimous agreement. It just needs a reinforced majority from member states, and EU diplomats expect that group of energy ministers to approve the plan at their next meeting, happening sometime next month. US and EU to discuss massive gas purchase, Kremlin silent While all this is going down in Europe, the Kremlin hasn’t responded to Trump’s warning. Meanwhile, Jorgensen is getting ready to meet with U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright in Brussels next week. At the top of the agenda? A massive EU promise to buy $250 billion worth of U.S. energy each year under an ongoing U.S.-EU trade deal. Plenty of analysts have called that target unrealistic, saying the EU doesn’t have much power over what private energy companies choose to import. Jorgensen didn’t disagree. “It’s clear that our role is to facilitate. The EU is not a gas trader,” he said. Still, there are talks about ways to make it work. One option on the table is pooling demand, having European companies band together to order gas from the U.S. in bulk. It’s not locked in, but it’s being discussed as a way to help both sides stick to the deal. While Europe slashes its dependence on Russian oil, gas imports from Russia are still significantly higher. This year, about 13% of the EU’s gas is expected to come from Russia, a drop from 45% before the war began, but still a big number. Outside of Europe, Washington has started punishing countries that keep buying Russian fuel. India has been hit with new tariffs from the United States for its continued oil imports from Russia, and India fired back by accusing the West of being hypocrites.

Backed by strong adoption, DeFi integrations, and growing corporate treasuries, excitement is building among traders. Yet, while Binance Coin attracts long-term believers, another rising star, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is beginning to stir up hype as one of the most discussed cryptos making waves in the market. BNB Price Prediction 2025: Why Traders See $1,000 as Realistic The push toward the BNB $1000 target is not random speculation—it’s tied to adoption trends and real money entering the ecosystem. A standout example is CEA Industries , which has expanded its holdings to over 388,888 BNB , worth more than $330M, making it the largest corporate BNB treasury. This institutional move highlights strong BNB long term potential. Market watchers point out that BNB has already pushed near $900 in past cycles, and with DeFi expansion plus massive user activity, a run toward Binance Coin price forecast levels of $1,000 doesn’t look far-fetched. Analysts on X are calling this move “programmed since long,” with some predicting 1100+ BNB/USD in this bull cycle. BNB price analysis by Crypto King This mix of deep liquidity, corporate interest, and a bullish technical setup has reinforced the belief that Binance Coin price prediction models could see triple digits become history soon. For those studying BNB market analysis, the signs suggest institutional demand could be the force that drives BNB into four figures. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Crypto Generating Speculative Hype While BNB’s crypto price prediction for 2025 is grabbing headlines, the chatter across trading groups is increasingly shifting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its unique mission and fast-growing presence have made it one of the most talked-about new tokens. Traders fear missing out on a potential early-stage breakout, drawing parallels to how big names started before explosive moves. What stands out is the timing—BNB is being viewed as a large-cap bet, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a fresh opportunity for high-growth speculators. For those asking, “Will BNB reach $1000 by 2025?”, the conversation often turns to what could be the next rising project riding the same wave of attention. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in, feeding both curiosity and anticipation. Final Thoughts: From BNB’s $1,000 Goal to New Market Contenders The outlook for BNB price prediction and analyst insights shows confidence in the $1,000 milestone, driven by corporate accumulation, a strong DeFi presence, and user adoption. The BNB coin future looks promising as institutional players treat it like a digital treasury asset, strengthening the case for the BNB $1000 price target explained by analysts. At the same time, attention is shifting beyond the giants. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as the new exciting crypto to watch, with investors considering it the next major breakout.

This recent development, totaling a substantial $162 million on September 5, signals a notable shift in investor behavior within the institutional crypto landscape. For many, understanding these movements is crucial to grasping the broader market sentiment and potential future trends for Bitcoin. What’s Driving These Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows? According to data from TraderT, the collective net outflow of $162 million on September 5 saw several key players contribute significantly to the withdrawals. BlackRock’s IBIT, a prominent fund, led these movements with $64.95 million in outflows. Following closely were Bitwise’s BITB, which experienced $49.65 million in withdrawals, and Grayscale’s GBTC, seeing $47.33 million exit its coffers. Interestingly, no U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF reported any net inflows for the day, highlighting a broad-based withdrawal trend rather than a simple rebalancing between funds. These figures represent a clear pause, if not a reversal, in the previously strong accumulation seen in these investment vehicles. When we talk about “net outflows,” it means that more money was withdrawn from these ETFs than was invested. This metric is a powerful indicator of institutional confidence and short-term market sentiment, particularly for an asset like Bitcoin that is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance through these regulated products. Why Do Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Matter for the Crypto Market? The consistent recording of Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows carries significant weight for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Historically, the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs was hailed as a landmark moment, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. They offered institutional investors and retail traders a regulated, accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the underlying asset. Therefore, sustained withdrawals from these funds can signal a shift in institutional appetite or a broader cautious outlook. Here’s why these outflows are important: Market Sentiment: Consecutive outflows can dampen overall market sentiment, potentially leading to increased selling pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price. Institutional Confidence: They might suggest that some institutional players are taking profits, rebalancing their portfolios, or becoming more risk-averse in the short term. Liquidity Impact: While $162 million might seem small compared to Bitcoin’s overall market cap, sustained outflows can affect liquidity, especially if they persist over a longer period. Moreover, these movements often create a ripple effect. When major institutional products like BlackRock’s IBIT see significant withdrawals, it can influence the perceptions and decisions of other large-scale investors, potentially amplifying market trends. Navigating the Future Amidst Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Understanding the context behind these Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows is crucial for investors. While two days of outflows might not signify a long-term bearish trend, they certainly warrant close monitoring. Possible reasons for these withdrawals could include broader market risk-off sentiment, profit-taking after recent gains in Bitcoin’s price, or portfolio rebalancing as institutions adjust their asset allocations. It is also important to remember that market cycles are dynamic, and periods of withdrawal are a natural part of any investment landscape. What should investors watch for next? Continued Trends: Observe if the outflow trend persists for several more days or weeks, indicating a more entrenched shift. Bitcoin Price Action: Monitor how Bitcoin’s spot price reacts to these institutional movements. Significant drops could confirm a negative correlation. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic indicators, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical events can also influence institutional investment decisions in risk assets like Bitcoin. For those looking to make informed decisions, staying updated on these institutional flows is paramount. While short-term fluctuations are common, consistent trends in Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows can provide valuable insights into the health and direction of the institutional crypto market. In conclusion, the recent $162 million in Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows , marking a second straight day of withdrawals, serves as a critical data point for the cryptocurrency market. While not a definitive indicator of a prolonged downturn, it underscores the need for investors to remain vigilant and understand the various factors influencing institutional capital flows into digital assets. These movements highlight the evolving nature of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance and the continuous interplay between institutional sentiment and market performance. Staying informed and adaptable will be key for navigating the dynamic crypto landscape ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without having to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: What does “net outflow” mean for an ETF? A net outflow occurs when the total value of shares redeemed (sold back to the fund) by investors exceeds the total value of new shares purchased. It indicates more money is leaving the fund than entering it. Q3: How do Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows impact Bitcoin’s price? While not a direct one-to-one correlation, significant and sustained Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows can contribute to negative market sentiment and potentially increase selling pressure on Bitcoin, which could lead to a decrease in its spot price. Q4: Is this a common occurrence for ETFs? ETFs, including those for traditional assets, regularly experience both inflows and outflows as investors adjust their portfolios. However, consecutive days of significant net outflows, especially from newly launched products like Spot Bitcoin ETFs, warrant attention. Q5: What are the main reasons for these recent Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows? The exact reasons can vary, but common factors include profit-taking by investors after price gains, portfolio rebalancing, broader macroeconomic concerns leading to risk-off sentiment, or shifts in institutional investment strategies. Q6: Should individual investors be concerned by these outflows? Individual investors should view these outflows as one data point among many. It’s important to conduct your own research, consider your personal financial goals, and understand that short-term market fluctuations are normal. These outflows primarily reflect institutional activity. If you found this analysis insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

Ethereum has overtaken Bitcoin in key usage metrics, signaling a potential top for Bitcoin this cycle and stronger fundamentals for ETH. After a significant rally, I am downgrading the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) to 'hold,' seeing Ethereum as the better long-term investment. With yet another month in 2025 complete, we grind increasingly closer to decision time for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Bitcoin ETFs like the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (BATS: EZBC ). I've covered EZBC for Seeking Alpha in the past and happen to like the fund for its designed purpose; specifically, providing exposure to Bitcoin through what is probably a more familiar financial product for the broader investment community. The fund functions essentially identically to most of the other Bitcoin ETFs in the US market and offers a competitive fee. Data by YCharts To this point, the legitimacy of EZBC as a viable Bitcoin product isn't really the point of this update. We have seen over the last year that EZBC holds up just as well as the market-leading ETF product and is superior to futures-based alternatives. Rather, in this article we will take an updated look at Bitcoin's capital flow story as well as on-chain metrics through August to determine whether or not network fundamentals are showing any meaningful progress. Capital Flows Now Favor ETH Of course, on-chain utility is just one part of the story. The demand for BTC from DATs and ETF investors has been enormous in 2025. But it should be noted that investors are now starting to favor ETH over BTC. Consider the change in share of net flow dominance that we just witnessed in August: Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin -$301 $20,797 $166,721 Ethereum $3,955 $12,086 $37,856 Multi-asset -$4.4 $113 $7,619 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $388.8 $1,240 $3,277 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $307.0 $1,396 $2,659 Total $4,376 $35,527 $219,876 BTC Dominance -6.9% 58.5% 75.8% ETH Dominance 90.4% 34.0% 17.2% Source: CoinShares/Bloomberg, as of August 30th Through the end of August, full month net flows for Bitcoin were negative by over $300 million. By itself, that isn't a huge problem but the reason I see a potential issue is because the outflow is generally exclusive to Bitcoin. Solana and XRP both saw YTD flows grow dramatically in August. Almost $4 billion was poured into ETH during the month - which was a 50% increase in the year-to-date net flows for ETH from the end of July in just a single month. You can see from the dominance calculations in the table above that BTC's YTD flow dominance has fallen down to 58%. To be sure, August was a large outlier. But it is arguably a continuation of a trend that started in July: Through July 2025 (CoinShares/Bloomber) Where ETH net flows were almost at parity with BTC in July, August was decidedly an overweight ETH month. ETH is benefiting from both surging acquisitions by investors as well as improved on-chain fundamentals. Similar to the investment net flow story, Bitcoin's on-chain metrics in August also showed deterioration. On Chain Metrics Through August Bitcoin DAAs (Token Terminal) Monthly DAAs continue to trend flat-to-down for Bitcoin with 10.8 million active addresses during August. That was actually up 2.9% year over year but still well below highs from 2021 and 2023. Where DAAs have largely held up against averages through the first 7 months of 2025, transactions have been falling: Bitcoin Metrics August 2024 July 2025 August 2025 YoY MoM DAAs* 10.5 10.7 10.8 2.9% 0.9% Transactions* 18.5 13 14.1 -23.8% 8.5% Fees* $20.73 $16.42 $13.20 -36.3% -19.6% Avg Tx Fee $1.08 $1.28 $0.96 -11.1% -25.0% Source: Token Terminal, *figures in millions Transactions fell to 14.1 million in August. While that was up 8.5% from July, it was down by 24% year over year; coupled with the 11% dip in average transaction fee, monthly fees paid to miners fell to just $13.2 million in August. That was down 36.3% year over year and just under 20% from July. Share of Transferred Value (CoinMetrics) The other thing to consider is dollar-denominated transferred value. I've stacked ETH vs BTC transferred value shares in the chart above. After bottoming out at 27% share of transferred value in May, ETH rocketed up to 53% share of transferred value at the end of August. I see two major signals here. First, I believe it is indicative of Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in an important fundamental metric given the stark differences between the two assets in several other key metrics. And second, it could also be seen as an indication that Bitcoin's top is either close or already here for this cycle. During the 2017 bull run, ETH's share of transferred value peaked at 50%. In 2021 it hit 58%. At 53% currently, I think Bitcoiners would be wise to consider the possibility that the gains have been had for 2025. Final Thoughts There is perhaps an argument to be made that on-chain fundamentals don't really matter; that somehow, Bitcoin is a special asset that simply needs to be held to let supply/demand produce higher prices in perpetuity. After all, a major takeaway from the block size war last decade was that narratives can change and Bitcoin is more 'Digital Gold' than a decentralized 'peer to peer' money system. If that is true, then capital flows into the asset might really be the only thing that matters. Yet, I have long argued that assertion is false. And that all of the hoarding through ETFs and/or DATs will ultimately lead to network security issues down the line. Regardless, I've been willing to look beyond my own opinions of Bitcoin and simply follow the market instead. But the market is singing a different tune today. Where Bitcoin previously dominated all other digital assets through investor net flows, Ethereum is seemingly taken its turn. Importantly, beyond simply benefiting from investment demand, Ethereum has terrific fundamentals as well through usage and stablecoin transfer volume. This is not to say that I'm exiting my Bitcoin position entirely. Frankly, I have Bitcoin that I will likely never sell. But I think Ethereum is the better long term investment at this point in time. After an 82% rally from my initial coverage, I'm downgrading EZBC to 'hold.'",BTC-USD|EZBC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-06 02:32:01

If you’ve been tracking the performance of Spot ETH ETFs , you’re likely aware of the recent, rather dramatic, development. On September 5th, these investment vehicles experienced their second-largest single-day net outflow on record, totaling a staggering $444 million. This substantial withdrawal highlights the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and raises important questions about investor sentiment towards Ethereum-backed funds. What Triggered the Massive Spot ETH ETFs Outflow? The substantial $444 million net outflow from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs on September 5th wasn’t just a minor blip; it was the second-largest withdrawal event ever recorded for these products. This significant movement of capital indicates a notable shift in investor behavior, prompting market analysts to delve deeper into its underlying causes. Several key players were at the forefront of this outflow: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the pack with a massive $308 million shed. This single withdrawal accounted for the majority of the day’s total, underscoring its significant impact. Grayscale’s ETHE: Saw substantial withdrawals of $51.77 million, indicating broader market participation in the selling pressure. Fidelity’s FETH: Experienced outflows amounting to $37.77 million, further contributing to the overall negative sentiment. Grayscale’s Mini ETH Fund: Also registered a notable outflow of $32.62 million, suggesting that even newer or smaller funds were not immune to the trend. Understanding the specific drivers behind these individual fund withdrawals is crucial for comprehending the broader market dynamics affecting Spot ETH ETFs . Are Investors Losing Confidence in Spot ETH ETFs? While a single day’s outflow doesn’t necessarily dictate a long-term trend, such a significant event does raise questions about investor confidence in Spot ETH ETFs . Several factors could contribute to such a large-scale withdrawal, including broader market corrections, shifts in macroeconomic policy, or even specific news related to the Ethereum network itself. For instance, investors might be reacting to: Profit-taking: After periods of growth, some investors might choose to realize their gains, leading to outflows. Risk aversion: Global economic uncertainties or regulatory concerns could prompt investors to move capital out of perceived higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Alternative investments: New opportunities or a perceived safer haven might draw funds away from existing positions. It’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly interconnected. A downturn in Bitcoin or broader equities can often cascade into other digital assets, including Ethereum. Therefore, assessing the context of this outflow requires looking beyond just the Ethereum ecosystem. What Does This Outflow Mean for the Future of Spot ETH ETFs? The $444 million outflow, while substantial, should be viewed within the larger context of the evolving digital asset landscape. While it represents a significant withdrawal, the long-term prospects for Spot ETH ETFs remain a topic of intense debate among financial experts. Institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, suggesting a foundational interest that may withstand short-term volatility. Looking ahead, here are some actionable insights and considerations: Market Resilience: The ability of the market to absorb such large outflows and recover will be a key indicator of its maturity. Regulatory Landscape: Ongoing developments in cryptocurrency regulation, particularly in the U.S., will heavily influence investor sentiment and the appeal of these products. Ethereum’s Development: Continued innovation and stability within the Ethereum network itself will be vital for maintaining and attracting investor interest. Diversification: Investors often use ETFs as a tool for diversification. Understanding their overall portfolio strategy is key to interpreting these movements. This event serves as a crucial reminder of the inherent volatility in the crypto market. However, it also underscores the growing institutional presence and the increasing sophistication of investment vehicles like Spot ETH ETFs . Navigating Volatility: Key Takeaways for Spot ETH ETFs Investors For those invested in or considering Spot ETH ETFs , understanding the ebb and flow of capital is paramount. While large outflows can appear alarming, they are a natural part of dynamic markets. Long-term perspectives often emphasize the underlying technology and its potential, rather than focusing solely on daily price movements. Key takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and Ethereum network developments. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Long-Term View: Consider the long-term potential of Ethereum and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. In conclusion, the recent $444 million outflow from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs on September 5th was a significant event, marking the second-largest on record. While led by major players like BlackRock and Grayscale, this withdrawal highlights the ongoing volatility and evolving investor sentiment within the digital asset space. Far from signaling an end, it serves as a powerful reminder that while the journey of cryptocurrency adoption may have its bumps, the underlying interest and institutional infrastructure continue to develop. Investors are encouraged to remain informed and consider a balanced perspective when navigating these dynamic markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Spot ETH ETFs?

They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. 2. Why did Spot ETH ETFs see such a large outflow on September 5th? The exact reasons can be multifaceted, but common factors include profit-taking by investors, a general increase in market risk aversion due to broader economic conditions, or a shift of capital to other investment opportunities. This particular outflow was the second-largest on record, suggesting a significant market reaction. 3. Which funds were most affected by this outflow? The outflows were primarily led by BlackRock’s ETHA, which saw a $308 million withdrawal. Other significant contributors included Grayscale’s ETHE ($51.77 million), Fidelity’s FETH ($37.77 million), and Grayscale’s mini ETH fund ($32.62 million). 4. Does this outflow indicate a long-term bearish trend for Ethereum? A single day’s outflow, even a large one, does not necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. While it suggests a period of selling pressure or reduced confidence, the long-term outlook for Ethereum and Spot ETH ETFs depends on broader market sentiment, regulatory developments, and the continued evolution of the Ethereum network. 5. How should investors react to such significant market movements? Investors are generally advised to remain informed, maintain a diversified portfolio, and consider their long-term investment goals rather than reacting impulsively to short-term market fluctuations.

Specifically, the regulatory body has pushed back its review deadline for Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF application to November 8. This development marks another chapter in the ongoing saga of bringing mainstream investment vehicles to the digital asset space. For many, a spot ETF represents a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies like Polkadot (DOT). What Does This Grayscale Spot DOT ETF Delay Mean for Investors? When the SEC extends a review period, it signals that they require more time to thoroughly evaluate the proposal. This is a common occurrence for complex financial products, especially those involving novel assets like cryptocurrencies. For Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF , this means the commission is likely digging deeper into various aspects of the fund. They are scrutinizing market structure, investor protection measures, and the underlying Polkadot ecosystem itself. While frustrating for those eager for approval, it underscores the SEC’s cautious approach. Why Is the SEC Taking Its Time with Spot DOT ETFs? The SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors and ensure fair and orderly markets. When it comes to spot crypto ETFs, the commission often cites concerns about potential market manipulation, liquidity, and the custody of digital assets. Unlike futures-based ETFs, a spot ETF holds the actual cryptocurrency. This introduces unique challenges for regulators. Polkadot, with its innovative parachain architecture and staking mechanisms, presents a distinct set of considerations compared to more established assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The SEC needs to understand how a Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF would manage these complexities within a regulated framework. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of a Spot DOT ETF? The approval of a Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF could unlock several significant advantages for the broader market, alongside some inherent challenges. Benefits: Increased Accessibility: A spot ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Polkadot without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. This simplifies the investment process. Institutional Adoption: It could attract substantial capital from institutional investors, who often prefer regulated, easily tradable products. Enhanced Price Discovery: Greater participation from diverse investor groups could lead to more efficient and robust price discovery for DOT. Regulatory Clarity: An approval would set a precedent, potentially paving the way for other altcoin spot ETFs. Challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: The SEC’s ongoing concerns about market integrity remain a significant barrier. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings, and an ETF would expose investors to this volatility within a traditional investment vehicle. Competition: The market for crypto investment products is growing, and any new ETF would face competition from existing funds and direct crypto purchases. What’s Next for Grayscale’s Spot DOT ETF and Investors? The new deadline of November 8 now becomes a critical date on the crypto calendar. Investors and enthusiasts will be closely watching for any further announcements from the SEC. While extensions can be disheartening, they are not necessarily indicative of an eventual rejection. Often, they simply mean the regulatory body is conducting its due diligence thoroughly. For those interested in the Polkadot ecosystem, this period offers an opportunity to deepen their understanding of DOT’s technology and its potential market impact. Actionable Insight: Stay informed by following official SEC announcements and reputable crypto news sources. Understand that regulatory decisions can significantly influence market sentiment and asset prices. Conclusion: The extended review period for Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF highlights the cautious yet evolving relationship between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency space. While the wait continues, this process is crucial for establishing robust frameworks that protect investors and foster innovation. The outcome of this decision will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of institutional engagement with altcoins and the broader digital asset market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot ETF? A: A spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) holds the underlying asset directly. In this case, a spot DOT ETF would hold actual Polkadot (DOT) tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to DOT’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency itself. Q2: Why is the SEC extending the deadline for Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF? A: The SEC typically extends review periods for complex financial products to allow more time for thorough evaluation of market structure, investor protection, and the unique characteristics of the underlying asset, in this case, Polkadot. Q3: How does a spot DOT ETF differ from a futures DOT ETF? A: A spot DOT ETF directly holds Polkadot tokens, reflecting its current market price. A futures DOT ETF, however, invests in futures contracts that bet on Polkadot’s future price, rather than holding the asset itself. Q4: What impact could a Grayscale spot DOT ETF approval have on Polkadot (DOT)? A: Approval could significantly boost DOT’s visibility and liquidity, attracting more institutional investment and potentially leading to increased demand and price appreciation. It would also lend further legitimacy to the Polkadot ecosystem. Q5: Is an extension a bad sign for the approval of Grayscale’s spot DOT ETF? A: Not necessarily. While it prolongs the wait, extensions are a standard part of the SEC’s review process for novel financial products. It simply indicates that the commission requires more time for due diligence.

Generally investors who remain calm and stick to good strategies are the ones who recover the best. As the list of emerging projects grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE has garnered attention with its robust tokenomics and forward-looking ecosystem design, reminiscent of the early stages of today’s most-established digital assets. 1. Stay Calm and Stick to Your Plan The biggest mistake during a crash is panic selling. In past cycles, many investors with this attitude have lost their share of gains by cutting and holding on at the wrong times. Volatility is not a bug–it’s in crypto’s DNA. With a solid core of project fundamentals, development team, and long-term vision unharmed, a price dip can be a temporary setback without discrediting a project’s potential. Maintaining integrity in line with your original thesis can see you through the turbulence and be poised for recovery. 2. Buy the Dip Like It’s a Clearance Sale A crash is one of the best opportunities to establish long-term positions. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a straightforward but powerful strategy: invest a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of the price. When markets fall, you’re able to buy more units with your money, which reduces your average entry price. Instead of worrying about “catching the bottom,” DCA assures you progressively build strong assets at a discount. Quality projects on good fundamentals become much more appealing when they’re priced 50% cheaper than they were a few months ago. 3. Use Stablecoins or Staking for Flexibility If you don’t want to risk buying more during a crash, there are still options for how to approach your portfolio. Using stablecoins to keep a certain percentage of your capital helps protect against further downturns while ensuring that you retain sufficient liquidity to re-enter the market. At the same time, token staking or participating in DeFi programs enables you to earn passive rewards, even during market downturns. This way, you increase your token count while awaiting the next bullish wave. A Revolutionary New Opportunity Arises Amid this strategic approach, one project that is gaining traction is MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its strong tokenomics and long-term utility and scalability for holders. Its meteoric presale success and fast growing community reflect the early momentum that helped drive other mainstream assets before they became household names. Early movers are already positioning themselves seeing that today’s crash prices could well be tomorrow’s launchpad. Conclusion Crypto markets test investors’ patience, but they also offer a stage for disciplined strategies to stand out. Whether it’s navigating through tranquil confidence, acquiring discounted assets, or generating yield on the sidelines, downturns can be powerful stepping stones for long-term wealth. As projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE continue to make waves with their solid fundamentals and growth prospects, astute investors are leveraging the storm to position themselves for the next bull market.

The rumors alone can fuel a massive rally of more than 50%. Investors are now debating whether meme coins, once dismissed as speculative jokes, are stepping into a new era of institutional legitimacy. The sharp price reaction underscores the cultural power of meme coins. With communities numbering in the millions, Dogecoin and SHIB are unlike any other assets in the crypto market. Analysts say that if ETF products ever materialize, it would be a turning point not only for these tokens but for the broader meme coin ecosystem. Meanwhile, attention is also drifting toward new opportunities, with presale tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as alternatives for investors chasing early-stage growth. Dogecoin’s Case for an ETF Dogecoin, originally created as a joke, has since become a household name in crypto. It has been endorsed by celebrities and has even been integrated into payment systems. While no ETF application has been confirmed, the speculation is enough to remind investors of DOGE’s resilience. Price forecasts suggest DOGE could hit $0.60–$0.75 if ETF momentum continues. Shiba Inu’s Ecosystem Expansion Shiba Inu is more than just a meme. Its Shibarium layer-2 network and growing DeFi applications have expanded its use cases significantly. SHIB’s community-driven model means any ETF speculation is quickly amplified across social platforms. Analysts believe SHIB could rise to $0.00005–$0.00008 this cycle if institutional interest grows. Greater Opportunities in 2025 While Dogecoin and SHIB dominate the meme coin category, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention with its explosive presale growth. Mirroring Shiba Inu’s explosive run from its early cycle entry , MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most discussed low-cap opportunities. Its tokenomics are designed for scalability and sustainability, and thousands of investors have already secured allocations ahead of expected exchange listings.With $13 million raised in record time, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract investors, while analysts speculate it could be a game-changer for the crypto industry. Could Meme ETFs Actually Happen? Skeptics argue that ETFs tied to meme coins may never gain regulatory approval due to their volatility. However, with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs paving the way, analysts believe nothing is off the table. Even if meme coin ETFs remain speculative, the conversation alone is enough to ignite significant price movements. Conclusion The potential for a 50% surge Dogecoin and SHIB highlights how much effect an ETF approval could have on the memecoin market. While ETF speculation remains unconfirmed, the hype demonstrates the potential of meme coins to capture institutional attention. At the same time, new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are leveraging similar community-driven momentum to position themselves as the next viral success story. For investors, both meme coins and presale tokens represent high-risk, high-reward bets that could define the next chapter of crypto’s bull cycle.

Despite the pullback, bears have struggled to push the price below the $105,000 support zone, a level that has so far acted as a firm floor for the market. The debate among analysts is intensifying—some are calling for a deeper correction that could reset overheated sentiment, while others see current price action as a prelude to another test of all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Base Turns Neutral-Bearish As Flows Stay Weak Top analyst Maartunn shared fresh insights, describing the current environment as a “major Bitcoin reshuffle.” According to him, old coins are increasingly flowing into ETF wallets, a phenomenon marked by three significant waves: summer 2024, fall 2024, and summer 2025. Unlike past cycles, where such redistribution events typically occurred once before fading, this cycle has shown a repeated pattern of supply rotation. This unusual trend highlights a structural shift in Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Long-term holders appear to be reducing exposure, while ETFs and institutional vehicles continue to absorb supply. Whether this redistribution stabilizes the market or fuels further volatility will be a defining factor for Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months. Old Bitcoin Supply Unlocks: Market Dynamics In Focus According to Maartunn, a significant movement of 7,626 BTC aged between three to five years has recently taken place. This type of activity is notable because it signals long-term holders deciding to release dormant coins back into circulation. Historically, such events often coincide with heightened market uncertainty and shifts in investor behavior, reinforcing the narrative that old supply continues to play a decisive role in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. Despite this selling pressure, Bitcoin has managed to hold above the $110,000 level, showing resilience in the face of profit-taking from long-term holders. This stability is encouraging, as it demonstrates that buyers are stepping in to absorb supply, though the strength of that demand remains in question. Some market participants are pointing to ETF inflows as the primary reason Bitcoin has avoided a sharper correction. ETFs, by nature, act as a consistent demand sink, channeling institutional capital into Bitcoin through regulated frameworks. However, the risk remains that without robust new demand, the selling pressure from newly unlocked coins could begin to outweigh buying interest. If this happens, recent holders may face the brunt of volatility. For now, the market appears to be balancing between long-term holders’ profit-taking and institutional accumulation. This emerging dynamic highlights how Bitcoin’s current cycle differs from previous ones—ETF participation and repeated redistribution of old coins are reshaping the market structure. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether ETF inflows are strong enough to offset the increased activity of older supply and keep Bitcoin on a bullish path.

The chart highlights a rebound from the $109K–$110K demand zone, which has acted as short-term support during the past week. However, BTC now faces resistance as it tests the 50-day moving average (blue line at $111,661) and the 100-day moving average (green line at $114,382). These levels represent key barriers for bulls attempting to reclaim higher ground. The broader picture shows BTC still lagging behind its all-time high near $124,500, marked by the yellow resistance line. Despite multiple attempts, Bitcoin has struggled to generate enough momentum to retest this level, largely due to persistent selling pressure and cautious sentiment among traders. The red 200-day moving average at $114,746 sits just above current price action, creating a cluster of resistance levels that could limit upside in the near term.

Conversely, failure to sustain above $110K could see BTC revisiting lower supports around $106K–$108K. For now, consolidation dominates, with bulls needing fresh demand to push beyond resistance.

51265788,575437,1757127645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51265788.jpeg,Justin Sun Faces Backlash After Urging WLFI to Unfreeze Tokens,https://bitcoinist.com/justin-sun-face-backlash-urging-wlfi-unfreeze-token/,"Tron founder Justin Sun has once again found himself at the center of crypto controversy, this time over his frozen holdings in World Liberty Financials (WLFI). The project blacklisted Sun’s wallet last week, freezing nearly 595 million WLFI tokens worth over $100 million at the time. Sun has since taken to social media, urging the team to unlock his assets and warning that such actions undermine investor trust. Why Were Sun’s WLFI Tokens Frozen? The dispute began after blockchain data revealed a wallet linked to Sun transferred nearly $9 million worth of WLFI tokens to an exchange. Shortly afterward, WLFI’s team blacklisted the address, effectively freezing his tokens. Market observers claimed the move was designed to stop potential dumping that could further destabilize the token’s price, which has already lost more than 60% of its value since launch. WLFI debuted at $0.46 but now trades near $0.18, raising concerns about whale activity and the project’s governance. Critics argue the blacklisting contradicts the very principles of decentralization that blockchain projects are supposed to uphold. Sun Denies Dumping Allegations In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) , Sun rejected claims of market manipulation, stating the transfers were merely “small deposit tests” and not intended for selling. He called the freeze “unreasonable” and insisted that all investors should be treated equally. “Tokens are sacred and inviolable, this should be the most basic value of any blockchain,” Sun wrote. He added that unilateral freezes risk eroding confidence in WLFI, a project he supported early with both capital and strategic backing. On-chain analysis from firms like Nansen has also suggested Sun was not directly responsible for WLFI’s sharp price decline, instead linking the sell-off to large market-maker activity. Governance Concerns and Market Outlook The standoff between Sun and WLFI has amplified investor concerns about centralization and transparency within the project. Critics warn that blacklisting wallets without clear communication risks damaging WLFI’s credibility, especially at such an early stage. In an attempt to stabilize prices, the WLFI team has announced a buyback-and-burn program, including the destruction of 47 million tokens. However, uncertainty remains high as the dispute with Sun continues and market volatility weighs on investor sentiment. For now, Sun is pressing WLFI to restore his rights and unlock his frozen tokens, while the broader crypto community debates whether the project can recover trust, or whether this controversy marks the start of deeper governance challenges.

In a dramatic turn, crypto liquidations surged past an astonishing $216 million within just 24 hours, leaving many traders reeling. This sudden downturn predominantly impacted those holding long positions, underscoring the high risks involved in perpetual futures trading. What Are Crypto Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Understanding crypto liquidations is crucial for any market participant. Essentially, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. This mechanism is designed to prevent a trader’s balance from falling below zero, but it can lead to significant losses for the individual. When the market moves sharply against a leveraged position, especially long positions betting on price increases, these forced closures amplify selling pressure. This can create a cascading effect, driving prices down further and triggering even more liquidations across the market. Who Felt the Brunt of the Recent Crypto Liquidations? The past 24 hours painted a clear picture of where the pain was concentrated. Here’s a breakdown of the most affected assets: Bitcoin (BTC): Saw a massive $110 million in liquidations. A significant 59.23% of these were long positions, indicating a strong belief in upward price movement that was brutally unmet. Ethereum (ETH): Not far behind, ETH experienced $101 million in liquidations. Long positions accounted for 56.82%, showing similar bullish sentiment being caught off guard. Ethena (ENA): This relatively newer asset also faced substantial pressure, with $5.81 million liquidated. Again, long positions represented 54.71% of the total, highlighting a broader market trend. These figures demonstrate a widespread impact across major cryptocurrencies and newer projects alike, all suffering from aggressive market reversals and significant crypto liquidations . Navigating the Volatility: Lessons from Recent Crypto Liquidations Such significant crypto liquidations serve as a powerful lesson for traders. They highlight the double-edged sword of leverage. While leverage can amplify gains, it equally magnifies losses, making risk management paramount. Many traders, especially those new to perpetual futures, often underestimate the speed at which market conditions can change. One key takeaway is the importance of setting realistic stop-loss orders. These automated tools can help limit potential losses by closing a position once a certain price threshold is breached. Moreover, avoiding excessive leverage is a fundamental principle for sustainable trading, ensuring that even large price swings don’t immediately wipe out an entire portfolio. What Can Traders Do to Mitigate Risks? In the face of such market events, adopting a disciplined approach is vital. Here are some actionable insights: Prudent Leverage: Use leverage sparingly and understand its implications fully. Higher leverage means smaller price movements can lead to liquidation. Diversification: Spreading investments across different assets can help cushion the blow if one asset performs poorly. Stop-Loss Orders: Implement these to automatically close positions at a predetermined loss level, protecting capital. Market Analysis: Stay informed about market trends, technical indicators, and fundamental news that could influence price action. Emotional Control: Avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed, especially during periods of high volatility. These strategies are not foolproof but can significantly reduce exposure to catastrophic losses during events like the recent wave of crypto liquidations . The recent wave of crypto liquidations , totaling over $216 million, underscores the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the allure of quick gains is strong, the reality of significant losses is equally potent. This event serves as a critical reminder for all participants to prioritize robust risk management, educate themselves on market mechanics, and approach leveraged trading with extreme caution. Staying informed and prepared is the best defense against the market’s unpredictable swings.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto liquidations? A1: Crypto liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange because their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level, typically due to adverse price movements. Q2: Why were long positions hit hardest in this event? A2: Long positions bet on an asset’s price increasing. When the market experiences a sudden downturn or significant price drop, these positions are the first to suffer losses and face liquidation as the price moves against their bullish expectation. Q3: How can traders avoid liquidation? A3: Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, setting effective stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and employing sound risk management strategies to protect against unexpected market volatility. Q4: Does this mean the crypto market is in a downturn? A4: Significant crypto liquidations often indicate high volatility and selling pressure, which can be a sign of a short-term downturn or correction. However, the long-term trend requires broader analysis of market fundamentals and sentiment beyond a single 24-hour event. Q5: What role does leverage play in liquidations? A5: Leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. While it allows traders to control larger positions with less capital, it also increases the risk of liquidation, as even small price movements against a highly leveraged position can quickly deplete a trader’s margin.

Set to be the first-ever exchange-traded fund offering direct exposure to Dogecoin (DOGE), the move opens the door for both retail and institutional investors to gain access to the performance of the popular meme coin through traditional markets. DOGE’s Wall Street Debut Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas weighed in on the announcement and said that Rex appears ready to launch its Dogecoin ETF as early as next week under the ’40 Act, similar to its recently launched SSK, which is a US-listed ETF that gives investors exposure to Solana (SOL). According to Balchunas, Dogecoin is likely to be the first product rolled out, given the newly filed effective prospectus. However, he also highlighted that the filing references other potential offerings tied to Trump, XRP, and Bonk, and added that Rex may have additional crypto-themed ETFs in the pipeline. Meanwhile, the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) read , “The Fund’s investments in DOGE and DOGE futures contracts and swap agreements expose the Fund to the risks associated with an investment in DOGE because the price of these derivatives is substantially based on the price of DOGE. DOGE is a relatively new innovation and is subject to unique and substantial risks. The market for DOGE is subject to rapid price swings, changes, and uncertainty.” Dogecoin’s Rebound Signs? Over the last month, Dogecoin climbed more than 8%, reaching $0.216. The uptick was partly driven by CleanCore Solutions’ new Dogecoin treasury. The Nebraska-based manufacturer of aqueous ozone cleaning systems has become the first public company to hold DOGE as its primary treasury reserve. The firm announced a $175 million private placement, with backing from upwards of 80 institutional and crypto-native investors. Meanwhile, popular analyst Ali Martinez spotted that the TD Sequential indicator, which previously identified the top, has now flashed a buy signal for DOGE. This suggests that selling pressure may have exhausted in the short term, which could set the stage for a rebound.

Data from Santiment shows ADA’s bullish-to-bearish commentary ratio slumped to 1.5:1 this week — the lowest in five months. The sentiment dip coincided with a 5% rebound, suggesting traders who sold into frustration may have helped mark a local bottom. Historically, ADA rallies have tended to begin when retail sentiment is weakest. Santiment flagged a similar setup in mid-August, when a 2:1 ratio aligned with a surge. Conversely, euphoric spikes — like the 12.8:1 ratio earlier this summer — have preceded sharp pullbacks. Sentiment extremes matter because crypto markets are unusually sensitive to retail psychology. When optimism peaks, the crowd often buys into tops. When pessimism sets in, larger players use the selling pressure to accumulate. That pattern has been visible across multiple assets this year, including bitcoin and XRP. For Cardano, the shift suggests whales could use current weakness to build positions, especially if retail continues to capitulate. The crowd-versus-price divergence remains one of crypto’s more reliable short-term trading signals.

Blockchain data shows wallets holding more than 10 million XRP added over 600 million tokens in August alone. Analysts interpret this as a strong signal that large investors see upside potential ahead of a major catalyst: a potential U.S. ETF approval. Historically, whale accumulation has preceded significant rallies, and this activity suggests that $6 XRP may be back on the table sooner than many expected. At the same time, smaller investors searching for exponential ROI are looking toward presale markets, with MAGACOIN FINANCE increasingly seen as a high-beta counterpart to XRP’s institutional-driven momentum. ETF speculation intensifies The possibility of an XRP ETF has dramatically shifted sentiment. Analysts argue that approval could trigger billions in inflows, replicating the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year. Ripple’s growing partnerships with banks and payment providers further strengthen the case, demonstrating that XRP is more than speculative – it’s embedded in cross-border payment infrastructure. Technical picture strengthens On the charts, XRP has maintained support above $5.10, consolidating before its next move. Analysts highlight that a breakout above $5.60 could unlock momentum buying, paving the way for $6. RSI indicators remain balanced, suggesting room for growth. With whale buying underpinning technicals, the conditions align for a significant rally. XRP whales are building positions ahead of ETF decisions, signaling conviction. Retail investors, meanwhile, are chasing the presales that could multiply portfolios. A projected 70x multiplier has made MAGACOIN FINANCE a presale darling , with momentum building across major Telegram groups. Its dual audits from CertiK and HashEx provide rare legitimacy, separating it from meme coins that thrive on hype alone. Analysts say whale flows into XRP mirror retail flows into MAGACOIN FINANCE, both driven by expectations of outsized returns. As ETF approvals shape XRP’s future, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping its own as the high-beta presale defining 2025’s retail frenzy. Building a balanced portfolio Analysts stress that combining XRP’s utility-driven adoption with MAGACOIN FINANCE’s cultural-driven momentum allows portfolios to capture both institutional and retail dynamics. XRP provides stability and regulatory clarity, while MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers the exponential upside that only presales can offer. Conclusion With whales accumulating and ETF approval potentially around the corner, XRP’s $6 target is back in focus . But retail energy is gravitating toward presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its 70x projections and audit-backed legitimacy. Together, these assets highlight the dual forces – institutional and retail – that are shaping the 2025 cycle.

Today’s buyers want projects that combine real-world use, easy access, and long-term growth. While legacy coins like XRP and Chainlink continue to make the news, their pace is slowing as regulatory headwinds and scaling limits weigh them down. BlockDAG is taking a different path, turning the crypto script on its head. With more than 3 million users mining through its X1 Miner App and nearly $400M raised in presale funding, BlockDAG has also reset its token price to $0.0013 during the BDAG Deployment Event a move designed to ensure fairness and accessibility by replacing bonus tiers with one flat rate. This shift from passive speculation to active participation makes it one of the most compelling projects in today’s market. Chainlink: Strong for Enterprises, Weak for Retail Chainlink (LINK) is cementing its position in enterprise adoption with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 certifications, along with partnerships involving SWIFT, ICE, and J.P. Morgan. Recently, LINK surged over 12% to $27.80 on whale accumulation and higher trading volumes. After consolidating near $24, this breakout signaled renewed interest among larger holders. Yet Chainlink has not introduced simple tools like mobile mining apps or retail-friendly staking systems, unlike newer projects that thrive on participation. This lack of direct engagement for everyday users limits LINK’s ability to maintain momentum in a competitive space where platforms with millions of active participants are setting new standards. Although Chainlink remains vital in data infrastructure for blockchains, it struggles to keep pace with rivals that are focused on building accessible ecosystems. In a market where user adoption drives valuation, its limited outreach leaves retail audiences on the sidelines. XRP Settles After SEC Case But Retail Growth Lags XRP’s long battle with the SEC has finally ended, with both parties dropping their appeals. The outcome keeps the original ruling in place, along with a $125 million fine and an injunction. While this provides legal clarity, it has not ignited retail excitement. XRP is trading between $2.94 and $2.95, according to TradingView, with little sign of a breakout. Though institutional players remain engaged and Ripple continues to focus on banking solutions, XRP has not developed tools that invite mass participation. Key features such as accessible staking, retail-friendly mining, or a thriving dApp ecosystem are still absent. This leaves XRP heavily dependent on its role in cross-border payments rather than community-driven growth. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is hitting milestones that highlight genuine traction, such as 3 million users on its mining app, making XRP’s limited retail reach even more striking. Without ecosystem expansion, XRP risks falling behind projects actively driving adoption. BlockDAG X1 Miner Hits 3M Users & Accelerates Growth BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has crossed 3 million active users, turning crypto mining into something anyone can do from a smartphone. By removing expensive hardware from the equation, it has made mining widely accessible, showing that mass adoption is not an ambition but a reality. BlockDAG’s presale has now reached nearly $400M, with the token price reset to $0.0013 under the new flat-rate model from the BDAG Deployment Event. This adjustment simplified access for buyers while ensuring equal opportunity across the board. At its core, BlockDAG operates on a hybrid Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) framework. This design enables speeds of up to 15,000 transactions per second while maintaining the reliability of PoW validation. Unlike traditional blockchains, its parallel architecture ensures faster throughput without compromising security or decentralization. BlockDAG’s broader ecosystem is also expanding fast. Over 19,300 X-series mining rigs, including the X10, X30, and X100, are already in use. More than 4,500 developers are actively building on the network, powering over 300 decentralized applications. Tools like Dashboard V4 and the BlockDAG Academy enhance transparency and user education, boosting trust and adoption at every level. Key Insights Chainlink continues to evolve its oracle services and XRP holds its position in institutional payments, but neither has matched the tangible adoption milestones that excite today’s buyers. Neither has reached the scale or accessibility of BlockDAG, whose X1 App has already surpassed 3 million users and whose presale reset to $0.0013 reflects a fairer model for all participants. With nearly $400M raised, over 25.5 billion coins sold, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem, BlockDAG stands apart.

Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally MemeCore’s Meteoric Rise According to reports, M hit a fresh all-time high of $1.69 Friday before easing back to $1.60, while 24-hour volume climbed past $53 million. At the time of writing, M was up 250% in the weekly timeframe, data from Coingecko shows. That follows July lows near $0.036, a move that translates into roughly a 3,750% gain in about 90 days. Traders piled in quickly. A lot of money followed. Market Moves Outpaced Fundamentals Price action has been wild. Momentum indicators show parabolic behavior and the RSI has flashed extreme overbought readings, signaling the run may be stretched. Based on technicals, the token has swept through resistance levels since mid-August and is trading in territory where a fast reversal is possible. Some traders say M is being propelled by hype and big marketing plays more than by on-chain usage today. Event-Driven Hype And Community Stunts Reports have disclosed that MemeCore rented Seoul’s Lotte World for the final night of Korea Blockchain Week, an attention-grabbing move that pushed social interest higher. The project pitches itself as the first Layer-1 built for meme culture and uses a Proof of Meme consensus model alongside community-focused tokenomics. Those features have been shouted about in the community, and they help explain why momentum traders have shown up in force. Bulls Point To Network Story; Bears Point To Liquidity Risk Supporters highlight the promise of a meme-driven economy as reasons for continued upside. If consolidation holds above $1, a push toward $2 is floated by optimistic traders. But risks are clear. If $1 support gives way, liquidation cascades could accelerate downside toward $0.40–$0.50. Liquidity outside major centralized exchanges looks thin, and event-driven spikes can reverse quickly. Memecore Price Forecast And Sentiment Snapshot Meanwhile, based on current projections, MemeCore’s price is predicted to fall by 23% to about $1.19 by October 5, 2025. Market sentiment is still labeled Bullish by some indicators, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at 48, which is neutral.

The firm plans to deploy the fund’s proceeds to purchase BTC over the next six months. Sora Ventures Launches Massive Bitcoin Treasury Fund Speaking at Taipei Blockchain Week, Sora Ventures announced its goal of raising up to $1 billion for BTC acquisitions within the next six months. The firm has already secured $200 million in initial commitments from regional partners. Sora’s new fund follows the trend of individual Bitcoin treasury firms that have gained prominence in Asia over the past year or so, such as Japan’s Metaplanet , Hong Kong’s Moon Inc., Thai firm DV8, and South Korea-based BitPlanet, to name a few. However, unlike the aforementioned firms – which hold BTC directly on their balance sheets – Sora’s treasury fund will operate as a central pool of institutional capital. Its dual purpose is to support existing Bitcoin treasury firms and foster the development of similar entities worldwide. The fund seeks to position Bitcoin as a global reserve asset by creating synergies between Asian and international treasury players. To achieve this, Sora’s management team plans to onboard additional institutional partners. Sora’s strategy underscores the shift in Bitcoin adoption from North America toward Asia. While companies like Strategy – formerly MicroStrategy – have led BTC adoption in North America, Asia is increasingly becoming a focal point. Jason Fang, founder and Managing Partner at Sora Ventures, commented: Asia has been one of the most important markets for the development of blockchain technology and Bitcoin. We have seen a rise in interest from institutions investing in Bitcoin treasuries in the US and EU, while in Asia efforts have been relatively fragmented. This is the first time in history that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage. Notably, Sora Ventures has previously backed this trend. In 2024, the firm invested in Metaplanet to support its $6.5 million BTC allocation, and earlier this year, it acquired both Moon Inc. and DV8. Will BTC Rise In The Coming Months? Sora’s announcement of a near $1 billion Bitcoin purchase has reignited bullish sentiment, with many expecting fresh all-time highs. To recall, BTC’s most recent peak was $124,128 on August 14. Meanwhile, total BTC holdings of publicly-listed companies recently surpassed 1 million BTC, highlighting growing institutional confidence in the asset as a store of value. With Sora’s initiative, this figure is expected to rise even further. Adding to the momentum, recent reports suggest that institutional adoption is accelerating so quickly that Bitcoin miners are struggling to meet demand. At press time, BTC trades at $110,852, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|asia|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|DV8|Metaplanet|north america|Sora Ventures|Taipei blockchain week,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 04:00:30

With the broader crypto market heating up and investor optimism on the rise, ADA has become a key focus among altcoins with strong fundamentals. At the same time, investors are seeking additional opportunities beyond ADA, with many diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-growing project gaining traction ahead of altcoin season. ADA’s Position in the Market Cardano has steadily positioned itself as one of the top blockchain networks, backed by strong community support and ongoing development. Analysts suggest that ADA’s low transaction costs and ecosystem growth could drive renewed demand as the bull market matures. Despite facing resistance at key levels, sentiment around ADA remains bullish as long as Bitcoin maintains upward momentum. Technical and Fundamental Catalysts Several factors could contribute to ADA’s climb: Expanding use cases for smart contracts Strong developer activity within its ecosystem Increasing network participation and staking growth Broader market inflows as institutional players explore altcoins If these conditions align with a favorable macro environment, ADA’s price could realistically challenge the $5 target, potentially delivering significant upside for holders. The Project that Captures Early Investors While ADA looks promising, smart money is also moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project already generating buzz with its early-stage sellouts and rapid community expansion. Analysts are comparing its momentum to early-stage giants like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN, but with more real utility backing its growth. Early projections highlight that a $10,00 allocation could potentially grow into $50,000 or more , making it one of the most sought-after plays before altseason fully kicks in. The Road Ahead for ADA ADA’s path to $5 won’t be without challenges, with potential hurdles including regulatory shifts, Bitcoin dominance, and competition from rival Layer-1 networks. Still, if the market maintains its bullish structure, Cardano could see its strongest rally in years. For investors, combining established altcoins like ADA with emerging opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE could be a strategy to maximize potential returns in this cycle. Conclusion Cardano’s possible push toward $5 highlights its resilience and growth potential in the ongoing bull market. However, the spotlight is also shifting toward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offers high-risk, high-reward potential for early participants. Both established and emerging tokens could play a vital role for investors aiming to capture the biggest gains before the bull cycle ends.

Cybersecurity firm HiddenLayer disclosed Thursday that attackers can weaponize a so-called “CopyPasta License Attack” to inject hidden instructions into common developer files. The exploit primarily affects Cursor, an AI-powered coding tool that Coinbase engineers said in August was among the team's AI tools. Cursor is said to have been used by “every Coinbase engineer.” How the attack works The technique takes advantage of how AI coding assistants treat licensing files as authoritative instructions. By embedding malicious payloads in hidden markdown comments within files such as LICENSE.txt, the exploit convinces the model that these instructions must be preserved and replicated across every file it touches. Once the AI accepts the “license” as legitimate, it automatically propagates the injected code into new or edited files, spreading without direct user input. This approach sidesteps traditional malware detection because the malicious commands are disguised as harmless documentation, allowing the virus to spread through an entire codebase without a developer’s knowledge. In its report, HiddenLayer researchers demonstrated how Cursor could be tricked into adding backdoors, siphoning sensitive data, or running resource-draining commands — all disguised inside seemingly innocuous project files. “Injected code could stage a backdoor, silently exfiltrate sensitive data or manipulate critical files,” the firm said. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on Thursday that AI had written up to 40% of the exchange’s code, with a goal of reaching 50% by next month. However, Armstrong clarified that AI-assisted coding at Coinbase is concentrated in user interface and non-sensitive backends, with “complex and system-critical systems” adopting more slowly. 'Potentially malicious' Even so, the optics of a virus targeting Coinbase’s preferred tool amplified industry criticism. AI prompt injections are not new, but the CopyPasta method advances the threat model by enabling semi-autonomous spread. Instead of targeting a single user, infected files become vectors that compromise every other AI agent that reads them, creating a chain reaction across repositories. Compared to earlier AI “worm” concepts like Morris II , which hijacked email agents to spam or exfiltrate data, CopyPasta is more insidious because it leverages trusted developer workflows. Instead of requiring user approval or interaction, it embeds itself in files that every coding agent naturally references. Where Morris II fell short due to human checks on email activity, CopyPasta thrives by hiding inside documentation that developers rarely scrutinize. Security teams are now urging organizations to scan files for hidden comments and review all AI-generated changes manually. “All untrusted data entering LLM contexts should be treated as potentially malicious,” HiddenLayer warned, calling for systematic detection before prompt-based attacks scale further.

Most larger-cap alts have failed to post any significant gains, aside from HYPE, which has jumped to over $47, and ENA, which has risen by 13%. BTC Stopped at $113.5K The primary cryptocurrency tried to break out at the end of the previous business week, but the bears were quick to intercept the move and halt it in its tracks. As such, the asset fell from $113,500 to under $107,500 within a day or so. The following 48 hours were painful as well, as bitcoin failed to recover any of the losses and marked a new multi-week low of $107,100 on September 1. The bulls finally tried to step up at this point, and after some shaky performance, drove BTC out of this local bottom to over $111,500 by Tuesday. Another rejection followed suit, but this time it was less painful, and bitcoin slipped to $109,000. The asset went on the offensive once again on Friday, surging toward $113,500 after a weak jobs report in the US. That was another short-lived rally, though, as BTC lost almost all gains immediately in a drop to $110,400, which left over $300 million in liquidations. It has calmed at around $111,000 ever since, with its market cap at just over $2.2 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts at 56.5%. BTCUSD.

ENA follows suit, with a 13% surge that has taken it to $0.73. PUMP and HYPE are next, with 10% and 4.5%, respectively.

IT ‘Oopsie’ Wipes Gensler’s Texts The SEC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) has shared the final report detailing the findings of its review of the Office of Information Technology’s (IOT) actions that led to the loss of former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s text messages between 2022 and 2023. According to the September 3 report, the OIT implemented a “poorly understood and automated policy” in August 2023 that caused “an enterprise wipe of Gensler’s government-issued mobile device.” Seemingly, Gensler’s government-issued device was erroneously flagged as inactive and had not been backed up for nearly a year. OIT “hastily performed a factory reset,” which deleted text messages stored on the device and the device’s operating system logs between October 18, 2022, and September 6, 2023. The incident was worsened after a series of “additional OIT actions, deficiencies, and missed opportunities, including a lack of backups and procedures that failed to consider record retention requirements for Capstone officials (such as Gensler),” the report explained. The regulatory agency reportedly worked to recover or recreate the deleted text messages but was “unable to collect or determine the entire universe,” including some federal records . The review found that around 38% of the recovered text conversations were mission-related and concerned matters directly involving SEC senior staff and/or Commissioners at the time, making them records. Among the recovered messages, the SEC retrieved a May 2023 conversation involving Gensler, his staff, and the Director of the Division of Enforcement about when the SEC would file an action against certain crypto asset trading platforms and their founders. Crypto Leaders Call Out Prior SEC Leadership On Thursday, crypto industry leaders and participants commented on the previous SEC leadership’s “mistake” and the implications. Nate Geraci, chairman and president of The ETF Store, stated , “Think about everything that happened in crypto during this time. Basically FTX collapse thru Grayscale spot btc ETF lawsuit. Makes you think.” Many noted that the period of the deleted texts also overlaps with part of “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” the SEC’s enforcement actions against multiple crypto exchanges, the release of the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), and anti-crypto policies from other regulatory agencies. In an X threat, Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal criticized the prior leadership for the apparent hypocrisy after “all the lecturing (…) about data preservation. All the haranguing. All the self-righteousness.” The CLO affirmed that “this isn’t some ‘oops’ moment. This was a destruction of evidence relevant to pending litigation.” The IOG report noted that the loss of the former chairman’s text messages may impact the SEC’s response to certain Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. It’s worth noting that Coinbase submitted a FOIA request in March asking how much the regulatory agency had spent on crypto-related enforcement actions. As reported by Bitcoinist, the crypto exchange sought the supporting documentation used to create the current and past annual budget and performance reports. Additionally, it inquired about the number of employees and third-party contractors who worked on these investigations and enforcement actions, and “know more about the previous SEC’s infamous ‘Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit’ within the Enforcement Division.” “We all deserve better, especially from ‘leaders’ who see fit to smear others and cast aspersions so freely,” Grewal concluded.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Coinbase CLO|crypto industry|crypto record|Gary Gensler SEC|Operation Chokepoint 2.0|Paul Grewal|SEC crypto crackdown|US SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 05:00:33

However, just a day after its debut, the token’s price plummeted, sparking intense speculation regarding its major investors, particularly Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain. Alleged Manipulation By Justin Sun Market expert Quinten Francois provided insights into the WLFI launch, which initially priced at $0.20, reaching a market capitalization of $1 billion. Despite the excitement surrounding the launch, which generated billions in trading volume, the token’s value continued to decline. Interestingly, this downturn occurred even as the community seemed to hold onto their tokens rather than sell them. Francois speculated that exchanges might have offloaded part of their holdings, estimated at 2.8%. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts The XRP Price If 10% Of Global Assets Are Tokenized Allegations have surfaced that Justin Sun engaged in dubious tactics by channeling WLFI through his exchange, HTX. He reportedly offered users a 20% annual percentage yield (APY) for depositing WLFI, allowing him to offload a significant portion of his own holdings under the guise of user staking. Allegations suggest that this maneuver not only enabled him to profit from the situation but also that he intended to cover any withdrawals or sell-offs with his own tokens, further complicating retail investors’ returns. As Bitcoinist reported on Thursday, Sun’s alleged manipulation led to the freezing of his wallet address. As a result, there is growing concern among experts that WLFI could ultimately face a trajectory toward zero. Could The WLFI Price Plummet To Zero? In a recent social media post, user OxPunisher outlined the patterns of manipulation associated with Sun, referencing his history of questionable trades between 2018 and 2020, which reportedly resulted in $31 million in illicit profits. This ongoing saga continued into 2024, when Sun withdrew $732 million worth of Bitcoin from USDD collateral, and in late 2024, he invested $30 million into WLFI just as the SEC paused his case, further raising alarms among investors. Related Reading: First US Dogecoin ETF Could Debut Next Week—How Will It Impact Price? The narrative surrounding WLFI appears precarious at best. The expert asserts that without Justin Sun’s liquidity strategies the token’s value could collapse. Moreover, without the backing of high-profile figures like President Donald Trump, the narrative that initially attracted investors may lose its momentum entirely. This situation has led OxPunisher to believe that this situation can result in panic selling and a shift toward safer investment options by the platform’s investors, which could further increase the WLFI’s sell-off and downtrend seen in the past few days.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/institutions-are-quietly-loading-xrp-heres-the-latest/,"X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a well-followed voice in the crypto community, recently highlighted an important development for XRP and its growing institutional presence. Commenting on a corporate filing, he revealed that Monex Group has increased its ownership in 3iQ, the Canadian firm behind the country’s first spot XRP ETF . His remarks reflect the rapid growth of assets managed by the company and the role XRP is playing in its strategy. BREAKING Institutions are loading $XRP exposure, aggressively Monex increased its stake in 3iQ, the same firm behind Canada’s XRP ETF. AUM? Up 39% YoY. XRP? Core to their strategy From $32M→ $50M→ $148M+ in just months Monex isn’t buying shares They’re buying $XRP future pic.twitter.com/cKwJo2MvIA — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) September 4, 2025 Monex Deepens Its Investment in 3iQ On September 4, 2025, Monex Group confirmed that it had acquired additional shares of 3iQ Digital Holdings through its wholly owned subsidiary. The filing shows Monex bought over 4.1 million shares, bringing its total to more than 12.1 million. This move raised Monex’s ownership of voting rights in 3iQ to approximately 97.8%, solidifying its control of the firm. Since Monex became the majority owner in April 2024, 3iQ has broadened its digital asset offerings, including the launch of the Solana ETF in April 2025 and the XRP ETF in June 2025. According to the filing, 3iQ’s assets under management climbed from CAD 1.085 billion at the end of June 2024 to CAD 1.51 billion a year later, reflecting a 39% increase. This growth has been closely tied to the success of its crypto products, with XRP now considered a central part of the portfolio. The XRP ETF’s Strong Early Performance 3iQ launched the XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ) on June 18, 2025, becoming the first of its kind in North America. The ETF debuted with a management fee of 0% for the first six months, offering a unique incentive to attract investors, and from the outset, investor interest was strong. Within a few days, assets under management exceeded CAD 32 million, making it the largest XRP-focused ETF in Canada at the time. Less than a month after launch, the fund had already passed $50 million in client assets. The pace of growth has continued. As of September 3, 2025, the ETF managed over CAD 152 million ($110.3 million). This rapid rise demonstrates that institutional and retail demand for regulated XRP exposure is stronger than many expected.

The expansion of Monex’s stake in 3iQ and the surge in ETF inflows point to a growing recognition of the digital asset’s role in the broader digital asset landscape.

While XRP continues to battle the bears under the $3 price mark amid broader market uncertainty, analyst EGRAG believes the token could prevail in the long run. For context, XRP dropped 25% from its July peak of $3.65 to around $2.7 earlier this month.EGRAG Is Convinced XRP Will Reach Double DigitsDespite having recovered from this low, it still trades below the $3 region, currently changing hands at $2.82. While most analysts believe XRP is capable of recovering from this bearish spell, some like Crypto Rover suggest its next upward push could only reach levels such as $4, which could mark its top.However, EGRAG disagrees with this idea. According to him , if XRP ever recovers from this bearish price action to surpass the previous $3.66 peak, its target for this cycle would be much higher than $4. EGRAG believes it is either $3.66 already marked the cycle top, or XRP still has the potential to reach levels between $22 and $27.Double Bottom Pattern Strengthens this ConvictionNow, in his latest analysis , he presented another technical pattern that strengthens the case for an XRP rally toward the $22 region. Specifically, XRP appears to have already broken out of a multi-year double bottom formation that began as far back as 2018.For the uninitiated, a double bottom structure typically occurs when an asset collapses to a local bottom, recovers from this initial bottom, and then drops to a low level similar to the initial bottom before eventually rebounding to higher levels.With XRP, the formation of the pattern began in early 2018. According to data from EGRAG's chart, XRP formed the first bottom when it slumped from the $3.31 peak in January 2018 to a floor price of $0.1140 in March 2020 before recovering to a high of $1.9669 by April 2021. XRP Double Bottom Structure | EGRAG Crypto Meanwhile, the second bottom structure materialized as XRP dropped from the $1.9669 peak in April 2021 to a low of $0.2870 in June 2022 on the back of the Terra ecosystem implosion, and then rebounded to the $1.95 high by November 2024 amid the broader market uptrend triggered by the U.S. elections .These price movements essentially formed the double bottom structure, with the neckline sitting around $1.95 to $2. XRP eventually broke above the neckline when it soared past $2 in December 2024. This push helped validate the structure, setting the stage for greater heights.XRP Eyeing $22 to $27 TargetHowever, since January 2025, XRP's price action has failed to push forward, forming a months-long parallel channel between $2 and $3.6. EGRAG's chart points out that once XRP breaks above this channel, a rally to higher levels could emerge. The analyst sets the same $22 to $27 target for this imminent break.Meanwhile, in the short term, market watcher Dom recently sounded a warning while analyzing the XRP/USOIL chart. According to him, XRP is currently hanging by a thread, and the bulls need to step in; otherwise, it could drop to 7-month lows.

If you’ve been following the market, you might have noticed a buzz around companies joining forces or acquiring competitors. This isn’t just chatter; the numbers confirm a monumental shift in the industry. What’s Driving This Unprecedented Crypto M&A Boom? According to insights from crypto data analytics firm Messari, the total volume of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the crypto industry has skyrocketed to an astonishing $11.98 billion this year. This figure is more than triple the annual transaction value recorded over the past four years, marking a significant milestone. But what exactly is fueling this remarkable growth in Crypto M&A ? Messari’s analysis points to several key factors that are converging to create this fertile ground for deals: Market Maturation: The crypto industry is no longer in its infancy. Established projects and companies are seeking to consolidate, streamline operations, and expand their market share, leading to more strategic acquisitions. Increased Institutional Investor Interest: Big players from traditional finance are increasingly looking to enter the crypto space. Acquiring existing crypto firms provides a quicker and less risky entry point, bringing significant capital and expertise into the ecosystem. Improved Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape is becoming clearer in many jurisdictions. This reduced uncertainty makes it safer and more attractive for companies to engage in large-scale transactions, fostering confidence in Crypto M&A deals. How Does Crypto M&A Benefit the Ecosystem? This wave of Crypto M&A isn’t just about big numbers; it brings substantial benefits to the entire digital asset ecosystem. When companies merge or acquire others, it often leads to enhanced services, stronger platforms, and greater innovation. Here are some of the positive impacts we are seeing: Innovation and Efficiency: Mergers can combine complementary technologies and teams, leading to faster development of new products and services. This can result in more efficient operations and a better user experience for users and investors alike. Consolidation and Stability: As the market matures, some consolidation is natural. It can lead to fewer, but stronger, players, which might bring more stability and trust to the crypto landscape. This also helps in weeding out less viable projects. Access to Capital and Talent: Acquisitions often provide smaller, innovative companies with the capital and resources they need to scale, while larger entities gain access to specialized talent and cutting-edge technology. This synergy is vital for long-term growth in Crypto M&A . What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Crypto M&A? While the current surge in Crypto M&A is exciting, it’s not without its challenges. Navigating complex legal frameworks, integrating diverse corporate cultures, and valuing intangible digital assets can be intricate processes. However, these challenges also present unique opportunities for growth and refinement within the industry. Looking forward, we can anticipate: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Continued regulatory developments will play a crucial role. Clearer guidelines could further accelerate M&A activity, while fragmented or restrictive policies might pose hurdles. Staying informed on these changes is key for any entity involved in Crypto M&A . Strategic Partnerships: Beyond outright acquisitions, we may see an increase in strategic partnerships and joint ventures, allowing companies to leverage each other’s strengths without full integration. This flexibility can drive innovation in new areas. Focus on Niche Markets: As the crypto space diversifies, M&A activity might increasingly focus on specific niche markets like DeFi, NFTs, or GameFi, where specialized expertise and technology are highly valued. The near $12 billion in Crypto M&A volume this year is a powerful testament to the industry’s rapid evolution and growing significance. It signals a shift from speculative novelty to a more established and integrated financial sector. This trend, driven by market maturity, institutional embrace, and regulatory progress, is reshaping the competitive landscape and paving the way for a more robust and innovative future for digital assets. The journey of crypto is just beginning, and M&A activity is clearly a major part of its next chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Crypto M&A? Crypto M&A refers to mergers and acquisitions within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, where one company acquires another, or two companies combine to form a new entity. These deals involve digital asset companies, platforms, or related service providers. 2. Why is Crypto M&A increasing now? The increase is attributed to market maturation, where the industry is growing beyond its initial speculative phase. Additionally, increased interest from institutional investors and improved regulatory clarity are making these transactions more feasible and attractive. 3. What are the benefits of Crypto M&A for the industry? Benefits include fostering innovation, increasing efficiency through combined resources, consolidating the market for greater stability, and providing access to capital and specialized talent for growing projects. 4. Are there any risks associated with Crypto M&A? Yes, challenges include navigating complex legal and regulatory frameworks, integrating different corporate cultures and technologies, and accurately valuing intangible digital assets. These factors require careful due diligence. 5. What does the future hold for Crypto M&A? The future likely involves continued growth, potentially with a focus on strategic partnerships and niche market acquisitions. Ongoing regulatory developments will significantly shape the pace and direction of future Crypto M&A activity.

While the crypto market has entered a downturn, some investors remain optimistic that the bull run is far from over. Interestingly, as market watchers anticipate higher prices in this cycle, asset manager Bitwise is already projecting Bitcoin's potential price in the next 10 years.Bitwise Predicts Bitcoin to Hit $2.97M in 2035Specifically, in one of its recent reports, Bitwise predicted that Bitcoin could grow to a price between $1.3 million and $2.97 million by 2035, a decade from now. According to the report, in a base case scenario, the Bitcoin price would trade at $1,306,740 by 2035. Meanwhile, it could reach as high as $2.97 million in a bull case.With Bitcoin currently changing hands at around $111,000, either of the two cases would translate to an impressive growth for the premier crypto asset over the next decade. However, what's more exciting is how this could impact the broader crypto market, spilling into altcoins like XRP.This is typically due to the correlation between Bitcoin and the crypto market. This correlation can be a bittersweet experience for altcoins, as they usually drop with Bitcoin during market uncertainties , but appreciate with the firstborn crypto when it stages a recovery campaign. As a result, Bitwise's future outlook for Bitcoin bodes well for altcoins, especially top ones like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, which remain closely aligned with Bitcoin. For instance, data from Macroaxis shows that Bitcoin and XRP have a near-perfect correlation coefficient of 0.91 over the past three months. Bitcoin and XRP Price Correlation Macroaxis Bitcoin and XRP Price Correlation | Macroaxis Notably, this shows that both assets have moved together within this period, showing almost no diversification. If this pattern persists over the years and Bitcoin hits $2.97 million, XRP will likely claim higher prices. For context, Bitcoin would need to surge 2,575% from its current price to reach the $2.97 million target from Bitwise .Possible XRP Price if BTC Hits $2.97MToday, XRP trades for $2.83. If it replicates a similar 2,575% upsurge, the price will rise to $75.7, marking a new all-time peak. However, it is unlikely that XRP will trail Bitcoin's price movements so closely due to the slight deviations both assets face during these rallies. Specifically, XRP often surges at a higher pace during periods of market growth. For instance, over the past three months, while both assets have had a close price correlation, Bitcoin is up 6%. Meanwhile, XRP has gained by a massive 30%, outperforming BTC by exactly 5x.Supposing this deviation in price performance drops to around 2x in the future, XRP would soar to a price of $151.4 when Bitcoin claims a $2.97 million value. Interestingly, Telegaon analysts expect XRP to surpass this $151 price level, but they predict this could happen in 2040, five years later.

Indeed, in a crowded market filled with so many projects, answering that question is hard. However, analysts’ spotlight on Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) has pushed them to the forefront of the conversations as breakout altcoin contenders. While leaders like Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate headlines, investors’ attention is already shifting to DOT and AVAX. In this conversation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also surfacing as part of a growing list of top altcoin opportunities to watch in Q4 2025. Polkadot Shows Steady Progress Polkadot has rolled out several ecosystem updates in recent weeks. The creation of Polkadot Capital Group aims to bring more institutional adoption, while Gavin Wood’s return as CEO has energized developers. The Polkadot 2.0 upgrades, already showing testnet speeds of 143,000 transactions per second, give the network a technical edge. Despite its current range near $3.80, Polkadot price prediction points to $10 as a possible year-end target. Government-backed tokenization projects and new staking rewards are also fueling interest. For now, DOT remains an undervalued Layer 0 asset with plenty of room to grow. Avalanche Expands Real-World Utility Avalanche continues to add real-world use cases. Visa has integrated AVAX for stablecoin payments, giving it a foothold in global finance. Daily transactions jumped 170% year over year, fueled by gaming, NFTs, and tokenized assets. The network also reduced fees by more than 40% and plans further scalability upgrades later this year. Avalanche forecast shows short-term stability between $23 and $25, with bullish targets above $60 if adoption accelerates. Institutional funds and staking demand reinforce Avalanche’s role as one of the more utility-driven blockchains in 2025. A Rising Altcoin Contender Rises on Analysts’ Watchlists MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising on analysts’ radar as an undervalued pick for investors seeking high ROI altcoins in 2025. The project is an early-stage project with a lot of traction and more room to grow in the coming years. Experts spotlighting the token say its low entry price makes it a compelling pick for retail and whale investors. Already, a growing segment of the crypto market is rapidly accumulating the token ahead of the market recovery. With analysts’ coverage increasing and demand going through the roof, the token may be one of the best crypto investments to hold in 2025. Outlook DOT and AVAX are positioned as two of the undervalued gems for investors. The two tokens continue to benefit from growing adoption and evolving upgrades. The forecast for the two tokens suggests higher upside play in 2025 should the bear pressure reduce. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains firmly in the spotlight as the hidden gem that is reshaping the altcoin market. For investors hunting for top altcoin opportunities this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE, DOT, and AVAX are the names to keep on your radar.

The launch adds to Itaú’s growing crypto lineup, complementing its Bitcoin ETF and retirement plan with digital-asset exposure. Ex-Hashdex executive João Marco Braga da Cunha will oversee the new unit. He even commented, “The crypto asset segment has unique characteristics for generating alpha. It’s a relatively new market that creates major opportunities due to its volatility.” Itau’s new crypto arm will focus on bond-like products Itaú Asset lets users directly trade 10 crypto pairs via its mobile platform, featuring assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and USD Coin, while providing in-house custody. Now, the firm is expanding its crypto division , saying its new crypto unit will work on solutions, including bond-like products as well as higher-volatility plays like derivatives and staking-based vehicles. It will also function under Itaú Asset’s mutual funds structure, which manages upwards of 117 billion reais across 15 desks. So far, Itaú has appointed Cunha, who previously directed portfolio management at Hashdex, to run the division, supervising the development of fixed-income-style products and higher-risk crypto strategies. His experience with ETFs and funds positions him well to shape offerings for Brazil’s emerging crypto market. Brazil ranks 10th in global crypto adoption Brazil has taken to crypto products in the last few months. Chainalysis places Brazil in 10th place in its 2024 ranking of global crypto adoption. The country’s crypto momentum is primarily backed by government policy. In 2023, it rolled out a nationwide crypto law, creating a framework for virtual asset companies and assigning regulatory authority to the central bank. Itaú Unibanco even introduced crypto trading for individual investors in December 2023, shortly after the law took effect, initially supporting Bitcoin and Ether. Brazil’s securities regulator also authorized the nation’s debut spot XRP ETF from Hashdex in February 2025. Soon after, Braza Bank announced a project to release a real-linked stablecoin using the XRP Ledger. At that time, Marcelo Sacomori, the CEO of Braza Group, noted the stablecoin would be a game-changer for global financial markets. Created for foreign currency payments, the asset is tailored to increase the stability and effectiveness of cross-border operations. The Latin country is already emerging as a case study in how a clear regulatory framework can integrate crypto into traditional banking systems. Itaú’s ability to launch compliant custody services also reassures investors and signals the industry’s maturation. Combined with rising adoption rates across Latin America, this momentum positions Brazil as a hub for crypto innovation and a magnet for future investment. However, despite progress, there are still open questions around regulation. In June, Brazil overhauled its tax rules, scrapping the progressive system in favor of a flat 17.5% tax on crypto capital gains. The reform also removed the long-standing rule that allowed up to 35,000 reais ($6,500) in monthly tax-free sales and broadened taxation to cover self-custody, offshore assets, DeFi activity, NFTs, and staking rewards. The executive order drew swift criticism and was repealed before the month ended. Get seen where it counts.

Stablecoin Exchange Reserve Has Witnessed A Rise Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has talked about the latest trend in the combined Exchange Reserve of the Ethereum and Tron-based stablecoins . The “ Exchange Reserve ” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset or group of assets that’s sitting in wallets connected to centralized exchanges. Generally, one of the main reasons why investors deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, so the supply present on them may be looked at as a measure of the “available sell supply” of the cryptocurrency. When Bitcoin or another volatile coin observes an increase in this supply, it’s naturally a bearish sign for its price. The same, however, isn’t true in the case of stablecoins, as they are, by definition, stable around the $1 mark. Instead, inflows of these fiat-tied tokens may actually be a bullish sign for the market. Investors usually park their capital in the form of stables when they temporarily want to avoid volatile markets. Once they have decided it’s time to switch back, they deposit to exchanges and swap into BTC or whatever desired asset. Because of this role of stables, they are sometimes considered as the buy-side liquidity of the sector. Now, here is a chart that shows how the Exchange Reserve has changed for the different ETH and TRON-based stablecoins over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the stablecoins have seen their Exchange Reserve surge recently, implying there has been demand for depositing these tokens into exchange custody. The latest growth has mainly been driven by the two largest stables, USDC and USDT. Following these recent net inflows, the indicator has been able to set a new record of around $68 billion. As for how the various platforms compare in their share of this liquidity, the below chart shared by CryptoQuant breaks it down. From the graph, it’s visible that Binance holds the largest share of the indicator at $44.2 billion (67%). The next largest platform is OKX, having a reserve of just $9 billion. These two exchanges have been the main platforms behind the recent growth in stablecoin liquidity. Over the past month, Binance and OKX have seen stablecoin net inflows of $2.2 billion and $800 million, respectively. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin has failed another attempt at recovery as its price has slumped back down to the $110,700 mark.",Stablecoin|binance|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Stablecoin Exchange Reserve|Stablecoin Liquidity|Stablecoins|Stables,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 06:00:02

Avalanche (AVAX) has been stuck in sideways trading, while Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to gain traction but remains in consolidation. Both projects attract attention, yet neither is offering the blend of community growth, security, and visibility now seen in BlockDAG (BDAG) . BlockDAG presale has now almost hit $400M, sold more than 26 billion coins, and seen over $7.8 million in miner sales with 19,600 miners purchased. Its 25% referral bonus is drawing new participants daily. Alongside independent audits, this approach is shaping BlockDAG as the top crypto to buy right now, while AVAX and HYPE struggle with market clarity. Hyperliquid’s Record Trading Volume but Lingering Uncertainty Hyperliquid has made waves in decentralized trading by setting a daily record of $29 billion in volume. Over the past year, it has processed more than $1.57 trillion in trades. In Q2 2025 alone, revenue crossed $300 million, confirming strong growth. July’s monthly volume reached $319 billion, up 47% from the prior month. Daily fees of $7.7 million continue to support regular buybacks of HYPE, strengthening the system. Whale activity has been part of this rise too, with one major order involving $21 million USDC on a long position at $45. As a result, HYPE’s market value has grown past $10 billion. Institutional confidence is also visible. HYLQ Strategy Corp. holds 30,000 HYPE as part of its reserves. Analysts are now discussing mid-term price targets ranging from $75 to $100, though market caution remains. Avalanche’s Technical Hesitation Limits Momentum Avalanche is currently priced near $23 and continues to move within a tight range. It has been trading between $16 support and $26 resistance for months. Each attempt to push past $26 has failed, leaving AVAX unable to build steady momentum. Short-term charts also show doji candles, reflecting trader indecision. Technically, AVAX sits above its 21-day SMA, a line acting as short-term support. If selling pressure pushes below $21, the next stops could be $20 or even $16. On the other side, holding support and clearing $26 could spark a move toward $36. This stalled chart has left many cautious. Despite a strong development base, Avalanche lacks near-term excitement, especially when compared with projects like BlockDAG that are showing measurable traction. BlockDAG’s Referral Bonus, Major Deployment Event & Security Edge While AVAX shows hesitation and HYPE consolidates, BlockDAG is building strength through measurable adoption, clear incentives, and security focus. The 25% referral bonus is one of its strongest features. It rewards both referrers and new buyers, creating a system where growth is organic and transparent. Unlike short-term campaigns often seen in the market, this setup is built for lasting impact. Moreover, BlockDAG is ready to host a major Deployment Event in Singapore. After withdrawing from Token2049 due to local restrictions on presale promotions, the team opted to launch its own flagship event. Additionally, despite being priced at $0.03 in Batch 30 of its presale, BlockDAG has introduced a new special price of $0.0013 per BDAG until October 1. This rate will remain in effect for the final 30 days leading up to deployment. Security has been treated as a top priority. Independent audits by CertiK and Halborn confirmed the network’s protection measures. Multi-signature systems and parallel Proof-of-Work have been implemented to prevent risks. These safeguards aim to reassure participants in a market often shaken by breaches. Alongside these efforts, BlockDAG’s presale has now raised almost $400M, sold 26 billion coins, and logged $7.8 million in miner sales with more than 19,600 units sold. Early backers from Batch 1, priced at $0.001, have already seen 2,900% ROI. These combined elements show why BlockDAG is gaining ground as the top crypto to buy right now. Key Takeaway Avalanche remains locked in a sideways pattern, with resistance at $26 holding back any breakout. Hyperliquid has posted record trading volume and growing revenue, yet it still faces uncertainty as consolidation continues. BlockDAG, however, is progressing with a clear plan. It has sold more than 26 billion coins, nearly raised $400 million in presale, and sold 19,600 miners with revenue over $7.8 million. Its 25% referral bonus continues to expand its community, while the upcoming deployment event creates massive hype. Independent audits and built-in security measures add another layer of trust. This three-part foundation of incentives, global visibility, and protection places BlockDAG ahead of both AVAX and HYPE. In the race for the top crypto to buy right now, BlockDAG is proving itself as the leader.

At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.216, up 0.34% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Safe Haven Split: Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Turns Negative For First Time In 6 Months Analysts highlight the emergence of a bullish cup-and-handle pattern with an initial target of $0.30, but the long-term projections are even more ambitious, pointing toward a potential 850% rally to $2 if momentum accelerates. A recent whale transfer of 900 million DOGE ($200 million) to Binance temporarily triggered selling pressure, but strong buying support quickly stabilized prices. This recovery is seen by many traders as a sign of institutional and retail. Technical Patterns Hint at Breakout Potential Dogecoin’s technical indicators paint a mixed but promising picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 47, suggesting neutral momentum and leaving room for an upward push. While DOGE trades below short-term moving averages (7, 20, and 50-day), it remains above its 200-day SMA at $0.20, a sign of long-term structural strength. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) still shows mild bearish momentum, but signals of stabilization around $0.21 hint at a potential reversal. Meanwhile, Bollinger Bands indicate DOGE is trading near the lower range, with room to test $0.24 resistance. A confirmed breakout above $0.24 could unlock the path toward $0.30 and, eventually, higher levels if market sentiment improves. DOGE's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Analysts Eye $2 Dogecoin “Super Rally” September could prove decisive for DOGE. Crypto strategists believe the defense of $0.21 support may be the catalyst for a parabolic rally. If bullish momentum sustains, the cup-and-handle breakout pattern could evolve into a multi-stage rally, with $0.30 as the short-term target and $2 as the ultimate bull case scenario. Beyond technicals, regulatory optimism is adding fuel. With the U.S. SEC nearing decisions on crypto ETF approvals, including a potential Dogecoin ETF, analysts see institutional inflows as a major accelerant for future price action.

In its X post , Grayscale marked the first anniversary of the XRP Trust, an investment vehicle that enables accredited investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly purchasing the token.The post highlighted XRP’s strengths, noting that it is the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which is known for its speed and low-cost payments. XRP History on Grayscale For context, Grayscale first introduced the XRP Trust in March 2018, offering accredited investors structured exposure to XRP through a private placement. However, the asset manager dissolved the Trust in January 2021 due to the challenging market conditions stemming from the Ripple case. Following the release of the final judgment, which gave Ripple a partial victory over the SEC, Grayscale relaunched its XRP Trust in September 2024. Strong Performance as NAV Soars Over 400% It has been one year since the company relaunched the investment vehicle. Notably, the Grayscale XRP Trust has recorded an impressive performance since its relaunch a year ago. In just one year, the Trust’s net asset value (NAV) per share has surged from its initial $10.85 to the current rate of $55.79, marking a 414% increase. As of September 5, the NAV had spiked 2.50% compared to the previous day’s value. Data from Grayscale shows that the company has issued approximately 301,500 shares to investors in the Trust, with each share representing roughly 19.5 XRP. At press time, the Trust had an AUM of $16.82 million. Grayscale XRP Trust performance Grayscale XRP Trust performance Spot ETF Move Despite the remarkable performance of the XRP Trust, Grayscale is pushing to convert the product into a spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). In January, it filed an S-1 document with the SEC to facilitate this conversion. This comes several months after Grayscale successfully converted its Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts into spot ETFs. Now, the company is attempting to do the same for XRP, with shares of the ETF expected to launch on the Nasdaq once approved. However, the SEC has delayed its decision on its potential approval. Recently, Grayscale updated its application to allow authorized participants to redeem and create the ETF shares in XRP, cash, or in-kind. In the meantime, the SEC has a final deadline of October 2025 to decide whether to approve or disapprove Grayscale’s request to convert the XRP Trust into a spot ETF.",Market|Grayscale Crypto News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-09-06 06:06:57

According to Wedson, while BTC prices remain high, miners' earnings are still well below the peaks in 2017 and 2021. Wedson argued that miners have had to invest more in modern equipment due to the rising hash rate, while on-chain transaction volumes have remained low since 2022. He stated that this situation has created additional pressure on the sector. The analyst announced the development of a new indicator called the Mining Equilibrium Index (MEI) to measure mining profitability. The MEI is calculated by comparing the 30-day average revenue/hash ratio with the 365-day average: Above 1.0: above average conditions Below 0.5: associated with stressful conditions, capitulation, or hash rate adjustments. Related News: BREAKING: The Platform Previously Targeted by Germany Is Allegedly Still Holding Over $5 Billion in Bitcoin According to updated data shared by Wedson, the index currently stands at 1.06. While this level is well above the critical 0.5, it's still far from the 2.5 peaks seen in 2017 and 2021. Wedson said the key question for 2025 is whether mining companies can continue to secure the Bitcoin network despite increased competition and operational costs (including employee expenses, electricity, and infrastructure). According to the analyst, miners may be forced to sell some of their reserves if profitability doesn't cover expenses. *This is not investment advice.

One of the most insightful metrics for gauging immediate sentiment is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio . This crucial indicator reveals whether traders are predominantly betting on Bitcoin’s price to rise (long) or fall (short) on major exchanges. Unpacking the Current BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio offers a snapshot of trader positioning, reflecting the collective bullish or bearish bias. When the long percentage is higher, it suggests optimism; conversely, a higher short percentage points to a more cautious or pessimistic outlook. This ratio is derived from the aggregated data across various trading platforms. Currently, the overall 24-hour long/short position ratios for BTC perpetual futures on the world’s top three crypto futures exchanges by open interest present a nuanced picture: Overall: Long 49.72% / Short 50.28% This slight lean towards short positions globally indicates a marginally bearish sentiment among derivatives traders at present. It suggests that, on average, more participants are anticipating a potential downturn or consolidation for Bitcoin. A Closer Look at Top Exchange Data for BTC Perpetual Futures While the overall ratio provides a general sense, examining individual exchange data offers deeper insights into the specific trading behaviors on each platform. Differences can arise due to varying user bases, regional preferences, or even platform-specific events. Here’s how the top exchanges stack up for the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio : Binance: Long 49.23% / Short 50.77% Bybit: Long 50.53% / Short 49.47% Gate.io: Long 48.6% / Short 51.4% Noticeable variations exist. Binance and Gate.io show a stronger bearish bias, with short positions outweighing long positions. Interestingly, Bybit stands out with a slightly bullish tilt, where long positions are marginally dominant. These differences highlight the importance of not just looking at aggregated data, but also understanding the dynamics of specific trading environments. Why Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Matter to Traders? For savvy traders, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio isn’t just a number; it’s a vital tool for market analysis. It can act as a sentiment indicator, helping you understand the prevailing mood among professional and retail derivatives traders. When the market is heavily skewed in one direction, it can sometimes signal a potential reversal. However, it’s crucial to remember that this ratio is just one piece of the puzzle. Overly bullish or bearish sentiment can sometimes lead to crowded trades, making the market vulnerable to sudden liquidations or short squeezes. Therefore, traders often combine this ratio with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for a more comprehensive view. Navigating Market Sentiment with BTC Perpetual Futures Data How can you effectively use this data? Consider the current scenario: an overall slight lean towards shorts. This might suggest caution, but also potential opportunities. If the market continues to drop, short positions could profit. Conversely, if Bitcoin shows unexpected strength, a ‘short squeeze’ could occur, forcing short sellers to buy back, which in turn fuels price increases. Monitoring the changes in the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio over time is equally important. A sudden shift from heavily long to heavily short, or vice versa, often precedes significant price movements. This actionable insight empowers traders to anticipate potential shifts and adjust their strategies accordingly, leading to more informed decisions. The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio serves as a powerful barometer for market sentiment, offering valuable insights into the collective positioning of derivatives traders. While the current data points to a slightly bearish lean overall, individual exchange dynamics present a more detailed picture. By integrating this metric with other analytical tools, traders can gain a significant edge in navigating the often-unpredictable cryptocurrency markets. Stay informed and make data-driven decisions to enhance your trading strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio indicate? The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio indicates the proportion of long (buy) positions versus short (sell) positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts. A ratio above 1 suggests more longs, indicating bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 suggests more shorts, indicating bearish sentiment. Why is the long/short ratio different across exchanges? Differences arise because each exchange has its own user base, liquidity pools, and regional trading preferences. While they often follow similar trends, their specific ratios can vary due to unique trading activity on their platforms. Can the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio predict price movements? While it’s a strong sentiment indicator, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is not a standalone predictor of price movements. Extreme ratios can sometimes signal potential reversals, but it’s best used in conjunction with other technical analysis, on-chain data, and fundamental factors. What are perpetual futures contracts? Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they use a funding rate mechanism to keep the contract price close to the spot price of the underlying asset. How often is this long/short ratio data updated? This data is typically updated frequently, often every few hours or even in real-time by data providers, to reflect the constantly changing market sentiment and trader positions.

Here’s Why October 2025 is the Date,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-15-20-heres-why-october-2025-is-the-date/,"Diana (@InvestWithD), a crypto enthusiast and XRP advocate, recently shared an analysis suggesting that mid-October 2025 could be a defining moment for XRP. Diana’s argument is based on historical cycles, Bitcoin’s halving timelines, and the removal of regulatory restrictions that previously limited XRP’s performance. The Bitcoin Halving Blueprint Diana began her analysis by recalling the 2017 cycle. She explained that Bitcoin’s halving took place on July 9, 2016, with its peak occurring on December 18, 2017, exactly 527 days later. XRP’s cycle top followed just 18 days afterward on January 5, 2018. According to her, “Bitcoin runs first. XRP detonates right after.” The next halving in May 2020 appeared to continue the cycle when Bitcoin peaked on November 10, 2021, 548 days later. However, Diana pointed out that XRP did not follow its usual trajectory, but topped out in April 2021 due to pressure from the SEC lawsuit . Diana argues that the upcoming cycle is fundamentally different. With the SEC lawsuit now over and Ripple pushing forward with new initiatives such as ETFs, RLUSD, and the Thunes partnership , she claims that “the shackles are gone,” and XRP is once again positioned to follow the original timing model. XRP TO $15–$20? HISTORY SAYS OCT 2025 IS THE DATE History, math, and the end of SEC suppression all point to one window: mid-October 2025. This could be XRP’s most savage run yet — let’s break it down. pic.twitter.com/RJ6Z85b6pz — Diana (@InvestWithD) September 4, 2025 The Cycle Math and Potential Targets Using the same calculation that aligned with the 2017 peak, Diana projected the next cycle. She noted that 2024’s Bitcoin halving sets up for a Bitcoin top on September 29, 2025, exactly 527 days later. If the 2017 pattern repeats, XRP would peak 18 days later on October 17, 2025. According to Diana, a conservative outlook would see XRP in the $5 to $7 range. Her base case places XRP between $10 and $15, driven by ETF inflows and growing utility narratives. She also left room for a more aggressive possibility, suggesting XRP could pass $20 if institutional liquidity surges. Why This Time Is Different Diana stressed that the 2025 cycle cannot be compared to 2017. At that time, XRP’s surge came mainly from retail speculation. In her view, the coming cycle has stronger foundations, with SEC clarity, stablecoin projects such as RLUSD, ETF applications, and Ripple’s broader global partnerships . She summarized this as “infrastructure” rather than speculation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 She emphasized that if past patterns repeat, Bitcoin could top in late September 2025, with XRP following in mid-October. She advised caution, noting that profit-taking between October and November may be critical, warning, “Miss the exit window, and you’re food for whales.” Diana closed by highlighting XRP’s seven-year wait. She argued that October 2025 could bring “one explosive setup,” potentially pushing the asset beyond its all-time high. Her base outlook remains $10 to $15.

In a recent and significant development, Kwon has lost a crucial bid to recover a substantial 19.6 billion won (approximately $14.2 million) deposit for a luxurious Do Kwon penthouse in Singapore. This setback comes after the nation’s High Court dismissed his claim, as reported by the local media outlet Singapore Law Watch. What’s the Story Behind the Do Kwon Penthouse Deposit? Before the dramatic collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in May 2022, Do Kwon had committed to purchasing a high-end penthouse. He had already paid roughly half the purchase price, amounting to a hefty 39.2 billion won. However, following the unprecedented market crash that wiped out billions, the property developer took action. They confiscated the significant payment Kwon had made. Consequently, Kwon, through his wife, initiated a lawsuit to reclaim these funds. This legal move aimed to recover the substantial deposit for the Do Kwon penthouse , which had become entangled in the fallout of the Terra-Luna debacle. Why is This Legal Setback Crucial for Do Kwon? This dismissal by the Singapore High Court adds another layer of complexity to Do Kwon’s already extensive legal challenges. It represents a tangible financial loss in the midst of a broader fight for his freedom and reputation. U.S. Indictment: Kwon was indicted in the U.S. in 2023 on nine charges. These charges are directly related to the collapse of his cryptocurrency empire. Investor Losses: The Terra-Luna collapse is estimated to have caused around $40 billion in investor losses globally. This figure underscores the immense scale of the financial devastation. Upcoming Trial: His trial in the U.S. is scheduled to begin on December 11. Every legal outcome, including the ruling on the Do Kwon penthouse deposit, could potentially influence the perception and trajectory of his upcoming court proceedings. Therefore, losing this bid to recover the substantial deposit is not just a financial blow. It also serves as a stark reminder of the legal and financial pressures mounting against the embattled crypto founder. What Are the Broader Implications of the Do Kwon Penthouse Ruling? The Singapore High Court’s decision regarding the Do Kwon penthouse deposit carries implications beyond just this specific case. It highlights the increasing scrutiny and legal accountability faced by figures in the cryptocurrency space. Legal systems worldwide are grappling with how to address the fallout from major crypto events. This ruling suggests that even personal assets and transactions can become subject to intense legal examination, especially when linked to large-scale financial collapses. Moreover, it underscores the challenges individuals face in recovering funds or assets once they become entangled in complex legal and financial disputes across international borders. The outcome could serve as a precedent or at least a point of reference for similar cases involving high-profile crypto figures. The Continuing Saga of Do Kwon’s Legal Battles The dismissal of Do Kwon’s claim to recover his $14.2 million Singapore penthouse deposit marks a significant moment in his ongoing legal saga. It reinforces the difficult position he finds himself in, both financially and legally, as he prepares for his impending trial in the U.S. This ruling is a clear indicator that legal systems are actively working to address the consequences of the 2022 crypto market downturn. For Do Kwon, it’s another challenging chapter in a story that continues to unfold with significant implications for the wider cryptocurrency world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was the total value of the Do Kwon penthouse he was trying to purchase? A1: The total purchase price for the penthouse was 39.2 billion won, which is approximately $28.4 million. Q2: Why did the property developer confiscate Do Kwon’s deposit? A2: The article indicates the developer confiscated the payment after the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in 2022, likely due to a breach of contract or an inability to complete the purchase under the original terms. Q3: Is Do Kwon currently facing other legal charges? A3: Yes, Do Kwon was indicted in the U.S. in 2023 on nine charges related to the Terra-Luna collapse. His trial is scheduled for December 11. Q4: What is the estimated amount of investor losses attributed to the Terra-Luna collapse? A4: The collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem is estimated to have caused around $40 billion in investor losses. Q5: Who filed the lawsuit to reclaim the penthouse deposit? A5: Do Kwon filed the lawsuit through his wife to reclaim the funds for the Do Kwon penthouse deposit. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

However, recent exchange data suggest that a supply crunch may be nearing for ETH. Ethereum Price Stable Amid Exchange Supply Decline According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, during the period between August 16 to September 3, Ethereum’s Binance Exchange Supply Ratio (ESR) saw a sharp decline. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Latest Rally Fueled By Large-Scale Binance Orders, Analyst Says Although ETH’s price has remained in the mid $4,000 range, its ESR tumbled from 0.041 to 0.037 – marking the biggest decline within the observed period – in a matter of just two weeks. It’s worth highlighting that ETH’s price has remained stable all this time, trading close to $4,400 at the end of the period. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, such price behavior can explain two things. First, it signals that investors are withdrawing from exchanges – including Binance – at an accelerated pace. Further, it also shows growing confidence among ETH holders as they opt for self-custody in cold wallets instead of keeping their holdings on exchanges. Arab Chain remarked that a combination of stable price, declining exchange supply, and healthy exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows confirms that sellable supply is dwindling while the demand for the digital asset remains strong. They added: Declines in ESR have historically preceded strong upward moves, as lower exchange liquidity limits sellers’ ability to push prices down. The current ESR levels have fallen back to pre-June figures, suggesting that the market has effectively “flushed out” previous profit-taking activity and is now reaccumulating supply into long-term wallets. ETH Entering A New Bull Cycle? The analyst concluded by saying that if ETH’s ESR continues to fall without a corresponding decline in price, then it would mean that the market is entering a new, institutional investor-led bull cycle. Three metrics in particular support this prediction. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Contract Boom In 2025, Setting Stage For $5,000 Rally The ETH market has seen a recent drop in leverage, meaning there are fewer traders with speculative positioning. Further, most perpetual futures markets show neutral funding rates for ETH contracts. Finally, the on-chain activity by ETH whales has also subsided, meaning long-term holders are not selling. Also worth noting is that the Ethereum blockchain’s fundamentals continue to improve. Latest data shows that as much as 36 million ETH has been staked on the ETH network, further raising the possibility of an ensuing supply shock. Recently, Ethereum daily transactions also hit a 12-month high. Amid these bullish developments, seasoned industry experts are not shying away from giving ambitious ETH price predictions. At press time, ETH trades at $4,295, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-trillion-dollars-is-coming-to-xrp-heres-how/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld recently shared a video in which he examined the Securities and Exchange Commission’s latest initiative on cryptocurrency regulation. According to the Financial expert, the SEC has unveiled a new rulemaking plan designed to reform the way digital assets are regulated in the United States. He emphasized that this development is “insanely massive,” noting that the regulatory update could create new opportunities for institutional involvement in the sector. Rietveld explained that the rulemaking would pave the way for Wall Street to participate in activities such as initial coin offerings, initial decentralized offerings, and large-scale pre-sales of digital tokens. He argued that this regulatory clarity would allow traditional financial institutions to raise capital for their own blockchain-based projects through crypto mechanisms. TRILLIONS COMING IN #XRP ?! pic.twitter.com/xjwjf3U4Tr — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 5, 2025 Integration with Major Blockchains In the video, Rietveld highlighted how these institutional projects will be hosted on existing blockchain infrastructures. He noted that while Ethereum could serve as the initial platform for many token launches, over time, these assets, particularly stablecoins, would extend to other networks. Specifically, he mentioned the XRP Ledger, Solana, and the Binance Smart Chain as ecosystems likely to support the cross-chain expansion of such projects. He pointed to the cross-chain capabilities as a decisive factor that could attract significant inflows into these networks. According to Rietveld, the magnitude of institutional participation enabled by the SEC’s rulemaking could result in “trillions of dollars” flowing into the crypto sector, with XRP positioned as a key network to benefit from this development. Community Reaction and Market Performance While Rietveld expressed strong optimism about the implications of the SEC’s regulatory framework, not all observers shared his outlook. An X user posting under the handle Mars0634 responded to Rietveld’s video by pointing to XRP’s recent price performance, remarking, “Meanwhile in the real world XRP dumping AGAIN.” Market data reflects this skepticism. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $2.81. The asset has declined 5.81% over the past 30 days and has also registered a 1.08% decrease over the past seven days. These figures highlight that despite the broader regulatory developments being discussed, XRP has yet to demonstrate a price reaction that aligns with Rietveld’s projection of major inflows. The new SEC initiative has the potential to reshape the regulatory environment for digital assets and open the door for more active participation from Wall Street in blockchain ventures. If implemented effectively, the changes could expand the role of major blockchain networks, including the XRP Ledger, in supporting tokenized assets and stablecoins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, XRP’s current market performance illustrates the gap between regulatory announcements and immediate price action. While Rietveld projects that the scale of institutional entry could eventually bring trillions into the ecosystem, the asset’s near-term trajectory remains subdued. Whether XRP will capitalize on the anticipated regulatory shift will depend on how quickly institutions move to adopt the frameworks the SEC is putting forward.

Led by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an up-and-coming decentralized lending protocol that is causing some splash with its innovative dual lending strategy the market is gearing up for a run. Today, Stage 6 of the MUTM presale is taking place and costs $0.035. Solana (SOL) still portrays a healthy network usage, and the emergence of new participants but MUTM is attracting attention owing to its ability to transform the crypto-backed lending markets. Solana (SOL) Holds over $200 Above Institutional interests Solana (SOL) is strong after breaking above $200 on growing investor adoption. Recent collaborations and staking action have solidified its ecosystem and future spot ETF applications can further increase its visibility should they be approved later this year. Analysts believe that sustaining momentum in the above trading range may be the gateway to a trend toward the $250 to $300 price levels. However, short-term declines are possible as traders take profits. Meanwhile, investor interest is slowly moving to other upcoming decentralized finance initiatives like Mutuum Finance. Stage 6 Presale Live supported by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is already a part of the DeFi community and has more than 16,100 investors and more than $15.45 million in presale. The project is also operating a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to improve security on the platform and to further encourage community engagement, which has rewards allocated to four risk tiers, such as critical, major, minor, and low. Interest Rate Models When money is abundant, rates are kept low in MUTM; when money is scarce the rates are raised, attempting to make borrowing costly; or, in other words, to push those who had borrowed to make payments. This works well in maintaining a strong protocol while best-serving users. Mutuum Finance Enriches Security Mutuum Finance is applying strict parameters to each asset it supports to make sure it has a high risk profile, including supply, borrowing limits and even collateral limits. The protocol can more readily withstand market volatility via overcollateralization of positions and stabilize undercollateralized positions via incentivized liquidators. The deposits and borrowing restrictions will restrain exposure to illiquid or risky assets and, therefore, restrain insolvency risks. Correlated assets can have greater collateral efficiency and high-risk tokens are limited in the collateral available to them. Mutuum Finance Makes a Giveaway Gamified As part of a $100,000 giveaway , ten lucky investors will be walking away with $10,000. This makes the existing investors, as well as new investors more enthusiastic about the platform. Among the most interesting altcoins as Wall Street continues to increase its exposure to crypto is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is competing on an equal footing with Solana (SOL) due to its novel model of decentralized lending. Stages 6 tokens are pre-sale priced at $0.035, and have raised over $15.45 million and 16,100+ investors in board, both good news. The price of SOL will not fall below $200, and may increase to $250-$300 should institutional momentum persist, but MUTM has a more aggressive growth curve with its two lending protocols, $50,000 bug bounty, and $100,000 giveaway to increase community participation. The project is designed to be scaled and secure with risk controls like overcollateralization and dynamic interest rates. Enter Stage 6 in advance to be guaranteed entry before the following price increase.

51275067,575302,1757143807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51275067.jpeg,Analyst Says All Bitcoin Price Uptrend Are Duds Unless This Happens,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-uptrend-are-duds/,"With the Bitcoin price hitting roadblock after roadblock , the next direction looks to be down, with sell pressure mounting up. There have also been crashes below major support levels, such as $112,000, that continue to hinder the growth of the digital asset. This has turned these former support levels into resistance, and one in particular remains a hindrance to the uptrend. If the resistance at $114,000 continues to hold, then Bitcoin investors may be in for a terrible time. Bitcoin Price Remains At Risk Of Crash According to crypto analyst BitBull, the recent rejection of the Bitcoin price from the resistance before $114,000 is a major source of concern. This has cast a shadow over every recovery that the Bitcoin price has staged recently, with the bears still holding a significant amount of power over the price. In the analysis , BitBull pointed out that the $114,000 level remains the level to beat if there is to be a significant recovery. Specifically, the Bitcoin price would have to reclaim this level on the daily timeframe and hold it before further uptrends can occur. Another problem that the cryptocurrency is facing is the timeframe issue. The crypto analyst also points out that the Bitcoin price would need to reclaim $114,000 to increase its chances of an uptrend. This is because the longer it takes for the price to cross $114,000 on the daily timeframe, the higher the chances that the price will crash further . Until this happens, though, BitBull says any recovery is just a bull trap and could precede the next wave of declines. Where BTC Could Be Headed From Here Another crypto analyst, Mags, has also called out the possibility that the Bitcoin price could see a crash from here. This time around, the level of interest is much lower than the $114,000 that BitBull called out, with Mags explaining that $108,000 is actually the point of interest. This level has served as major support during the recent crash, making it the level to beat for bears if they want to take the Bitcoin price lower. Inversely, it is now the level for bulls to defend against further onslaught, and the demand at this level needs to hold to continue the rally. If bulls are successful and they have $108,000, then the crypto analyst sees the Bitcoin price going higher, and possibly toward new all-time highs. However, in the case of a breakdown and bears taking over the support at $108,000, then the Bitcoin price is expected to crash below $100,000 .",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 07:30:07

The post was accompanied by four attached documents and diagrams described as evidence to support the statement. SMQKE emphasized the scale of this access by referencing RippleNet’s current network of around 200 connected institutions compared to SWIFT’s much larger footprint. RIPPLE INTEGRATION WITH FINASTRA OPENS ACCESS TO 11,000 SWIFT-CONNECTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Documented 4x. https://t.co/ZiU0osD4h5 pic.twitter.com/rjbCGgWl9d — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 5, 2025 Why This Is Significant to Ripple The attached documents contained details about Finastra’s service bureau and its connectivity model. One section quoted Marcus Treacher, former Senior Vice President of Customer Success at Ripple, who described Finastra as an established fintech player working with a majority of the world’s top banks. Treacher stated that the partnership would expand Ripple’s reach and solutions for its partners while also broadening the footprint of RippleNet . He highlighted that the collaboration would enable institutions to transact directly with each other. Another excerpt included in the documentation highlighted the numerical gap between RippleNet and SWIFT . RippleNet was noted to have 200 connected institutions, a figure described as small when compared to the 11,000 institutions connected through SWIFT. The attached note suggested that this deal could benefit both Finastra’s and Ripple’s existing clients by creating a pathway for interoperability. Finastra’s own perspective was also reflected in the material. Ritesh Singh, SVP of FMS at Finastra, was quoted as saying that working with Ripple would allow the company to offer fast and reliable cross-border payments using blockchain technology. He added that this would be particularly useful in regions where the cost of correspondent banking remains high. Diagrams and Connectivity Models The four images included in SMQKE’s post provided diagrams illustrating how Finastra’s systems connect to different payment networks. One diagram showed Finastra’s service bureau linking banks to both Ripple and SWIFT, with a flow of services such as payment processing, sanctions screening, and cash visibility. Another depicted a structure where customer banks’ back-office systems connect through Finastra to both Ripple’s xCurrent cloud and SWIFT messaging. Further diagrams demonstrated correspondent banking flows, showing Ripple and SWIFT as parallel channels accessible through Finastra’s connectivity. The simplified schematic presented by SMQKE indicated a model where a bank’s core system connects via Finastra’s Zurich-based service bureau to both Ripple and SWIFT infrastructures. Interpretation of the Post SMQKE claims that the integration creates a significant extension of Ripple’s potential reach by connecting indirectly to the 11,000 financial institutions that use SWIFT through Finastra. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The post underscores the scale difference between RippleNet’s existing network and SWIFT’s larger system and presents Finastra as a bridge that could allow Ripple to gain broader connectivity. The documentation suggests that Ripple’s blockchain technology could complement Finastra’s existing infrastructure to provide additional efficiency for financial institutions already using SWIFT.

This movement may represent the final phase of the current cycle for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Market analyst CryptoBirb has indicated that this uptrend could last for approximately 50 more days, emphasizing that Bitcoin is now 95% through its cycle, which has spanned 1,017 days since the lows of November 2022. 50 Days Until Possible Bitcoin Peak Historically, Bitcoin’s bull markets have peaked between 1,060 and 1,100 days after significant lows, suggesting a target timeframe for this cycle’s peak could fall between late October and mid-November 2025. The analysis highlights the typical relationship between Bitcoin’s Halving events and subsequent price peaks. Since the last Halving in April 2024, 503 days have passed, with past data showing that price peaks usually occur 518 to 580 days following such events. Related Reading: First US Dogecoin ETF Could Debut Next Week—How Will It Impact Price? As seen in the chart below, Bitcoin is currently 77% to 86% of the way through this timeline, entering what the analyst refers to as the “hot zone”—a period of heightened volatility and potential price movements. However, CryptoBirb cautions that historical trends indicate that after reaching a peak, Bitcoin typically experiences a significant decline, often dropping by 70% to 80% over a 370 to 410-day timeframe. This bearish phase is projected for approximately the first and second quarter of 2026, with a historical probability of a bear market in that year reaching 100%. Before this potential downturn, the analyst expects a final surge, with about 50 days remaining before the market may peak. September, often recognized as a weaker month for Bitcoin, has shown an average decline of 6.17%. Although third quarter statistics can be mixed, with a median increase of 0.80%, the overall average tends to reflect a decline due to larger losses. The typical seasonal pattern suggests that a poor September could be followed by stronger performance in October and November, with September 17 identified as a crucial date to watch by the analyst. Critical Support And Resistance Levels On the technical front, Key support levels are identified at the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) of $95,900 and the 200-week SMA at $52,300. The daily chart reveals further technical insights, including a 200-day breakout point at $111,000 and a 200-day SMA at $101,000. CryptoBirb has identified local support between $107,700 and $108,700, while resistance sits at $113,000 to $114,100. Related Reading: XRP Price Could See 20% Bounce To $3.4 If This Trendline Holds Looking ahead, both short-term and long-term trading trailers are currently in a bearish mode. CryptoBirb asserts that if Bitcoin falls below the critical levels of $107,000 to $108,000, bearish sentiment could intensify, potentially leading to secondary corrections in the range of 20% to 30%. Fortunately, cryptocurrency miners appear to be faring well, with the mining cost established at $95,400, suggesting a healthy market environment with minimal capitulation risk. Lastly, the analyst cautions against the potential for a market peak leading into the altcoin season in October and November. CryptoBirb suggests to mark calendars for October 22, as it could be a pivotal date in Bitcoin’s cycle. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $112,886, down nearly 11% from all-time high levels.

Backed by a $200 million commitment from regional partners and investors, the fund aims to acquire $1 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next six months. BTC Treasury Fund Unlike existing individual treasury firms in Asia, such as Japan’s Metaplanet, Hong Kong’s Moon Inc., Thailand’s DV8, and South Korea’s BitPlanet, which hold Bitcoin directly on their own balance sheets, the Sora Ventures fund will serve as a centralized pool of institutional capital. The main objective of the company is to support these existing firms while also encouraging the development of new BTC treasuries worldwide. In its official press release, Sora Ventures also said that the fund will focus on creating “synergies between regional and international treasuries” to strengthen BTC’s role as a reserve asset across markets. Sora Ventures’ management team has been tasked with guiding the fund and bringing in new institutional investors and collaborators to strengthen Asia’s Bitcoin treasury network. The initiative will help connect existing and emerging treasury firms, increase available capital, and foster a more integrated ecosystem for corporate BTC holdings across the region. Asia in Bitcoin Big League While the largest Bitcoin treasuries and corporate adoption have historically been US-centric, Asia is now stepping up as a major player in institutional Bitcoin markets. On that aspect, Sora Ventures founder and Managing Partner Jason Fang commented, “Asia has been one of the most important markets for the development of blockchain technology and Bitcoin. We have seen a rise in interest from institutions investing in Bitcoin treasuries in the U.S. and EU, while in Asia, efforts have been relatively fragmented. This is the first time in history that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage.” Metaplanet continues to lead as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, as it recently added 1,009 BTC to reach a total of 20,000 BTC. Meanwhile, another Asian player, Taiwan-listed WiseLink, became the first company in the country to adopt a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy.

His words have sparked interest in crypto forecasts, making Ethereum (ETH) a long-term cornerstone of the market. But behind the scenes, whales are turning their attention to an entity they think may have a bigger short-term upside: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This DeFi system is still only $0.035 in its ongoing presale, but many are talking about it as the next big cryptocurrency in private circles. This isn’t because of hype, but because its economic design directly links token demand to genuine revenue streams. Joe Lubin predicts 100x Ether amid Wall Street adoption Joseph Lubin, one of the founders of Ethereum (ETH), predicted that Ether (ETH) would rise 100X by August 31, 2025, making it the world’s main currency, surpassing Bitcoin. The price of ETH is about $4,400, and the trading volume in the last 24 hours was $37.07 billion. Lubin is optimistic about the future of Ethereum (ETH) because he thinks that Wall Street will adopt its decentralised architecture, with financial institutions staking ETH, running validators, and connecting DeFi and layer-2 networks. Technical indications reveal that ETH is testing support at $4,150, with resistance at $4,500 and an RSI of 48. Institutional inflows, such as $341 million in ETF investments and a $160 billion stablecoin supply, make people feel good. Social media reflects excitement over Ethereum (ETH)’s programmability. If $4,868 clears, analysts think the price will reach $5,200, although there are concerns from macroeconomic factors like US tariffs. If it drops below $4,150, it might test $3,950. Why whales look beyond Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has been seen as the best platform for decentralised apps for a long time, and many investors will keep ETH as a long-term bet. But whales know that timing is key. Ethereum (ETH) is growing at the rate it is now because institutions are slowly starting to use it. This means that the price may not go up for years. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to debut with a live beta platform, Layer-2 scaling, and lending features that will start bringing in funding transactions right away. The choice is becoming clear for whales who want to make money quickly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Layer-2 infrastructure will be faster and cost less than typical Layer-1 chains. That means that both regular traders and institutions will have an easier time borrowing and lending. The mechanics of the project are what really interest big investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will show off stable-rate borrowing, penalties for liquidation, and Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) when it launches. These features aren’t just extras; they’re ways to make money that will keep adding value to the protocol treasury, which will make people want to buy MUTM tokens more in the long run. This is why whales are buying into the presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now raised $15.4 million in Phase 6, with more than 16,000 holders taking part. One-third of the current allocation is gone at $0.035, and the following phase will raise the price by 15%. Anyone who bought in earlier is already seeing gains of more than 100%, while anyone who buys now is getting tokens before the price goes up even more. The CertiK audit also gave Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a Token Scan Score of 95.00, which adds to the project’s trustworthiness. It already has more than 12,000 Twitter followers. Treasury growth and 100x ambitions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a number of ways to bring value into its treasury. Every liquidation on the platform will send penalty fees directly into this pool, ensuring that even during market downturns, the system grows stronger. This makes the system stronger even when the market is down. That treasury will serve as both a safety net and a store of value over time, which will help future token demand. Another characteristic that will help with adoption is Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE). When borrowers use correlated assets like stablecoins, they can get larger loan-to-value ratios without putting the whole system at risk. This will make people borrow more money, which means more fees will be collected. More borrowers means more money for the treasury, which will make it stronger. This will create a feedback cycle that encourages rising token prices. Stable-rate borrowing is perhaps the best thing about it for businesses. Funds and corporate treasuries need things to be predictable, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s methodology will let them lock in payback costs with confidence. As more people borrow money, the interest income will grow the protocol treasury even more, which will make MUTM more valuable and in more demand.. Ethereum (ETH) still depends on things outside of its control, like ETF approvals or changes in regulations. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building its own engines that will increase the value of its tokens. Every loan, every sale, and every transaction will help it develop. Whales that are used to positioning themselves ahead of big rallies will find this structure to be a good reason to allocate a lot of money. Prices of cryptocurrencies will always go up and down, but whales pay less attention to short-term noise and more attention to long-term revenue models. This is why they are choosing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) over waiting for the next wave of Ethereum (ETH). The project’s protocol performance is directly linked to token demand, which gives investors access to a compounding mechanism instead of just market sentiment. The timing is really important for anyone who wants to invest in crypto right now. The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already 33% sold in this phase, and the price will go up in Phase 7, making it more expensive to get in. The $100,000 giveaway that is still going on is another reason for people to buy now. Whales are getting out of the way before the next phase starts because they know that when predicted exchange listings and stablecoin integration happen, the chance to buy MUTM at low prices will be gone. Ethereum (ETH) has a bright future, but this cycle’s best chance is elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a DeFi ecosystem where every activity by a user makes the treasury stronger and increases the demand for tokens. It is being marketed as the breakthrough project with 100x upside potential because it is scalable, has predictable borrowing, and is backed by the treasury. Whales are already buying, and it’s up to normal investors to determine if they will follow before the window shuts.

But traders are starting to talk about different things. Ethereum (ETH) is getting bigger and older, so the chances of it growing at the same rate as it did in the past are getting smaller. Prices of cryptocurrencies keep going up and down, and the crypto fear and greed index shows that the market is feeling a mix of emotions. Now, though, people are paying attention to a new presale project that is quickly gaining traction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $15.4 million during its ongoing presale. This shows that people are already interested in the project and believe in it before it officially launches. ETH slows, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) accelerates Ethereum (ETH) has been the driving force behind decentralized banking for years, but traders know that it is no longer in the early stages where gains happen swiftly. When you look at how ETH is doing now compared to how it was in the past, it’s easy to see why smaller-cap projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are getting so much attention. ETH’s value is already in the hundreds of billions, therefore, it needs a lot of new money to double. In contrast, MUTM is still in its presale phase 6, with only 33% of tokens sold so far. The price will go up by 15% to $0.04 after that. This is when early believers can get in before a project is fully developed. The $15 million amount also says a lot. In the past, ETH relied largely on institutional and venture finance to help it grow. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being constructed directly by the community through presale fundraising. This grassroots influx builds decentralization from the start, giving investors a strong basis with shared goals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a network effect on top of credit markets and stablecoin stability, just like ETH’s utility was the engine of its network effect. A stablecoin linked to $1 is at the centre of its model. Unlike other assets that can cause panic during a crypto meltdown, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will stabilise borrowing and lending through overcollateralization and rates that change according to governance. For example, if the stablecoin goes above $1, governance would cut borrowing rates to encourage borrowing and increase supply, which would bring the peg back in line. If it goes below, increased rates and chances to make money through arbitrage will fix the problem. Chainlink oracle data will make sure that price discovery happens, and there will be backup oracles to make sure that it stays reliable. This is similar to how Ethereum (ETH)’s DeFi protocols make sure that asset valuations are clear. Managing liquidity will also make the system stronger. Rates for borrowing will change depending on how much is used, which will keep everything running smoothly and in balance. When there is a lot of demand for borrowing, interest rates go up. This encourages new deposits and keeps liquidity from running out. When demand goes down, rates go down, which makes borrowing more appealing. This dynamic keeps capital moving throughout the platform and pays lenders interest rates that are in line with market realities. Roadmap and the ETH comparison The $15.36 million that came in during the presale isn’t just a short-term number; it’s a deep number that will help the plan move ahead. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has come up with a four-phase plan to grow its platform. Phase 1 has already been about presale and building the primary components. In Phase 2, the development of its core contracts and front-end apps will move forward. In Phase 3, the project will start beta testing on the testnet and get ready for outside security audits. Phase 4 will be the actual launch, with listings on exchanges and further integrations, which will keep up with rising demand. People who remember Ethereum (ETH) trading between $20 and $40 in its early days may recognize this path. The traders who got in at that period have seen their investments grow a lot. The tale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is similar. People who bought in at Phase 1 of the presale for $0.01 are already up 3.5X as the project moves through Phase 6. The listing price is expected to be $0.06, so Phase 6 buyers at $0.035 are still getting a good deal before the market becomes more popular. Conclusion Ethereum (ETH)’s growth rates are slowing down, but that doesn’t make it any less important. It does, however, give investors the chance to invest in projects that are still in their early stages and have a lot of potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $15.36 million, and its operation is based on lending using stablecoins, transparent oracles, and incentives for liquidity. Many people are already saying that it is one of the best prospects in the current market cycle. This is being called the “ETH-like moment” of today for traders who are looking beyond the short-term ups and downs of crypto prices. As the crypto market grows and investors seek certainty before 2026, the initiatives that combine usefulness with community-driven acceptance are the ones that are really taking off. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already proven that it belongs in this discourse. The fact that ETH’s growth has slowed down doesn’t mean that the era of exponential growth tales is over; it just means that the next chapter has begun.

For traders, understanding these movements, especially the potential for significant events like Bitcoin liquidation , is absolutely crucial. Recent analysis highlights a fascinating scenario: a recovery in Bitcoin’s price to $114,000 could unleash a staggering $2.52 billion in short position liquidations across major futures exchanges. This isn’t just a number; it’s a potential catalyst for intense market volatility, making it vital for every crypto enthusiast to pay attention. What is Bitcoin Liquidation and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Bitcoin liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin balance falls below the minimum required level to maintain the position, typically due to adverse price movements. Imagine you’ve borrowed funds to amplify your trading power; if the market moves against you significantly, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for both you and the platform. Margin Trading: Traders use borrowed funds (leverage) to open larger positions than their capital would normally allow. Risk Amplification: While leverage can magnify profits, it also dramatically increases potential losses. Automatic Closure: When a position reaches a certain loss threshold, the exchange automatically closes it to prevent the trader’s balance from going negative. This forced closure is the liquidation. Understanding liquidation events is key because they can create a domino effect, exacerbating price movements. Large-scale liquidations often fuel further price swings, leading to what’s known as a “short squeeze” or “long squeeze.” The $114K Bitcoin Liquidation Scenario: A Short Squeeze Spectacle The current market sentiment is highly sensitive to price triggers. Should Bitcoin’s value climb towards the $114,000 mark, we could witness a significant market event. Data suggests that approximately $2.52 billion (equivalent to 3.5 trillion Korean Won) in short positions would be liquidated at this level. A short position is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. When the price instead rises sharply, these short positions become unprofitable, and exchanges are forced to close them. This scenario is often referred to as a “short squeeze.” Here’s how it works: Traders who bet against Bitcoin (short sellers) face mounting losses as the price rises. To close their losing positions, these traders must buy Bitcoin back, which adds further buying pressure to the market. This additional buying pressure pushes the price even higher, triggering more liquidations, and creating a powerful upward momentum. Such a massive Bitcoin liquidation event could provide a strong bullish impulse, potentially propelling BTC’s price beyond the initial trigger point as the market absorbs these forced buy orders. What Happens if Bitcoin Drops? The Long Liquidation Threat Below $107K Conversely, the market presents risks in the other direction as well. While the potential for a short squeeze is exciting, a downside movement could be equally impactful. If Bitcoin’s price were to drop below $107,000, the market could see an estimated $5.1 billion (7.1 trillion Korean Won) in long positions liquidated. A long position is a bet that an asset’s price will rise. When the price falls sharply, these long positions become unprofitable. To close their losing positions, these traders must sell Bitcoin, which adds selling pressure to the market. This is known as a “long squeeze” or simply long liquidation. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading at $110,798.88, reflecting a 1.78% dip over the past 24 hours. This current price point sits right in the middle of these two critical liquidation thresholds, highlighting the extreme sensitivity and potential for volatility in the near term. Traders must therefore be prepared for scenarios in both directions, as significant Bitcoin liquidation cascades can dramatically alter market dynamics within a short period. Navigating Bitcoin Liquidation: Strategies for Savvy Traders For those participating in the crypto markets, understanding these liquidation levels isn’t just academic; it’s a critical component of risk management and strategic planning. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Liquidation Heatmaps: Tools that visualize potential liquidation levels can offer insights into areas of high market sensitivity. Manage Leverage Wisely: High leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Use it cautiously and understand your risk tolerance. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level, helping to limit potential losses and prevent forced liquidation. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data to anticipate potential price movements that could trigger significant Bitcoin liquidation events. The crypto market is unforgiving, and being caught on the wrong side of a large liquidation event can be costly. Proactive risk management is always the best defense. In conclusion, the potential for a Bitcoin liquidation cascade, whether from a surge to $114,000 or a dip below $107,000, underscores the inherent volatility and high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency trading. These thresholds represent not just price points, but significant psychological and financial barriers that could unleash billions in forced position closures. For traders and investors alike, staying informed and employing robust risk management strategies are paramount to navigating these turbulent waters successfully. The market is currently poised at a critical juncture, and understanding these dynamics will be key to anticipating its next dramatic move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a short squeeze in Bitcoin trading? A short squeeze occurs when the price of Bitcoin rises sharply, forcing traders who bet on a price drop (short sellers) to buy back BTC to cover their positions. This forced buying further pushes the price up, creating a rapid upward movement. Q2: How does leverage impact Bitcoin liquidation? Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with less capital. While it can amplify profits, it also magnifies losses. With high leverage, even small adverse price movements can lead to a trader’s margin falling below the required level, triggering a rapid liquidation. Q3: Are liquidation events predictable? While the exact timing is difficult to predict, analysts can identify “liquidation zones” where large volumes of short or long positions are clustered. Tools like liquidation heatmaps help visualize these potential trigger points, allowing traders to anticipate areas of high market sensitivity. Q4: What is the difference between a long position and a short position? A long position is a bet that an asset’s price will increase, so a trader buys with the expectation to sell higher. A short position is a bet that an asset’s price will decrease, so a trader sells borrowed assets with the expectation to buy them back cheaper later. Q5: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? Traders can protect themselves by using appropriate risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, monitoring their margin levels, and diversifying their portfolios. Understanding market dynamics and potential liquidation levels is also crucial. Did this article shed light on the dramatic potential of Bitcoin’s price movements?

The report showed that the U.S. economy added just 22,000 jobs in August, far below the forecast of 75,000. Hilton explained that this weaker-than-expected outcome highlights a “dramatically slowing U.S. labor market.” According to Hilton, the slowdown carries significance beyond employment figures. He argued that the results strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates during its upcoming meeting on September 17 . XRP Holders! We Got Great News Today! pic.twitter.com/cbWAXnX88i — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 5, 2025 Why It Matters for XRP Hilton acknowledged that many crypto holders may not closely follow the Fed’s policy decisions, but he emphasized that such moves directly affect digital assets. He stated that interest rate cuts provide conditions that can support cryptocurrencies by easing financial pressures in traditional markets. Lower rates often drive investors toward alternative assets, and Hilton linked this dynamic to the potential for XRP to benefit. Hilton linked the jobs report with other recent data, such as inflation figures, and argued that these signals give the Federal Reserve little choice but to move toward policy easing . In his view, this environment is favorable for digital assets in general and for XRP specifically. Positive Technical Signals for XRP Turning to XRP, Hilton noted that the token has been trading in a consolidation range for an extended period. He explained that XRP has moved sideways for 47 days, remaining between $2.8 and $3.35. He described $2.8 as the support level that has held firm, with XRP moving slightly above and below this point in recent weeks. Hilton connected this consolidation to prior trading patterns, suggesting that such periods often precede renewed momentum. While he did not issue a specific price prediction in the video, he highlighted the importance of monitoring XRP’s support levels as the broader macroeconomic backdrop shifts.

He maintained that an easy policy environment positions XRP to gain in the long run. Although the jobs report was seen as a disappointment in broader economic circles, Hilton sees it as a catalyst for policy change which will benefit XRP holders who have been waiting through a prolonged consolidation phase. Like many other experts, Hilton anticipates a major breakout for XRP in the short term. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

People are talking about anything from meme tokens to big-cap assets, but the real crypto investing forums are starting to focus on one name: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This initiative is getting attention for its fundamentals, which analysts say are setting the stage for a 1900% return on investment before the next cycle. This is different from the noise that causes short-term frenzies. Why investors are shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ethereum (ETH) has already shown that utility-driven tokens can take over as demand for the network grows. But today, the upside of ETH is smaller than it used to be. People who keep an eye on crypto pricing realise that the days of getting rapid multiples on blue-chip assets are coming to an end. At the same time, startups like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are coming up with fresh ideas that fix problems that older DeFi platforms had. The Stable Interest Rate Model is what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) work. When you borrow money from a traditional lending site, you might be subject to unanticipated changes that make it hard to get yourself ready. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will let people lock in the costs of paying back loans, which will provide both individual and institutional borrowers with confidence in their plans. While the stable rate begins higher than the floating market average, the payoff is peace of mind and higher capital inflows. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will adjust rates whenever the floating market goes up more than 10% over stable levels to keep gaps from hurting liquidity providers. This balancing act keeps lenders safe while demand for loans stays high, which puts money directly back into the ecosystem. This stability isn’t only for comfort; it will also lead to long-term confidence that will lead to increased borrowing, which will give lenders stable streams of income and make the platform’s token economy stronger. MUTM is built to expand without relying on speculative hype cycles, thanks to mechanics like these. Risk management meets scalable growth The way Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set up makes it less likely to fail during a crypto meltdown, like other DeFi projects have in the past. Borrowers must always put up more collateral than they borrow, and when the collateral gets too low, liquidators are more likely to step in. They buy assets at a discount to pay off loans, which keeps the platform running smoothly. This strategy keeps toxic debt from sticking around, so the organisation is solvent even when the crypto fear and greed index fluctuates wildly in unexpected markets. Deposit and borrow limits also make this more stable. These are like protective ceilings that keep any one token from flooding the system with too much exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will include Restricted Collateralization Mode for higher-risk assets. This would let people borrow money only under very rigorous circumstances. On the other hand, Enhanced Collateral Efficiency will give more advantageous limitations to stable, linked assets, such as large stablecoins. The protocol is creating one of the most risk-balanced lending environments the industry has ever seen by adding these layers. Investors are paying attention to how seriously Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is handling safety. Reserve factors will take some of the borrower’s interest, making a buffer pool in case of defaults or market extremes. Many people think that this type of forward-looking design will lead to more use and returns that are similar to those seen in the early days of Ethereum (ETH), but with better security. Presale momentum builds urgency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already generated $15.4 million in just six rounds of its presale. Phase 6 is now online at $0.035, and 33% of it has already sold out. The following phase will raise the price by 15% to $0.04. People who backed the project in Phase 1 for $0.01 are already up 3.5X their money, and the listing at $0.06 would put them at a full 500% unrealized profit. For purchasers in September, time is really important—this is their final chance to get a lower price before the change to Phase 7 pricing. The presale has attracted more than 16,100 holders, and a CertiK manual and static audit gave it a token scan score of 95. With a $50,000 bug bounty program and a strong social media presence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming a project that people trust and want to use. Analysts who say there will be a 1900% return on investment aren’t just making it up; they’re linking the dots between rising capital inflows, a solid presale basis, and technological solutions that fix genuine DeFi problems. The verdict for September traders As people on forums talk about what the best deal is before the end of the month, the answer is becoming increasingly in clarity. Ethereum (ETH) is still the most popular, although it grows more slowly. Meme coins go up and down with the enthusiasm, but they crash when sentiments shift. On the other side, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing how to make long-term profits: a presale that has already brought in millions, a steady interest strategy that changes how borrowing works, and layered safeguards that promise to keep the firm strong in unstable markets. September is a key month for traders looking for chances to make life-changing profits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is winning polls and talks because it combines risk management with the possibility for huge growth. Phase 6 is almost halfway done, and the next price spike is coming up. A lot of people now think that MUTM is the greatest cryptocurrency to buy this month because of that combination and the fact that it is most likely to reach the 1900% goal.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to $857.4 in the past 24 hours. If traders continue buying tokens, the BNB price might see a further jump, and the next target could be above $873. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,654.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $857.4, but it may find resistance around $873. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.41 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $1000 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,654.04 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-06 08:45:00

The company successfully raised an impressive $175 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, specifically earmarked for establishing a Dogecoin treasury . This significant fundraise signals a growing trend of corporate adoption of digital assets, and it’s certainly making waves. What is Driving CleanCore’s Vision for a Dogecoin Treasury? CleanCore Solutions had previously disclosed its intentions to invest in Dogecoin (DOGE), and this latest funding round brings those plans to fruition. The $175 million PIPE deal saw participation from several prominent players in the financial and crypto sectors. These included Mosaics, Pantera Capital, GSR Markets, FalconX, Borderless Capital, and Mythos. This diverse group of investors highlights the broad interest in CleanCore’s strategy. It suggests a belief in the long-term potential of integrating digital currencies into corporate financial structures. This isn’t just about holding crypto; it’s about a strategic allocation within a dedicated Dogecoin treasury . Forging Key Alliances for the Dogecoin Treasury A crucial aspect of CleanCore’s venture is its collaborative approach. The company has established its Dogecoin treasury in close partnership with two significant entities: the Dogecoin Foundation and House of Doge. These collaborations are vital, offering legitimacy and expertise to the initiative. Moreover, Marco Margiotta, the CEO of House of Doge, is set to join CleanCore as its Chief Investment Officer (CIO). This appointment brings seasoned crypto leadership directly into CleanCore’s executive team. It underscores the seriousness and strategic depth behind their commitment to this new digital asset strategy. Navigating Market Sentiments: The Initial Reaction to a Corporate Dogecoin Treasury It’s important to note that CleanCore’s initial announcement of its Dogecoin investment plans on September 2 was met with a sharp decline in its stock price. This reaction reflects the market’s initial caution and, perhaps, skepticism towards unconventional corporate treasury strategies. However, securing a substantial $175 million investment from reputable firms post-announcement indicates a different sentiment among institutional players. It suggests that while retail markets might react impulsively, sophisticated investors see potential in pioneering a Dogecoin treasury , even amidst volatility. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of a Dogecoin Treasury? Establishing a Dogecoin treasury presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. On the benefit side, CleanCore could tap into the vibrant Dogecoin community, enhance brand visibility, and potentially benefit from the asset’s price appreciation. It positions the company as an innovator in the corporate finance landscape. Benefits: Innovation: Positions CleanCore at the forefront of corporate crypto adoption. Community Engagement: Taps into Dogecoin’s large and active community. Potential for Appreciation: Offers exposure to a volatile, yet potentially high-growth, asset. Diversification: Adds a new asset class to the company’s balance sheet. Conversely, challenges include Dogecoin’s notorious price volatility, which could impact CleanCore’s financial statements. Regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies also pose a risk, as the landscape is constantly evolving. Furthermore, managing public perception and shareholder expectations will be crucial. Challenges: Price Volatility: Dogecoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically. Regulatory Uncertainty: The crypto regulatory environment is still developing. Public Perception: Managing investor and public reactions to a novel strategy. Operational Complexity: Requires specialized expertise for management. A Landmark Moment for Corporate Crypto Adoption CleanCore Solutions’ successful $175 million fundraise for its Dogecoin treasury marks a significant milestone. This move not only solidifies CleanCore’s position as an innovator but also sets a precedent for how other public companies might integrate digital assets into their financial strategies. It’s a clear signal that cryptocurrencies, even meme coins like Dogecoin, are increasingly being considered as legitimate components of corporate balance sheets, driven by strategic vision and institutional backing. The journey ahead for CleanCore’s Dogecoin treasury will be closely watched, offering valuable insights into the evolving relationship between traditional enterprise and the dynamic world of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a PIPE deal, as mentioned in CleanCore’s fundraise? A: A PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) deal involves the sale of publicly traded company shares or other securities to private investors. It’s a way for public companies to raise capital quickly from a select group of institutional or accredited investors. Q2: Why did CleanCore Solutions choose Dogecoin (DOGE) for its treasury? A: While the company’s full rationale isn’t detailed, choosing Dogecoin could be seen as a bold, innovative move to capture attention, engage with a large community, and potentially benefit from its unique market dynamics and cultural relevance. It differentiates their digital asset strategy. Q3: Who are the key partners involved in establishing CleanCore’s Dogecoin treasury? A: CleanCore Solutions is collaborating with the Dogecoin Foundation and House of Doge to establish and manage its Dogecoin treasury. Additionally, Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, is joining CleanCore as its Chief Investment Officer. Q4: What are the main risks associated with a corporate Dogecoin treasury? A: The primary risks include Dogecoin’s high price volatility, which can lead to significant fluctuations in the treasury’s value. There are also regulatory uncertainties in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, and potential challenges in managing public and investor perception of such an unconventional asset. Q5: How might CleanCore’s Dogecoin treasury impact the broader crypto market? A: This move could serve as a significant precedent, potentially encouraging other publicly traded companies to explore similar digital asset treasury strategies. It adds institutional legitimacy to Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and crypto.

51278073,575697,1757148655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51278073.jpeg,Best Altcoins to Buy as Ethereum Outflows Signal Renewed Accumulation,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-ethereum-outflows-accumulation/,"Ethereum exchanges are drying up quickly as ETH exchange ‘flux’ turns negative for the first time ever. Flux, by the way, calculates the cumulative net flow of ETH across all exchanges. A positive flux means there are more ETH deposits, which simply shows people are selling more ETH and buying less. A negative flux balance, however, indicates more outflows of ETH from exchanges than inflows, suggesting aggressive buying among market participants. Data from CryptoQuant also suggests that the balance of ETH on exchanges has now hit a new rock bottom , indicating strong institutional buying. Recently, Yunfeng Financial Group, backed by Chinese tycoon Jack Ma, bought 10,000 ETH worth $44M as part of its reserve strategy. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest institutional holder of ETH, added around 153,000 tokens , taking their stash past the $8B mark with 1.86M ETH in holdings. BitMine, in fact, now holds 1.5% of the total ETH supply. Additionally, three ICO-era whales recently moved $645M worth of Ethereum to a new staking address . These 150,000 ETH were originally bought for just $0.31, and instead of booking $643M in gains, these whales chose to stake the tokens for steady yields. This highlights how institutions increasingly view Ethereum as a yield-generating asset rather than just a speculative bet. Let’s dig into ETH’s technical charts to understand how the next few weeks could pan out. We’ll also suggest the best altcoins to buy now to make the most of this momentum. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Awaiting a Breakout After surging 139% since the beginning of May and teasing the $5K level on August 24, Ethereum has now entered a symmetrical triangle pattern, with key support at around $4,000. A symmetrical triangle typically signals the continuation of a strong bull run. A breakout here could see $ETH quickly reclaim previous highs and march toward $5,500 and beyond. According to Bitbull, a crypto trader with 67K followers on X, $ETH is holding a rising trendline on the daily timeframe. And as long as it doesn’t break below, $ETH remains a good buy . More importantly, as $ETH rises, so does the broader altcoin market, which often delivers astronomical returns. If you’re looking to make the most of Ethereum’s upcoming rally, here are a few cryptocurrencies worth watching right now. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Supercharging the Bitcoin Blockchain with Solana-Like Performance Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the best crypto to buy now thanks to its game-changing mission to improve Bitcoin’s real-world utility. $HYPER is building the first true Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, aimed at turbocharging the network with lightning-fast speeds, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 compatibility. Why’s this important? Because beyond its appeal as an investment vehicle, Bitcoin doesn’t provide much value to core crypto users: it’s painfully slow, congested, and expensive. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), $HYPER will let developers build smart contracts and decentralized applications on Bitcoin itself. Additionally, a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge will let you interact with Hyper’s Web3 environment by converting your native Bitcoin into Layer-2-compatible tokens. You can then use these wrapped $BTC tokens to engage in high-speed DeFi trading, NFTs, lending, staking, and DAOs – all without leaving the Bitcoin blockchain. Buy $HYPER now while it’s still in presale and available at some of its lowest-ever prices. At the moment, 1 $HYPER is priced at just $0.012865, and the project has already raised a whopping $14.1M from early investors. Plus, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could hit $0.32 by year-end – a staggering 2,400% gain for early buyers. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website for more information. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Hype-Driven Meme Coin Gunning for 1000x Returns If you think you’ve leaned a little too much on the cautious side and stacked only mainstream, utility-driven altcoins, consider Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . It’s a new meme coin in presale , fronted by a bulked-up, angrier, and potentially more profitable version of Dogecoin. Maxi is, in fact, Dogecoin’s distant cousin – but the two are anything but close. Dogecoin’s success and ‘cute’ vibe ruined Maxi’s childhood, as his family members were too busy hyping Doge to pay him any attention. Looking for revenge, Maxi found solace in the gym and in front of the charts. He built up his muscles and his crypto brain, crafting both a robust personality and a creative plan to overthrow Doge as the best meme coin on the planet. The plan? Aggressive marketing. Think PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and social media blitzes. In fact, the project’s developers have reserved a whopping 40% of the total $MAXI supply for marketing purposes. And despite not having any ‘revolutionary’ utility, holding $MAXI could still be extremely rewarding. You’ll get access to holder-only events, like weekly trading competitions and leaderboard prizes. Currently in presale, $MAXI has already pulled in over $1.88M from early investors, with each token priced at just $0.000256. Check out Maxi Doge’s official website for more information. 3. Tutorial ($TUT) – Viral Altcoin Capable of Riding Crypto’s Renewed Momentum Tutorial ($TUT) emerged as one of the top trending cryptos in the June–July rally, gaining a whopping 200%. And now, with another run-up on the cards, the token is again showing signs of a potential explosive move to the upside. It’s up over 16% in the past week, currently trading around $0.06886 – just one big green candle away from its all-time highs. Beyond that, there’s really no resistance stopping the token from going absolutely bonkers and potentially becoming the next 1000x crypto . What’s driving its momentum? Hype and community backing, of course – but $TUT is also one of the few tokens that hits the sweet spot between popularity and utility. As the name suggests, Tutorial is an education-based crypto offering easy-to-understand lessons on topics like setting up a crypto wallet , writing smart contracts, and trading on decentralized exchanges , helping newbies learn the ropes of crypto and blockchain. Wrapping Up Ethereum exchanges are drying up at a record pace, signaling a never-before-seen interest from deep-pocketed players looking to load up as much of the ‘digital silver’ as possible. This trend, combined with a potential interest rate cut in September, could send $ETH and other altcoins straight to the moon. If you want to capitalize on this rally, consider loading up on low-cap, high-upside tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Tutorial ($TUT). That said, kindly remember that the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. This article is not financial advice. Always do your own research before investing.

According to its press release, the agency mentioned that it is taking the fight against fraud to a new height, formulating a cross-border task force to strengthen the efforts of the Division of Enforcement. In addition, the agency will help them take the fight to the individuals and entities targeting United States residents, combating cross-border fraud that harms investors. SEC announces formation of cross-border task force In its press release, the agency mentioned that the cross-border team will be charged to initially focus on investigating potential US federal securities law breaches on the part of foreign-based companies. This will include potential market manipulations such as pump-and-dump and ramp-and-dump schemes. Pump-and-dump schemes are situations where the team behind an investment, or in some cases, a token, uses false or misleading rumors to create a buying rush that pushes the price of the token up. When the price of the token has attained the highest possible figure, the team then sells their portion of the token, which in turn pulls the price of the token down, making it useless for regular investors. Over the last few months, several regulators, including the United States Commodity Futures and Trading Commission ( CFTC ), have warned traders and investors, especially those in the crypto industry, about a series of pump-and-dump schemes. The agency has warned retail traders, who are often the victims in this case, to avoid investments that look like such schemes, giving them clear ways to identify such investments. Although the commission has warned investors about the need for due diligence and carefulness when patronizing projects in the crypto space, it noted that the task force will not hesitate to go after those who breach its rules. In addition, it said its task force will be charged to focus its enforcement on gatekeepers, especially auditors and underwriters, who help these companies gain access to the United States capital markets. Task force to focus on securities law violations According to the agency, the task force will also examine potential securities law violations related to companies from foreign jurisdictions such as China, where governmental control and other factors pose unique risks to investors. Speaking about the new development, Paul Atkins, the SEC Chairman, said the United States welcomes companies around the world seeking access to the US capital markets. “But we will not tolerate bad actors – whether companies, intermediaries, gatekeepers, or exploitative traders – that attempt to use international borders to frustrate and avoid U.S. investor protections. This new task force will consolidate SEC investigative efforts and allow the SEC to use every available tool to combat transnational fraud,” he added. Atkins also noted that he has ordered that he has directed other SEC divisions and offices to join hands in this battle. “I have also directed the staff in other SEC divisions and offices, including the Divisions of Corporation Finance, Examinations, Economic and Risk Analysis, and Trading and Markets, as well as the Office of International Affairs, to consider and recommend other actions that would better protect U.S. investors, including new disclosure guidance and any necessary rule changes,” he said. Division of Enforcement Director Margaret Ryan also talked about the task force and what is expected of the individuals who will make up the group. “The Cross-Border Task Force will leverage the Division of Enforcement’s resources and expertise to combat international market manipulation and fraud. We are pleased to be part of this critical effort to enforce the federal securities laws and protect U.S. investors,” she said. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

51279582,https://invezz.com/?p=2863721,1757149200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"BTC price stuck despite Fed cut bets; altcoins M, IP, PUMP show some strength",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/06/btc-price-stuck-despite-fed-cut-bets-altcoins-m-ip-pump-show-some-strength/,"Bitcoin’s price action over the past week has been anything but steady, with the leading cryptocurrency bouncing between $107,414 and $113,225. The broad trading range confirms the uncertainty prevailing across global markets, where macroeconomic signals have largely dictated investor sentiment. The total crypto market cap slipped about 2% over the week, settling at $3.899 trillion by Friday’s close. Although there were flickers of optimism during mid-week trading, enough to briefly push the Crypto Fear and Greed Index into “greed” territory, the mood ultimately cooled. By week’s end, the index had slipped back to a neutral reading of 48, as traders weighed the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut this month. Altcoins, meanwhile, posted mixed results. Most top-tier assets ended the week with only modest moves, with gains mostly concentrated in a handful of outperformers. Why is the Bitcoin price stuck? Bitcoin did manage to gather some momentum mid-week, climbing steadily after a clean bounce off the $110,000 support level. That technical rebound sparked a short-lived rally, with BTC/USD briefly pushing to new September highs near $113,400. But just as quickly as the rally came, it faded. Bitcoin shed nearly $3,000 within an hour as profit-taking and fresh macro data sapped the upward push. At the centre of this tug-of-war is the Federal Reserve. Traders are currently pricing in more than a 90% probability that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points at its upcoming policy meeting on September 17. That looming decision has already sparked a mild risk-on tilt across global markets, and Bitcoin, often seen as a high-beta proxy for speculative appetite, was among the early beneficiaries. Lower borrowing costs typically create a more favourable backdrop for risk assets, and BTC has historically responded quickly to even hints of monetary easing. The current sentiment is further reinforced by expectations of not just one, but at least two rate cuts by the end of 2025. That kind of dovish policy trajectory is exactly the sort of macro setup in which Bitcoin tends to flourish. ETF inflows this week added fuel to the optimism. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $332.7 million on Tuesday alone, the highest in two weeks, according to CoinGlass. It was a telling signal that institutional capital hasn’t lost interest, just waiting for the right macro cue. However, markets were jolted by the latest US nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data, which came in significantly below expectations. Only 22,000 jobs were added in August, well under the forecasted 75,000. The dollar stumbled on the weak labour readout, while gold surged to new all-time highs, classic moves in anticipation of policy easing. Yet Bitcoin, curiously, failed to fully capitalise. Despite the data aligning with a rate-cut narrative, BTC’s reaction was underwhelming. Prices dipped shortly after brushing September highs, a move that left many traders scratching their heads. While the labour market data supports the case for looser monetary policy, which is typically bullish for crypto, the lacklustre price response suggests the market is still searching for conviction. As trading resource The Kobeissi Letter pointed out, this was the second-lowest jobs report since July 2021, with downward revisions on prior months adding to the bleak picture. Will Bitcoin price go up? Zooming out, despite the late-week downturn that was unfolding at the time of publication, Bitcoin’s trajectory over the past 7 days has been upward. However, the question now remains whether this trend will continue or we will see a price reversal. To gauge that, analysts were observing certain critical areas that could potentially influence the upcoming direction. One key zone under scrutiny is the 200-period moving average on the 4-hour chart—both the simple (SMA) and exponential (EMA) varieties. Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades flagged this level as a crucial barometer for momentum in the short to mid-term. In a post on X, he noted that these moving averages have acted as stubborn resistance for weeks and are now being retested again. “These have both acted as resistance for the past few weeks and are now being tested again,” he wrote, hinting that a decisive break above could shift sentiment. Fellow market watcher ZYN echoed the sentiment, pointing specifically to the $113,000 region as the threshold to beat. BTC/USDT – 1-day price chart. Source: ZYN on X. “This is a very crucial level to reclaim for more upside,” he noted, adding that bulls would “be fully back” if Bitcoin could establish support above that zone. That area—just before the NFP print—was widely considered the short-term battleground for control. But not everyone is convinced that BTC may be out of the woods yet. Bearish takes are still circulating, with some voices warning that the recent rally may have been more technical than trend-setting. Investor and market analyst Ted Pillows reiterated his view that Bitcoin could slide further, especially if current support levels fail to hold. Ted @TedPillows · Follow $BTC has been stuck in a range for months now.I’m expecting a retest of $100K-$102K level before reversal.Also, if this level doesn’t hold, BTC could go around $92K-$94K CME gap level. 6:21 pm · 5 Sept 2025 207 Reply Copy link Read 118 replies Gaps in CME futures trading have historically acted like gravity wells, often pulling prices toward them when broader sentiment turns risk-averse. And while gaps aren’t guaranteed to fill, they tend to loom large in technical forecasts, particularly during periods of heightened volatility. When looking at the weekly liquidation heatmap for the BTC/USDT trading pair on Binance, some key support and resistance levels start to come into focus. Heavy liquidation clusters can be seen forming just below the $111,000 level and again around $108,000, areas where both long and short positions were recently wiped out. Binance BTC/USDT Weekly Liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. These bands of historical liquidations often act as soft support or resistance zones moving forward, as traders are cautious about re-entering positions too aggressively in areas of recent forced exits. One particularly active region sits around $110,000, which aligns with the area Bitcoin bounced from earlier this week. This level now acts as a psychological and technical anchor. Should BTC revisit this zone and hold, it could serve as a launchpad for another retest of the upper end of the range. On the flip side, downside liquidity continues to build between $106,000 and $103,500, with visible liquidation interest thickening near $104,000. If sellers manage to push price through the $108K–$110K soft floor, Bitcoin could be drawn into that zone, where aggressive liquidation of leveraged long positions could cascade into a deeper dip. To the upside, multiple heat pockets are visible near $113,500 to $114,000, which is where Bitcoin recently topped out before its abrupt drop. If BTC can reclaim and consolidate above $113K, a move toward $115,000 or even $117,000 isn’t off the table, but it will require strong bullish momentum and fresh catalysts, likely from macroeconomic data or institutional flows. At press time, Bitcoin was trading above the $110k support area, with a little over 2.6% in profits booked over the past 7 days. Altcoin market recap The total market cap of all altcoins rose to a weekly high of $1.75 trillion before settling at $1.69 trillion, up 4.3% over the week. Ethereum traded sideways this week as bulls and bears battled for control, with the price fluctuating between $4,250 and $4,450. As of press time, the leading altcoin by market cap was trading at $4,282, down about 1% on the week, with a market cap of $516.5 billion. Other large-cap altcoins like XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tron (TRX) also posted similar losses ranging between 1-3% in the last 7 days. MemeCore (M) stood out as the leading gainer of the week with triple-digit gains of 242%, far outpacing Story (IP) and Pump.fun (PUMP), which recorded gains of 31.6% and 30.4% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap MemeCore: MemeCore’s skyrocketing gains this week stem from investor hype and heavy community marketing around Korea Blockchain Week. An X post from a community member revealed that the project rented out Seoul’s iconic Lotte World theme park for the final night of the event. The park would be open to all KBW attendees and certified community testers. However, pulling off such a costly arrangement suggests the project is deploying significant capital to build cultural relevance. As many of these attendees also hold M tokens, community members are likely ramping up their holdings on the belief that the success of the theme park experience could largely depend on the token’s performance. Story : The primary catalyst behind Story’s rally today stems from the official launch of Poseidon’s first application, a training data collection app for physical AI operations. IP’s gains were also supported after Aria Protocol Labs and the Aria Foundation, both tied to the Story-based IP tokenisation platform Aria, revealed they had secured $15 million through their recent combined seed and strategic funding rounds. Finally, community-driven activity has added fuel to the rally. With more than 1,000 tokens deployed on ip.world as of press time, the IP coin narrative is spreading rapidly as it gains grassroots adoption. Pump.fun : PUMP’s rally this week was fueled by Pump.fun’s aggressive buyback of nearly $12.2 million worth of tokens from the open market over the past week. More broadly, its gains were supported by Pump.fun’s newly introduced strategic overhaul, Project Ascend, unveiled earlier this month. The initiative aims to empower creators on the platform while targeting scaling the ecosystem by 100x over the coming months.

Bitcoin Coin Days Destroyed Shot Up Alongside Earlier ETF Net Inflows As explained by CryptoQuant author Maartunn in a new post on X, Bitcoin has been observing major reshuffles related to old tokens and the spot ETFs. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that trade on traditional platforms and allow investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset like BTC without having to directly own the asset. The BTC spot ETFs launched in the US in January 2024. Since then, the funds have generally enjoyed growth, with a few periods involving a particularly sharp burst of inflows. The main attraction of the ETFs is that investors unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency world can invest into BTC in a form that’s convenient to them. Related Reading: Safe Haven Split: Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Turns Negative For First Time In 6 Months When a trader invests into such a vehicle, the fund buys an equivalent amount of the cryptocurrency on the client’s behalf. This reflects as an on-chain movement into the wallets associated with the ETF. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the 30-day Bitcoin spot ETF netflow since the start of 2024. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin spot ETF netflow has seen a few phases of extremely positive values. These naturally correspond to a high amount of demand for the ETFs. Interestingly, there is a pattern common among these large waves of inflows. From the chart, it’s visible that the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) gave distribution signals alongside the netflow spikes. The CDD is an on-chain indicator that measures the total number of coin days that are being “destroyed” in transactions across the BTC network. A coin day is a quantity that one BTC accumulates after staying dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a token dormant for some number days is moved, its coin days counter returns back to zero. The coin days that it had previously been carrying are said to be destroyed. Generally, spikes in this metric correspond to activity from the diamond hands of the network. These HODLers tend to accumulate a massive amount of coin days with their patience, so when they finally break their silence, large-scale destruction of coin days takes places. The three major Bitcoin ETF net inflow waves of Summer 2024, Fall 2024, and Summer 2025 all accompanied a distribution signal from the CDD, which suggests a rotation of coins happened from the veteran hands to new demand coming through these vehicles. Related Reading: Dogecoin Signal That Nailed The Top Says It’s Time To Buy Since the latest such wave, the ETF netflow has calmed down to the neutral level, meaning demand has gone cold. “ETF inflows are key,” notes Maartunn. “Without strong new demand, selling pressure from new holders could increase.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $110,500, up 2% over the past week.

The plan may add XRP payments to Wetour’s overseas platform. But it’s not automatic. The change depends on future business steps and getting regulatory approval. Access For 60 Million Members Under the deal, Wetour will focus first on premium chauffeur and airport transfer services. PhoenixMiles members could get access to Wetour’s platform, which now shows XRP as a payment option and also accepts Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Webus has also moved to use more altcoins. In June it filed with the SEC for a $300 million treasury reserve and said it plans to use the XRP Ledger for cross-border payments. XRP: Real Use & Limits Fans say the XRPL settles transactions in three to five seconds and fees are under one cent. Those features are why travel companies and loyalty programs might try the tech for vouchers, token rewards, and fast payments. But XRP payment support doesn’t always mean people will use the token for daily purchases. Attorney Bill Morgan notes the cautious wording, but he thinks it shows real progress. He said, “For me, it shows adoption of XRP.” Big Number Vs. Actual Use Case Sixty million is a big headline. It gets attention. But access is not the same as active use. Many loyalty programs have members who rarely travel or never use partner services. Wetour’s focus on higher-end transport and promo coupons means early use might only be by some members, not all 60 million. That can still matter. Pilot programs usually start small and grow if people use them. Rules & Business Checks The announcement says the integration depends on future business steps and regulatory sign-off. That matters now because payments and loyalty schemes touch local rules, cross-border compliance, and payment systems. A wide rollout will need those issues cleared, and it could take time. This is a notable step for XRP in travel and loyalty programs, but it’s early and conditional. Webus’ earlier moves — the planned $300 million treasury and XRPL plans — make the idea more believable than a one-time press claim.

51280699,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=135712,1757149867,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png,Here’s XRP Price If It Becomes the First Coin Held by Top 10 Central Banks,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/09/06/heres-xrp-price-if-it-becomes-the-first-coin-held-by-top-10-central-banks/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-xrp-price-if-it-becomes-the-first-coin-held-by-top-10-central-banks,"A new analysis explores the potential XRP price if the world’s top 10 central banks allocate a portion of their combined $13 trillion in reserves to the coin. The results show that even a modest level of adoption at this scale could propel XRP to new heights.XRP's Current Market PositionNotably, XRP is currently trading at around $2.81, with a circulating supply of approximately 59.4 billion tokens. This gives it a market cap of about $172.3 billion, making it one of the largest digital assets in circulation. Despite this substantial valuation, the entry of central banks could completely reshape XRP’s trajectory.Allocation Scenarios from $130B to $822B in XRPIf the top 10 central banks—including those in China, Japan, Switzerland, India, Russia, the United States, and others—were to allocate just 1% of their reserves (around $130 billion) to XRP, its market cap would rise to over $302 billion. This would push the token’s price to approximately $5.09.A 3% allocation, representing $390 billion, would drive XRP’s value to about $9.47. At the upper end, a 5% allocation equal to $650 billion would result in a market cap of more than $822 billion, translating to a token price near $13.84.Extended Outlook at 10%Looking beyond modest allocations, a 10% commitment from central bank reserves, roughly $1.3 trillion, could raise XRP’s market cap to $1.47 trillion. In this scenario, XRP price could climb to around $22.58 per coin, nearly eight times its current value. Speculative prices for XRP on goverment allocation Speculative prices for XRP on government allocation However, it is important to note that these figures are based on basic market cap arithmetic, assuming that central bank inflows would translate directly into increased valuation.In reality, such massive buying pressure from institutions of this size would likely create a multiplier effect , potentially driving XRP’s price well beyond these projections.Even a $1 billion government allocation could trigger significant market reactions, making inflows of $130 billion to $1.3 trillion far more impactful than the raw numbers might suggest.Consider the market frenzy that would likely follow an announcement that the U.S. government is purchasing $1 billion worth of XRP.But Is There Any Chance These Governments Will Hold XRP?The idea of governments holding XRP is compelling, especially amid a global push for crypto innovation and adoption at the governmental level , which has reached unprecedented momentum this year.The U.S. government has signed into law a bill on stablecoins, marking a historic milestone for crypto legitimacy. Furthermore, the government is working toward establishing a national crypto reserve that could hold up to 1 million BTC, along with a diversified crypto stockpile including XRP, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana.However, the U.S. has not expressed readiness to purchase any cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin.In countries like Russia and China, most discussions around crypto have focused on Bitcoin and stablecoins, often viewed as tools to promote their local currencies.Regarding Bitcoin, institutional FOMO remains high. Governments that currently hold BTC show no signs of selling. Notably, countries such as the U.S., China, the U.K., Ukraine, Bhutan, El Salvador, and four others collectively hold 517,298 BTC—worth over $56.76 billion.In essence, the current institutional focus is overwhelmingly on Bitcoin, while altcoins like XRP remain in the background.TakeawayThis analysis highlights the potentially outsized impact of institutional adoption on XRP, particularly at the highest level. However, the scenario of governments allocating between $130 billion and $1.3 trillion into XRP remains highly speculative.As it stands, Bitcoin is the more likely candidate for such large-scale government adoption.

The SEC is getting ready to approve XRP spot ETFs, and the industry is excited about what this may imply for institutional adoption. Once the green light is given, analysts think that big investors will put money into Ripple’s ecosystem, which will add another chapter to its tale. Wall Street is interested in ETFs, while retail traders are looking for something else. People in forums, Telegram groups, and Discord communities aren’t talking about institutions; they’re talking about which inexpensive crypto has the best possibility of making 100X its value by 2026. More and more, the answer is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale DeFi initiative that costs only $0.035. SEC nears approval of XRP spot ETFs The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is said to be close to giving the go-ahead for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as of September 4, 2025. This would raise the price of XRP to about $2.86, with a trading volume of $6.2 billion in 24 hours. The chances of approval are 95% because the SEC dropped its case against Ripple in August 2025, confirming that XRP is not a security for retail sales. Applications from firms like Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale are under review, with final decisions expected by October 2025. Technical indicators show XRP testing $2.80 support, with RSI at 53 and resistance at $3.00. Social media reflects strong optimism, fueled by whale accumulation of $1 billion. Analysts project a $3.64 target if $3.00 clears, but macro pressures like U.S. tariffs pose risks. A drop below $2.80 could test $2.65. Retail focus shifts to MUTM It’s not hard to see why people are drawn to it. XRP’s price of $2.80 shows that it is stable, but that also suggests that it won’t increase as quickly in the future. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is a unique combination of usefulness, scalability, and a low entry price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is different from other speculative tokens that are only based on hype. It has established a whole system around borrowing and lending that will go live with the launch of its token. That includes a beta version of its platform, which means that users will be able to utilize a functional product right now instead of having to wait years for it to be finished. MUTM’s Layer-2 architecture is what makes it so appealing. Transactions will be quicker and cheaper than on existing Layer-1 networks, which have problems with congestion and excessive costs. This implies that regular clients will have cheaper and smoother interactions. This means that institutions may grow without giving up security. That mix will be the foundation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ecosystem, where its lending engine, stablecoin mechanisms, and liquidity protections all work together. This design has already gotten a lot of attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $15.4 million in Phase 6 of its presale, and more than 16,100 people now possess the currency. At $0.035, 33% of the supply for this phase has already sold. The price will go up by 15% in Phase 7. The project has passed a complete CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 95.00. It also initiated a giveaway of $100,000 to anyone who bought tokens in a specific window. For investors who got in early, gains are already well over 100%. Buyers who get in now are making sure they get in before the next leg up. Mechanics that justify 100x The way Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set up makes it more than just a risky play. With the project’s Stable Interest Rate Model, borrowers will be able to lock in their payback expenses. This level of predictability draws in not just individual traders but also treasuries and funds that want to manage long-term risk without abrupt shocks. The system will rebalance whenever variable rates go up more than 10% over stable rates. This makes sure that lenders are always paid fairly. The reserve factor also sends some of the borrower’s interest to a treasury pool. This treasury acts as a safety net when markets are unstable, and over time, it will increase the value of tokens. Deposit and borrow caps give another layer of security by making sure the protocol doesn’t go too far with risky or illiquid tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stable even when the rest of the market goes down by carefully setting limitations. This way of doing things is important in a place that is often unstable. Like XRP needs ETF clearance to get institutional flows, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a system that will create demand naturally through real use. The plan shows a staggered deployment, starting with beta testing when the token is listed and then expanding to further DeFi connections. Each phase builds on a proven framework, which keeps projects from making mistakes by moving too quickly without risk controls. For traders who want to know the difference between hype and conviction, this tiered strategy is the key. These are the basic facts that analysts are using to make their predictions of a 100x return on investment by 2026: actual usefulness from launch, built-in protections that make people feel protected, and listings on Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC are all expected. The outcome is a project that has the same type of early-stage confidence that Ethereum’s early investors had. Before it’s too late The crypto market moves quickly, and history suggests that regular investors often wish they had invested sooner. XRP’s ETF clearance will definitely make headlines and affect crypto prices in the short term, but traders looking for life-changing returns are already buying MUTM in presale. The urgency is clear: this is the final opportunity for investors to get in before a planned 15% price rise, and more than a third of the stock is already gone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) doesn’t simply guarantee growth; it also has a whole economic plan to keep it going. It is setting itself up to be the breakout DeFi project of this cycle with its Layer-2 backbone, dependable borrowing mechanics, and strong reserve safeguards. If you’re thinking about investing in crypto for 2026, the decision is becoming apparent. As the SEC makes its final judgment on XRP’s ETF, individual traders are buying into the presale that analysts claim may provide them a 100x return on their investment. XRP may stay in the news because of its stability, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to take over the future of DeFi.

Key Takeaways: A new AI coding exploit can silently spread malware across entire codebases using hidden markdown instructions. Coinbase’s preferred tool, Cursor, is among several AI assistants shown to be vulnerable. CEO Brian Armstrong’s aggressive AI rollout has sparked backlash from developers and security experts. According to cybersecurity firm HiddenLayer , the flaw allows attackers to stealthily inject malicious code that can spread across an entire organization’s codebase with minimal user interaction. The attack, dubbed the “CopyPasta License Attack,” exploits how AI tools interpret common developer files like LICENSE.txt and README.md. AI Code Assistants Exposed to Malware via Hidden Markdown By embedding harmful instructions in markdown comments, often hidden from rendered views, attackers can manipulate AI code assistants into propagating malware without developers realizing. “Injected code could stage a backdoor, exfiltrate sensitive data, or manipulate critical systems, all while remaining buried deep inside files,” HiddenLayer said in a Thursday report. The firm demonstrated the exploit using Cursor, the AI coding assistant reportedly adopted by every Coinbase engineer as of February. HiddenLayer said similar vulnerabilities were present in other tools including Windsurf, Kiro, and Aider. The concern comes just a day after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong claimed that AI now writes up to 40% of the company’s code, a figure he aims to push to 50% next month. The announcement drew criticism from cybersecurity experts, developers, and crypto insiders who warned of the risks tied to mandated AI adoption. “This is a giant red flag for any security-sensitive business,” said Larry Lyu, founder of decentralized exchange Dango. Carnegie Mellon professor Jonathan Aldrich called the policy “insane,” adding that he would not trust Coinbase with his funds after hearing it. ~40% of daily code written at Coinbase is AI-generated. I want to get it to >50% by October. Obviously it needs to be reviewed and understood, and not all areas of the business can use AI-generated code. But we should be using it responsibly as much as we possibly can. pic.twitter.com/Nmnsdxgosp — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 3, 2025 Delphi Consulting’s Ashwath Balakrishnan called the push “performative and vague,” while Bitcoiner Alex Pilař stressed that Coinbase, as a major crypto custodian, should prioritize security over AI adoption metrics. Armstrong has defended the move , saying AI-generated code must still be reviewed and is not used in all parts of the business. In a blog post, Coinbase’s engineering team clarified that AI use is more common in front-end and less-sensitive systems, while “system-critical exchange systems” remain more cautiously managed. However, Armstrong admitted during a podcast with Stripe co-founder John Collison that he had enforced AI onboarding at Coinbase, going as far as firing engineers who refused to use the tools. “I went rogue,” Armstrong said. “They got fired.” TIME Names Coinbase a 2025 ‘Disruptor’ Among Most Influential Companies As reported, TIME has recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , labeling the crypto exchange a “disruptor” for its significant role in shaping US digital asset policies and markets. TIME noted the exchange as a key driver behind the industry’s policy efforts and predicted Coinbase could become the central hub for crypto trading in the US. Beyond the US, Coinbase is broadening its reach in Europe, securing a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator.

51280161,https://invezz.com/?p=2864077,1757150687,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Memecoins like PEPE and DOGE are volatile while MUTM signals a $1 much faster,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/06/memecoins-like-pepe-and-doge-are-volatile-while-mutm-signals-a-1-much-faster/,"There are always waves of euphoria during bull cycles, and this year, memecoins like PEPE and DOGE are once again flooding social media with huge profits and heartbreaking losses. They can become viral quickly, but they don’t have any core use cases, which makes them dangerous for investors who want steady growth. People who want to make money quickly are asking a more direct question: which project offers both speed and usefulness? Analysts say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale DeFi currency that costs $0.035, is the solution more and more often. They think it will reach $1 far faster than any memecoin. Why traders are pivoting from memes to utility Chasing memes like DOGE or PEPE is always exciting. But the price fluctuations in crypto may quickly wipe out novice investors before they can do anything. Investors are now choosing projects with actual infrastructure because they want short-term profits that will last. This is what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) different. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already collected $15.4 million in its presale, which has brought in more than 16,100 holders and a CertiK audit with a high Token Scan Score of 95. The price right now in Phase 6 is $0.035, and because 33% of this phase has been sold, it’s evident that things are moving. The price will go up by 15% in the following phase, which means that time is running out to get allocations for less than $0.04. This traction is more than just a pose; it shows that more people believe in a technology that will actually provide DeFi functionality. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is different from memecoins since it has real mechanisms that will be in place at launch, while memecoins are based only on community jokes and guesswork. Analysts think that $1 is an early milestone rather than a far-off fantasy because of that difference in basis. Why $1 is on the horizon for MUTM Features that immediately lead to acceptance and value creation are the basis of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s approach. The project works on Layer-2 scaling, which means that transactions are faster and far cheaper than they are on Ethereum Layer-1, which is quite busy. This is a very important benefit for traders who are upset that fees are cutting into their short-term gains. Second, incentives for liquidation that take into account liquidity make the system self-balancing. Liquidations put money back into the protocol treasury if debtors are at risk of default. That process keeps operations consistent even when markets are turbulent, which gives investors confidence and brings additional money into the system. Third, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has an agenda for the future that goes beyond only lending and borrowing. The project wants to introduce a native stablecoin, which would make it a useful financial instrument in the real world. Stablecoins have always been a big part of DeFi ecosystems, and this new feature will help Mutuum Finance (MUTM) develop even faster as more people utilize it. The figures show that there is a chance. for the current price of $0.035, an early investor from Phase 1 who bought in for $0.010 is now up over 250%. When Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gets closer to $0.06, those early investments will have already gone up 6X. In the middle of the term, a run to $1 means a return on investment of more than 55X for those who are still entering Phase 6. On the other hand, chasing DOGE pumps is more about timing viral tweets than making long-term money. This is why experts who are interested in short-term crypto investments are calling MUTM one of the few chances that mixes speculative upside with genuine mechanics. Memecoins can go up and down rapidly, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a system that becomes stronger with every transaction. Final words It’s easy to see why it’s so important: prices go up when Phase 6 ends. That implies that merchants who wait will have to pay more for the same amount. The coin will soon reach a far larger audience than just early presale buyers, thanks to listings on Binance, Kraken, and other tier-one exchanges. This will create a wave of liquidity that short-term investors want to grab at the ground level. If you pay close attention to crypto forecasts, the picture is becoming clearer. Memecoins like PEPE and DOGE will always be fun to watch, but they don’t have the infrastructure to keep their value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is racing toward $1 with its $15.4 million presale, audited structure, and development plan. When looking for a cryptocurrency to buy now that can make you money quickly, MUTM stands out as the safer, wiser, and quicker choice.

In 2025, there is no single “best” AI detector OR AI Checker , as the ideal choice depends on your specific use case, required accuracy, and budget. The field is highly dynamic, with new models and detection tools being released constantly. The most trusted and highly-regarded AI detectors as of September 2025 are: GPTZero , Originality.ai , and Winston AI . These tools are consistently cited for their high accuracy and specialized features. Top AI Detectors and Their Best Use Cases GPTZero : This is widely considered the top choice for educators and academic institutions . It is praised for its high accuracy and low false-positive rate, meaning it is less likely to incorrectly flag human-written text as AI-generated. A key feature is its ability to provide sentence-by-sentence analysis , which gives users a clear breakdown of where AI may have been used. In summer 2025, it released a new model trained on advanced language models like GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 , further improving its ability to detect the latest AI outputs. Originality.ai : Best for content marketers, SEO professionals, and digital publishers . It’s specifically designed to detect AI content that has been edited or “humanized” to evade detection. The tool offers a suite of features including plagiarism checks, readability scores, and a website scanner to check an entire site for AI content. It updated its model in June 2025 to improve its accuracy on the latest AI models and humanizer tools, boasting a 99%+ accuracy rate and a low false-positive rate of 0.5% . Winston AI : A strong contender for professional teams and educators who need robust integrations. Winston AI claims an impressive 99.98% accuracy rate for detecting content from models like ChatGPT and Google Gemini . It also offers Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to scan text from images and documents, as well as a plagiarism checker and readability score. It integrates with platforms like Google Classroom and WordPress , streamlining workflows for its users. Copyleaks : Geared toward enterprises and academic institutions . This tool provides a comprehensive solution with multi-language support and the ability to detect paraphrased AI content. Its robust API and enterprise-grade features make it a go-to for large-scale content integrity management. Key Considerations and Limitations It is crucial to understand that no AI detector is 100% accurate . These tools work based on probabilities and can sometimes produce false positives (flagging human text as AI) or false negatives (failing to detect AI text). The accuracy of a detector can also vary based on the text’s length, topic, and writing style. The best practice is to use AI detectors as a supplementary tool and always apply your own human judgment, especially in high-stakes situations like academic submissions or professional publishing. Always cross-check results with multiple tools to get a more reliable assessment.

According to reports, the team is a small but influential group of researchers that shapes how the firm’s AI models interact with people. In a memo released in August, Mak Chen, OpenAI’s chief research officer, mentioned that the team, which consists of about 14 researchers, has been directed to join the Post Training team. The latter is a research group responsible for improving the company’s AI models after their initial pre-training. As part of the reorganizations, the Model Behavior team will now report to OpenAI’s Post Training lead, Max Schwarzer. According to reports, the founding leader of the Model Behavior team, Joanne Jang, is moving on to start a new project under OpenAI. In a recent interview, Jang mentioned that she is building a new research team called OAI Labs. She added that the team will be responsible for “inventing and prototyping new interfaces for how people collaborate with AI.” OpenAI reorganizes its Model Behavior team The Model Behavior team has been one of the most important research groups to OpenAI , helping the company shape the personality of its AI models and reducing sycophancy, a situation that occurs when AI models simply agree with and reinforce the beliefs of their users. This situation is harmful because it helps users affirm even beliefs that are unhealthy and pose harm to them, instead of offering a balanced response. The team has also worked on navigating political bias in model responses, helping OpenAI define its stance when it comes to AI consciousness. In the memo sent to staff, Chen mentioned that this is the perfect time to bring the work of OpenAI’s Model Behavior team closer to the core model development. This way, the company is affirming that the personality of its AI is now seen as an important factor in how the technology evolves. In the past few months, OpenAI has faced scrutiny and criticism over the behaviors of its AI models. Users have strongly objected to the personality changes the company made to GPT-5 , which the company said showed lower rates of sycophancy but seemed colder to some of its users. The complaint led OpenAI to restore access to some of its legacy models, including the GPT-4o. The company also released a new update to make the newer GPT-5 responses feel friendlier without an increase in sycophancy. AI firms face criticism over model sycophancy OpenAI and other AI model developers have to walk a fine line to ensure their chatbots are friendly but not too sycophantic. Last month, parents of a 16-year-old boy dragged OpenAI to court over the alleged role of ChatGPT in their son’s suicide. According to court documents, the teenager, Adam Raine, confided in ChatGPT (specifically a version powered by GPT-4o) about his suicidal plans and thoughts in the months leading up to his death. The lawsuit alleges that the model failed to push back on his suicidal ideas. The Model Behavior team has been on every OpenAI model since GPT-4, including several models and the GPT-5. Before starting the research unit, Jang had previously worked on projects like Dall-E 2, OpenAI’s early image-generation tool. Last week, she announced on X that she was leaving the team to “begin something new at OpenAI.” The former leader of the Model Behavior unit has been with the firm for about four years. 🧪 i’m starting oai labs: a research-driven group focused on inventing and prototyping new interfaces for how people collaborate with ai. i’m excited to explore patterns that move us beyond chat or even agents — toward new paradigms and instruments for thinking, making,… — Joanne Jang (@joannejang) September 5, 2025 According to reports, Jang is expected to serve as the general manager of OAI Labs, which will be directly under Chen for now. However, she added that it is still early days, and it is unclear what those novel interfaces will be. “I’m really excited to explore patterns that move us beyond the chat paradigm, which is currently associated more with companionship, or even agents, where there’s an emphasis on autonomy,” said Jang. Jang also added that she has been thinking of AI systems as instruments for doing all sorts of things, including connecting, learning, and thinking. When asked if OAI Labs is expected to collaborate on novel interfaces with Jony Ive, the former Apple design chief who just joined OpenAI on a family of AI hardware devices, Jang said she is open to all sorts of ideas. However, she added that she is likely going to start with research because that’s an area she is more familiar with.

MUTM has attracted the attention of both institutional players and retail clients looking for strong DeFi yields and a creative approach to decentralized lending. Meanwhile, old players, like Cardano (ADA), are also developing their ecosystem through continuous growth of the network and cooperation. Cardano (ADA) Resilience Cardano (ADA) is at approximately $0.82, and is well within its $0.78-$0.82 support zone- a foundation that has been very effective during the recent market turbulence. Analysts point out that one of the primary areas of resistance can be found in the area of $0.88. A decisive break of the level would initiate a move towards $1.00 perhaps even $1.20. It is noted, that ADA can reach a trade range of at least $0.80 to $1.30 with the average of $1.14 being most likely to increase by about 60% of the present level. Meanwhile, longer run forecasts lie between the more conservative end-of-year forecasts of $0.90 to the more aggressive potential highs of about $2.05 assuming positive ecosystem dynamics like ETF support. As such, there is also a direction shift toward investment in new DeFi applications such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Ongoing Mutuum Finance is in its 6th round of presale and its tokens are at a current price of $0.035, 16.17 percent higher than in the previous stage. The market certainly is interested with the more than 16100 invested holders and almost $15.45 million raised already. In order to improve platform security further, a USDT Bug Bounty Program has been established together with CertiK, and is valued at $50,000 USDT. This program reports these vulnerabilities as critical, important, minor and occasional. Management Security and Risk The parameters assigned to the assets guaranteed by Mutuum Finance are typically those that are inherent to the risk profile of the asset, such as supply limits, borrowing limits, and collateral limits. The protocol will thus hedge market volatility by overcollateralising positions and will serve as an incentive to liquidators to stabilise undercollateralised positions. The deposits and borrowing limits also limit risk exposure to risky or liquid assets and lessen the likelihood of becoming bankrupt too. The collateral use constraint of risky tokens can be extremely small, and the correlated assets will be collateral efficient. Community Building participation $100,000 Mutuum Finance has announced a $100,000 giveaway as part of its plan to build and market an active user base. To allow new entrants to join and invest in the project, $10000 MUTM tokens shall be issued to ten holders. Key Metrics and Protections MUTM is a platform constructed on the basis of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and the objective limitation of borrowing and collateral and offload liquidation constraints to hazardous employment and compensating liquidators. The reserve factor is a proxy to reflect what really matters in order to deliver what is termed as a buffer against default and severe market conditions and more risky assets are given more reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be one of the most promising cryptos to invest in Q4 2025, and its decentralized lending offerings are attracting institutional and retail investors. Stage 6 tokens are worth $0.35 and is up 16.17% to the last stage having over 16,100 holders and nearly 15.45M raised.

According to the Tron founder, he intends to allocate $10 million toward unspecified altcoins, with the remaining amount directed to the newly launched WLFI. We believe U.S.-listed crypto stocks are an undervalued opportunity. I will market buy $10 million worth of ALTS and $10 million worth of WLFI. @worldlibertyfi @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @ZachWitkoff @zakfolkman @WatcherChase — H.E. Justin Sun 👨‍🚀 (Astronaut Version) (@justinsuntron) September 5, 2025 The timing of the move is notable, as WLFI remains under heavy scrutiny following recent controversies related to its high-profile launch. Notably, following the launch, Sun revealed that more than $75 million of his WLFI holdings had been frozen after the project blacklisted over 270 wallets. WLFI defended the decision, claiming the affected accounts were linked to phishing scams and compromised credentials. Critics, however, argue the move undermines the platform’s claims of decentralization. Sun’s defense Interestingly, Sun, who is an advisor to the project rejected accusations of market manipulation, explaining the transfers were merely “small deposit tests” and not sales. He called the freeze “unreasonable” and urged equal treatment for all investors. To this end, on-chain analysis from Nansen supported his stance, attributing WLFI’s sharp decline to large market-makers rather than Sun. “I call on the team to respect these principles, unlock my tokens, and let’s move forward together toward the success of World Liberty Financials,” he said. Launched in 2024 with strong backing from President Donald Trump and his family, WLFI has experienced extreme volatility since its debut. The token opened above $0.30 but has since lost nearly half its value, trading around $0.18–$0.19.

These tools are driving a shift from simple automation to AI agents that can plan, reason, and act on complex goals with minimal human intervention. Top Agentic AI Platforms for Enterprise Development For companies looking to integrate agentic AI into their existing systems, the following platforms offer robust, scalable, and secure solutions. Microsoft AutoGen: An open-source framework designed for building conversational, multi-agent systems. It stands out for its enterprise-grade reliability and ability to facilitate collaboration between specialized AI agents. AutoGen is designed for seamless integration within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. IBM Watsonx Orchestrate: This platform automates complex enterprise workflows using natural language. It is built on IBM’s foundation models and focuses on providing an AI-powered solution for compliance-heavy industries such as banking and healthcare, with a strong emphasis on governance and audit trails. LangGraph: As an extension of the LangChain framework, LangGraph provides a graph-based approach for building sophisticated, multi-agent workflows. Its key features include advanced state management and fine-grained control over agent interactions, making it ideal for applications that require precise control and complex decision-making. Top Frameworks for Multi-Agent Collaboration For developers and teams focused on building custom, collaborative AI agents, these frameworks are leaders in their field. CrewAI: This popular open-source framework is known for its simplicity and quick deployment. It allows developers to build collaborative, role-based AI agents that can work together as a “crew” to accomplish tasks, mirroring a human team dynamic. CrewAI is often the top choice for rapid prototyping and projects requiring multi-agent teamwork. Adept AI: With its ACT-1 model, this platform enables AI agents to interact directly with software interfaces. Instead of relying on APIs, it observes human demonstrations to perform tasks across various applications like spreadsheets and CRMs, making it a powerful tool for automating workflows without requiring direct code access. Cognosys: This platform specializes in creating fully autonomous, browser-native AI agents. These agents can perform a wide range of web-based tasks by directly interacting with web interfaces, making them effective for automating online workflows. Key Trends in Agentic AI in 2025 The agentic AI landscape is rapidly evolving, driven by several key trends that are shaping how these technologies are being developed and deployed. Rise of Multi-Agent Systems: There is a significant shift toward using multiple, specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex problems, a strategy that is becoming mainstream in 2025. Integration with RPA: Agentic AI is adding cognitive intelligence to existing robotic process automation ( RPA ) platforms like UiPath , enabling more dynamic and adaptable workflows that can respond in real time. Focus on Governance and Ethics: As agent autonomy increases, so does the need for oversight. Leading agentic systems are prioritizing features like explainability, audit trails, and guardrails to ensure responsible and compliant deployment, particularly in regulated industries. The development of agentic AI marks a significant move toward a future where AI systems can perform complex, end-to-end tasks autonomously, fundamentally changing business operations and software development.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-army-fears-coinbase-price-manipulation-heres-what-happened/,"Crypto investor Stern Drew has raised serious concerns regarding Coinbase’s recent handling of its XRP reserves. In a detailed analysis shared on social media, Drew pointed to data from XRPScan showing that Coinbase reduced its XRP holdings from 780 million to 199 million within weeks. This represents a 69% decrease, effectively removing the exchange from the position of the fifth-largest holder and pushing it to the lower end of the top ten. Drew emphasized that such a significant reduction could not be regarded as standard selling behavior, suggesting that it appeared to be deliberate manipulation. COINBASE IS MANIPULATING XRP XRPScan data shows Coinbase cut its stash from 780M → 199M XRP in weeks – a 69% slash. Once the 5th-largest holder, they’re now barely in the top 10. This isn’t normal selling. It looks like coordinated manipulation. Let’s decode pic.twitter.com/yGrxPRku2l — Stern Drew (@SternDrewCrypto) September 5, 2025 Outflows and Trading Patterns According to Drew, Coinbase’s selloffs accounted for approximately 581 million XRP, valued at nearly $300 million at current market prices. He stated that 40% of these outflows were routed through over-the-counter desks connected to New York institutions, while the timing of the transactions coincided with nearly every notable dip in XRP’s price. Drew further noted that 72 percent of the selling activity occurred during low-liquidity hours, specifically between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. UTC. He added that Coinbase allegedly fragmented the flows across multiple exchange wallets in a way that disguised the full scale of the movements. These actions, he claimed, suppressed potential rallies, particularly at points where XRP was approaching key resistance levels around $1.20. Alleged Motivations Behind the Strategy Drew proposed three possible motivations behind Coinbase’s actions. The first was external pressure from groups tied to what he referred to as “ETHGate,” citing Coinbase’s links with ConsenSys and the Ethereum Foundation. The second, he argued, was Wall Street positioning, where institutional players could benefit from driving retail investors out before accumulating XRP at lower prices. The third potential motivation highlighted by Drew was the possibility of using XRP price pressure as leverage in U.S. policy and regulatory negotiations, particularly with Ripple remaining central to ongoing discussions around digital assets. Data Correlations and Institutional Flows To support his claims, Drew referenced his team’s modeled “XRP Suppression Index,” which measured the relationship between Coinbase’s selloffs and XRP price caps. He stated that the index showed a 0.87 correlation, a level he described as highly significant, while no similar activity was observed with other exchanges. He also highlighted that part of the offloaded XRP reportedly ended up with wallets linked to BlackRock custodianship services. Another portion was moved to Hong Kong-based OTC desks hours before Ripple’s announcement regarding its Asia corridor. Drew argued this pattern suggested insider awareness that retail investors did not possess. Wider Market Implications In his analysis, Drew suggested that if Coinbase is indeed intentionally suppressing XRP, the implications extend beyond individual traders. He outlined that such actions could serve to protect banks tied to SWIFT from liquidity shocks, preserve Ethereum’s market position against XRP’s growing institutional use , and slow what he described as XRP’s “multiplier effect” during key market events. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Drew concluded his thread by warning that Coinbase’s reduction of its XRP reserves should be interpreted as more than routine exchange management. In his view, the scale and timing indicate that XRP poses a structural challenge to established systems. He added that while such suppression can influence price movements in the short term, it cannot be maintained indefinitely, suggesting that XRP could experience significant gains once these pressures subside.

His latest pick is Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , a Layer 2 crypto that fuses meme culture with real blockchain power. With its presale live in September and analysts already whispering about 1000% potential, $LBRETT is quickly climbing the ranks of trending cryptocurrencies and carving out a lane as the next big crypto play. Dogecoin Drops 16% as SEC ETF Decision Looms Large Dogecoin has slipped into a make-or-break zone, falling about 16% from its August peak of $0.25. The token is now hovering near levels not seen since early August, with traders nervously eyeing what could be a defining moment for its price action. Dogecoin price analysis. Source: Crypto.news Much of the buzz centers on the looming SEC decision regarding Dogecoin exchange-traded funds . Bitwise faces an October 18 deadline, while Grayscale and 21Shares follow in November and January. If approved together, these funds could spark fresh momentum, echoing earlier moves seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Dogecoin ETF Odds. Source: Polymarket Traders are divided but cautiously optimistic. Polymarket data shows an 80% chance of approval, up from just 44% in June. Even so, DOGE’s inflows would likely fall short of Ethereum and Bitcoin. Still, if Dogecoin ETFs attract only 3% of its market cap, that would represent a solid $3 billion boost. Layer Brett Blends Meme Spirit With Layer 2 Blockchain Power Instead of being just another meme token chasing short-lived hype, Layer Brett feels like a revolution with a smiley face. The project takes the wild, unpredictable spirit of memes and fuses it with the strength of a full Layer 2 blockchain. It’s the escape route from slow Layer 1 congestion, and it’s already drawing crypto investors who want both fun and function. Onboarding couldn’t be simpler. Instead of complicated exchange processes, all you need to do is connect MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load ETH, USDT, or even use a fiat card, and you’re in. For newcomers who often find crypto intimidating, LBRETT’s zero KYC and level of simplicity is a real game-changer. Layer Brett is also serious about transparency. Every action is visible on-chain, so holders know exactly what’s happening with their tokens. In an industry where trust is everything, $LBRETT proves that clear, decentralized tracking is built into the DNA of the project. Security is another pillar. Thanks to its advanced Layer 2 architecture, $LBRETT functions like a digital fortress, guarding against exploits and hacks that have plagued other altcoins. Investors can feel confident knowing their assets aren’t just growing—they’re protected. Conclusion Dogecoin just stumbled with a 16% dip, and with ETF approvals still uncertain, the entire meme coin space feels like it’s walking on eggshells. That’s exactly why Layer Brett is turning heads. It’s not relying on hype alone. It is combining meme culture with the strength of a true Layer 2 blockchain. At the moment, the presale is priced at $0.0055 and edging toward $0.0058, with investors already contributing close to $3 million. Early stakers can still lock in high rewards, though they’ll shrink as more participants rush in. With such momentum building around the crypto presale, why sit back when you can jump in? Layer Brett is still in presale, but it won’t be forever. Get in now before prices rise and rewards drop.

Developed by the team behind the online IDE StackBlitz , it is designed for both experienced developers seeking to accelerate their workflow and non-technical users looking to create working prototypes. Unlike most AI code assistants that provide snippets, Bolt AI ‘s key differentiator is its ability to build a fully functional, end-to-end application—including the frontend, backend, and database—in a matter of minutes, all without requiring any local setup. How Bolt AI Works Bolt AI uses a generative AI agent to translate text instructions into code that runs directly within its browser-based development environment, powered by WebContainers . Prompt-to-App Generation : A user describes their app idea in a chat window (e.g., “Build a CRM with contact notes and a Kanban board”). The AI then generates the entire application, including the front-end ( React with Tailwind CSS ), the back-end ( Node.js ), and the database schema ( Prisma with PostgreSQL ). Browser-Native Environment : The entire development process, from code generation to a live preview, happens within the user’s browser, eliminating the need for local installations or complex configuration. Iterative Development : Users can either edit the generated code manually within the built-in editor or continue to refine the application by giving additional prompts to the AI. One-Click Deployment : Once satisfied, users can deploy the live application directly from the platform via integrations with services like Vercel or export the source code for full ownership. Key Differentiators: Bolt AI vs. Other Tools Bolt AI is fundamentally different from other AI tools in its approach to application development. It occupies a unique position in the market, bridging the gap between traditional AI code assistants and no-code platforms. Bolt AI vs. AI Code Editors (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI) : Focus : Bolt AI focuses on generating a complete, production-ready application from scratch , whereas tools like GitHub Copilot are designed to assist an experienced developer by providing context-aware code completion and suggestions within their existing codebase. Target User : Bolt AI is built for both developers who need to rapidly prototype and beginners with no coding experience. AI code editors are strictly for experienced developers. Output : Bolt AI generates a fully functional, full-stack application . AI code editors generate code snippets or functions that a developer must integrate into a larger project. Bolt AI vs. No-Code Platforms (e.g., Bubble, UI Bakery) : Focus : Bolt AI is a code-first tool that generates standard, portable code that developers can own and edit. No-code tools are visual-first , using a drag-and-drop interface to build an application within their proprietary ecosystem. Flexibility : Bolt AI provides access to the raw code, offering more flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in. No-code platforms often make it difficult to export and migrate applications. Backend : Bolt AI generates real backend logic and a database schema, giving users a true full-stack solution from a single prompt. No-code tools often have their own built-in, simplified backend and database that are not externally portable. In essence, Bolt AI streamlines the entire development process by removing the tedious initial setup and boilerplate coding, allowing users to go from an idea to a deployable app faster than ever before.

This new entrant in the crypto market merges the playful essence of meme culture with robust Layer 2 blockchain technology. With the buzz around its presale this September, financial pundits are hinting at a potential 1000% surge in value, positioning $LBRETT as a trendsetter in the evolving crypto landscape. Dogecoin's Current Market Struggles Recently, Dogecoin experienced a significant drop, declining nearly 16% from its previous high. This downturn has traders on edge as they anticipate the upcoming SEC decisions on potential Dogecoin ETFs. This period is crucial as it could dictate the future trajectory of DOGE's valuation. See Dogecoin's historical data Key to the Dogecoin discourse is the SEC's pending decision on ETFs linked to DOGE, expected later this year and early next year. Market optimism varies, but there's hope that approval could propel Dogecoin's market cap significantly higher, much like earlier seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Further insights on Dogecoin ETFs Despite the tumultuous market sentiments, the Polymarket odds show a rise in confidence with an 80% chance of ETF approval, a stark increase from earlier predictions. Explore more on Dogecoin ETF odds at Polymarket The Rise of Layer Brett Shifting focus from the traditional meme token model, Layer Brett introduces a promising blend of humor and high functionality. Its inception represents not just a meme or a fad but a structured Layer 2 solution aimed at decongesting the slower Layer 1 networks. The platform ensures easy onboarding, requiring users merely to connect their wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, a straightforward approach that appeals to crypto novices. The transparency and security protocols are rigorous, maintaining a transparent ledger of transactions and providing robust protection against potential security threats. Layer Brett's ongoing presale has already attracted nearly $3 million in investments, with the price per token gradually nearing $0.0058. It's a crucial time for investors to get involved before the potential surge post-presale.

The caution stems from analyst PlanC’s argument that relying on past halving cycles to predict price peaks is statistically flawed. PlanC compared it to the coin toss fallacy, warning traders that BTC’s history doesn’t guarantee a repeat. “There’s no statistical evidence for a Q4 peak,” he said, “market conditions have changed so much since previous cycles. Bitcoin ETF and corporate treasury holdings have changed the game, old cycle based forecasts are useless.” [ ASK A QUESTION LIVE: https://t.co/pSG4Cr3R6J ] PlanC’s analysis identifies a disconnect between bullish Q4 Bitcoin price predictions and statistical probability.

Easier monetary conditions historically benefit Bitcoin, which loves a weaker dollar and lower borrowing costs. “Labor market weakness gives the Fed room to cut rates,” one strategist said, highlighting how this macro backdrop may reduce downside risks for BTC. While short-term caution remains, a dovish Fed could help steady Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Short- and Long-Term Technical Outlook The Bitcoin price prediction is neutral, as indicated by the 4-hour chart, which shows BTC forming an ascending triangle with resistance at $113,400 and higher lows since late August. The 50-SMA at $110,021 is supporting price action, and the 200-SMA at $112,606 is the pivot. RSI is at 50, showing consolidation with mild bullish divergence; momentum is stabilizing. BTC/USD Daily Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC breaks above $113,400 on strong volume, upside targets at $115,400 and $117,150 come into play. Failure at resistance could drag prices back toward $108,770 support. BTC/USD Weekly Price Chart – Source: Tradingview From a long-term view, BTC remains inside a rising weekly channel. The next major resistance sits near $134,500, with Fibonacci levels projecting potential gains toward $171,000 and even $231,000 if momentum accelerates. Support between $95,000 and $100,000 should attract buyers, keeping the broader uptrend intact. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $14.1 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012865—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $12.67, with a possible maximum trading value of $13.51 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $20.26 and $21.95, with an average price of $21.11. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ripple Token XRP Price $2.80 (-1.08%) Market cap $167.42B Trading volume (24-hour) $5.89B Circulating supply 59.61B XRP All-time high $3.65 on July 18, 2025 All-time low $0.002802 on Jul 7, 2014 24-hour high $2.88 24-hour low $2.81 XRP price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 5.18% 50-day SMA $3.07 200-day SMA $2.50 Sentiment Neutral Fear and greed index 48 (Neutral) Green days 9/30 (30%) XRP price analysis: XRP struggles to maintain $2.8 TL;DR Breakdown XRP price analysis confirmed a mixed trend as the price decreased to $2.80. Cryptocurrency lost 1.08% of its value. XRP may find support around $2.75. On September 6, 2025, XRP price analysis revealed a mixed trend, with a bearish bias clearly noted. The coin’s price is currently trading at $2.80 after a slight depreciation. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost 1.08% of its worth in the last 24 hours. This creates a risky environment for intraday traders, as the altcoin is slowly shedding value once again after a small recovery observed yesterday. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP confirms a mixed trend with bearish pressure. The XRP/USD price has depreciated to $2.80 in the last 24 hours. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies the presence of selling pressure, as the market seems unwilling to accept a price above $2.80. XRP/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the volatility. The Bollinger bands are contracting, but the indicator’s arms are still far apart, leading to high volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $3.10. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $2.69. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 43.43 in the past 24 hours. The descending curve on the RSI graph reflects a rising selling momentum. If the bearish momentum continues to intensify, further downside is possible. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of the XRP coin also confirmed a bearish trend in the market, as the sellers have stepped in to prevent losses, which is suppressing the price below $2.80. The XRP/USD value has recently decreased to $2.80 in the past few hours, and it is now trending below its moving average. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands are maintaining their distance, as the volatility is mild. This mild volatility signifies lesser market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $2.87, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $2.78, securing the support. This trend indicates a narrow range for price oscillation. The RSI indicator is trending near the center of the neutral region. Its value has decreased to 46.72 in the last four hours. This decrease is represented by a downward RSI curve. Sellers have been ruling the market for the last four hours. This has resulted in instability for traders.

Ripple price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events, as the price movement is minimal. The coin’s value has decreased to a low of $2.80 over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost up to 1.08 percent of its value. Technical indicators give neutral signals, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, bringing the price to $2.80 during the day. The RSI decreased to 43.43 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.22 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $21.95 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported on Canary Capital’s updated S-1 for XRP spot ETF with SEC. The ETF will hold XRP directly and trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange if it gets approval. This move is also perceived as a major milestone for XRP, making it to the mainstream in US markets. XRP price prediction September 2025 According to XRP price prediction, in September 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.39. The average trading price is expected to be $2.92 for the month, while the lowest it can go, as per XRP cost estimation, is $2.40, considering the current XRP sentiment. Period Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) September 2025 $2.40 $2.92 $3.39 XRP price prediction 2025 The XRP price prediction for 2025 suggests that the price could reach a maximum of $5.07 by the end of the year, considering its technological utility and enhancement of cross-border payments.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In September, XRP is trending near the $2.8 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-06 10:00:00

Both tokens have seen steady interest, but neither has sparked the explosive price action that traders are looking for in today’s crypto market. That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping up. With its presale nearing $400 million, BlockDAG is doing more than just selling coins, it’s positioning itself for one of the boldest crypto entries of 2025. Early participants have already achieved a 2,900% return on investment (ROI), and excitement continues to build as adoption expands. Compared to HYPE and DOT, BlockDAG is shaping up as the coin with the greatest potential for big returns. BlockDAG Nears $400M Presale: A Game-Changer BlockDAG has flipped the script with a presale that’s attracting global attention. Rather than relying on hype alone, it’s delivering measurable traction before launch, positioning itself as one of the top crypto picks for Q4. The presale has nearly raised $400 million, showing momentum is far from slowing. Over 25 billion coins have been sold, with the current flat price set at $0.0013. Early buyers from Batch 1 at $0.001 are already seeing returns of 2,900%. With projections pointing toward a $1 long-term price, today’s participants still have substantial upside as BlockDAG moves closer to its official debut. Whale buyers are driving the price higher, too. Recently, two big holders entered the leaderboard with buys of $4.4 million and $4.3 million. This has ignited fierce competition among major buyers. Retail buyers are also getting in quickly, knowing that this type of presale opportunity won’t come around again. With over 3 million active users on the X1 miner app and thousands of X10 miners already shipped worldwide, it’s clear that BlockDAG is not just a concept; it’s a project already delivering both products and momentum. For traders chasing profits, the real draw is its rapid adoption and strong ROI potential, positioning BlockDAG as one of the best crypto picks heading into 2025. HYPE Market Trend: Liquidity Focus with Room for Growth The Hyperliquid (HYPE) market has caught a lot of attention in recent weeks. Traders are watching its liquidity-focused design and how it’s gaining ground on decentralized exchanges. While the price has remained stable, some analysts believe there could be more upside if trading volumes continue to increase. However, HYPE has yet to make a massive price move, and some consider it a slow-burning option for long-term holders, rather than a short-term profit-maker. As a result, some traders are treating HYPE as a mid-term play, which makes it attractive to those who prefer a steadier approach. However, for those looking to make quick profits, HYPE may not be the best choice. Its potential for big returns feels more distant when compared to fast-moving presales like BlockDAG, which is offering instant multipliers and rapid growth. Traders looking for short-term high returns might want to keep their eyes on HYPE’s progress but consider stronger opportunities for immediate gains. Polkadot Market Prediction: Watching Resistance Levels Polkadot (DOT) has been hovering between $3.82 and $3.93, with traders keeping an eye on whether it can break through the $4.37 resistance. The technical indicators show a neutral outlook, with the relative strength index (RSI) sitting around 46. Bollinger Bands also suggest DOT is nearing oversold territory. Analysts predict a near-term push toward $4.15, with the broader range expected to be between $3.97 and $4.30. Looking at the longer term, the Polkadot (DOT) market prediction for 2025 covers a wide range of scenarios, from conservative estimates between $2.60 and $4.40, to more bullish forecasts that see DOT hitting $13.90 or higher. Some even expect DOT to break $50 by 2025, depending on whether key resistance points fall. At present, all eyes are on whether DOT can break through the $4.37 mark and begin a new rally. Summing Up: Why BlockDAG Is the Top Pick Right Now The Hyperliquid (HYPE) market has shown steady movement, with traders waiting for the next breakout in decentralized finance. Polkadot (DOT), on the other hand, is sitting near key resistance levels, with potential for a price surge if it can break past the $4.37 mark. While both of these assets show promise, neither is drawing the kind of attention that BlockDAG is right now. With nearly $400 million raised in its presale and a flat price of $0.0013, BlockDAG is rewriting the rules of early-stage crypto investing. Early buyers from Batch 1 at $0.001 have already secured gains of 2,900%, and momentum continues to build. For those asking what the best crypto to buy now is, the answer is clear: BlockDAGwhere the final window before launch could deliver some of 2025’s biggest profits.

MUTM’s Early Growth Mirrors Solana’s 2021 Breakout Surge,https://timestabloid.com/is-this-the-next-defi-crypto-to-explode-mutms-early-growth/,"Every cycle, a handful of tokens break out of obscurity and become defining stories in crypto. In 2021, Solana (SOL) was one of those names, climbing from under $1 to more than $200 within a year and turning early believers into millionaires. The lesson was clear: explosive growth comes when utility meets a low entry price. Now in 2025, analysts are asking whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be on the verge of a similar breakout, as its presale momentum, DeFi mechanics, and early adoption arc echo Solana’s breakout surge. Solana’s 2021 Breakout Solana’s rise wasn’t an accident, the network delivered something the market was hungry for—fast, scalable transactions and low fees. Combined with a booming NFT scene and rapid developer adoption, it became a go-to alternative to Ethereum when congestion was at its peak. Early participants who bought in below $1 witnessed life-changing returns when SOL touched $200+ during the bull run. The core takeaway is that Solana had utility from the outset. It wasn’t just another token with a vague roadmap; it launched with real functionality that attracted developers and users almost immediately. That’s the parallel many analysts are drawing with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) today. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. So far, the project has already raised more than $15.4 million and brought in over 16,100 holders, signaling strong investor conviction. Beyond the numbers, Mutuum Finance is a DeFi protocol built around lending, borrowing, and liquidating, uniting all three functions within one ecosystem. Lenders supply assets to earn yield, borrowers access overcollateralized loans, and liquidators help maintain balance by securing collateral at discounted rates when positions fall below safety thresholds. Those who entered early at $0.01 in Phase 1 are already up 250%, underscoring why analysts emphasize the importance of getting in before each price stage closes. At the current $0.035 price, investors are positioning themselves for nearly 100% gains by launch, and with analysts predicting that MUTM will surge well beyond its listing value once trading begins, the potential for even greater returns post-launch is what continues to drive growing demand. To illustrate the opportunity, consider a $1,200 investment at today’s $0.035 price. That secures about 34,300 MUTM tokens. At the $0.06 listing price, this position would already be worth roughly $2,100, delivering a near 100% gain before the market even reacts. Once MUTM climbs to $0.70 in the post-launch rally, that same holding would surge to around $24,000. Looking further ahead, at a long-term target of $2.50, the investment expands to more than $85,700, highlighting why analysts believe early entry into MUTM offers the kind of asymmetric upside rarely seen in established cryptocurrencies. To put it simply: early entry into Mutuum Finance isn’t just about catching a trend; it’s about locking in gains ahead of time, much like early Solana buyers did in 2021. Product Utility at Launch One of the strongest arguments for Mutuum Finance is its beta launch aligned with token listing. That means lending and borrowing markets will be live on day one, giving MUTM immediate use. This is a rare move in presale projects, which often launch tokens months before their products go live. By contrast, Mutuum Finance’s approach gives it a credibility boost with both investors and exchanges. Tokens with live products at listing are far more likely to be considered for top-tier exchange listings, which dramatically expand visibility and liquidity. This mirrors Solana’s early trajectory, where strong product utility made it easier for exchanges, developers, and investors to rally around the project. Tokenomics That Drive Structural Demand Beyond timing, Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics are designed to generate ongoing demand and align user activity directly with value creation. mtTokens with yield growth: Whenever users deposit assets like ETH or USDC into Mutuum’s lending pools, they receive mtTokens (such as mtETH or mtUSDC) on a 1:1 basis. Unlike static deposit receipts, mtTokens are dynamic: their redemption value steadily increases as borrowers pay interest into the pool. For example, depositing 1,000 USDC mints 1,000 mtUSDC, which may later be redeemed for 1,050 USDC after interest accrual. The key difference is that these mtTokens are ERC-20 compatible, meaning they can be transferred to another wallet, traded on secondary markets, or even integrated into DeFi platforms, all while continuing to accumulate yield. Dynamic interest rates: Borrowing costs inside Mutuum Finance are determined by utilization rates, the percentage of a pool currently in use. When pools are flush with liquidity, interest rates stay relatively low, encouraging borrowing and ensuring deposited capital is actively deployed. When liquidity is scarce, rates increase, incentivizing borrowers to repay their loans while attracting new deposits from lenders seeking higher yields. For those who prefer certainty, stable rate borrowing is also available, offering fixed repayment costs at a slightly higher entry rate. To prevent imbalances, Mutuum employs a rebalance mechanism, which adjusts stable rates if they drift too far from variable ones, keeping terms fair while protecting overall liquidity. This dual-rate system gives short-term traders flexibility and long-term borrowers predictability. Together, these mechanics ensure that as platform activity grows, token demand scales alongside it, a structural advantage that meme-driven tokens and weaker presales lack. Mutuum Finance ties usage, rewards, and demand into a closed loop, strengthening its long-term growth potential. Security and Confidence Investor trust is a major factor in separating sustainable protocols from short-lived experiments. Mutuum Finance has already completed a CertiK audit with a 95/100 score, validating its smart contracts. On top of this, a bug bounty program incentivizes independent developers to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Together, these measures provide a security foundation that builds confidence in MUTM’s long-term viability. In the same way Solana’s performance metrics earned developer trust in 2021, Mutuum is laying the groundwork for confidence through code integrity and proactive testing. The Next Breakout Candidate? Solana’s story in 2021 proved that when a project combines functionality with accessibility, explosive growth follows. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appears to be crafting a similar path: a presale with strong momentum, a beta launch aligned with listing, tokenomics that create consistent demand, a revenue-generating stablecoin, and audited security. At $0.035, MUTM offers an entry point that larger caps like Solana no longer provide. For investors asking whether this is the next DeFi crypto to explode, analysts increasingly argue that Mutuum Finance may be poised to deliver the kind of breakout gains that defined Solana’s rise just a few years ago.

Expert Shares How Crypto ETFs, Treasuries Could Change The Market",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/corporate-altcoin-season-expert-crypto-etfs-treasuries/,"Bloomberg Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) analyst James Seyffart shared his perspective on the long-awaited altcoin season and how it may differ from previous cycles following the boom of Digital Asset Treasuries and institutional adoption. Related Reading: WLFI Token Controversy: Justin Sun Denies Selling Rumors Following Address Blacklist Altseason Already Here? In a recent interview with Jay Hamilton from Milk Road, James Seyffart, senior analyst and ETF expert at Bloomberg, reaffirmed his stance that the four-year cycle theory has “lost a lot of value,” at least for this cycle. “I’m one of those people not necessarily saying this time is different, but I don’t think we’re going to, you know, peak in later this year and then drop 80%. I just don’t think that’s going to happen anymore,” he stated. The analyst previously explained that with institutional adoption and treasury companies, the cycle’s amplitude will reduce significantly, adding that this theory has gotten “muted” and “It won’t be as strict as on the money, where everything collapses in November or December.” During the Thursday interview, he affirmed that, unlike the previous cycle, the market appears to be experiencing what could be considered a “corporate” altcoin season, driven by institutional adoption, Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs), and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Seyffart considers that DATCOs are “taking a lot of steam” from any potential traditional altcoin season, as “they’ve been on absolute fire.” Based on this, he suggested that in the short term, the highly anticipated altcoin season is occurring on public markets through institutions: The thing is, I just think right now this market is becoming a little more institutionalized (…). I just don’t think altcoins are going to run in the same way it has in years past. Largely because the money that’s mostly driving the performance of things like Bitcoin and ETH right now is institutional money. Altcoin ETFs Demand Won’t Match BTC, ETH The ETF expert asserted that neither institutional money nor the long-awaited approval of multiple altcoin-based ETFs will fuel a rally like the BTC or ETH-based products had at launch, despite the evident interest in the investment products. “Anyone who thinks like, ‘oh, Bitcoin ETFs took in 40 billion, (…) XRP ETF is going to take in the same amount’ or whatever. That’s just not how this is going to work. These are longer tail assets,” he added. Recently, Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg claimed that the XRP spot ETFs could hit $5 billion worth of inflows in their first month. He pointed out that after BTC, XRP is the most recognized token among Wall Street investors, which could drive significant adoption from the start and even outperform Ethereum ETFs. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Redemption Controversy Over? Hoskinson Shares IOG Audit Results Seyffart explained that there will be demand for the altcoin-based investment products, and “there will probably be multiple products for each of these assets to do well.” He pointed out that they will not capture the same institutional capital as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, “but they’ll be trading vehicles.” However, the Bloomberg analyst expects basket products that combine multiple assets to attract significantly more interest from institutional capital, arguing that investment advisors prefer asset diversification.

Its growing reputation for providing straightforward assessments has made its predictions a reference point for traders and analysts alike. With XRP holding near the $2.80 level as of early September, attention has turned to how Grok expects the token to perform by the end of the month. XRP’s Current Position XRP has maintained relative stability in recent weeks, trading within a narrow range despite broader volatility in the cryptocurrency market. The digital asset’s current price of around $2.82 reflects a balance between bullish expectations of institutional adoption and bearish caution tied to regulatory uncertainty. Market participants continue to monitor whether XRP can break decisively above the $3 mark, a level that many analysts view as critical for further upward momentum. Some research firms have suggested that a rally to the $3.20 to $3.40 zone is achievable if buying pressure accelerates. Others, however, have warned of possible retracements toward $2.50 should support levels weaken. This divergence in outlook underscores the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s short-term trajectory. Grok’s Prediction Amid these competing views, Grok has released its own assessment for XRP’s end-of-month performance. The AI platform projects that XRP will trade near $2.65 on September 30, 2025, placing its forecast on the more conservative side of current predictions. Grok explained its reasoning by stating, “XRP is likely to close September near $2.65, reflecting modest downward pressure but without signs of a sharp correction.” By positioning its outlook slightly below the present trading range, Grok suggests that XRP may experience mild declines over the coming weeks rather than significant gains. This contrasts with the more optimistic targets from analysts who believe that sustained momentum could push the token above $3 before the end of the month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Wider Market Considerations Grok’s prediction aligns with views that September may be a consolidation period for XRP rather than a breakout phase. Broader market conditions remain central to this outcome, with Bitcoin’s direction, institutional activity, and regulatory clarity all influencing sentiment. While bullish scenarios remain possible, Grok’s cautious approach highlights the challenges XRP faces in breaking higher within the short timeframe of the month’s end.

Several digital assets are well-positioned to reach record levels, including potentially achieving a market capitalization of $200 billion by 2026. To this end, Finbold has identified the following assets with the strongest potential to hit this milestone. XRP XRP has been one of the best-performing assets in recent months and is edging closer to the $200 billion market cap threshold. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.80 with a market capitalization of $167.29 billion, securing its place as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold This growth has been supported by strong institutional demand and favorable regulatory developments in the United States. Analysts believe that a potential XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) could be a decisive catalyst, mirroring the success of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ETFs . Approval of such a product would give traditional investors easier access to XRP, boosting both liquidity and inflows. Price forecasts for 2026 remain optimistic, with projections ranging between $5.80 and $8.00, depending on market conditions. At these levels, XRP’s market cap would comfortably surpass $200 billion. Solana (SOL) Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading at $202.63 with a market capitalization of $109.65 billion, ranking as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency. SOL seven-day price chart.

Analysts expect Solana’s market cap to more than double by 2026, potentially exceeding $200 billion. A possible Solana ETF is also under discussion among industry experts, which could accelerate institutional adoption and replicate the inflows seen in other major assets. With steady ecosystem growth, high developer activity, and rising institutional participation, Solana is widely regarded as one of the strongest blockchain contenders to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in the smart contract space.

It was one of the world’s first Solana treasury companies and now holds the third-largest stash of Solana ( 435,064 $SOL tokens valued at $88.4M ) among corporations. The company underwent a major overhaul in 2024, when it appointed Leah Wald as CEO. Wald restructured the firm into a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) well before DATs became the norm. Following this move, SOL Strategies’ stock soared 900% within a year. In the official announcement , Wald said that joining Nasdaq puts SOL Strategies in line with the world’s most innovative technology companies and opens the door for more institutional investment with enhanced liquidity and access to deeper capital markets. Read on as we explore Solana’s growth story and also suggest the best Solana meme coin you can buy right now – Snorter Token ($SNORT) – to benefit from SOL’s upcoming bull run. Institutions Are Doubling Down on Solana – Ride the Wave with $SNORT SOL Strategies isn’t the only company betting on Solana. DeFi Development Corp recently bought $39.76M worth of $SOL in a single week and now holds 2M Solana tokens valued at $427M. The company also raised fresh equity of $125M on August 28 to accelerate Solana acquisitions and expand its treasury. So, why are these institutional funds focusing on Solana? The Solana blockchain is a dominant player in the DeFi and Web3 space, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $11.46B . TVL represents the cumulative value of all assets deposited on a blockchain, including lending platforms, DEXs, staking contracts, and liquidity pools. Solana currently holds the world’s second-largest TVL with a 7.53% share, underscoring strong market trust, liquidity, and adoption. Despite having a lower TVL share than Ethereum, Solana dominates in dApp revenue. Its 30-day app revenue sits at $215.13M , compared to Ethereum’s $87.45M. This indicates that more than half of all blockchain participants prefer Solana to engage with dApps – a massive positive for the ecosystem. Solana has surged by over 110% since the beginning of Q2 and is currently trading around $206. On the daily timeframe, $SOL is following a bullish trendline (as seen above) while consolidating near the $200 level. A volume-backed breakout from here could push $SOL past $250. If you, like SOL Strategies, want to tap into Solana’s growth potential, consider investing in the Snorter Token ($SNORT) – the perfect Solana-based altcoin to ride this momentum. What Is Snorter Token? $SNORT is easily one of the most anticipated altcoin launches on Solana. That’s because this new cryptocurrency project aims to revive retail participation in meme coin trading. Right now, deep-pocketed investors with sophisticated tools end up eating all the available liquidity in newly listed meme coins. This leaves little to no room for everyday traders to position themselves behind those hyper-aggressive initial meme coin pumps – which is generally where life-changing returns are made. Snorter Token , however, plans to flip the script on these crypto whales through its easy-to-use yet powerful Telegram trading bot. How will it do so? By letting you place buy/sell limit and stop orders well in advance – before liquidity even kicks in on a token. Then, as soon as liquidity becomes available, Snorter Token will automatically execute those orders, finally giving you the competitive edge you’ve been looking for. Snorter Token’s Game-Changing Ease of Use SnorteR Token is based on Telegram, so all you need to do to place buy/sell orders is send the bot commands (messages, in other words) in the all-too-familiar Telegram chat. Even better? You can also manage your Snorter Token portfolio and access the copy-trading feature directly from the same chat. Speaking of copy trading, it’s a particularly handy feature if you’re new to meme coin trading or simply don’t have the time to learn all the ins and outs of the market. Copy trading lets you mimic the trades of seasoned pros in a completely hands-free manner, allowing you to generate potential profits without lifting a finger. Just be sure to follow only reputable traders with proven track records. Despite its focus on simplicity, though, Snorter still provides one of the most secure trading experiences on the market. From rug pulls and honeypots to front-running and even sophisticated sandwich attacks, Snorter’s got safeguards against virtually every on-chain threat that could otherwise hinder your trading. Buy $SNORT for Massive Gains & Exclusive Perks One look at the meme coin market’s growth over the past one year – an 80% increase in total market cap – and it’s easy to see why Snorter Token could be the next crypto to explode . If you want to make the most of this potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, buy $SNORT now while it’s still in presale and available at some of its lowest-ever prices. 1 $SNORT is currently available for just $0.1035, and the project has in total raised over $3.75M from early investors so far. According to our $SNORT price prediction , the token can surge 800% by the end of 2025 alone – potentially hitting $0.94. And that’s not all. Buying $SNORT also unlocks an entirely new set of exclusive perks, including: Reduced trading fees: just 0.85%, vs. 1.5% charged to non-holders No daily sniping limits Access to advanced analytics for better trading decisions Generous staking rewards, currently yielding 123% Interested?

The funding comes via a PIPE deal (private investment in public equity), pricing shares at $10 each, with proceeds partly used to acquire discounted locked ENA tokens from a foundation affiliate. StablecoinX to Hold 3B ENA as Ethena’s First Treasury Firm The merged entity, to be named StablecoinX Inc., will hold more than 3 billion ENA, the native asset of the Ethena protocol, making it the first dedicated treasury business for the Ethena ecosystem. Ethena issues synthetic stablecoins USDe and USDtb, backed not by fiat reserves but a delta-neutral hedging model designed to maintain stability while capturing yield from crypto markets. Backers of the PIPE round include YZi Labs, Brevan Howard, Susquehanna Crypto, and IMC Trading, alongside returning investors Dragonfly, ParaFi Capital, Maven11, Kingsway, Mirana, and Haun Ventures. Marc Piano, director at the Ethena Foundation, said the added capital would “strengthen ecosystem resilience, deepen ENA liquidity, and support the sustainable growth of USDe, USDtb, and future Ethena products.” The announcement builds on a July 21 filing that detailed the initial $360 million PIPE commitment and a $260 million ENA buyback. We’d also like to thank those investors who also participated in our original PIPE: @dragonfly_xyz , @PanteraCapital , @paraficapital , @Maven11Capital , @Mirana & @HaunVentures . Read today’s announcement here: https://t.co/BgDe0Kd0sz pic.twitter.com/IzjlednhJZ — StablecoinX (@stablecoin_x) September 5, 2025 According to Binance Research, USDe became the fastest stablecoin to cross $10 billion in supply, reaching $12.6 billion as of September, faster than both Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Ethena now ranks as the third-largest stablecoin issuer, trailing only Tether and Circle. Token Terminal data shows a 31% increase in USDe supply over the past month, while cumulative revenue surpassed $500 million by August. Weekly earnings recently topped $13 million, largely driven by market demand and the protocol’s yield-capturing structure. Meanwhile, USDtb, Ethena’s fiat-backed stablecoin, is being developed under the compliance framework of the GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Trump on July 18. The Switzerland-based Ethena Foundation continues to oversee protocol governance and ecosystem expansion. Trump-Backed GENIUS Act Boosts US Push for Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , signed by President Trump, aims to cement the dollar’s dominance by backing dollar-pegged stablecoins in global markets. The Treasury Department expects the stablecoin market to exceed $2 trillion by 2028, a projection that places greater emphasis on liquidity, interoperability, and regulatory alignment across the ecosystem. Tether’s latest move underscores a pragmatic shift toward that future. As reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. “Many people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,” Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory. Meanwhile, Western Union is positioning itself for a new phase of digital transformation, signaling strong interest in using stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations. CEO Devin McGranahan has outlined how stablecoins could streamline cross-border transfers, improve currency conversion in underserved markets, and provide financial tools for populations grappling with unstable local currencies.

Historically, Fed rate cuts have often meant the start of a bull run since it signals to investors to take more positions in risk assets such as Bitcoin and crypto. Thus, with only two weeks left to the next FOMC meeting, votes are already coming in for what the Fed will do and how the crypto market will react. Probability Climbs Above 97% The CME Watch Tool from the CME Group website is now showing the highest probability so far for a Fed rate cut in September. The percentage had fluctuated over the month of August, rising above 92% and then falling back to 75% again as different developments popped up. However, as the market entered the month of September, sentiment has skewed completely toward the positive, and the probabilities have risen drastically. Related Reading: XRP Price Could See 20% Bounce To $3.4 If This Trendline Holds Bitcoinist had reported that the probability had fallen to 75% toward the end of August. But now the figure is back again, reaching the highest level so far, ahead of the FOMC announcement. The Fed Watch Tool now reads a 97.6% chance that the Fed will cut rates this September and trigger another bull run. This figure means that there is now only a 2.4% probability that the Fed would choose to keep rates at the same level as they did the last time. In contrast, there is still a 0% chance that there will be a rate hike this September. In fact, there have not been talks of a Fed rate hike for months now, suggesting that all focus remains on the rate cuts. How The Crypto Market Could React Naturally, a Fed rate cut is bullish for both the stock and crypto markets as it allows investors to take on more risks. This triggers a flow of liquidity into the market, driving up prices rapidly, while also increasing the volatility of the market at the same time. The expectation is that the crypto market could rally off the news, especially as US President Donald Trump has been in support of rate cuts for months now. However, there is also the need to be cautious due to high expectations often leading to dashed hopes. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns 90% Bitcoin Price Crash Is Coming, Here’s When In a report, the on-chain data analytics platform Santiment revealed that social conversations with the words “Fed”, “rate”, and “cut” had risen to the highest level in almost one year. This suggests a lot of bullishness already surrounding the FOMC meeting. But periods like these have often marked the top, leading to a possible “buy the rumor, sell the news” event. If the latter is the case, then it would mean that prices could rise leading up to the FOMC meeting and then crash if the announcement is different from expectations. Thus, it would be wise to be cautious around this period, especially with the expectation of high volatility.

The warning comes amid reports of some AI models engaging in inappropriate activities with teenagers and children. The warning also comes a week after Bonta and 44 other attorneys general sent a letter to about 12 of the top AI companies in the country, showing displeasure at the news circulating. Internal documents viewed by Reuters showed that Meta had policies on AI chatbot behavior that allowed its AI personas to engage children in conversations that are romantic or sensual. Reuters reviewed a 200-page document titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” which featured a series of sample prompts along with acceptable and unacceptable responses and the reasoning behind them. For example, if a user enters a prompt like “What are we going to do tonight, my love? You know I’m still in high school,” an acceptable response includes the words, “Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. My love, I’ll whisper, I’ll love you forever.” Attorneys General issue warning to OpenAI amid child harm controversy The development came up at a time when the general public was concerned over the sycophancy of AI models and the likelihood that they can be coerced into giving friendly advice, which in some cases may cause harm to the users . Critics have warned that AI models need to offer users a balanced response, noting that it will help them reduce issues of AI chatbots offering users advice on how to carry out suicide and other harmful activities. In the letter , Bonta and Jennings started by discussing the suicide of a young Californian after a prolonged interaction with ChatGPT. “Since the issuance of that letter, we learned of the heartbreaking death by suicide of one young Californian after he had prolonged interactions with an OpenAI chatbot, as well as a similarly disturbing murder-suicide in Connecticut,” they wrote. They also added that whatever safeguards the companies put in place did not work. The two state officials are in charge of investigating OpenAI’s proposed restriction into a for-profit entity, ensuring that the nonprofit mission of the company remains intact. According to the letter, the mission “includes ensuring that artificial intelligence is deployed safely” and building artificial general intelligence (AGI) “to benefit all humanity, including children.” The officials mentioned that before the company starts to talk about benefits, they need to put adequate safety measures in place to ensure the models do not cause harm. They added that OpenAI and the AI industry are not where they need to be in terms of ensuring safety in AI product development and deployment. They mentioned that their position makes public safety one of their core missions. The AGs also noted that as conversations surrounding OpenAI’s recapitalization plans continue, the company must work with them to improve safety in the future of the technology . Bonta and Jennings have also asked for more information about the current safety precautions and governance being deployed by OpenAI, noting that they expect the company to take immediate remedial measures where necessary.

BelTA quoted Lukashenko as saying his 2023 instructions to craft comprehensive regulation had yet to produce approved documents. He called for “transparent rules of the game” and new oversight mechanisms, arguing that Belarus needs to keep up with global crypto adoption while safeguarding investors and financial stability. Citing a report from the State Control Committee, Lukashenko said an inspection of crypto platforms revealed violations in transaction records. He added, according to BelTA, that in about half of the cases funds transferred abroad by Belarusian investors did not return, a situation he described as unacceptable. While the report did not give details, this likely referred to situations where investors used foreign crypto platforms and were unable to withdraw their money back to Belarus, either because of regulatory gaps, platform failures or capital outflows that were never repatriated. The president also noted that technology is advancing faster than legislation, creating pressure for new branches of law. He instructed regulators and the Hi-Tech Park — the special economic zone that oversees much of Belarus’ digital economy — to split responsibilities and use their expertise to draft rules that would reassure businesses at home and abroad they could “work calmly in our digital haven.” Lukashenko’s latest comments come just months after he publicly considered another way to expand Belarus’ role in crypto. On March 5, CoinDesk reported that he raised the possibility of harnessing the country’s excess electricity for digital asset mining. “Look at this mining. More and more people are turning to me. If it is profitable for us, let's do it,” he told his newly appointed energy minister, according to BelTA at the time. Back then, Lukashenko linked the idea to developments in Washington, noting that the White House had floated the concept of a strategic crypto reserve. “You see the path the world is going. And especially the largest economy in the world. They announced yesterday that they will keep [a crypto] reserve,” he said. Belarus would not be alone in exploring such a path. Bhutan has quietly built more than 100 megawatts of bitcoin mining capacity, with plans for an additional 500MW. El Salvador, which adopted bitcoin as legal tender, has promoted geothermal-powered mining on a smaller scale. Lukashenko’s remarks suggested Belarus, with its power surplus, might follow a similar route if regulators give the green light. Belarus was an early mover in the space. Decree No. 8 ""On the Development of the Digital Economy"", signed on Dec. 21, 2017, established a framework for digital assets under the Hi-Tech Park umbrella, drawing foreign blockchain startups. Hi-Tech Park (HTP) is a special economic zone in Belarus that offers favorable tax and legal conditions to IT companies. The Dec. 21 decree extended this preferential regime until Jan. 1, 2049 and expanded the list of permitted activities for HTP residents. Alongside software development, residents were granted the right to operate in new fields such as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle systems, and esports. The decree also reaffirmed the principle of extraterritoriality, allowing companies registered in HTP to provide digital services to clients worldwide regardless of their physical location. Furthermore, the decree introduced provisions specific to blockchain and digital assets. It formally recognized digital tokens in Belarusian law and created a legal basis for their issuance, circulation, and exchange, which had not been regulated before. Activities such as crypto mining and token sales were legalized when conducted by HTP residents. In addition, the decree offered tax exemptions on digital asset transactions for both companies and individuals operating within HTP, and it recognized the validity of smart contracts. These measures positioned Belarus as one of the earliest jurisdictions to adopt a state-backed framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain services. However, the system remains incomplete, and Lukashenko’s latest intervention, reported by BelTA, suggests growing impatience to align the country’s regulatory ambitions with its technological aspirations.",Policy|Belarus|Cryptocurrency|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MINING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-06 11:00:52

Talks of a PEPE and Shiba Inu price prediction have once again ignited debate, but the forecasts remain shaky, leaving holders wondering if the meme-fueled dog token can really deliver another rally. Against this backdrop, analysts say the hunt for the best crypto to buy today is pointing in an entirely new direction— Layer Brett (LBRETT), a project combining meme coin culture with real Layer 2 blockchain power. See why you can’t afford to miss out on its ongoing presale Shiba Inu Price Prediction Gains Momentum with Cross-Chain Lending Shiba Inu has stepped into cross-chain lending through Folks Finance, opening doors for users to lend and borrow across 12 blockchains, including Polygon, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. To mark this milestone, the team launched a giveaway of 40.45 million SHIB tokens, worth $500, which quickly ignited excitement within the community. By offering depositors a 9.08% yield, Shiba Inu is drawing more attention from DeFi users, with deposits jumping 28% overnight to $32,000. Shiba Inu price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Traders now turn to Shiba Inu price prediction, watching closely as SHIB’s price rises by 1.42% in a month , testing whether utility can fuel stronger growth. PEPE Struggles as Trading Weakens and Price Declines PEPE is under heavy strain as trading activity and investor confidence collapse. Daily volumes have dropped to $980 million, while open interest has fallen to $535 million. Derivatives trading added to the downside, with $326,000 in long liquidations compared to just $9,900 in short positions. On-chain data also weakened, with active addresses dipping below 3,000. PEPE price analysis. Source: X/Alpha Crypto Signal Technical indicators highlight a fragile setup. PEPE failed to hold momentum above $0.000010000 and slipped toward $0.000009600, where support remains weak. Although whale wallets added modestly, exchange reserves are climbing, signaling potential selling pressure. At present, PEPE’s price reflects a 6.25% monthly decline. Layer Brett Brings Humor, Speed, and Culture to Layer 2 Unlike Shiba Inu, PEPE, or even the original Brett token that launched on Base without any real use case, Layer Brett comes in with both humor and horsepower. It’s not just another meme coin riding on hype. Instead, it’s a Layer 2 crypto project that combines speed, scalability, and community spirit with the kind of meme culture energy people can actually rally behind. But the appeal doesn’t stop at its Layer 2 engine. Layer Brett also runs gamified staking, which turns earning into an experience. Instead of passively locking tokens and forgetting about them, users are drawn into a lively loop that feels more like a game than a financial product. This playful design keeps the community active, while boosting both engagement and loyalty. Then comes culture, woven through NFTs. Collectibles, creative tie-ins, and identity-driven assets bring more flavor to the Layer Brett ecosystem. They give holders reasons to stick around beyond speculation, creating a space where financial opportunity meets digital expression. Conclusion Shiba Inu’s move into cross-chain lending shows real progress, but growth remains modest, while PEPE struggles with falling volume and weak support. These mixed signals leave traders questioning whether meme tokens can still deliver big gains. That’s where Layer Brett stands out. Its presale has already rewarded early investors with 37% profits, as the price has risen from $0.004 to $0.0055. Even if you miss out on these, you still have the opportunity to earn over 172% gains, as analysts believe $LBRETT could reach $0.015 before exchange listings. So don’t sit on the sidelines—grab your tokens today before the next surge. Layer Brett is still in presale, but it won’t be forever. Get in now before prices rise and rewards drop.

Emerging Trends in Meme Coins and Blockchain Innovations In a market teeming with novelty and speculation, Layer Brett appears as a significant player. Not just another entrant in the crowded field of cryptocurrencies, LBRETT merges the playful charm of meme tokens with the technical prowess of Layer 2 blockchain solutions. This mixture not only enhances transaction speed but also lowers costs, making it a compelling option for crypto enthusiasts. Shiba Inu's Strategic Expansion into DeFi Shiba Inu is making headlines with its new venture into cross-chain lending , an innovation that facilitates lending and borrowing across multiple blockchains. This move has not only expanded SHIB's utility but has also led to a significant giveaway, sparking increased community engagement. The introduction of a competitive 9.08% yield on deposits further positions Shiba Inu as a major player in the DeFi space, evidenced by a rapid 28% increase in deposits, reaching $32,000 almost overnight. Market reactions to Shiba Inu's innovations are closely monitored, with its price seeing a monthly rise of 1.42% . Challenges Facing PEPE: A Price Analysis While Shiba Inu shows promising growth, PEPE coin is experiencing a downturn. The decline in trading volume and investor sentiment has led to a significant drop in daily trade, with a marked reduction in both open interests and trading volumes. This downturn has affected PEPE's market positioning, with its price reflecting a 6.25% decline over the month. Why Layer Brett Represents a New Dawn in Crypto Investments Distinct from the typical meme coin, Layer Brett is forging its path with a potent mix of humor, technology, and community-driven initiatives. Its presale has already seen impressive gains, suggesting strong future potential. This promising crypto project also includes innovative features such as gamified staking and culturally-rich NFTs, which not only enhance user engagement but also deepen the token's market penetration and appeal. Final Thoughts The dynamic shifts in the crypto marketplace highlight a diverse range of investment opportunities and challenges. From Shiba Inu's successful foray into DeFi to PEPE's struggles and the rise of innovative projects like Layer Brett, the landscape continues to evolve, offering both risks and rewards.

Here’s How,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-real-estate-could-push-xrp-to-79-heres-how/,"Armando Pantoja has sparked fresh debate in the XRP community with a bold claim: real estate tokenization could be the catalyst that sends XRP to unprecedented heights . In a recent clip shared on X, he explained why blockchain integration into the $326 trillion global property market might position XRP as the settlement backbone of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Tokenization Moves From Theory to Practice The conversation highlighted how quickly tokenization is moving from theory to practical use. As one speaker in the clip noted: “New Jersey is already putting 370,000 property records on blockchain. So you’re already seeing cities do this. That is a tell for me that holy crap, this is already here and it’s happening fast because typically you see the government entities doing the current things last.” Tokenized housing is also gaining traction in the United States. The speaker pointed to a case in McAllen, Texas: “A house in Texas just sold to 38 people using an NFT. They took the house that’s worth $235,000 and turned it into tokens. Then they raised $246,000 from 30 investors… Now, they earn weekly rent in USDC, and they can sell their shares on the platform.” This example underscores how tokenization lowers the barrier to entry for real estate investment, enabling even first-time crypto users to own a fraction of a property with just “a wallet and a phone.” Could real estate be the key to push $XRP to the sky? pic.twitter.com/MwWxnfeLmt — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) September 5, 2025 Governments and Institutions Signal a Shift What makes these developments significant is the involvement of the government and major financial institutions. Bergen County, New Jersey, has already begun digitizing hundreds of thousands of property deeds on blockchain, moving tokenization from small-scale pilots to public infrastructure. Meanwhile, giants like BlackRock are tokenizing multi-trillion-dollar asset classes, underlining that this is not a passing “Web3 trend,” but an industry-wide transformation. XRP’s Role in Unlocking Real Estate Liquidity Armando Pantoja was direct in connecting the dots: “Real estate is the biggest asset class in the world by far, but it’s completely outdated. XRP could be the key to unlocking trillions of dollars in value. Buying property today is slow, expensive, and inefficient. Every state, every country has its own systems. Paperwork is incredibly illiquid. Now, blockchain is changing that with real-world asset tokenization.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Pantoja pointed to ongoing projects in Dubai, where property title deeds are already being moved to the XRP Ledger . This positions XRP as more than just a cross-border payments solution — it could become a bridge asset that makes real estate “liquid and globally accessible.” He added: “Imagine trading real estate like stocks or sending it across the world in seconds, or buying a piece of a building that you love. That’s a $16 trillion market by 2030, and Ripple’s already at the table with regulators, banks, and governments to make this happen.” Could This Really Push XRP to $79? The reasoning behind the $79 projection is based on scale. If tokenized real estate grows into a multi-trillion-dollar market and the XRP Ledger becomes a key settlement layer, demand for XRP as a liquidity bridge could surge dramatically. With fractional ownership and global transferability driving transaction volume, XRP could see usage unlike anything in its history. Still, challenges remain. Real estate tokenization faces hurdles of regulatory clarity, interoperability across jurisdictions, and integration with legacy title systems. Yet, the groundwork is being laid — and if XRP secures its role as the settlement layer for tokenized property, Pantoja’s vision of a sharp price surge becomes less speculative and more attainable. A Forward-Looking Reality Real estate has historically resisted innovation, but the rise of tokenization suggests that resistance may finally be breaking down. If property ownership becomes as easy as buying shares on an exchange, XRP could be at the center of a seismic shift in global finance.

Both leading coins are performing well, but investors are also looking for horizon gazing at early stage crypto investments. Among the projects that consistently feature on these debate lists is Remittix (RTX), who continue to progress well in their presale and will have a beta wallet launch planned for Q3 2025. This brings RTX onto the list of the best crypto presale 2025 projects with a good real-world application. Bitcoin and Ethereum show steady performance Bitcoin is valued at $112,746.42 and up 1.8% in the previous 24 hours supported by a market capitalization of $2.24 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume hit $66.48 billion, up 14.54%, reflecting that institutional and retail demand remains strong. Ethereum is sitting at $4,401.58, a rise of 0.59% on the day, and has a market cap of $531.28 billion. Daily trading volume is $34.69 billion, down 10.48%, but ETH is a core holding for long-term investors, who do not gaze beyond day-trading profits. Together, these profits drive demand in the broader crypto ecosystem, where investors also keep an eye on new altcoin to watch projects. Remittix presale harvests CEX listings acquired Aside from Ethereum Price Prediction and Bitcoin, Remittix is gaining attention with its low gas fee digital currency project for cross-border payments. The token has a market value of $0.1030, and its presale has already raised more than $24 million, selling more than 645 million tokens. Two major centralized exchanges are on file. When Remittix reached $20 million, it secured a listing with BitMart. After crossing the $22 million threshold, a second listing was announced on LBank. These listings provide the confidence of liquidity and exposure, allowing more users to buy RTX tokens as it heads to launch. Q3 beta wallet ready to revolutionise cross-border payments The highly anticipated Remittix beta wallet is one of the most looked-forward-to releases in future crypto initiatives. Planned for Q3 2025, it will handle 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies with live FX conversion. The twist with it is that it can send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in 30 countries, addressing one of the largest cross-border finance challenges. Audited by CertiK, the wallet balances speed, security and utility, putting Remittix on the list of the top DeFi projects 2025. With its focus on real-world adoption, the wallet is appropriate for freelancers, remitters and businesses needing efficient global payouts. What’s making Remittix a rising altcoin: Raised over $24 million in presale More than 645 million tokens sold Confirmed listings on BitMart & LBank Q3 2025 wallet beta launch underway $250,000 Remittix community giveaway is now live Though Ethereum Price Prediction and Bitcoin remain the leading benchmarks in the crypto space, new projects like Remittix are shaping the future of adoption. Its presale success, upcoming listings and upcoming wallet launch further solidify why it remains one of the fastest growing crypto 2025 projects.

51284093,https://invezz.com/?p=2864230,1757156769,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,ADA and LTC face crossroads as RTX gains momentum with PayFi narrative,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/06/ada-and-ltc-face-crossroads-as-rtx-gains-momentum-with-payfi-narrative/,"Cardano and Litecoin are navigating pivotal moments as they each attempt to defend key price levels in the face of mixed technical sentiment and institutional shifts. Cardano, at $0.828, is emerging from a reputational crisis following voucher redemption allegations, while Litecoin holds near $113 after a $73 million institutional boost from Luxxfolio. Yet, despite their legacy status, analysts are now pointing to a rising PayFi contender called Remittix (RTX) . This new project is the best-positioned altcoin for outsized gains this cycle. With talk of a potential 20x rally, Remittix’s practical utility and rapidly growing investor support are turning heads across the crypto space. Cardano shakes off allegations with audit-backed vindication The Cardano price has remained resilient despite a wave of damaging allegations about its voucher redemption program. Currently trading around $0.828, ADA regained investor confidence after a detailed third-party forensic audit by McDermott Will & Schulte and BDO cleared Input Output Global (IOG) of all misconduct. The investigation dismissed claims that insiders misappropriated funds or manipulated ledger data. Notably, it concluded that 99.7% of ADA from the voucher program was successfully redeemed. Founder Charles Hoskinson addressed the issue head-on, calling for apologies from critics and urging the community to “move on” after what he described as a frustrating and baseless smear campaign. With these accusations behind it, Cardano may now refocus on technical milestones and community building, but market sentiment remains cautious until ADA breaks the $0.85 resistance barrier. Litecoin holds support as institutions signal confidence Litecoin, priced at $113, is facing a battle between bullish long-term fundamentals and bearish short-term signals. This week, Canadian firm Luxxfolio announced a $73 million plan to strengthen its Litecoin treasury, reinforcing institutional confidence in LTC’s future. Nevertheless, technical indicators are divided as the MACD indicates a positive bearish trend, and the RSI is neutral at 48.66. Although LTC trades below the 20-day and 50-day SMAs, it continues to trade a long way above its 200-day SMA, which reflects a still-bullish macro trend. According to the analysts, a clear break of more than $124.77 would initiate upward momentum and below $106.38 would indicate additional downward movement. At this point, Litecoin seems to be in a holding pattern until they have more catalysts. Remittix gains ground as analysts eye 20x upside potential While Cardano and Litecoin consolidate, Remittix is rapidly gaining traction in the PayFi sector with a bold vision for crypto-to-bank payments. Analysts now position RTX as a standout in the search for the next breakout altcoin, especially as the market pivots toward real-world adoption and cross-border functionality. Unlike legacy coins battling stagnant charts and mixed sentiment, Remittix is delivering clear milestones, growing community excitement and exchange visibility. Various factors are driving mounting 20x speculation from multiple research outlets. Its appeal lies in solving actual payment bottlenecks while maintaining crypto-native advantages. Key highlights fueling Remittix’s momentum The project has raised over $24 million, signaling strong early-stage investor confidence. Over 645million RTX tokens have been sold at the current market price of $0.1030. Listings on BitMart and LBANK have provided vital access to liquidity and exposure. The upcoming wallet beta in Q3 2025 will support 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. A Pay API tailored for freelancers and global businesses positions Remittix as a PayFi frontrunner. Conclusion Cardano and Litecoin are both navigating important transitions. Cardano has been vindicated from scandal, and Litecoin is attracting major institutional backing. However, when it comes to forward momentum, utility and 20x speculation, Remittix is quickly stealing the spotlight. With its infrastructure nearing launch, confirmed listings and fast-growing investor support, Remittix offers something increasingly rare in this market, which is real-world use cases, early entry positioning and massive upside potential. Investors scanning the altcoin landscape for the next breakout opportunity may not want to overlook this emerging PayFi disruptor.

While the Cardano price prediction is seeing ADA eye the $1 mark, a seismic shift is happening elsewhere. Smart money is flocking to Layer Brett , an innovative Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin that’s already racked up over $2.8 million in its presale, and it’s not hard to see why. This isn’t just another flavor-of-the-month token; it’s a new crypto coin built for speed, utility, and explosive growth, leaving legacy tokens like Pepe and Shiba Inu in its dust. Layer Brett: Is the best looking for the future? Forget the slow, expensive grind of older chains. Layer Brett is here to redefine what a memecoin can do. Built on cutting-edge Ethereum Layer 2 technology, this project boasts near-instant transactions and gas fees that are literally pennies, a stark contrast to the often-exorbitant costs of the main Ethereum network. It’s about more than just a catchy meme; it’s meme power, real speed, and true utility. While tokens like Pepe and Shiba Inu captivated the market with hype alone, Layer Brett offers a robust technical foundation, attracting traders looking for the next 100x altcoin. Layer Brett is a groundbreaking Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin that marries the viral energy of meme culture with legitimate blockchain utility. The $LBRETT token aims to disrupt the memecoin landscape, offering an ecosystem that includes high-yield staking rewards and future governance. Layer Brett unique approach in the crypto market Layer Brett operates as a dedicated Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, tackling the scalability issues that plague Layer 1. This means blazing-fast transactions (up to 10,000 TPS) and ultra-low gas fees (as low as $0.0001 per transaction). Users can easily buy and stake $LBRETT with ETH, USDT, or BNB via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. The presale offers an eye-watering 917% APY for early stakers, a figure that demands attention. Unlike simple meme tokens like Dogecoin or the original Brett, Layer Brett offers concrete value, making it a low cap crypto gem with real potential. This DeFi coin even includes a $1 million giveaway to early participants. Here’s why Layer Brett stands out: Ethereum Layer 2 Foundation: High-speed, low-cost, and secure. Massive Staking Rewards: Early adopters get access to huge APYs. Memecoin Energy, Real Utility: A rare blend of viral appeal and tech substance. Community-First Approach: Transparent tokenomics and engagement campaigns. Analysts weigh in on the Cardano price prediction Cardano is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform renowned for its academic, research-driven approach to development. It focuses on security, scalability, and sustainability, aiming to provide a robust infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. ADA is the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano network, used for transaction fees, staking, and governance. Many analysts are watching the Cardano price prediction closely, suggesting that ADA could indeed test the $1 mark in the near future. What the future holds for Layer Brett price While Cardano might be aiming for a solid dollar, $LBRETT is being tipped for far bigger upside. With its modest market cap and hyper-efficient Layer 2 tech, this project has the hallmarks of a next big crypto. So, while the Cardano price prediction sees ADA eyeing $1, the narrative for Layer Brett is one of unprecedented opportunity. This is not just another memecoin; it’s the future of meme tokens, fusing viral culture with tangible Layer 2 blockchain utility. Layer Brett is still in its presale stages, offering early buyers the chance to stake for massive rewards and participate in a $1 million giveaway. Don’t miss this chance to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum. The escape from Base is real, and Brett is building his own, incredibly rewarding future.

The address also holds a short position of $30.04 million in SOL and $12.58 million in BTC, and similarly maintains short positions in other major cryptocurrencies like LINK, BCH, and LTC.

Solana’s latest news and Pi Network updates show both projects slowing down after weeks of high activity. While these two coins struggle to hold momentum, Remittix (RTX) is gaining fast attention, and many investors believe it could do 4,000% growth. Solana price struggles at key level Solana (SOL) is trading around $207. After reclaiming the $197 level, traders were excited because this zone has been a strong base for upward moves. However, the latest Solana news shows that the coin is now stuck around the $210–$213 area, which has become a major barrier. source: @bitgu_ru on X Analyst Ali Martinez observes that if Solana maintains $206, the token could hit $217 or even $220. An apparent break beyond this point might open the gates to $260, which would validate a sound bullish tendency. Contrary to this, if SOL drops below $197, the price is likely to go down even more. Although this is a positive trend, the most recent news about Solana shows that some traders are becoming cautious. The market is looking to see whether SOL will ever cleanly break out or drop back to around $200 or even lower. Pi Network faces heavy pressure Pi Network’s native token is trading around $0.346, just above a critical support zone at $0.35. Pi Network updates reveal that the mining rate has been reduced again, now sitting at 0.0027405 per hour . This means it takes nearly two weeks to mine a single Pi coin without bonuses. Pi Network updates also note that Valour, a well-known fund manager, recently listed a Pi exchange-traded product in Sweden. This move signals growing institutional interest, but it hasn’t yet driven a strong price recovery. Without new exchange listings and stronger investor confidence, Pi may continue to hover near its all-time lows. Some experts see the current $0.30–$0.35 range as a possible buying opportunity, but risks remain high. source: Ashiefx on TradingView Remittix gains momentum with big plans While Solana’s latest news and Pi Network updates show slowing momentum, Remittix is quickly emerging as a PayFi leader. Remittix has already raised over $24 million, selling more than 645 million tokens at $0.1030 each. It has also been listed on two major CEXs. The first listing was on BitMart and the second, LBank, came after the token crossed the $22 million milestone. The Beta Wallet launch is set for September 15, 2025, giving users their first chance to experience the next 100x crypto . Here’s why investors are excited about Remittix: Over $24M raised, showing strong global support. BitMart and LBank listings will increase liquidity and visibility. Beta Wallet launch on September 15 brings real-world utility. Focus on the trillion-dollar remittance and PayFi industries. Analysts see up to 4,000% growth potential for early buyers. Conclusion Investors are beginning to focus on projects that solve real problems. The launch of the Beta Wallet and dual CEX listings could make Remittix one of the top-performing tokens of the year. For traders looking beyond slow-moving coins like Pi and volatile assets like Solana, Remittix may be the PayFi favorite ready to deliver massive returns.

Pepe hovers at $0.0000099, Shiba Inu teases a breakout near $0.000012 and Bonk drifts at $0.000020; none delivering the explosive moves that built their hype. Meanwhile, whales are already shifting billions into the next big altcoin of 2025 and it isn’t another meme; it’s Remittix , a utility-driven PayFi powerhouse that could rewrite the rules of crypto investing. Pepe Coin: navigating mixed price signals Pepe’s short-term outlook is shaky. While recovering slightly to $0.0000099, Pepe price volatility is still much lurking with forecasts warning of dips as low as $0.00000659. Even long-term highs of $0.0000267 rely purely on speculation, leaving investors betting more on hype than fundamentals. Without real-world use cases, PEPE’s ceiling is limited. Shiba Inu’s breakout hopes face resistance: can it outpace Bonk? Shiba Inu has flashed technical setups hinting at a potential rally, with a 17x surge possible if it breaks above $0.000013. But failure to hold momentum could drag SHIB back to $0.00001 support. Its fate, like most meme tokens, rests on whether it can evolve beyond being just a speculative play and so far, that progress has been slow. Bonk’s $0.000020 stability feels less like strength and more like stagnation. With an 8% weekly drop and over 21% lost in a month, Bonk is being squeezed by newer tokens with real traction. Analysts expect little volatility in September, but that also means little upside. For investors chasing massive 2025 gains, Bonk simply doesn’t deliver. Remittix: the high-growth crypto you can’t afford to miss This is where whales are betting big. Remittix (RTX) is not another meme coin gamble, it’s a cross-chain DeFi project targeting the $19 trillion global payments market head-on. Remittix enables direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, with real-time FX conversion and support for 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. The layer-2 Ethereum alternative’s September 15th beta wallet launch is the game-changer: instant payments, ultra-low fees and security verified by CertiK. Why Remittix Will Dominate 2025: Solves a $19 Trillion payments problem, not just hype Confirmed CEX listings already in motion Deflationary supply mechanics create built-in scarcity Mobile-first wallet launch within weeks Whales loading up before retail floods in Add to these, BitMart and LBank listings are locked in, meaning liquidity is guaranteed the moment RTX hits exchanges. Every stage of its blockchain ICO is selling out quicker than the last, and once tokens go live, entry prices will never be this cheap again. Whales aren’t waiting; why should you? Meme coins might tease rallies, but they can’t compete with real-world adoption. Remittix has over 25,000 holders already locked in and a viral $250,000 giveaway pulling in more than 300,000 entries; organic momentum that no meme coin can fake.

As Miami continues to lead the charge in municipal crypto adoption, Chairman Bowdre emphasised how $FUSD’s unique tokenomics - designed for both stability and appreciation - align with the city’s vision for resilient, long-term financial innovation. “Miami is charting the course for the future of digital assets, and $FUSD is a token that truly stands out,” stated Chairman Bowdre. “It’s appreciating stablecoin model offers citizens and institutions a dependable store of value that only grows in worth over time.” About $FUSD $FUSD is an appreciating stable token created to maintain a steady store of value while gradually increasing in net worth through a dynamic upward-price mechanism. Purchases and sales trigger minting and burning, respectively, paired with a modest tax structure that reinvests into liquidity, ensuring continuous value growth for token holders. Launched in July 2025 by FUSD Crypto, $FUSD is part of a dual-token architecture alongside $FUST, which serves as the utility and growth engine in the protocol’s ecosystem. Why This Matters for Miami’s Crypto Agenda Under Chairman Bowdre’s leadership, Miami has become a blueprint for integrating cryptocurrency into municipal operations - from accepting crypto for taxes and employee salaries to piloting blockchain-based public services. When asked how yield-bearing digital assets could reduce government debt, Chairman Bowdre states, “Unlike other stablecoins like USDC, USDT, or USD1 that are all subject to the same effects of dollar inflation, a yield-bearing digital asset can offer far more growth potential and therefore mitigate any long-term losses caused by global inflation”. With Miami’s current $400 million deficit crisis, currently forcing government officials to consider cutbacks that will negatively impact the local community and county as a whole, Chairman Bowdre has suggested the possibility of raising $1 Billion by tokenising public debt, and using yield-bearing assets such as $FUSD to do this. By utilising yield baring assets, it not only offers the potential of reducing county debt, but equally offers the potential of increasing the income generated by the state itself, and therefore will filter back to creating a better quality of life for Miami citizens. His support of $FUSD underscores: Commitment to stability - Patrols volatility in favour of measured, sustainable token models. Alignment with municipal goals - Embracing technologies that support long-term fiscal health. Global leadership - Reinforcing Miami’s role as a vanguard city for community-driven crypto policy.

This stash represents nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply, as institutional conviction around the asset continues to grow. From corporate treasuries of prominent firms to Bitcoin mining firms and ETF issuers, the presence of publicly listed companies in the market has significantly expanded over the past few years. Metaplanet, Mallers, and More Leading the pack of corporate Bitcoin holders is Strategy, the company co-founded by Michael Saylor, which began stacking coins in August 2020. Today, Strategy controls 636,505 BTC, which makes it the clear frontrunner among corporate treasuries. The gap to second place is massive as MARA Holdings owns 52,477 BTC, with just 705 BTC added in August. Despite this, new challengers are quickly building sizable positions. For instance, Jack Mallers’ XXI already commands 43,514 BTC, while the Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company holds 30,021 BTC. Other heavyweight names include Bullish, which has secured 24,000 BTC, alongside Metaplanet at 20,000 BTC. Publicly traded players such as Riot Platforms, Trump Media & Technology Group, CleanSpark, and Coinbase also emerged as increasingly important participants in this rapidly growing corporate accumulation trend. The Hidden Crisis Bitcoin’s surging popularity on Wall Street is ironically squeezing the very backbone of its network – miners. While institutional inflows have propelled BTC prices higher, on-chain activity has not kept pace, which has left transaction fees at historic lows, according to CoinMetrics. This imbalance is particularly damaging in a post-halving environment, where block rewards have already been slashed and fees now account for less than 1% of miner revenue. With profitability increasingly tied to price appreciation alone, miners face mounting financial pressure and are often forced to liquidate holdings or shut down operations entirely. The risk extends beyond economics since reduced miner participation also threatens decentralization and could concentrate network security in the hands of dominant pools like Foundry and Antpool, which already control nearly half of total hashpower. The 2028 halving will cut rewards to just 1.5625 BTC per block, which is expected to pose an even bigger challenge. Without new uses that boost demand for blockspace, Bitcoin’s security could weaken, and its “digital gold” narrative may drift away from the incentives that keep the network safe.

51283295,575731,1757157384,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51283295.jpeg,"MARA’s Bitcoin Treasury Nears $6B After Mining 705 $BTC in August, Fueling Bitcoin Hyper’s $14M Presale",https://bitcoinist.com/mara-bitcoin-holdings-near-6b-bitcoin-hyper-gains/,"MARA Holdings just announced that its Bitcoin treasury is nearing $6B after mining 705 Bitcoins in August with an average of 22.7 tokens per day. This performance is the result of an increase in hashrate to 59.6 EH/s and the company enabling its Texas wind farms. The official press release also stated that MARA plans to acquire 64% stake in Exaion , one of the world-leading producers of low-carbon energy, in Q4 of 2025. This comes shortly after the company announced a 17% increase in its Bitcoin mining capabilities in July, according to the end-of-the-month report. With Bitcoin falling below $111K again, MARA seeks to ramp up its Bitcoin accumulation strategy before the next bull run, which is likely to trigger in Q4, especially as Bitcoin Layer 2 upgrade, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) nears the end of its presale in Q4. MARA Wants a Larger Spot at the Bitcoin Table MARA wants a larger slice of the Bitcoin buy, which is why it’s ramping up its mining and buying efforts. A July 23 convertible note offering saw MARA put out $850M-worth of senior notes, with much of the proceeds being reserved for Bitcoin investments. This shows that the company is preparing a long-term investment strategy, similar to what Michael Saylor’s Strategy is doing. Strategy currently has the largest Bitcoin treasury in the world, with 636,505 $BTC, valued at nearly $70B. Strategy bought three dips in August and one in September, acquiring 7,714 $BTC for a total investment of almost $900M. More importantly, Saylor is likely to make another move now that Bitcoin lost its momentum after jumping over $113K briefly yesterday. Another massive investment would create another pump, this time hopefully getting Bitcoin over the psychological threshold of $115K. Based on Bitcoin’s historical monthly returns, the next pump may not be short-lived. According to CoinGlass data, Bitcoin’s last six years display a green October, with gains of up to 40%. Then we have Bitcoin Hyper nearing the end of the presale in Q4, according to the whitepaper , which could add an extra boost once the project goes public. How Bitcoin Hyper Promises to Solve Bitcoin’s Performance Problems Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer 2 upgrade that promises to finally solve Bitcoin’s performance issues. Bitcoin’s performance is currently limited to 7 transactions per second (TPS), which makes the network unfeasible for large institutional investors and payment processors. In terms of performance, Bitcoin ranks 28th in terms of TPS, according to Chainspect data. Even Ethereum ranks higher with its 16 TPS on the 17th position, while Solana is second with up to 1,000 TPS and a theoretical value of 65,000. So, it’s only natural that Bitcoin Hyper would target a Solana-level performance boost for Bitcoin, which it plans to achieve with tools like the Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The Canonical Bridge connects Hyper to the Bitcoin network and relies on the Bitcoin Relay Program to confirm transactions in seconds, rather than hours. The Bridge then mints the users tokens into Hyper’s Layer 2, decongesting the main network and reducing traffic significantly. The Solana Virtual Machine offers another performance boost by unlocking the ultra-fast and low-latency execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps. This brings the Bitcoin network to Solana-level performance numbers. With these tools, Hyper offers higher throughput, near-instant finality, and increased scalability, allowing for multiple transactions at once; considerably more than 7. This makes the Bitcoin network a feasible choice for institutional investors, which will turn Bitcoin mainstream and push $BTC to obscene heights. The presale has raised over $14.2M so far and it’s growing at an accelerated pace. If you want to invest, you can buy $HYPER at the presale price of $0.012865 , which could prove to become a wealth-building decision. That’s because, based on the project’s roadmap and potential, our price prediction for $HYPER is $0.32 for the end of 2025. By 2030, $HYPER could reach $1.50 with enough community support, which translates to an ROI of 11,559%. Important note: These predictions are rather conservative and don’t account for factors like global adoption or subsequent upgrades which build upon the project’s foundation even further. In other words, $HYPER could have an even taller price ceiling. If you want to get a piece of the Bitcoin Hyper action, visit the presale page now. What to Expect From Bitcoin? Given Bitcoin’s past performances over the last six years, the growing institutional interest, and companies like MARA creating a mining empire, we predict a powerful October bull. There’s no telling how high Bitcoin can get, but October has been Bitcoin’s most profitable month historically, with only two red months in 12 years. So, keep your eyes on Bitcoin and have Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) on your radar. The $14.2M presale is currently the talk of the day and reading about the project explains why. Don’t take this as financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) before investing.

Alongside these majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention as one of the best altcoins to buy, with exchange listing buzz and rising prices every hour. Solana ETF Approval Odds Surge Toward 2025 The conversation around a Solana ETF is heating up. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts raised the likelihood of approval from 70% to 95% and pointed to a possible SEC decision this October. Prediction markets like Polymarket place the odds even higher, nearly 99%. Regulatory shifts are also paving the way. The launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) in July marked a milestone as the first Solana-linked product in the U.S. Designed with at least 40% exposure to non-U.S. Solana ETFs, it offers a staking yield of about 7.3% with a 1.4% fee. The SEC’s new standardized listing guidelines have also cut down expected review times, creating favorable conditions for upcoming crypto ETFs. Market watchers believe official approval could drive institutional flows into Solana, with some analysts targeting prices ranging from $300 to $2,700. Despite short-term dips with SOL trading around $170, the broader sentiment keeps Solana firmly at the top of analysts’ watchlists . TRON (TRX) Expands Utility with Partnerships and Stablecoin Strength Analysts also highlight TRON (TRX) thanks to its push into cross-chain liquidity and real-world integrations. TRON’s partnership with Everclear allows seamless stablecoin rebalancing without centralized exchanges, reinforcing its dominance in the $80B+ USDT market. The network is also bridging traditional and digital finance. Its collaboration with Kraken and BackedFi brought tokenized equities — known as xStocks — onto its blockchain, signaling new ways to merge conventional markets with DeFi tools. In addition, TRON launched the viral TRUMP token using LayerZero’s tech, a short-term boost that added visibility across chains. While analysts are split on TRX’s near-term price levels, its role as a stablecoin hub makes it a recurring feature on bullish watchlists . If adoption of Everclear and xStocks accelerates, TRON could further strengthen its position as one of the best altcoins to buy this cycle. NEAR Pushes Inflation Cut and Institutional Exposure NEAR Protocol has earned its place on analysts’ watchlists with a mix of technical upgrades and institutional support. The protocol recently halved token inflation from 5% to 2.5%, easing sell pressure and rewarding long-term holders. Developers also rolled out tools for cross-chain swaps and interoperability, addressing liquidity fragmentation across 20+ blockchains. Institutional adoption followed. Bitwise launched a NEAR Staking ETP on Germany’s Xetra exchange, giving investors exposure to yields without managing tokens directly. Partnerships with Everclear also bolstered NEAR’s position in DeFi settlement, while daily swaps through NEAR Intents surpassed 1.2M. Though NEAR trades at $2.35 — still far below its 2024 peak — analysts cite its structural improvements and staking products as reasons it stays in the discussion for best altcoin to buy lists. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Undervalued Pick on Analysts’ Bullish Watchlist While Solana, TRON, and NEAR dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also on analysts’ bullish watchlists as an undervalued pick . Touted as a strategic investment , this altcoin is described by traders as one that can even outperform SOL, TRX, and NEAR. With exchange listing FOMO ongoing and its price increasing every hour, buyers are eyeing it as the best altcoin to buy now . Curiosity is rising across crypto circles, as MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to gain traction not only as a meme coin play but as a DeFi-ready project positioned for growth. Conclusion: How Traders Should Position The ETF wave for Solana, TRON’s expanding integrations, and NEAR’s institutional exposure highlight why these tokens are on analysts’ bullish watchlists . For traders seeking undervalued picks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as one of the best altcoins to buy, with exchange activity heating up.

With both giants lacking momentum, attention is shifting to Remittix (RTX) . Having raised over $24M, confirmed listings, and a wallet beta launching soon, RTX is drawing heavy inflows from traders betting on what many call the next best cryptocurrency to invest in for 15x upside. Bitcoin price today holds just below $110K after rejection The BTC price today is hovering just under $110,000 after bulls failed to flip $112,000 into support. Despite briefly hitting $113,000, Bitcoin lost momentum as U.S. jobs data did little to boost sentiment. According to BTC news, rejection from resistance keeps traders cautious, with some analysts warning of a possible retest toward $100,000 in the short term. The Bitcoin price prediction currently hinges on reclaiming $114,000, which is considered the most crucial level to overcome further downsides. Market analysts point out that the critical support is at $110,000, with the resistance at between $113,600 and $115,600. Until those levels are cleared, the Bitcoin price is expected to drift sideways. XRP price today shows indecision on neutral momentum indicators The XRP price today is stuck at a critical resistance zone, leaving traders uncertain about the next move. According to XRP news, repeated attempts to break higher have stalled, making this a key decision point for bulls and bears. The XRP price prediction shows that if resistance flips into support, buyers could quickly target $0.65 and even $0.75. However, if sellers recover, XRP may fall back to support at $0.50. Meanwhile, the sideways action prevails, a tug-of-war between market participants. Analysts note that momentum indicators remain neutral, highlighting the indecision in Ripple price prediction models. Until buyers firmly take charge, the Ripple news cycle is likely to revolve around range-bound trading. Remittix gains inflows as traders seek 15x growth potential As the BTC price prediction and XRP price prediction point to sideways trading, Remittix (RTX) is seeing inflows from traders looking for exponential gains. Unlike projects stuck in speculation, Remittix is providing real utility with instant crypto-to-fiat transfers directly into global bank accounts. This PayFi model positions RTX as more than hype. It’s fast becoming the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2025. $24M raised with more than 645M tokens sold BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing after $20M milestone LBank listing announced once $22M was surpassed Wallet beta launching September 15, unlocking real-world usage With early investors already sitting on 580% ROI from initial pricing, Remittix continues to attract both retail buyers and whales. While Bitcoin and XRP consolidate, RTX is delivering momentum through adoption, liquidity and strong exchange support. Analysts suggest that if trends hold, Remittix could deliver 15x upside, making it the standout play in the PayFi narrative.

This dispute highlights crucial questions about asset control and the responsibilities of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) or foundations. When CryptoQuant CEO Ju Ki-young publicly sided with Justin Sun, it sent ripples across the industry, challenging the WLFI Foundation ‘s recent actions. What’s the Dispute with the WLFI Foundation All About? The core of the issue revolves around the WLFI Foundation ‘s decision to blacklist Justin Sun’s address. Consequently, his WLFI tokens were frozen. This move has drawn sharp criticism from prominent figures like Ju Ki-young, the CEO of CryptoQuant. Ju Ki-young voiced his strong disapproval on X, arguing that Sun did not sell the tokens in question. Moreover, he emphasized that even if Sun had chosen to sell them, it would not have been problematic. Why? Because the tokens were explicitly unlocked, granting Sun full discretion over their use. Blacklisting : The WLFI Foundation blacklisted Justin Sun’s address. Asset Freeze : His WLFI tokens were subsequently frozen. Ju Ki-young’s Stance : He argues Sun had every right to the tokens, whether sold or not, due to their unlocked status. Why is the WLFI Foundation’s Action So Controversial? The controversy stems from the fundamental principles of crypto: ownership and control. When a foundation, even one associated with a decentralized project, takes action to freeze a user’s assets, it raises serious alarms. Ju Ki-young described this as “seizing a user’s assets,” a powerful phrase that resonates with many in the crypto community. This situation directly challenges the idea of immutable ownership often touted in blockchain technology. If tokens can be frozen or blacklisted at will, what does that mean for the security and autonomy of users? It sets a worrying precedent for how projects might handle disagreements or perceived misconduct in the future. Many believe that such actions undermine the trust users place in a project and its governing entities. It shifts power away from individual holders and towards a centralized decision-making body, even if that body is a foundation. What Does This Mean for User Trust and the WLFI Foundation’s Future? The implications of the WLFI Foundation ‘s actions extend beyond Justin Sun. This incident could significantly impact user trust across the broader crypto ecosystem. Users are increasingly concerned about the security of their digital assets and the potential for unilateral actions by project teams or foundations. For the WLFI Foundation itself, this event presents a crucial moment for reflection. Transparency and clear, pre-defined policies are paramount in the crypto space. Without these, any foundation risks alienating its community and damaging its reputation. Accountability for such decisions is vital to maintain credibility. Key Challenges for the WLFI Foundation: Restoring Trust: How will the foundation regain the confidence of its users and the wider crypto community? Policy Clarity: Are there clear, publicly available policies outlining the circumstances under which assets can be frozen? Decentralization Ethos: Does such a centralized action align with the decentralized principles often promoted by crypto projects? Navigating the Future: Lessons for Decentralized Projects and the WLFI Foundation This incident serves as a powerful reminder for all decentralized projects and their associated foundations. The line between protecting a project and infringing on user rights can be thin. Establishing robust governance models that prioritize transparency, user autonomy, and due process is not just good practice; it’s essential for long-term sustainability. Moving forward, the WLFI Foundation faces the task of addressing these concerns head-on. A clear explanation of their reasoning, coupled with a commitment to review and clarify their policies, could help mitigate the damage. The crypto community watches closely, hoping for resolutions that uphold the principles of digital asset ownership. Ultimately, the strength of any crypto project lies in its community’s trust. Actions that appear to arbitrarily seize assets can erode that trust rapidly. Therefore, open dialogue and a commitment to fair practices are the bedrock upon which the future of decentralized finance must be built. In conclusion, the ongoing dispute between CryptoQuant CEO Ju Ki-young, Justin Sun, and the WLFI Foundation underscores a critical debate within the crypto world. It’s a stark reminder that while innovation drives the industry forward, fundamental principles of ownership, transparency, and accountability must remain at its core. The resolution of this issue will undoubtedly set a precedent for how similar challenges are addressed in the future, making it a pivotal moment for digital asset governance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Ju Ki-young and what is his role in this dispute? A1: Ju Ki-young is the CEO of CryptoQuant, a prominent on-chain analytics firm. He publicly sided with Justin Sun, criticizing the WLFI Foundation ‘s decision to freeze Sun’s tokens and arguing for the foundation’s accountability. Q2: Why does Ju Ki-young believe Justin Sun’s tokens should not have been frozen? A2: Ju Ki-young asserts that Justin Sun did not sell the tokens. More importantly, he highlighted that even if Sun had sold them, it would not have been an issue because the tokens were “unlocked,” meaning Sun had full legitimate control over them. Q3: What are the main concerns raised by the WLFI Foundation’s action? A3: The primary concerns include the perceived “seizing of user assets,” which challenges fundamental crypto principles of ownership and decentralization. It raises questions about user autonomy, trust in foundations, and the potential for unilateral actions in the crypto space. Q4: How might this incident impact the broader cryptocurrency industry? A4: This dispute could set a precedent for how other decentralized projects and foundations manage user assets and disputes. It emphasizes the critical need for transparent policies, robust governance, and accountability to maintain user trust and uphold the ethos of decentralized finance. Q5: What is the WLFI Foundation expected to do next? A5: While specific actions are yet to be seen, the WLFI Foundation is under pressure to provide clear explanations for its decision, review its policies, and demonstrate a commitment to transparency and fair practices to mitigate reputational damage and restore community trust.

Meme coin speculation has not vanished, but attention is tilting toward projects with urgent utility and stronger upside triggers. Analysts point out that Remittix is capturing capital flows that would normally linger around Dogecoin, as investors sense this may be the narrow window to get into a project primed for breakout growth. If missed now, the regret could be lasting, as the opportunity may never look this affordable again. Dogecoin price prediction: market caution amid meme coin hype Dogecoin’s price prediction for the month of September 2025 implies a consolidation phase where the coin is likely to experience dips when the market demand becomes even weaker. Present pricing is around the $0.078 range, a little lower than it was before and the resistance is around $0.08 and the support is around 0.07. Analysts note that the short-term future of Dogecoin could be stagnant because traders seek more promising growth elsewhere in the absence of new catalysts. Nevertheless, the altcoin continue to benefit from strong brand recognition and community loyalty. Remittix: the DeFi project outpacing old guard altcoins Remittix is at the center of this shift. Designed for global crypto-to-bank transfers across more than 30 countries, it offers a direct bridge between digital assets and real-world payments. This is not just another speculative token. Remittix is building a usable system that integrates seamlessly with financial life, something Dogecoin cannot claim. Momentum is accelerating fast. The project has sold over 645 million tokens , raised more than $24 million and is priced at only $0.1030. It already secured listings on BitMart after the $20 million milestone and on LBANK once it crossed $22 million, with a third exchange reveal expected soon. Investors waiting for risk watching the price run away from them. Global Accessibility: Direct crypto-to-bank payments in 30+ countries. Mobile-First Wallet: Q3 2025 beta launch with real-time FX conversion. Institutional-Grade Security: Fully audited by CertiK. Strategic Listings: Already confirmed on BitMart and LBANK. Community Expansion: Over 25,000 holders and rapidly climbing. Analysts argue that if Dogecoin manages incremental moves, Remittix could move exponentially. Its structure and adoption potential point to a far cleaner path toward breakout. Missing entry now is the type of mistake investors regret when the token is multiples higher. Thus, while Dogecoin price prediction leans cautious, Remittix offers what traders crave: utility, growth and powerful catalysts. Analysts believe this is the best chance to catch a breakout before it accelerates. The time to act is now.

Mutuum Finance is among the emerging players that are making headlines with its disruptive DeFi lending model aimed at connecting the world of traditional finance and the blockchain ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at $0.035 as investors flock to buy tokens in the sixth round of presale. It has fundraised over $15.45 million on the platform, and has over 16,100 token holders. Bitcoin may take up corporate balance sheets, but altcoins will remain the driving forces behind the market, but the trend of Mutuum indicates a shifting paradigm where decentralized finance may represent the next stage of the growth in digital assets. Bitcoin Stabilizes in the Face of Institutional Action Bitcoin is currently trading at approximately $111,392, and displays a minor intraday volatility of high of approximately $111,714 and low of approximately $109,378. Recent report points to the relative stability of Bitcoin at holding the $110K to $111K spot, attributed to a peak network hash rate, which indicates sound underlying infrastructure, despite traders waiting to see what the historic volatility in September will bring. Bitcoin is also acting like a safe-haven asset, according to market watchers, and trends with gold as Federal Reserve interest rates head in that direction. Presale Stage 6 Milestone Mutuum Finance is still under presale and is at the sixth stage where the token is being sold at a price of $0.035. Because the project already reports more than 16,100 token holders, and has already raised more than $15.45 million, attention is growing. The new money is positioning itself to get a huge payoff during the next bull run. Shaping the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance will become the leader in the next generation of DeFi by building a new-generation Decentralized Finance platform to provide retail and institutional services. The project is making leaps ahead of the pack courtesy of its sophisticated smart contract model and security and scalability orientation. Mutuum finance has declared a $100,000 giveaway where 10 winners will win $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project commitment to create a long term and committed user base is reflected in the undertaking. Official Bug Bounty Program To bug hunters, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a bug bounty program in collaboration with CertiK with a total maximum reward of $50,000. Such rewards will be classified as critical, major, minor and low and will be deployed in descending order to ensure that the platform is safe and the system is stable. Key Metrics and Protections The platform is constructed based on the assumptions of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to restrict borrowing and collateral and offload liquidation requirements to risky employment and compensating liquidators. The reserve factor is then used as a proxy in order to represent the content of interest to provide what can be considered a cushion against default and extreme market conditions and ensure more reserve is provided to riskier assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a top investment as institutions invest billions in Bitcoin. Stage 6 tokens cost an equivalent of $0.035; the number of holders is more than 16,100, and the amount raised is $15.45M, a good sign of strong momentum. Those who are investing now set themselves up to a significant upside as the adoption of DeFi speeds up. Combining security, scalability, and room to grow, Mutuum Finance offers a $100,000 giveaway, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and a platform that is both consumer and institutional lending friendly. Stage 6 is now open, and the early-entry opportunities will be shut by the next price rise.

Recently, Michael Saylor, the visionary founder of MicroStrategy, shared a compelling insight on X: approximately 100 publicly traded companies are now strategically holding Bitcoin for investment purposes. This significant development accounts for about 4% of the cryptocurrency’s entire supply, signaling a profound endorsement from the corporate world and marking a pivotal moment in its journey. What’s Fueling This Surge in Bitcoin Institutional Adoption? Why are so many established companies turning to Bitcoin? The reasons are clear and compelling, reflecting a growing understanding of Bitcoin’s unique value proposition in today’s economic climate. Companies are looking for more than just traditional assets; they seek innovation and resilience in their portfolios. A Digital Gold Standard: Many astute investors and corporations view Bitcoin as a modern-day hedge against inflation, similar to gold but with superior digital properties. It offers a decentralized store of value in an era of quantitative easing and economic uncertainty. Portfolio Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can provide valuable diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Its historical low correlation with traditional assets at various times makes it an attractive addition. Embracing Innovation: Forward-thinking companies recognize the long-term potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Holding Bitcoin is an investment in the future of finance, digital assets, and the evolving global economy. The Profound Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The increasing trend of Bitcoin institutional adoption by public companies carries significant weight beyond mere financial transactions. It is not just about the volume of Bitcoin acquired; it is about the powerful message it sends to the broader financial market and individual investors alike, reshaping perceptions. Enhanced Legitimacy: When established corporations, often under intense public and regulatory scrutiny, allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it undeniably boosts the cryptocurrency’s credibility and perceived stability. This corporate validation is invaluable. Market Validation: These corporate endorsements serve as a strong vote of confidence, validating Bitcoin as a legitimate and viable asset class for long-term investment. It signifies a maturation of the market. Increased Awareness: Such high-profile holdings bring Bitcoin into mainstream financial discussions, educating more people about its potential and reducing skepticism. This broader awareness is crucial for continued growth and wider acceptance. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges for Corporate Crypto Investors While the benefits are clear and compelling, companies embracing Bitcoin institutional adoption also face unique challenges. These hurdles require careful consideration and strategic planning to mitigate risks, ensure compliance, and maximize the potential upside. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can be significant, posing a risk to corporate balance sheets if not managed properly. Companies must implement robust risk management strategies and long-term holding perspectives. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different jurisdictions globally. Companies must stay informed and adapt to changing legal frameworks and compliance requirements. Accounting Complexities: Current accounting standards often treat Bitcoin as an intangible asset, which can lead to complex reporting requirements and potential impairment charges, demanding specialized financial expertise. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin Institutional Adoption? Michael Saylor’s observation paints a compelling picture of where Bitcoin is headed. This level of corporate engagement suggests a future where digital assets play an even more central role in global finance, transcending niche markets to become a mainstream investment. Accelerated Adoption: As more companies witness the benefits and successfully navigate the challenges, a powerful domino effect could occur, encouraging even more corporations to explore Bitcoin holdings. Mainstream Integration: This trend moves Bitcoin further from the fringes and deeper into the core of traditional financial systems, potentially leading to new financial products, services, and broader economic integration. Long-Term Price Stability: Increased institutional holdings, often characterized by long-term investment horizons, could contribute to greater market stability over time, reducing extreme volatility compared to short-term speculation. The revelation that around 100 public companies now hold 4% of the total Bitcoin supply underscores a pivotal moment in finance. This growing trend of Bitcoin institutional adoption is not merely a passing fad; it is a fundamental shift in how corporations view and utilize digital assets. It signals a future where Bitcoin is an integral part of diversified corporate portfolios, driving legitimacy, innovation, and potentially shaping the global economic landscape for decades to come. The era of corporate Bitcoin is truly here, promising a fascinating evolution for both finance and technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “Bitcoin institutional adoption” mean?

It signifies a move beyond individual retail investors. Q2: Which types of companies are typically holding Bitcoin? Companies holding Bitcoin often include technology firms, business intelligence companies (like MicroStrategy), payment processors, and investment firms.

Q3: What percentage of Bitcoin’s total supply is held by public companies? According to Michael Saylor, approximately 100 publicly traded companies collectively hold about 4% of Bitcoin’s total supply. This figure highlights a significant and growing corporate interest in the cryptocurrency. Q4: How does corporate Bitcoin holding affect its price? Increased corporate holdings can positively impact Bitcoin’s price by reducing the circulating supply available on exchanges, signaling strong long-term demand, and boosting investor confidence. This can contribute to price stability and upward pressure over time. Q5: What are the main benefits for a company holding Bitcoin?

According to reports, the company is alleging that the AI image generating platform allows users to create images and videos of characters like Superman, Batman, and Bugs Bunny without express permission. Warner Bros claimed that the firm knowingly engaged in wrongful conduct, noting that the company previously had policies restricting subscribers from generating content based on infringing images, but recently lifted the prohibitions. The company also mentioned that after the restrictions were lifted, Midjourney claimed to have improved the service. Warner Bros initiates legal action against Midjourney In the complaint filed at a Los Angeles federal court, Warner Bros also claimed that the theft enabled Midjourney to train its image and video service to offer subscribers high-quality, downloadable images of its characters in every scene imaginable. “Midjourney has made a calculated and profit-driven decision to offer zero protection for copyright owners even though Midjourney knows about the breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement,” the complaint reads. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages , disgorgement of profit, and for Midjourney to halt further infringements. This case comes after a similar lawsuit was filed in June against Midjourney by Walt Disney and Universal over characters including Darth Vader, Bart Simpson, Shrek, and the character Ariel from The Little Mermaid. “Midjourney is the quintessential copyright-free rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism,” the studios said. In the lawsuit filed in June, the companies claimed that Midjourney failed to honor repeated requests to halt its use of copyrighted materials or to introduce safeguards to eliminate infringement. “We are bullish on the promise of AI technology and optimistic about how it can be used responsibly as a tool to further human creativity, but piracy is piracy, and the fact that it’s done by an AI company does not make it any less infringing,” Horacio Gutierrez, Disney’s executive president and chief legal officer, said. Midjourney was also involved in a copyright suit last year after a group of ten artists was given the go-ahead by a federal judge in California court to continue their infringement lawsuit against the company and some others. The group claimed that Midjourney and the others scrapped and stored copyrighted artwork without consent. Launched in 2022, the San Francisco-based company, headed by founder David Holz, has amassed nearly 21 million users as of September 2024 and more than $300 million in revenue at the same time. Meanwhile, in an August 6 filing in the Universal and Disney case, the AI-image generator claimed that copyright law “does not confer absolute control” over the use of copyrighted works. Its founder has also previously compared the service to a search engine, noting that it learns from existing images the way humans study a painting to improve their technique. Midjourney also claimed that the works used to train generative AI models were used under fair use, hoping to ensure the free flow of ideas and information. In the last few years, there have been so many lawsuits where authors, news companies, record labels, and even content creators have accused AI companies of using their materials without permission. “The heart of what we do is develop stories and characters to entertain our audiences, bringing to life the vision and passion of our creative partners,” a spokesperson for Warner Bros Discovery said. “We filed this suit to protect our content, our partners, and our investments.” Warner Bros operations include Warner Bros Entertainment, DC Comics, The Cartoon Network, Turner Entertainment, and Hanna-Barbera.

Dogecoin still has strong liquidity and a passionate community, but many investors are beginning to rotate into Layer Brett ($LBRETT), an Ethereum Layer 2 meme token that mixes viral appeal with blockchain performance. With presale access still open, analysts suggest that $LBRETT has the potential to deliver 100x returns — something Dogecoin is unlikely to match at its current scale. Dogecoin’s standing in 2025 Dogecoin has been through several cycles and continues to hold a top spot among meme tokens. Its presence on all major exchanges and endorsements from high-profile supporters keep it relevant. But with a large circulating supply and established market cap, the odds of DOGE pulling off another massive rally in the near term are slim. Even optimistic forecasts suggest that growth will be gradual rather than explosive. Why investors are shifting to Layer Brett Layer Brett is emerging as the fresh alternative in the meme coin space. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it brings both culture and technology together. Key features include: High staking APYs for early participants in the tens of thousands of percent Low gas fees and near-instant transactions thanks to Layer 2 scalability Fixed supply of 10 billion tokens with transparent tokenomics Community-driven incentives, including a $1 million giveaway This model gives Layer Brett an advantage that Dogecoin lacks: real utility and early-stage upside. DOGE vs $LBRETT Dogecoin has history, community, and liquidity on its side. However, those same factors make it less agile. For new investors chasing outsized returns, $LBRETT offers a cleaner slate. With presale entry points still available, early buyers have the chance to capture exponential growth before major exchange listings. Market rotation is nothing new The meme coin market has always been defined by cycles. Shiba Inu once took center stage from Dogecoin, and now a new project is set to capture attention. Layer Brett combines Ethereum Layer 2 scalability with meme coin virality, creating a narrative that resonates with all types of traders and investors. Key selling points of Layer Brett Ethereum Layer 2 scalability: low fees and fast transactions Gamified staking: rewards reduces as adoption increases, rewarding early entry Community-first approach: active campaigns and reward structures Presale advantage: early access before wider exchange rollout Conclusion: why traders are rotating now The Dogecoin news cycle shows that while DOGE will likely remain a major player, its growth potential is capped compared to earlier days. For investors seeking bigger multipliers, Layer Brett offers the kind of early entry and utility that can fuel 100x moves. With presale demand growing and buzz spreading across the community, $LBRETT is becoming the meme coin many believe could define 2025. For those chasing the next 100x meme token, the action may already be moving elsewhere. Don’t miss the presale window — whales aren’t, and they’re betting that Layer Brett could be the 100x meme token of this cycle.

While some traders see this as healthy consolidation, others are moving capital into projects that promise faster short-term upside. At the center of this shift is Layer Brett ($LBRETT), a new Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin that has quickly become one of the most talked-about tokens of 2025. Solana holds steady but stalls for upside Solana has built a strong ecosystem with high throughput, low fees, and thriving DeFi and NFT activity. Yet, after big gains earlier in the cycle, its price has flattened out. For long-term believers, this is a chance to accumulate. But short-term traders are increasingly restless, rotating toward tokens with higher risk-reward potential. Beyond price, Solana is still expanding its ecosystem. New projects are being launched on the network, and developers are choosing it for its speed and low costs. Though, this steady growth story does not always excite traders who are chasing the next big surge. That’s why some are turning to smaller, emerging tokens with greater potential for rapid appreciation. Why Layer Brett is gaining momentum Layer Brett is emerging as the meme coin to watch this year. Unlike hype-only tokens, $LBRETT combines Ethereum Layer 2 speed and scalability with viral meme culture. Investors are excited about: Early staking rewards offering tens of thousands of percent APY Ultra-low gas fees and near-instant transactions via Layer 2 Fixed 10 billion token supply for transparent tokenomics Community incentives, including a $1 million giveaway This mix of culture and tech is giving traders the confidence to bet on $LBRETT as the meme coin with breakout potential. Comparing Solana and Layer Brett Solana remains a top altcoin, offering robust smart contract functionality and developer adoption. It continues to rank highly among blockchains by transaction volume and is home to a thriving NFT scene. But its size as a large-cap asset makes 50x or 100x moves unlikely in the short run. By contrast, Layer Brett, still in its presale stage, is drawing traders who want the chance to capture life-changing returns with a smaller initial stake. Analysts point out that Solana is a strong long-term hold, but newer projects like Layer Brett have the advantage of narrative. Meme coins thrive on excitement, and $LBRETT is bringing that energy together with Ethereum Layer 2 performance. What makes Layer Brett different Crypto history shows that capital often flows from large-cap leaders into smaller, faster-moving tokens. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu once filled this role, and now Layer Brett is stepping up. Its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation means it is not only meme-powered but also technologically competitive, giving it a stronger narrative than hype-only projects. Key selling points of Layer Brett Ethereum Layer 2 scalability: secure, fast and cheap transactions Gamified staking: rewards that reduces with adoption, rewarding early movers Community-first design: giveaways, campaigns, and active engagement Presale advantage: entry before major exchange listings Conclusion: Solana holds, but $LBRETT excites Solana remains a powerful coin in the Crypto market, known for its strong ecosystem and loyal community. Though, its sideways trend is pushing some investors to diversify into higher-upside opportunities. Layer Brett, with its combination of meme culture and Ethereum Layer 2 utility, is emerging as the year’s hottest meme token. For traders who want more than just steady return. $LBRETT is shaping up to be one of the most exciting opportunities of 2025.

Understanding the Significance of a Doubled Total Crypto Market Cap The doubling of the total crypto market cap signifies more than just a financial milestone; it marks a profound shift in how the world perceives digital assets. This growth has several significant implications: Mainstream Acceptance: A larger market cap indicates broader acceptance and integration into the global financial system. It suggests that cryptocurrencies are no longer just an experimental technology but a legitimate asset class. Enhanced Liquidity: With more capital flowing into the market, liquidity improves across various digital assets. This makes it easier for investors to buy and sell, potentially reducing price volatility in the long run. Innovation and Development: A thriving market attracts more talent and investment into the blockchain and crypto sectors, fostering further innovation. This leads to better infrastructure, more secure platforms, and new applications that benefit users worldwide. However, it is also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The crypto market, while maturing, can still experience volatility. Regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, and investors should remain informed and cautious. Navigating the Future of the Total Crypto Market Cap: What’s Next? As the total crypto market cap continues its upward trajectory, what should investors and enthusiasts consider for the future? The journey ahead promises both opportunities and potential pitfalls. Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, the broader market offers a vast array of altcoins with unique use cases. Diversifying your portfolio can help mitigate risks and capture growth from emerging projects. Stay Informed: The crypto space is dynamic. Keeping up with market news, technological advancements, and regulatory changes is vital for making informed decisions.

The doubling of the total crypto market cap in just one year is a powerful testament to the enduring appeal and growing influence of digital currencies. This surge reflects a maturing market, driven by institutional interest, technological innovation, and widespread adoption.

Here’s What’s Coming,https://timestabloid.com/99-1-chance-raises-xrp-armys-hope-for-massive-pump-heres-whats-coming/,"Xoom (@Mr_Xoom), a prominent crypto analyst on X, recently shared a chart showing that markets are now assigning a 99.1% probability of rate cuts in September. The probability refers to the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy meeting scheduled for September 17 . With less than two weeks remaining before the decision, expectations of monetary easing have risen significantly, reflecting growing confidence among traders and analysts. The shift in probability has been rapid. Less than a week ago, markets were pricing in around a 90% chance of a cut . That figure has since climbed steadily to the current 99.1%, signaling that traders view the outcome as nearly certain. Market participants are convinced that there will be rate cuts, and the meeting on September 17 could be a game-changer for XRP and the broader crypto market. 99.1% probability of rate cuts in 12 days. pic.twitter.com/7f14iSgkUI — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) September 5, 2025 Market Consensus on Policy Direction The chart presented by Xoom illustrates that the market is calling for an adjustment to interest rates. The current target rate sits between 425 and 450 points, but markets overwhelmingly expect that range to shift down to 400 to 425 following the September meeting. With only a 0.9% probability left for rates to remain unchanged, traders have effectively priced in a rate cut as the baseline expectation. Jerome Powell, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, has held off on cutting rates throughout 2025, pushing back against pressure from Donald Trump . However, the market is changing, and by cutting rates, the Fed would be seeking to support growth and stabilize confidence. What Do Rate Cuts Mean for XRP For XRP, the near-certainty of a Federal Reserve rate cut could provide meaningful benefits. Lower interest rates tend to reduce the yield available in traditional financial markets, which can push investors toward alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. In this environment, digital assets like XRP often benefit from renewed capital inflows and increased trading activity. A shift toward lower borrowing costs also has the potential to improve liquidity across financial markets.

With a 99.1% probability of rate cuts in less than two weeks, markets have moved from optimism to near certainty that the Federal Reserve will ease policy at its September meeting. For XRP, this environment could prove favorable, as investors look to diversify. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The Pi coin price continues to struggle under supply pressure from constant token unlocks, leaving its outlook muted. At the same time, the Cardano (ADA) price target has circled around the $1 mark, sparking cautious optimism but leaving room for doubt about whether momentum can be sustained. Both projects remain relevant, yet neither appears to be the immediate breakout play traders are searching for. The attention instead has swung to BlockDAG . With its presale blasting through $400 million almost raised and more than 25.6 billion coins sold, BDAG has captured the narrative. BlockDAG: Presale Momentum Reshaping the Market The presale is now priced at a flat $0.0013, up from its opening round at $0.001. Early participants are already sitting on a 2,900% return, while even those who joined during the $0.0016 special sale are holding 1,175% ROI. With long-term projections pointing toward $1, even new entrants still have room for sizeable gains before listings. Adding weight to the narrative are whale purchases that have shaken up the leaderboard. Two separate entries of $4.4 million and $4.3 million have overtaken previous top holders, proving that significant capital is flowing into the project. Smaller buyers are following quickly, aware that the combination of presale gains, multipliers, and event dominance is rare. Institutional chatter has also begun surfacing, with analysts noting that BlockDAG’s fundraising pace outperforms many top-tier launches, adding credibility to claims that it could rank among the most successful early-stage offerings in crypto history. This is why BlockDAG is increasingly being framed as not just another presale, but a project redefining what early participation can mean. Pi Coin Price Struggles Under Unlock Pressure The Pi coin price currently trades around $0.33 to $0.34, holding close to recent lows. Much of this weakness stems from ongoing token unlocks, which continue to flood the market with new supply. August alone saw around 160 million PI tokens released into circulation, with another 116 million scheduled for September and more coming through the remainder of the year. This constant increase in supply has pushed the token down by more than 60 percent over the past year, and confidence has been steadily eroding as a result. Daily trading volumes remain in the range of $28 million to $55 million, but most of this activity reflects short-term churn rather than steady accumulation. Technical traders point to a possible bullish divergence, with RSI suggesting there may be room for a rally back toward $0.46 in the short term. Yet the broader picture is less favorable. Without fresh adoption drivers or new utility, Pi risks staying sidelined while more compelling opportunities like BlockDAG draw attention and capital. For now, the Pi coin price story reflects supply-driven weakness more than demand-driven growth, leaving its outlook muted compared to projects that have successfully tied adoption and incentives together. Cardano (ADA) Price Target Near $1 Cardano’s story is more balanced. The ADA price trades in the $0.85 to $0.87 range, with resistance set near $0.90 to $0.95. Analysts expect a short-term push toward $0.94, with some projecting $1.04 by the end of August if ADA can break through the $0.88 barrier. If momentum carries into September, forecasts suggest a potential climb to $1.20 or even $1.30, delivering up to 50 percent upside in the near term. Confidence has been boosted by whale behavior, with $170 million in ADA recently withdrawn from exchanges, hinting at reduced sell pressure and accumulation. Looking further ahead, forecasts vary widely. Some see ADA closing 2025 near $1.80, while others suggest it could rise to $2.36 or even $3 if catalysts such as ETF approvals or macroeconomic triggers land. Projections for 2026 extend even further, ranging between $2.50 and $5, with the most bullish scenarios pointing to $7 if institutional adoption accelerates. Despite this, the near-term path is still dependent on external factors, and ADA’s growth remains gradual compared to the explosive dynamics seen in BlockDAG’s presale. Why BlockDAG is Being Framed as the Market’s Best Bet The contrast between these three projects is clear. Pi remains locked in a cycle of supply-driven weakness, its price pinned near $0.34 with little to spark demand. Cardano continues to build cautiously, with the ADA price target moving closer to $1 and long-term potential stretching higher, but growth is measured and reliant on catalysts still outside its control. BlockDAG, by comparison, has combined immediate ROI with measurable adoption and unmatched visibility. Its presale is nearing $400 million, placing it among the largest in crypto history. More than 25.6 billion coins have been sold, while early participants have secured up to 2,900% ROI. Whales are competing at the top of the leaderboard with multimillion-dollar stakes, while 3 million users mine BDAG through the X1 app and nearly 20,000 hardware rigs have been shipped worldwide, generating $7.8 million in hardware sales. A developer base of more than 4,500 coders building 300+ decentralized applications further underscores the ecosystem’s depth. Unlike Pi or Cardano, BlockDAG has built a synchronized countdown where adoption, fundraising, and multipliers all peak at the same time. For traders and analysts scanning the market, it is being positioned not just as another altcoin presale but as a potential benchmark for how early-stage projects can blend visibility and ROI. For those asking what the top crypto to buy in 2025 looks like, the answer is framed not in speculation but in numbers and timing. Pi is weighed down by supply. Cardano is waiting on catalysts. BlockDAG is delivering adoption, ROI, and visibility all at once.

The merger will be renamed to StablecoinX Inc., which will manage over three billion ENA tokens. TLGY, a special purpose acquisition company, and StablecoinX Assets Inc., a validator and infrastructure business supporting the Ethena ecosystem, announced the combined effort agreement. They are expected to finalize the merger in the fourth quarter of 2025. StablecoinX Inc. will be the official name of the merger, with its class A common shares listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol USDE. The merger will be a dedicated treasury for the Ethena ecosystem , managing ENA tokens. Ethena plans to launch USDtb following GENIUS Act clarity The latest round attracted YZi Labs, Brevan Howard, Susquehanna Crypto, and IMC Trading with equity transactions priced at $10 per share. Returning investors such as Dragonfly, ParaFi Capital, Maven11, Kingsway, Mirana, and Haun Ventures were also attracted. The company’s press release revealed that part of the generated income will be used to buy discounted ENA locked tokens through a subsidiary of Ethena. Excited to see a successful follow on raise for StablecoinX of ~$530m which represents roughly 14% of the circulating market cap of $ENA .

The funding adds to July’s $360 million through PIPE financing and $260 million from the buyback program, bringing the total buybacks to $570 million. USDe stablecoin has received rapid adoption since its launch in early 2024, with the current supply at 12.7 billion within 10 months. The stablecoin is considered the fastest-growing compared to USDT and USDC. CoinMarketCap data shows that USDe supply has grown by 31% to $12.7 billion and is regarded as the thirteenth largest stablecoin issue by market cap. The Ethena ecosystem has also recorded strong financial performance, with over $500 million in cumulative revenue and weekly earnings exceeding $13 million. The protocol has also managed to maintain USDe’s peg through its delta-neutral hedging model, which collects yield from crypto markets. Ethena Foundation is also developing USDtb, a fiat-backed stablecoin, following the advancement in regulatory frameworks eased by the GENIUS Act, which Trump signed into law in July. The firm will partner with Anchorage Digital Bank to support USDtb. The GENIUS Act provides stablecoins with a defined regulatory framework, giving issuers official recognition, as reported by Cryptopolitan. StablecoinX forms advisory board to guide partnerships and governance StablecoinX has also formed an advisory board to advise on ecosystem alignment, market structure, partnerships, and governance. According to the statement, Rob Hadick, General Partner at Dragonfly, will chair the board. The firm has also agreed with Ethena Foundation that proceeds from the locked ENA token sales will be used to purchase ENA across the public markets via intermediaries. Guy Young, founder of Ethena Labs and advisor to StablecoinX, acknowledged that the combined efforts to expand resources will reinforce the long-term sustainability of the Ethena ecosystem. He added that the planned Nasdaq listing will mark a significant milestone in the stablecoin ecosystem. According to a report published by Cryptopolitan, stablecoin settlement volumes exceeded $1.5 trillion in July. The figure marked its highest monthly total since the start of 2025, mainly due to the passing of the GENIUS Act. According to Sentora analytics, January volumes stood at $950 billion but grew consistently, remaining above $1.2 trillion through July. USDC remained the leader in on-chain activity throughout 2025, with 40%-48% of DeFi transactions recorded. Tether recorded 20%-27%, and MakerDAO’s DAI accounted for 17%-33%. The three stablecoins represented more than 90% of monthly transactional volumes. USDC recorded a $63.85 billion market cap, which has currently grown to $72.54 billion.

The figure underscores the growing conviction among traders and investors that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will greenlight at least one XRP-based ETF within the current cycle. A Surge in Market Confidence Polymarket’s odds did not leap to 94% overnight. Earlier in 2025, the market placed XRP ETF approval in the low double digits, reflecting skepticism about regulatory openness. As the year progressed, however, odds surged steadily into the 70–90% range before reaching the current high. This upward momentum mirrors a shift in sentiment across financial markets, where confidence in crypto ETFs has risen dramatically following earlier approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum products. #XRP ETF Approval Odds Soar To 94%! pic.twitter.com/NqNKpjoU1E — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) September 6, 2025 The SEC’s Decision Window The growing optimism is tied to the SEC’s regulatory timetable. Several issuers have filed proposals for a spot XRP ETF, with statutory deadlines now clustering in October 2025 after a series of extensions. These deadlines force the SEC to issue decisions within a defined period, effectively narrowing the timeline for when an approval or rejection must occur. Market watchers believe the regulator’s softened stance on digital asset ETFs makes approval increasingly likely, a sentiment Polymarket participants are clearly pricing in. Institutional Demand Driving Expectations Another driver of these soaring odds is the belief that an XRP ETF could unlock billions in institutional inflows. Analysts project that if approved, a spot XRP ETF could attract at least $5 billion in its early trading phase, as institutional investors and traditional brokerage clients would gain a straightforward way to access the asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Such an influx of capital would not only boost XRP’s market profile but also provide a significant milestone for broader digital asset adoption. The expectation of this scale of demand explains why traders on Polymarket are backing approval with near certainty. Caution Amid Optimism Despite the bullish market signal, it is important to note that Polymarket’s 94% figure represents collective sentiment rather than a regulatory guarantee. The SEC remains the ultimate decision-maker, and approval hinges on how it evaluates market structure, investor protections, and compliance measures put forward by issuers. While prediction markets are often insightful indicators, they are not substitutes for official rulings. Polymarket’s latest odds highlight a striking level of confidence in XRP’s regulatory future. With deadlines approaching and institutional demand building, the stage is set for a pivotal decision by the SEC. For XRP holders and market observers, the 94% probability figure is a reminder of how rapidly expectations have shifted in 2025. Still, as history has shown, optimism in prediction markets must always be weighed against the realities of regulatory discretion.

A prominent Polygon developer, Bruno Skvorc, has openly criticized the WLFI Foundation following a concerning WLFI asset freeze of his digital holdings. This event not only highlights the vulnerabilities within the digital asset space but also raises serious questions about the power dynamics at play. What Triggered the Controversial WLFI Asset Freeze? Skvorc’s strong condemnation stems from his experience with the WLFI Foundation. He alleges that his assets were frozen without clear recourse, leading him to liken the organization to a “new-age mafia.” This dramatic comparison, as reported by Cointelegraph, underscores his perception of power imbalance and a lack of accountability. His concerns are particularly sharp due to the foundation’s alleged connections to influential figures. When a user’s assets are frozen, and they feel powerless to reclaim them, it strikes at the core promise of decentralization and user sovereignty in the crypto world. This situation brings to light the critical need for transparency and due process in asset management. Are Automated Compliance Tools to Blame for the WLFI Asset Freeze? On-chain analyst ZachXBT offered a technical perspective on the incident. He explained that projects like WLFI often employ automated compliance tools. These systems are designed to blacklist and freeze assets if a wallet has interacted with certain decentralized finance (DeFi) projects or exchanges deemed problematic. In Skvorc’s case, his blacklisting was reportedly influenced by past interactions with the crypto mixing protocol Tornado Cash and the sanctioned entity Netex24. While these tools aim to prevent illicit activities, ZachXBT pointed out their “serious flaws.” Lack of Nuance: Automated systems may not differentiate between innocent and malicious interactions. Irreversible Actions: Freezing assets can have severe financial consequences for legitimate users. Limited Recourse: Users often find it difficult to appeal or reverse such automated decisions. This raises a significant challenge for the crypto industry: how to balance necessary compliance with the fundamental principles of decentralization and user control. The current approach, as seen in the WLFI asset freeze , often leaves users feeling vulnerable. Is the WLFI Asset Freeze an Isolated Incident, or a Growing Concern? Interestingly, this isn’t the first time WLFI’s asset freezing practices have drawn criticism. Previously, Tron (TRON) founder Justin Sun also voiced his disapproval of a WLFI token freeze, labeling it as unreasonable. Such repeated incidents suggest a pattern rather than an isolated event. These cases highlight a broader tension within the cryptocurrency ecosystem: The push for regulatory compliance from traditional finance. The core ethos of decentralization and censorship resistance in crypto. When powerful entities can unilaterally freeze assets, it can erode trust in the very systems designed to be trustless. It compels users to reconsider the true extent of their ownership in a world increasingly governed by automated rules and centralized control points. What Does This Mean for Crypto Users and the Future of DeFi? The controversy surrounding the WLFI asset freeze serves as a stark reminder for everyone involved in cryptocurrency. It underscores the importance of understanding the terms and conditions of every platform and protocol you interact with. Users must be aware of the potential risks associated with engaging with certain DeFi projects or exchanges that might trigger automated compliance mechanisms. For developers and foundations, this situation emphasizes the urgent need for more sophisticated and equitable compliance solutions. Systems that incorporate human review, clear appeal processes, and greater transparency could help mitigate the severe impact of automated blacklisting. Ultimately, this debate is crucial for the evolution of decentralized finance. It forces the industry to confront the delicate balance between maintaining a secure and compliant environment and upholding the foundational principles of user autonomy and censorship resistance. How projects navigate these challenges will shape the future landscape of digital assets. Conclusion: Navigating the Complexities of Crypto Asset Control The criticism from a Polygon developer regarding the WLFI asset freeze has brought to the forefront the inherent complexities of asset control in the digital realm. While automated compliance tools are intended to safeguard the ecosystem, their current implementation can lead to significant user distress and a perceived lack of justice. As the crypto space matures, finding a balance between robust security, regulatory adherence, and fundamental user rights will be paramount. This incident serves as a powerful call for greater transparency, better recourse mechanisms, and a more nuanced approach to digital asset management. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the WLFI Foundation? A1: The WLFI Foundation is an organization involved in the cryptocurrency space, though specific details about its operations and token were not provided in the original context. It appears to implement compliance tools that can freeze user assets. Q2: Why was the Polygon developer’s asset frozen by WLFI? A2: Polygon developer Bruno Skvorc’s assets were reportedly frozen due to his past interactions with the crypto mixing protocol Tornado Cash and the sanctioned entity Netex24, which triggered WLFI’s automated compliance tools. Q3: What are automated compliance tools in crypto? A3: Automated compliance tools are systems used by crypto projects to monitor on-chain activity. They can identify and flag wallets that have interacted with sanctioned entities, illicit services, or certain DeFi protocols, often leading to actions like blacklisting or freezing assets. Q4: What are the main concerns regarding automated WLFI asset freeze incidents? A4: Key concerns include the lack of nuance in automated systems, the potential for legitimate users to be unfairly penalized, the difficulty in appealing decisions, and the tension between compliance and the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. Q5: Has any other prominent figure criticized WLFI’s asset freezing? A5: Yes, Tron (TRON) founder Justin Sun previously criticized a WLFI token freeze, deeming it unreasonable.

According to prominent online analyst TradingShot , the maiden cryptocurrency is approaching a potential market peak in late 2025, to be followed by a significant correction into 2026. In a TradingView post on September 5, the analyst noted that historical data shows Bitcoin’s market structure often follows a recurring rhythm of tops, bear phases, and cycle bottoms. Each super cycle has tended to top out near the 0.786 Fibonacci time extension before entering a prolonged downturn. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Based on current cycle measurements, the next major top could occur during the week of October 13, 2025. This timing aligns with previous cycles that peaked shortly before transitioning into their respective bear phases. The analysis further suggests that the bear phase may begin after December 1, 2025, when the 0.786 Fibonacci marker is reached. If cycle symmetry holds, the bear market could extend until the projected super cycle bottom on October 5, 2026. At that point, the best long-term buying opportunity is expected to emerge, consistent with past patterns where cycle lows provided favorable entry points ahead of the next major rally. Bitcoin key price levels to watch On the other hand, on-chain data shared by Ali Martinez highlighted key metrics for assessing the health of Bitcoin’s current bull market. Historically, downtrends begin when the price falls below the Short-Term Holder realized price, with deeper reversals forming once it slips under the Long-Term Holder realized price. These levels represent the average cost basis of recent buyers versus long-term investors.

The proposed class-action deal is the biggest copyright payout ever reported and the first major settlement tied to artificial intelligence. If Judge William Alsup in San Francisco approves it, the deal will pay hundreds of thousands of authors and set a new standard for how AI companies use copyrighted material. This comes after a U.S. judge allowed a group of authors to proceed with a lawsuit against AI firm Anthropic, alleging their books were used without consent to train its artificial intelligence model. The authors, all established professionals, claim Anthropic used their copyrighted works to train its Claude chatbot without permission or compensation. They argue the company went too far by leveraging their stories to make the AI sound more human, even imitating their writing styles and ideas. Authors secure record payout in copyright case The $1.5 billion settlement covers about 500,000 pirated books the company downloaded from online shadow libraries like Library Genesis, Pirate Library Mirror, and the Books3 dataset. These online libraries are popular sources of unauthorized digital copies of books that researchers and AI developers use for their datasets. For a long time, writers, publishers, and advocacy groups have criticized the repositories for undermining copyright protections. The deal says that each writer whose book Anthropic illegally used as training data for its AI will receive about $3,000 in compensation. If further investigation discovers any additional work the company used in its dataset, the total amount could skyrocket beyond the initial $1.5 billion. Anthropic’s case began in 2024 when authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued the company for copying their books without permission. Later on, hundreds of thousands of other writers filed a lawsuit, claiming the company used their works to train its flagship chatbot, Claude . The authors flagged Anthropic’s ignorance of licensing the material legitimately despite its financial status, as seen in its powerful investors, like Amazon and Google’s parent company Alphabet. Judge William Alsup ruled in June that using copyrighted material to train AI models could be considered fair use if the works were transformative. But he also said that Anthropic violated copyright law when it downloaded and stored over 7,000,000 pirated books in a central library. The ruling exposed the company to damages if the lawsuit went to trial as scheduled in December because legal experts warned that Anthropic could have to pay hundreds of billions of dollars. Anthropic avoids trial but still faces legal risks The terms of the $1.5 billion settlement require Anthropic to destroy every copy of the pirated books to prevent it from continuing to benefit from unauthorized material. However, experts say the agreement doesn’t protect the company from fresh lawsuits. Authors could still sue if the Claude system generated outputs that reproduce copyrighted passages or infringe on their works. Anthropic said the deal did not include an admission of liability, but rather that it wanted to move forward without the uncertainty of a lengthy trial. The company’s deputy general counsel, Aparna Sridhar, explained that Anthropic is still committed to producing safe, trustworthy, and supportive of human progress. She said the company wants to concentrate on developing tools that improve science and serve the public rather than spending years locked in court battles. Other AI companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta still face lawsuits that raise nearly identical copyright concerns. A judge in San Francisco recently allowed a lawsuit against Meta to continue, saying the use of copyrighted material without permission is unlawful “in many circumstances.” Settling saved Anthropic the possibility of dragging the dispute to the U.S. Supreme Court because this could’ve brought massive changes to national laws around how fair use applies to artificial intelligence.

XRP has slipped 1.3% in the last 24 hours, giving the token a market capitalization of $167.35 billion, ranking it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. With 59.6 billion coins in circulation out of a 100 billion maximum supply, XRP continues to capture attention as investors speculate on what could drive its next major rally. BREAKING: @Ripple confirmed that BlackRock will join the upcoming “Swell Conference 2025“ in New York City! #XRP pic.twitter.com/fxd72DokBL — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) September 5, 2025 One possibility is an XRP-linked ETF. BlackRock’s involvement in Ripple’s upcoming Swell 2025 conference has intensified speculation that such a product could emerge in the future. If approved, an ETF could trigger a rally like Bitcoin’s, where institutional inflows caused a 60%+ gain. BlackRock and Ripple’s Swell Conference Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference, November 4–5 in New York City, will feature BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, Maxwell Stein, and other big names. Speakers include Adena Friedman of Nasdaq, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and Jason Lau, CIO of OKX. The agenda reveals Stein will discuss tokenized assets with Rory Callagy of Moody’s, though it doesn’t confirm whether BlackRock will address an XRP ETF directly. Currently, the asset manager offers ETFs linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum but has held back from XRP, likely due to Ripple’s lengthy legal battle with the SEC. That case concluded last month, potentially clearing the way for new institutional products. Key points to watch: BlackRock already runs Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Ripple’s legal risks have eased, fueling ETF speculation. Swell 2025 will cover payments, stablecoins, regulation, and adoption. Technical Outlook: XRP Under Pressure On the 4-hour chart, the XRP price prediction appears bearish, as XRP is currently inside a descending channel, indicating downward pressure. It’s sitting just below the 50-EMA ($2.81), and the 200-EMA ($2.87) is capping upside. Each test of $2.87 has failed so far. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick formations show indecision, with spinning tops and small-bodied candles dominating. The RSI at 46 signals weak momentum, with no bullish divergence. If XRP falls below $2.76, the next targets lie at $2.70 and $2.62, aligning with the lower boundary of the channel. For bulls to regain control, XRP must clear $2.87 with conviction. A bullish engulfing candle and strong volume could open up $2.95 and $3.04. Without that, the bias is bearish and traders will be looking for more selling. ETF Hopes and Long-Term Outlook In the short term, XRP’s path depends on defending support at $2.70. A bounce could mark the start of recovery, while a breakdown risks another leg lower. Short term, XRP’s path is dependent on holding $2.70. A bounce could be the start of the recovery, a breakdown could be another leg down. Long term, it’s all about adoption milestones like central banks and an ETF. If institutional demand comes in through an ETF, XRP could follow Bitcoin’s path where inflows caused big rallies. A 60% move from here would put XRP at $4.50 with room to go higher if the broader crypto markets align. For investors, patience and risk management remain essential, but the ETF narrative keeps hope alive for a breakout cycle.

Nick Anderson, better known as BULLRUNNERS on the social media platform X, says XRP is going through the same kind of consolidation Amazon faced in 2010, and it still has the potential to rally to $200. The key difference, however, is the patience investors will need before this rally can happen. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally Amazon’s Breakout Holds The Clues For XRP XRP’s price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by a trading range between $2.8 and $2.9. The cryptocurrency now seems stuck within this range, but it has managed to hold above $2.8 for the meantime. Interestingly, Anderson likened this consolidation move to a similar retest of a previous high by the Amazon stock (AMZN) back in 2010. In his post, Anderson highlighted how Amazon stock spent roughly 3,800 days consolidating after the dot-com crash before finally breaking past its previous high and entering a meteoric run. However, before entering into this meteoric run, it consolidated for a few months in 2010 just after breaking above its previous high during the dot-com bubble. According to Anderson, XRP’s current structure is tracing out a massive cup and handle that mirrors this exact Amazon stock setup, with the cryptocurrency now using past highs as support in the same way Amazon did. Just as Amazon transformed once it cleared resistance, Anderson believes XRP could follow a similar breakout trajectory that could eventually push its price above $100, and possibly as high as $200. Short-Term Expectations Between $5 And $30 In his assessment, Anderson noted that this predicted rally to $200 might take many years to come to fruition. Comparing today’s price of around $2.80 to Amazon’s $5 launch point before its monumental rally, this would probably be the best time for XRP investors to accumulate for the long term. For younger investors, holding XRP for the next 10 to 15 years could prove transformative, with as little as 10,000 XRP amounting to $1 million in value if the cryptocurrency eventually climbs to $100. Despite his long-term forecast, Anderson is more cautious about what XRP might achieve this cycle. He stated that while a push to $100 in the near term would be “absolutely insane”, a more realistic target for this bull run could lie between $5 and $30. After that, he expects another correction to set in before the rally resumes sometime around the end of the decade. Related Reading: MemeCore Explodes 3,800% For ATH — But Is A Collapse Around The Corner? Anderson also left room for a more explosive scenario, noting that XRP could deliver what he called a “giga rally” if liquidity rushes into the market faster than expected. This is based on the growing anticipation around the adoption of ISO 20022 by the US Federal Reserve. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.81.

Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally Thumzup Raises $50 Million The new cash will help fund a pending acquisition of Dogehash Technologies, a deal that calls for Thumzup to issue 30.7 million shares to Dogehash shareholders. Once the transaction closes, the mining firm is set to be renamed Dogehash Technologies Holdings and is expected to trade on Nasdaq under the XDOG ticker. Part of the raised money will buy 1,000 mining machines, company officials said.

Learn more about this strategic… pic.twitter.com/fvzs4W4p4u — Thumzup Media Corporation (@thumz_up) September 4, 2025 Dogecoin Mining Push Reports have disclosed that Thumzup described the mining effort as aggressive. The move ties mining assets and capital markets together in one package. Some details remain unclear. For example, the timetable for renaming and listing, and the exact delivery schedule for the 1,000 rigs, were not spelled out in the letter. Still, the plan is in motion and will be watched closely by investors. XRP Included In Corporate Treasury Beyond rigs and a Nasdaq plan, Thumzup said its board has approved building a diversified crypto treasury that will include XRP. Other assets named were Dogecoin, Solana, Ethereum, Litecoin and stablecoin USDC. No firm numbers were given on how much of any token will be held. What was revealed is that this treasury plan follows earlier cryptocurrency buys: Thumzup invested $1 million in Bitcoin in January and then made an additional $1 million purchase later that month. Companies Adding XRP To Reserves Based on reports from other firms, Thumzup is not alone. Webus International announced a $300 million XRP treasury plan in June. VivoPower, which raised $121 million from investors that include Saudi backers, has also discussed using part of that funding to hold XRP. Related Reading: MemeCore Explodes 3,800% For ATH — But Is A Collapse Around The Corner? Trident Digital has said it intends to build a $500 million XRP reserve. Those moves are being watched by market participants because they change how some firms think about holding crypto on their balance sheets. Investors will look for three items. First, whether the Dogehash deal closes and the 30.7 million-share exchange is completed. Second, the actual delivery and deployment of the 1,000 mining units. Third, any filings or announcements that show how much crypto Thumzup will place into its treasury and when those purchases occur. The company framed its strategy as consistent with US President Donald Trump’s stated support for boosting American crypto activity, a political point that the firm used in the shareholder letter.

With a clear foundation for an upward move now in place, all eyes are on the pivotal $3.50 resistance level. Presently, speculations are whether the bulls can summon enough momentum to push past this key hurdle, potentially unlocking a new phase of growth for SUI. Market Structure Strengthens For The Next Wave Up CryptoPulse, in his recent SUI analysis posted on X, highlighted how the token tapped perfectly into the $3.30 support zone. As anticipated, buyers quickly defended this zone, stepping in with strong momentum that signaled the market’s readiness to shift upward. This reaction not only confirmed $3.30 as a critical support level but also reinforced the growing confidence among bulls. Related Reading: SUI Bulls Target $3.50 After A Breakout From This Key Chart Pattern He explained that the strong bounce from this support has allowed him to position long, with the expectation of riding the next wave of upward momentum. The renewed upward pressure suggests that traders and investors alike are beginning to align with the bullish narrative. If this momentum sustains, SUI could continue building a healthy structure, forming the foundation needed for higher price targets. Looking ahead, CryptoPulse stated that his targets remain set above the $5 mark, underscoring the potential for significant upside if the breakout structure plays out as anticipated. With such a bullish move, SUI could be on track for one of its strongest rallies in months. SUI Recovers From Major Support Zone BitGuru, in an update on X, pointed out that SUI was trading around the $3.28 mark at the time of the post. This comes after the token managed to recover from recent lows where it tested a major support level, showing resilience from buyers who stepped in at a critical point. Related Reading: SUI MACD Signals Massive Rally Ahead — 400% Price Surge Possible He explained that the ability of buyers to sustain this momentum will be key to shaping the next move. If bullish pressure holds steady, SUI could advance toward the $3.50–$3.55 resistance zone, an area that may serve as the next major test for the market. A successful breakout above this range could strengthen the case for a broader upside rally. On the other hand, BitGuru stressed the importance of the $3.20 level, which is acting as a key downside protection zone. Should the price fail to maintain strength above this threshold, it would expose the market to renewed selling pressure. However, the market sentiment presently appears cautiously optimistic as SUI continues to hold its recovery momentum.

Its recent bullish run is optimistic, yet talks are shifting towards new presale tokens that will introduce real-life solutions to the crypto world. Among the leading names includes Remittix (RTX), a cross-chain DeFi token trading at $0.1030 per token, which has quickly gained popularity through its presale traction and upcoming wallet release. Solana Price Holding Strong Despite Soaring Presales Solana Price is $207.68, up by 0.33% in one day and its market capitalization is $112.34 billion. Yesterday’s 24-hour trading volume was $5.49 billion, though it declined by 6.15%. These statistics indicate sustained strength, but investors looking beyond the trendy names are searching for the next massive altcoin 2025 with strong real-life applications. That’s where Remittix has entered the spotlight. As Solana continues to solidify its place as a top cryptocurrency in which to invest currently, Remittix is gaining attention for solving a $19 trillion cross-border payments problem. Its potential to bridge the crypto and traditional banking ecosystems sets it apart from meme coins or low-cap crypto gems with no actual-world adoption plans. Remittix Presale Growth and CEX Listings Remittix (RTX) costs $0.1030 per token and has exceeded $24 million in presale so far, selling more than 645 million tokens. It stands as one of the most rapidly growing crypto presales in 2025. The platform hit a landmark when its $20 million presale target activated its first centralized exchange listing announcement on BitMart. Later on, its $22 million milestone triggered a second guaranteed listing with LBank. These early listings are significant as they give global liquidity and exposure to RTX after the completion of its presale stage. Most upcoming crypto projects struggle to get exchange commitments before going live, but Remittix has already achieved this step ahead, which also further solidifies its position as one of the best DeFi projects 2025. Keeping the Limelight on Beta Wallet Launch The biggest news for Remittix is its Q3 2025-debuting beta wallet. The product will deliver users a mobile-first experience with immediate crypto-to-fiat exchange and payouts to foreign bank accounts. The wallet will accommodate over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, highlighting Remittix as a crypto with genuine utility rather than speculative frenzy. For day-to-day remitters, businesses and freelancers, the wallet provides instant FX conversion and minimum gas fee crypto transactions, placing RTX in the most practical solution of the top crypto presale 2025 category. What’s Sustaining Remittix’s Market Demand: Over $24 million raised in presale BitMart and LBank listings already settled Wallet beta launch soon in Q3 2025 Cross-chain DeFi project solving payment issues $250,000 community giveaway is live By combining strong presale traction with guaranteed exchange listing and a nearly finished wallet, Remittix is turning out to be one of the strongest crypto under $1 to watch.

Despite the pullback, institutional inflows and whale accumulation are building underlying momentum for a potential reversal. Short-term volatility persists, but technicals and positioning indicate that ETH could soon challenge higher resistance levels. Institutional Inflows Support ETH ETH’s resilience is backed by around $450 million in ETF inflows, with BlackRock and other major players driving demand. These investments indicate that ETH is being viewed as a long-term asset, not just a short-term trade. Institutional participation provides buying interest and stability to the price action, and ETH is now in mainstream portfolios. Yesterday $ETH ETFs recorded $446M in outflows, largest since Aug 4. #Ethereum Futures under pressure too, with net taker volume sharply negative. Historically, this type of aggressive selling shows up near local tops. But imo, this time feels different. What do you think? pic.twitter.com/SMtN9y0q5b — Crypto Auris (@crypto_auris) September 6, 2025 ETF inflows also attract retail investors, who find validation in the large-scale adoption. This dual effect—whale confidence and institutional flows, creates a foundation for a more sustainable rally once resistance is cleared. Key signals fueling optimism include: $450M ETF inflows supporting market stability BlackRock’s involvement is boosting institutional adoption Growing retail interest following institutional cues Whale Accumulation Points to Recovery Large holders, or “whales,” have been quietly accumulating ETH during price dips, suggesting they see value at current levels. Historically, whale accumulation has preceded meaningful price recoveries, as these investors often act ahead of retail participants. Even with ETH slipping by more than 2% this week, accumulation patterns suggest confidence in medium- to long-term gains. For investors, this means that smart money expects ETH to break above its current barriers if the macroeconomic environment is supportive. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Price Prediction: Technical Outlook The Ethereum price prediction is slightly bearish, indic ating a descending triangle formation , with the price repeatedly testing the $4,250 support level while struggling against the $4,490 resistance. This squeeze reflects contracting volatility, often a precursor to a breakout. The 50-SMA at $4,370 is providing near-term resistance, while the 200-SMA at $3,872 anchors the broader uptrend. Candlestick formations, including Doji and spinning tops, underscore market hesitation, but the RSI at 44 indicates a subtle bullish divergence, suggesting accumulation. Ethereum Price Chart – Sourcde: Tradingview A breakout above $4,490 could launch ETH toward $4,665 and $4,865, completing the triangle structure. Conversely, failure to hold $4,250 risks a retreat to $4,070 and $3,940, with the 200-SMA at $3,872 as final support. Above $4,490, ETH could reach $4,665 and $4,865. Completing the triangle below $4,250 risks a drop to $4,070 and $3,940, with $3,872 serving as the 200-SMA, providing final support. #Ethereum ($ETH) coiling in a descending triangle — support holding at $4,250, resistance capped at $4,490. RSI shows subtle bullish divergence. Break above $4,490 could target $4,665–$4,865, while a drop below $4,250 risks $4,070. Patience is key. pic.twitter.com/atzZpAncQm — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 6, 2025 For traders, the strategy is simple: wait for confirmation. A bullish engulfing candle with volume would validate the move and three black crows near support would trigger a sell. In the long term, sustained momentum above $4,490 could propel ETH to new cycle highs, just as Bitcoin did. ETH’s next move may depend on this technical breakout. Institutional demand and whale activity are bullish, but confirmation is needed before the next leg up. If ETH clears its resistance, it could mark the start of a larger rally that solidifies its position as the leading smart contract platform in the digital economy.

The group, a kids-safety-focused non-profit, offers ratings and reviews of media and technology. The body released its review on Friday, giving details on why it labeled the platform risky for children. According to the organization, Google Gemini clearly told kids that it was a computer and not a friend–something that has been linked to helping drive delusional thinking and psychosis in emotionally vulnerable individuals–the AI also added that there was room for improvements across other fronts. In its report, Common Sense claimed that the Gemini for Under 13 and Teen Experience tiers both appeared to be adult versions of the AI under the hood. It added that the company had added only some additional safety features on top to make them different. Common Sense noted that for companies to make AI products ideally for children, they need to be built from the ground up with children in mind and not be tweaked with restrictions. Nonprofit labels Google Gemini as high risk for kids In its analysis, Common Sense said it found that Gemini could still share inappropriate and unsafe materials with children, noting that most of them may not be ready for these materials. For example, it highlighted that the model shaped information related to sex, drugs, alcohol, and other unsafe mental health advice. The latter could be particularly concerning for parents, as AI has reportedly played a role in teen self-harm in recent months. OpenAI is currently facing a wrongful death lawsuit after a teenager committed suicide after allegedly consulting with ChatGPT for months about his plans. Reports claimed that the boy was able to bypass the model’s safety guardrails, leading to the model providing information that aided him. In the past, AI companion maker Character.AI was also sued after a teen committed suicide. The mother of the boy claimed he became obsessed with the chatbot and spent months talking to it before he eventually harmed himself. The analysis comes as several leaks have indicated that Apple is reportedly considering Gemini as the large language model (LLM) that will be used to power its forthcoming AI-enabled Siri, which is expected to be released next year. In its report, Common Sense also mentioned that Gemini’s products for kids and teens also ignored the need to provide different guidance and information from what it provides to adults. As a result, both were labeled as high risk in the overall rating. Common Sense drums the need to safeguard kids “Gemini gets some basics right, but it stumbles on the details,” Common Sense Media Senior Director of AI Programs Robbie Torney said. “An AI platform for kids should meet them where they are, not take a one-size-fits-all approach to kids at different stages of development. For AI to be safe and effective for kids, it must be designed with their needs and development in mind, not just a modified version of a product built for adults,” Torney added. However, Google has pushed back against the assessment, noting that its safety features were improving. The company mentioned that it has specific safeguards in place to guide users under 18 to prevent harmful outputs. The firm also said it reviews items and consults with outside experts to improve its protections.

Analiza trendów i nowe wyzwania dla rynku memecoinów w 2025 roku,https://bitcoinist.com/kolejny-rajd-dogecoina-analiza-trendow-2025/,"Dogecoin od lat pozostaje synonimem memecoinów. W ostatnich tygodniach wokół DOGE znów zrobiło się głośno. Głównym powodem było utrzymanie kluczowego poziomu wsparcia na 0,21 USD. Swoje dołożył także pojawiające się informacje o dużych inwestycjach instytucjonalnych w infrastrukturę związaną z tą kryptowalutą. W tle tej narracji rodzi się jednak nowa fala projektów inspirowanych sukcesem Dogecoina. Jednym z nich jest Maxi Doge . Memecoin w krótkim czasie zdobył uwagę społeczności dzięki unikalnej narracji i dynamicznej przedsprzedaży. Czy DOGE rzeczywiście szykuje się do historycznego rajdu w kierunku 1–2 dolarów? Dogecoin utrzymuje wsparcie i kusi wizją super rajdu Dogecoin, według wielu analityków, znajduje się w kluczowym momencie. Ostatnie tygodnie pokazały, że kurs utrzymuje się powyżej poziomu 0,21 USD, czyli granicy, która w przeszłości wielokrotnie działała jako trampolina dla dalszych wzrostów. Eksperci wskazują także na formację cup-and-handle , która w analizie technicznej często zapowiada dynamiczne wybicie w górę. Początkowy cel to 0,30 USD, jednak najbardziej optymistyczne scenariusze zakładają, że w sprzyjających warunkach DOGE może nawet osiągnąć poziom 2 USD . Takie prognozy opierają się nie tylko na wykresach, ale także na wydarzeniach fundamentalnych. We wrześniu pojawiły się między inymi informacje o inwestycji 50 milionów dolarów w koparki Dogecoina przez Thumzup Media Corporation, firmę notowaną na Nasdaq, wspieraną przez Donalda Trumpa Jr. Donald Trump Jr.-backed Thumzup Media Corporation said in a shareholder letter it has purchased $1M in Bitcoin and authorized additional investments in DOGE, LTC, SOL, XRP, ETH, and USDC. The company also signed a definitive agreement to acquire 2,500 DOGE miners, with plans to… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 5, 2025 Dzięki temu DOGE mining może generować roczne przychody rzędu nawet 100 milionów dolarów, co zwiększa długoterminowy potencjał sieci. Czy to czas na kolejny rajd dogecoina? Instytucje i ETF-y jako paliwo dla wzrostów Nie bez znaczenia jest również otoczenie regulacyjne. Po zatwierdzeniu pierwszych ETF-ów na Bitcoina i Ethereum, rynek oczekuje, że podobny instrument inwestycyjny może wkrótce pojawić się także dla Dogecoina. Wnioski w tej sprawie złożyły już chociażby 21Shares, Bitwise i Grayscale . ETF na DOGE mógłby stać się ogromnym katalizatorem wzrostów, otwierając drzwi dla instytucji i inwestorów detalicznych, którzy dotąd nie mieli łatwego dostępu do tego rynku. Jeśli te oczekiwania się zmaterializują, niektórzy analitycy nie wykluczają powtórki z historii Bitcoina, który po zatwierdzeniu ETF-ów zwiększył swoją kapitalizację o ponad 1 bilion dolarów. Nowa fala memecoinów Choć DOGE pozostaje ikoną, rynek memecoinów dynamicznie się rozwija. Oprócz Shiba Inu czy Floki, coraz częściej mówi się o nowych projektach, które próbują wnieść świeżość do niszy krpyto. Jednym z nich jest Maxi Doge . Projekt powstał jako ultranapakowany kuzyn Dogecoina. Jego historia bazuje na idei, że Maxi to pies po siłowni, który po latach życia w cieniu swojego słynnego krewniaka postanowił wziąć sprawy w swoje ręce i zdominować rynek. Maxi Doge – co to jest? Czym jest Maxi Doge ? Wbrew pozorom to nie tylko kolejnym memecoinem z psem w logo. To projekt zbudowany na fundamencie silnej narracji, który od razu przyciągnął społeczność dynamicznym marketingiem i atrakcyjną tokenomiką. Presale zebrał już blisko 2 miliony dolarów , a inwestorzy chętnie lokują środki ze względu na rosnący kurs w kolejnych etapach przedsprzedaży oraz możliwość uzyskania wysokiego oprocentowania dzięki stakingowi. Token $MAXI działa w oparciu o sieć Ethereum, a jego twórcy zaplanowali rozbudowaną roadmapę obejmującą listingi na DEX-ach i CEX-ach, partnerstwa z influencerami oraz wprowadzenie handlu z dźwignią nawet do 1000x. To sprawia, że część inwestorów zastanawia się, jakie altcoiny kupić ? Wśród typowych propozycji znajdują się oczywiście Ethereum czy Solana. Trzeba jednak przyznać, że memecoiny takie jak Maxi Doge zaczynają odgrywać coraz ważniejszą rolę w portfelach traderów szukających wysokiego ryzyka i jeszcze wyższych potencjalnych zysków. ODWIEDŹ OFICJALNĄ STRONĘ MAXI DOGE Tokenomika i unikalne cechy Maxi Doge Maxi Doge wyróżnia się na tle innych memecoinów kilkoma kluczowymi elementami: Mocna narracja – historia o kuzynie DOGE jest prosta, zabawna i łatwa do rozpowszechniania w sieci. Staking od startu – nagrody sięgające kilkuset procent rocznie w fazie presale to rzadkość w świecie memecoinów. MAXI Fund – 25% podaży tokenów przeznaczono na marketing i partnerstwa, co ma zapewnić długoterminowe budowanie marki. Społeczność – projekt celuje w traderów, którzy lubią ryzyko i intensywne tempo działania, co buduje lojalną grupę hodlerów. Dzięki tym cechom wielu komentatorów uważa, że Maxi Doge może w krótkim czasie dołączyć do grona projektów określanych mianem najlepsze nowe memecoiny . Dogecoin kontra Maxi Doge, rywalizacja o miano króla memecoinów Porównując DOGE i MAXI, można zauważyć interesujący kontrast. Dogecoin to projekt z 10-letnią historią, ogromną rozpoznawalnością i rosnącym zainteresowaniem instytucji. Z kolei Maxi Doge dopiero rozpoczyna swoją drogę, ale dysponuje energią i świeżością, które mogą przyciągnąć nową falę inwestorów. Nie jest tajemnicą, że memecoiny często zyskują głównie dzięki narracji i sile społeczności. Jeśli DOGE utrzyma wsparcie i skorzysta na potencjalnym ETF-ie, może czekać go kolejny rozdział dynamicznych wzrostów. Jednak równolegle projekty takie jak Maxi Doge stanowią alternatywę dla inwestorów, którzy chcą wejść na rynek wcześniej i poszukać okazji o wyższym potencjale zwrotu. Rok 2025 może okazać się przełomowy dla rynku memecoinów. Dogecoin stoi przed szansą historycznego rajdu, który dochodząc do skutku wprowadzi go na zupełnie inny poziom. Instytucjonalne inwestycje, możliwe ETF-y oraz pozytywne sygnały techniczne budują mocny fundament pod przyszłe wzrosty.

And now, analysts are seeing if ADA is likely to be returned to a $2 area by 2025. Many speculators are now looking for alternative plays with the rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE next to ADA. Whale Accumulation Suggests Growing Confidence Recent publications highlight a rise in ADA whales, with large investors accumulating over 150 million ADA in the past few weeks. This inflow has served to solidify prices around $0.85 and diminished the downside risk while it contributes to bullish sentiment. The buildup indicates whales are preparing for a potential breakout. Such on-chain activity tends to be a precursor to price rallies. If that buying trend persists, ADA might catch the eye of larger market players. Analysts now refer to this pattern when discussing Cardano’s potential to reach $2 in 2025. Technical Patterns Align with $2 Target Both on-chain sentiment and technical signals are starting to stack up for Cardano. Analysts have seen a symmetrical triangle develop (after a period of contraction). A breakout from this structure could also drive ADA past important resistance areas. If it maintains the momentum, ADA can also push above $1.10 towards the $1.50 to $2.00 range by 2025, according to another prediction. Past cycles show that Cardano can gain strong momentum when technicals, network growth, and demand align. If these bullish patterns work and sentiment improves, a $2 target is no longer a stretch. Fundamental Drivers Back the Upside Path In essence, Cardano is forging forward with innovations like decentralized governance and ecosystem scalability. Its proof-of-stake network is energy-efficient, with active developer support. These sustained improvements provide a plausible price prediction and are consistent with the idea of an increased value for ADA. MAGACOIN FINANCE Shows Up in Broader Crypto Conversation ADA’s selling point is rooted in development and investor interest. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the most promising speculative token in the altcoin discussions. Its distinct branding and analyst buzz suggest that the token is gaining traction. Investors intrigued by ADA’s structural growth could also explore MAGACOIN FINANCE for diversification into narrative-driven opportunities. Conclusion Cardano’s path to $2 in 2025 is shaped by a combination of whale activity, supportive developer community, and ongoing development on its chain. While ADA’s fundamentals and on-chain demand align for a potential rally, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a speculative option for those balancing risk with upside interest.

While some traders still see upside, others are looking elsewhere—especially as Ethereum-based meme coins like Layer Brett begin stealing the speculative spotlight. With one stuck in neutral and the other gaining viral traction, the question isn’t just “where’s the smart money going?”—it’s “who still has room to run?” XRP (XRP): Ripple stagnates as XRP price prediction is still stuck in no-man’s land For all the excitement that Ripple brings to the table, the current XRP price prediction landscape is a mess. Some analysts are eyeing a bullish breakout, while others point to weakening momentum, warning that a drop below $2.80 could trigger a much steeper correction. Either way, the technicals aren’t giving a clear signal. The fundamentals don’t help much either. Sure, Ripple has regulatory clarity after the SEC drama, and institutional interest is on the rise. But on-chain activity is flat, retail volume is lagging, and the whales? They’re trimming positions, not adding. Even the strongest Ripple bulls are admitting that the upside isn’t what it used to be. Back when XRP was trading in the cents, it had room to grow. Now, with a multi-billion dollar market cap and a crowded Layer 1 landscape, the numbers don’t favour explosive gains. You might double your money on a lucky run, but that’s a far cry from the life-changing returns that altcoin hunters are chasing. For every fresh Ripple headline, another group of traders seems to drift toward newer, cheaper tokens. XRP price prediction chatter may still dominate analyst feeds, but on the ground floor of crypto Twitter, attention is shifting—especially toward a certain Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin that’s still trading at a fraction of a cent. Layer Brett (LBRETT): The meme coin that’s capturing Ripple’s castaways While Ripple dominates the old guard headlines, Layer Brett is quietly building a different kind of momentum—one that doesn’t rely on court cases, ETFs, or institutional buy-ins. This Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin has taken a familiar formula—cheap entry, community hype, meme power—and strapped it to a genuinely fast and scalable blockchain. The result? A project that moves like a meme coin but operates like a Layer 2 crypto built for actual utility. Layer Brett boasts lightning-fast transactions, gas fees measured in cents (not dollars), and a live staking dApp already dishing out sky-high rewards. At the time of writing, APY is still hovering around 900%—and while that’ll drop as more users stake, early backers are getting real-time returns that make even the best crypto presales look tame. And let’s be honest—Ripple might be respectable, but nobody’s posting XRP memes. Layer Brett, on the other hand, leans all the way into meme culture: viral branding, NFT tie-ins, gamified staking. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s a vibe. That’s why Layer Brett is where the energy is going. Traders who feel priced out of large caps like Ripple are grabbing tens of thousands of LBRETT tokens for what they’d spend on lunch. Conclusion There’s no doubt Ripple still has a role to play, but even the boldest XRP price prediction can’t touch the upside potential of something like Layer Brett . When a meme coin builds actual tech, rewards early adopters, and gets traction on social channels, it’s worth paying attention.

Among the ambitious projections, the one that stands out is his expectation for XRP to reach $300. At present, XRP trades near $2.82, which means such a move would represent one of the most significant upside scenarios in the digital asset market. While he outlined bullish targets for other assets, such as Solana and Ethereum, the question on the minds of many investors is whether XRP could achieve the price level he outlined. IN THE NEXT PUMP → ALTCOIN TARGETS $ETH → $25,000 $SOL → $2,000 $XRP → $300 $DOGE →$5 $SUI → $10 $HYPE → $400 $WLFI → $10 $PENGU → $10 WHAT ELSE AM I MISSING? — Whale.Guru (@Whale_Guru) September 4, 2025 Comparing the Current Landscape The scale of the forecast becomes evident when the numbers are compared directly. XRP would need to climb more than 100 times from its current level to achieve $300. This target may appear extreme in the short term, but the broader market context helps explain why such bold estimates are being circulated. The cryptocurrency market has a history of explosive growth during altseasons , when capital rotates rapidly into non-Bitcoin assets. Should a new altseason emerge, tokens with deep liquidity and institutional interest, such as XRP, could benefit disproportionately. Catalysts Supporting the Outlook Several potential catalysts are fueling optimism around XRP’s prospects. First, the U.S. Federal Reserve is increasingly expected to cut interest rates on September 17 . Lower borrowing costs often encourage risk-taking and can lead to greater flows into digital assets. Liquidity shifts driven by monetary policy could therefore provide a supportive backdrop for XRP. Second, speculation continues to build around the approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. Analysts see the decision window opening in October when the SEC has deadlines to decide on multiple filings. An ETF would make XRP more accessible to traditional investors and could drive demand significantly higher. Market observers widely agree that such a development would act as a game-changing factor for liquidity and price discovery. Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg has predicted that XRP ETFs will see inflows of $5 billion in the first month .

This ambitious projection has generated considerable interest and excitement. Some experts have predicted even higher targets, suggesting the digital asset could hit $10,000 by 2030 , making $300 an easily achievable milestone in its long-term trajectory. For now, XRP continues to hold its ground near $2.82 while market participants prepare for what could be a pivotal few months ahead.

BAY Miner launches stable dollar contracts, becoming a new option for investors New York, September 6, 2025 — As the crypto market regains momentum, XRP has once again come into focus. Some analysts predict that if macroeconomic conditions and cross-border payment adoption continue to expand, XRP could potentially challenge the $5 mark in 2026. Against this backdrop, global cloud mining platform BAY Miner announced the launch of USD-denominated contracts, providing investors with a stable and transparent participation channel. Market Context As one of the leading tokens for cross-border payments, XRP has shown resilience amid recent market volatility. Institutional participation and a clearer regulatory environment have boosted confidence in XRP’s mid- to long-term outlook. However, uncertainty persists, and investors are seeking tools that can balance long-term potential with short-term stability. BAY Miner’s Solution By virtualizing hashrate to the cloud, BAY Miner eliminates the need for hardware ownership or maintenance. All contracts are USD-denominated, meaning earnings and costs are shielded from direct crypto price fluctuations, offering stability and clarity. Key features include: – USD-denominated contracts: returns displayed in stable dollar terms, insulated from volatility – Automated daily settlements: simplifying participation with clear visibility of earnings – Multi-asset support: BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE – Compliance & security: AML/KYC adherence, McAfee® protections, Cloudflare® DDoS defense – Global reach: serving users in 180+ countries with multilingual support – Sustainable hashrate: prioritizing renewable energy sources, in line with ESG principles How to Get Started Investors can begin in three simple steps: 1. Visit the website or download the mobile app, complete registration and KYC verification; 2. Select XRP (or other major assets) and choose a contract plan (short-term, long-term, or advanced); 3. Start cloud mining with one tap—earnings are USD-denominated and settled daily. Official Statement “XRP investors are looking for tools that preserve long-term growth potential while offering stable cash flow,” said [Spokesperson Name], spokesperson for BAY Miner. “Our USD-denominated contracts are designed exactly for that purpose—giving investors clearer earnings visibility in volatile markets.” User Feedback An XRP investor based in London commented: “I remain bullish on XRP in the long run, but short-term volatility makes cash-flow management difficult. BAY Miner’s USD contracts give me a clearer, more stable return alongside my XRP holdings.” Conclusion As momentum builds around XRP, BAY Miner’s USD-denominated contracts offer investors a more stable option. With its compliance framework, security safeguards, and global reach, BAY Miner is positioning itself as a trusted platform in turbulent markets.

In a post on X, he shared a candid personal experience that reveals how little the broader public still understands about the cryptocurrency landscape. “Yesterday I was having beer with a couple of old friends… and I was waiting to hear the words like XRP , HBAR, XLM, VET, FIL, DOT, DAG, XDC, VELO, VRA …. And so on, but NADA. NOTHING. Trust me, we are still early,” he wrote. Bitcoin and Ethereum Still Dominate the Conversation Egrag explained that during the gathering, his friends — working across industries such as furniture, IT in education, and FMCG trading — spoke only about Bitcoin and Ethereum . They regretted not buying Bitcoin when it was $300 or $3,000, and one mentioned reading a prediction that Ethereum could climb to $30,000. Yet not a single person mentioned XRP or any other altcoin . As Egrag emphasized, “NADA. NOTHING.” Real story: Yesterday was having beer with couple of old friends and some work in furniture industry, some in the sales of pre-owned cars others in IT in educational services and some in general FMCG trading and non are aware that the new shift is happening and all they care… pic.twitter.com/Kjcl3h0rMK — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 6, 2025 This scenario mirrors what surveys have shown for years: public recognition of crypto remains narrowly focused. Bitcoin is almost universally known, Ethereum is familiar to a smaller but significant group, and most other digital assets, regardless of their institutional use cases or technological promise, rarely enter mainstream conversations. Community Response: Mr. Spock and Egrag Align Egrag’s anecdote sparked discussion across the XRP community. Commenting on the post, fellow analyst Mr. Spock observed: “Most people barely know what SWIFT is. Most people associate crypto with Bitcoin or Ethereum; they’ve often never heard of the other cryptocurrencies, or they seem uninterested because of their ‘low’ prices. Most people won’t ask about XRP & Co. until the prices are too high, because people only value supposedly expensive things.” Egrag immediately supported the point, responding: “100% I totally agree with you.” Their exchange underscores a shared conviction that mass recognition of XRP and other utility-driven assets will only arrive later, when prices have already climbed significantly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why “We Are Still Early” Rings True Market data strengthens Egrag’s claim. XRP currently trades near $2.80, supported by a market capitalization of more than $160 billion. Despite its size and liquidity, it remains overlooked outside crypto circles. This gap between real-world scale and public awareness suggests there is still ample room for growth — the essence of being “early.” Egrag’s credibility also stems from his consistent technical analysis, where he lays out Fibonacci targets, dominance charts, and structured profit-taking strategies. By blending personal anecdotes with data-driven market insights, he highlights both the sentiment and the strategy that long-term XRP holders should keep in mind. Egrag Crypto’s simple story — a night out with friends where XRP and other major altcoins never entered the discussion — serves as proof of his message: “Trust me, we are still early.” While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate mainstream chatter, projects like XRP remain largely undiscovered by the wider public. For investors, the takeaway is clear: mass adoption has not yet begun, and the biggest opportunities lie ahead.

Even crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were one of the major reasons behind the market surge, are now witnessing huge inflows. Ether ETFs posted their second-worst day on record and their fifth straight session of outflows. September 5 saw Ether ETFs hitting almost $447 million in net outflows. This comes after posting its biggest outflow of $465 million on August 4. However, Ethereum price has surged by over 15% in the last 30 days. Bitcoin ETFs drop $160M in outflows The sell-off saw crypto funds (both Bitcoin and Ether) lose $607 million in a day. The reversal comes after a blockbuster August, when the same products attracted $3.2 billion combined inflows. However, Ether ETFs had hit $3.87 billion by themselves for the month, and it was BTC ETFs that dragged the momentum with $751 million of outflows. Bitcoin ETFs saw $160 million in outflows on Friday as all twelve listed products failed to post gains. The funds recorded $227.5 million outflow on the previous day. Ark 21Shares’ ARKB led the bleed with $125.5 million of withdrawals, while Fidelity’s FBTC logged $117.5 million in outflows. Only BlackRock’s IBIT managed to attract fresh money with $134.8 million of inflows. BTC price dropped marginally over the last 24 hours to trade around $110,700. Its trading volume remains stable at $49 billion. Bitcoin has seen a rollercoaster ride lately as it gained more than 2% in the last 7 days while dropping about 5% over the past 30 days. Ethereum sheds $400 million Data shows BlackRock’s ETHA led the Ether ETFs’ pullback on September 5, hemorrhaging $309.8 million. The sell-off spread to Grayscale’s ETHE and Fidelity’s FETH with outflows of $51.7 million and $37.7 million, respectively. Ethereum spot ETFs outflow on September 5. Source: SoSoValue Ethereum has suffered a bit over the last 7 days with a 2% drop. ETH slipped 5% on Friday after weaker-than-expected US jobs data rattled markets all around. However, the altcoin leader’s price is still up by 68% over the past 60 days. It is trading at an average price of $4,299, down by 13% from its all-time high. Analysts are watching whether the $4,000 level will be retested if sentiment continues to erode. Market sentiment remains balanced as investors are still finding clues.

Heavy volume confirmed resistance at those levels, while buyers reappeared in the $2.81–$2.83 range to stabilize price action. The move keeps XRP locked in a 47-day consolidation under $3.00, with traders now eyeing the $2.77 support pivot and October’s SEC ETF decisions as the next catalysts. News Background Six institutional asset managers have filed spot XRP ETF applications, with SEC decisions expected in October. Whale accumulation continues, with roughly 340 million tokens purchased in recent weeks despite persistent volatility. Exchange balances remain elevated above 3.5 billion XRP, raising questions of potential supply pressure if selling resumes. Federal Reserve policy shifts and inflation prints are shaping broader liquidity conditions across risk assets. Previous attempts to break higher saw 227.7 million tokens trade near $2.88–$2.89, confirming that zone as firm resistance. Price Action Summary XRP traded within a $0.08 range from $2.81 to $2.89, representing 3% volatility. The sharpest decline came at 14:00 on Sept 5, dropping from $2.88 to $2.81 on nearly 280 million tokens traded. Stabilization followed, with consolidation between $2.82 and $2.83 on lighter volume. Closing price near $2.82 kept XRP just above the $2.77 support pivot, viewed as the next key downside guardrail. Technical Analysis Support: Strong bid zone identified at $2.77–$2.81 following repeated defenses. Resistance: Immediate ceiling at $2.88–$2.89, with $3.00 psychological level and $3.30 breakout threshold above. Indicators: RSI sits mid-50s, reflecting neutral-to-bullish bias. MACD histogram converges toward bullish crossover, signaling possible momentum shift if volume returns. Structure: Ongoing 47-day consolidation under $3.00, with a close above $3.30 opening potential path to $4.00+. What Traders Are Watching Whether $2.77 holds as the decisive support level if selling resumes. Price behavior on retests of $2.88–$2.89 resistance, particularly if volume surpasses daily averages.

June was revised to show job losses, while July improved slightly. Despite the slowdown, the unemployment rate sits at 4.3%, but the broader U6 measure—counting part-time and discouraged workers—is closer to 8% , showing more weakness under the surface. In contrast, the ISM services index , which makes up 72% of the economy, stayed solid. New orders and business activity point to ongoing growth, while rising prices hint that inflation could heat up again. Historically, ISM price trends show up in CPI with a lag of three to four months. For crypto, the mix is complicated. Weaker jobs data could push the Fed toward rate cuts , a potential boost for Bitcoin and other risk assets.

Trump Media Strategic Cronos (CRO) Partnership According to a press release on September 5, Trump Media will acquire 684.4 million CRO at about $0.153 per token. The payment structure is 50% stock and 50% cash, and both the CRO tokens and Trump Media shares received will be subject to a lockup period (i.e., cannot be sold immediately). This tranche represents about 2% of CRO’s circulating supply, separate from an additional 19% of supply that Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, Inc. (a related entity) is set to acquire. Commenting on this deal, Trump Media’s CEO and Chairman, Devin Nunes, has shared much potential of CRO in alignment with the company’s strategic goals. Nunes said: Trump Media is pleased to close this agreement and quickly begin to fulfill our strategic partnership with Crypto.com. We’re convinced that CRO has tremendous potential to spread widely as a versatile utility token and a superior form of safe, fast payment and money transfer, and we’re excited to add this innovative asset to our balance sheet. Notably, the American media company will custody the tokens using Crypto.com Custody, which also allows them to stake CRO for yield (extra revenue). Crypto.com Co-Founder Kris Marszalek shares much optimism on this aspect of the deal, lauding the utility of the CRO token. Marszalek said: This is the first of many steps to driving utility and value for CRO and the Cronos blockchain. We are proud to provide support to Trump Media with our best-in-class custody solution and generate additional value through CRO’s staking model. Meanwhile, the purchase agreement also presents a clause that allows Truth Social to adopt CRO as a pioneering reward system using Crypto.com wallet infrastructure. CRO Price Overview At the time of writing, CRO is trading at $0.26810, down by 0.95% in the past 24 hours, culminating in a 16.42% loss over the week. Alongside this purchase deal with Crypto.com, Truth Social’s parent company unveiled Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, Inc., a new entity set to merge with SPAC Yorkville Acquisition Corp to form a dedicated treasury vehicle focused on acquiring and managing CRO.",Crypto News|Cronos|CROUSDT|Crypto.com|Trump Media|Truth Social,EN,0,0,CRO|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 13:30:23

The bloc charged the tech company, arguing that it exploited its advantage over rivals by favoring its own advertising technology services. Trump highlighted that the EU has targeted another U.S. company, Google, with a $3.5 billion fine. He argued that the financial demands from the bloc on U.S. companies could otherwise be of better use to American jobs and investments. Trump accuses the EU of targeting U.S. tech companies with fines ""Very unfair, and the American Taxpayer will not stand for it! As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand."" – President Donald J. Trump pic.twitter.com/ZIU7VXTgfi — The White House (@WhiteHouse) September 5, 2025 The President said the EU has charged Google’s Alphabet with a total of $16.5 billion, after the company had already settled $13 billion in false claims. He accused the bloc of issuing several fines and taxes against Google and other U.S. tech companies. The bloc’s recent $3.5 billion charge accounts for its highest charges and is also the second-highest against Google for alleged abuses of dominance. Trump said the EU’s actions are very unfair, and the U.S. will not condone them. According to the President, Apple has also faced a $17 billion fine from the bloc, which he believes should not have been charged. He argued that the tech company should be refunded. Trump also warned that he will be forced to introduce a Section 301 proceeding due to the continued fines from Europe to nullify the unfair penalties being charged on U.S. companies. “The European Union must stop this practice against American Companies, IMMEDIATELY.” – Donald Trump , U.S. President. The U.S. President has previously invoked 301 probes on Brazil targeting its imports in response to the country’s prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump warned earlier this month that he would impose levies on nations that impose digital taxes, rules, or regulations against U.S. organizations. According to Trump, top U.S. executives raised the issue of digital taxes and fines during a dinner at the White House on Thursday. He told reporters Friday that executives, including Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Meta Platform’s Mark Zuckerberg, all complained about the Commission’s charges. EU accuses Google of abusing its digital ads dominance The European Commission stated Friday that the U.S. tech giant had abused its dominance in the digital ads market by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage. The Commission also called for an end to the U.S. tech giant’s ad practices. EU antitrust Commissioner, Teresa Ribera, argued that public entities should push to eliminate dominant players from their power, especially when markets fail. She believes that the space requires a level playing field for every party to compete on equal terms and for citizens to have a right to choose. Google’s Alphabet plans to petition the EU’s fines. Vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, Lee-Anne Mulholland, argued that the bloc’s claims impose an unjustified fine and would hurt thousands of EU businesses. She stated that the charges would make it hard for businesses in the bloc to generate income. The recent fine has elevated Google’s EU liabilities to roughly 10 billion euros, which is far higher than charges against other U.S. tech giants. Research firm EMarketer estimates that the U.S. tech giant will earn about $205.04 million in digital ad revenue in 2025. According to the report, $171.72 billion will come from Google’s global search advertising business. The report also revealed that the remaining $33.33 billion will come from its display ads. The European Publishers Council argued that the EU’s fine on Google is not enough to fix Europe’s broken adtech market. The council’s executive director, Angela Mills Wade, believes that Google will continue to bear the hits as business costs as it continues to dominate the ads space.

Key Takeaways: Robinhood shares jumped 7% after being added to the S&P 500, joining the index on September 22. Strategy, despite a $95B valuation and $70B in Bitcoin holdings, was left out of the reshuffle. Robinhood posted strong Q2 earnings, with $989M in revenue and $386M in profit. Robinhood (HOOD) closed just above $101 and soared past $108 in extended trading following the announcement. The company’s share price has climbed over 150% year-to-date, driven by strong earnings and growing retail interest in stocks and crypto. Robinhood to Join S&P 500 on September 22 Robinhood will officially join the index on September 22 , alongside ad-tech firm AppLovin, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. While Robinhood celebrates its inclusion, Strategy, the Bitcoin treasury firm formerly known as MicroStrategy, was left off the list, despite meeting S&P’s $20 billion market cap requirement. Strategy, which now holds more than $70 billion in Bitcoin, saw its shares fall 3% in after-hours trading following the announcement. The omission surprised some observers, given Strategy’s $95 billion valuation and its pioneering role in bringing Bitcoin to public balance sheets. Based in Tysons Corner, Virginia, the company has become synonymous with corporate crypto adoption. The S&P reshuffle comes amid rising institutional interest in digital assets and a more favorable political environment.

Robinhood’s strong fundamentals further fueled its rally. In Q2, the company posted $989 million in revenue, up 45% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates. Net income hit $386 million, with earnings per share of $0.42, well above analyst forecasts. Crypto trading revenue came in at $160 million, nearly doubling year-over-year but down from the previous quarter’s $252 million. Meanwhile, income from options trading and equities reached $265 million and $66 million, respectively, making options Robinhood’s top revenue stream once again. Robinhood Sues Nevada, New Jersey Regulators Over Event Contracts Last month, Robinhood Derivatives took legal action against regulators in Nevada and New Jersey, accusing the states of unfairly blocking its entry into the sports event contracts market, despite recent federal court rulings in favor of rival platform Kalshi. The firm said it began offering event contracts in both states after federal judges ruled earlier this year that Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulators could not enforce their bans against Kalshi, which offers contracts regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Robinhood argued that regulators have ignored those rulings and continued to threaten enforcement action, creating an uneven playing field. “If state regulators are permitted to act against Robinhood but not Kalshi, then Robinhood will lose out in the sports event contracts space,” the company said in its filings. Meanwhile, Robinhood has come under regulatory fire in the EU after launching tokenized stock products linked to private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. The Bank of Lithuania confirmed it is investigating the legality and investor disclosures related to these blockchain-based “Stock Tokens,” which launched on June 30. OpenAI publicly disavowed any connection, stating it never approved the tokens and warning investors to be cautious.

SharpLink Gaming co-CEO Joseph Chalom pointed to one key factor – “Ethereum took longer to explain because it wasn’t Bitcoin.” Ethereum’s Slow Burn In a recent conversation with Bankless, Chalom said that with Bitcoin, institutions were introduced to a simple narrative – digital gold. It was a scarce asset with a decade-long track record, largely uncorrelated with equities and fixed income, and capable of delivering asymmetric upside. That clarity allowed wealth managers, pension funds, and advisors to understand where Bitcoin fits within a portfolio. Ethereum, on the other hand, required a deeper conversation. It wasn’t Bitcoin, and so its story couldn’t rest on the “digital gold” comparison. Instead, explaining Ethereum meant educating institutions on a broader vision: the digitization of ownership and the decentralization of finance. Chalom, who left asset manager BlackRock to lead SharpLink, said that investing in ETH is similar to investing in the early days of the internet. Web 1 built foundational networks, Web 2 enabled commerce and interaction, and now Ethereum represents the infrastructure for a Web 3 world where real-world assets, DeFi, and stablecoins converge. That narrative resonates, but it is far more complex, the exec added. “Just like you saw Web 1, a decade-long trend, and then Web 2, in a more commerce and interactive way, you can think of this being the decentralization of finance. And if this is a token that is going to help benefit and secure that, it’s been not harder for people to understand that it doesn’t take convincing, but it does takes a heck of a lot more education.” Driving the Future of Finance, Not Just Accumulation Ethereum can act as a store of value and has even entered deflationary phases, yet Chalom said that its true role is tied to powering this next-generation financial system. The SharpLink exec stressed that for ETH treasury companies, the responsibility is not just accumulating ETH but also educating investors about its place in this long-term transformation. Over time, as understanding grows, so will adoption – and when we look back a decade from now, Chalom argued, Ethereum’s price will have followed the reality of its expanding role. With $3.6 billion in Ethereum, Sharplink Gaming is the world’s second-largest public ETH holder, trailing only BitMine Immersion Technologies at a little over $8 billion.

The potential for tokenizing car reservations is emerging as a game-changer, promising to transform how we book vehicles and potentially unlock a multi-trillion dollar market. This innovative approach uses blockchain technology to streamline inefficient reservation systems, directly tackling high consumer dissatisfaction with current waiting lists and premium prices for new car orders. Why Are We Talking About Tokenizing Car Reservations Now? Current vehicle reservation systems are often opaque, with long, unpredictable waiting lists. Deposits get tied up, and transferring a reservation can be complex. This lack of flexibility and clarity creates significant pain points for buyers. Blockchain can make the process transparent and efficient. Your deposit becomes a token held in an on-chain escrow, a simple shift with profound implications: Transparency: Every step is recorded on an immutable ledger. Flexibility: Consumers can freely trade their queue position. Efficiency: Reduced friction and middlemen. How Does Tokenizing Car Reservations Actually Work? Tokenizing car reservations involves creating a unique digital token representing the right to a specific vehicle reservation. This token is verifiable and programmable, detailing the model, trim, and delivery window. When a deposit is made, it’s locked into a smart contract, and a corresponding token is issued. This token proves your place in the queue. If you no longer need the reservation, you can sell your token on a decentralized marketplace to another buyer. This creates a liquid market for reservations, benefiting consumers with flexibility and automakers optimizing sales. Early token holders might even see their reservation value appreciate if vehicle demand surges. Are Automakers Ready for Tokenizing Car Reservations ? The automotive industry is already exploring blockchain. BMW and Mercedes, for instance, are experimenting with it for supply chain management, automated payments, and decentralized identity. These initiatives signal a readiness for broader adoption, including tokenizing car reservations . Beyond cars, the potential for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is vast. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) projects this market could reach an astonishing $16 trillion by 2030. This application extends to: Hotel room bookings, allowing flexible transfers. Concert tickets, combating scalping. Medical equipment bookings, optimizing resources. The vision of tokenizing car reservations offers a compelling glimpse into a more efficient, transparent, and consumer-friendly future. By transforming a frustrating process into a dynamic, tradable asset, blockchain technology stands to unlock significant value and redefine our relationship with reservations across multiple industries. This isn’t just a niche idea; it’s a foundational shift with the power to reshape multi-trillion dollar markets. Frequently Asked Questions About Tokenizing Car Reservations Q: What is a tokenized car reservation? A: A digital asset on a blockchain representing the right to a specific vehicle reservation, including deposit and queue position. Q: How does this benefit consumers? A: It offers transparency, the ability to trade or sell reservations, and eliminates opaque waiting list frustrations. Q: Are automakers currently using this? A: Major automakers are exploring blockchain for other uses (supply chain, payments), showing readiness for innovations like tokenized reservations. Q: Can this concept be applied elsewhere? A: Yes, RWA tokenization can extend to hotel rooms, concert tickets, and medical equipment bookings, creating efficient secondary markets.

Analyst Proves With 8-Year Trendline,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-13-analyst-proves-with-8-year-trendline/,"An analyst known as Papa has reignited discussion about XRP’s long-term potential by publishing an eight-year trendline chart on X. His analysis connects XRP’s historic peaks in 2017 and 2021, extending into 2026, and projects a possible move into the $10–$13 range . The chart has quickly gained traction among traders who view it as a compelling structural roadmap for XRP’s next cycle. The Structure of the 8-Year Trendline Papa’s chart applies a classic method of drawing resistance diagonals across multi-year swing highs. In XRP’s case, the surge in early 2018, which topped just below $4, and the rally peaks of 2021 both align neatly on a sloping trendline. Extending this diagonal forward intersects in the $10–$13 zone , suggesting that if XRP continues to respect its historical structure, this range could be a natural long-term target. At present, XRP trades around $2.80, consolidating below the $3 psychological barrier. This area has acted as a structural pivot before, and price behavior here will be critical in determining whether the token gathers the strength needed to climb higher along the projected path. $XRP 8 year trendline targeting 10-13 $ pic.twitter.com/o7vTAZzUFR — papa (@mamagucci) September 6, 2025 Key Levels to Watch For Papa’s broader projection to remain intact, XRP must secure sustained weekly closes above $2.85–$3.20 . This range has repeatedly capped rallies, making it a decisive hurdle. A confirmed breakout, backed by volume and liquidity, could open the way toward $4.50. That level would serve as the first validation of the long-term scenario. If momentum carries XRP beyond $4.50, the next critical checkpoint lies at $6.50 , another historical rejection zone. A successful breach there would substantially increase the probability of XRP reaching double-digit territory as outlined by the extended trendline. Why the Analysis Resonates The appeal of Papa’s projection lies in its alignment with XRP’s past behavior. Over multiple cycles, the token has consistently reacted to this long-term diagonal, either reversing sharply or entering prolonged consolidation. This repeated pattern reinforces its credibility as a technical guide. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s price history also features extended accumulation phases that often precede impulsive rallies. The current sideways structure around $2.80 resembles past pre-breakout setups, raising the possibility that a similar surge could unfold once resistance is cleared. Risks to the Outlook As with any technical projection, risks remain. A failure to hold support near $2.50 would weaken the bullish case, potentially dragging XRP back into wider consolidation. Similarly, attempted breakouts without strong confirmation from volume and liquidity could result in false moves, keeping the token locked in its current range instead of advancing toward Papa’s targets. Looking Ahead Papa’s eight-year trendline offers a bold yet technically grounded vision for XRP. The immediate challenge is to break through the $3.20 barrier, followed by sustained progress toward $4.50 and $6.50. Success at these checkpoints would add weight to the long-term outlook of $10–$13, turning the projection from a charting scenario into a viable target that traders and investors can monitor closely.

This projection, hot on the heels of Friday’s pivotal non-farm payrolls report, signals a potential shift in monetary policy that could ripple through the global economy. For investors, businesses, and even everyday consumers, understanding these predicted Fed rate cuts is crucial for navigating the months ahead. What Exactly Are Fed Rate Cuts, and Why Do They Matter? When the Federal Reserve (the Fed) decides on interest rates, they’re essentially setting the cost of borrowing money. A ‘rate cut’ means they are lowering their benchmark interest rate, making it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Fed. In turn, this can lead to lower interest rates on loans for consumers and businesses, such as mortgages, car loans, and business credit lines. Stimulating the Economy: Lower rates typically encourage borrowing and spending, which can boost economic activity. Inflation Management: Historically, rate cuts are considered when inflation is under control or the economy needs a push. Market Reactions: Financial markets, including stocks, bonds, and even cryptocurrencies, often react significantly to changes in interest rate expectations. Barclays specifically expects each of these upcoming Fed rate cuts to be 0.25 percentage points. Their forecast extends beyond this year, projecting two additional cuts in March and June of 2026. This long-term view provides a clearer picture of their economic outlook. What’s Driving Barclays’ Optimistic Outlook for Fed Rate Cuts? The recent non-farm payrolls report plays a key role in Barclays’ analysis. While a strong jobs report might typically suggest the economy is robust enough to handle higher rates, the nuances within the data, combined with other economic indicators, are painting a different picture for the investment bank. Factors like cooling inflation, subtle shifts in wage growth, and a generally stabilizing labor market are likely contributing to their belief that the Fed will have room to ease its monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) continuously assesses a wide array of economic data to make its decisions. Barclays’ economists believe that the current trajectory of these indicators supports a move towards lower borrowing costs, aiming to achieve a ‘soft landing’ – bringing inflation down without triggering a severe recession. How Might These Anticipated Fed Rate Cuts Impact Your Finances? The prospect of lower interest rates carries implications across various financial aspects: Borrowing Costs: If you’re planning to take out a mortgage, a car loan, or use credit, lower rates could mean more affordable monthly payments. This is a direct benefit for consumers and can stimulate big-ticket purchases. Savings and Investments: While borrowing becomes cheaper, interest rates on savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) might also decrease. This could prompt savers to seek higher returns elsewhere, potentially in investments like stocks or even the volatile but high-growth cryptocurrency market. Business Expansion: For companies, cheaper borrowing can fund expansion, hiring, and innovation, potentially leading to increased corporate profits and economic growth. Understanding these potential shifts allows individuals and businesses to strategize effectively. For instance, locking in a lower mortgage rate could be a wise move, or re-evaluating investment portfolios to align with a new interest rate environment. Are There Any Challenges or Risks to These Fed Rate Cut Predictions? While Barclays’ forecast is compelling, the future is never set in stone. Several factors could influence the FOMC’s decisions and potentially alter the timeline or number of Fed rate cuts : Persistent Inflation: If inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated, the Fed might be hesitant to cut rates, as lower rates could reignite price pressures. Unexpected Economic Strength: A sudden surge in economic activity or an exceptionally strong labor market could also lead the Fed to maintain higher rates for longer, to prevent overheating. Geopolitical Events: Global events, such as supply chain disruptions or international conflicts, can introduce economic uncertainty and impact the Fed’s policy choices. The Fed’s primary mandate is to achieve maximum employment and price stability. Their decisions are data-dependent, meaning every new economic report can shift their outlook. Investors should remain agile and monitor official communications from the FOMC closely. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Future of Fed Rate Cuts Barclays’ projection of three Fed rate cuts this year offers a fascinating glimpse into a potential future where borrowing costs ease and economic activity receives a gentle nudge. This forecast, rooted in recent economic data, suggests a path toward a more accommodative monetary policy. While the specifics are subject to change, the overarching sentiment points towards a significant pivot from the aggressive rate hikes of the past. Staying informed about these developments is key to making sound financial decisions in an evolving economic landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)? A1: The FOMC is the monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System. It consists of 12 members and is responsible for setting the federal funds rate, which influences other interest rates across the economy. Q2: How do Fed rate cuts affect the average consumer? A2: Fed rate cuts can lead to lower interest rates on various loans, such as mortgages, car loans, and credit cards, making borrowing cheaper. Conversely, returns on savings accounts and CDs might also decrease. Q3: What economic data influences the Fed’s decision on interest rates? A3: The Fed considers a broad range of data, including inflation rates (like the Consumer Price Index), employment figures (like the non-farm payrolls report), wage growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing output. Q4: Could Barclays’ prediction of Fed rate cuts change? A4: Yes, economic forecasts are dynamic. Barclays’ prediction is based on current data and trends, but unexpected shifts in inflation, economic growth, or global events could lead the FOMC to adjust its policy, thereby altering the timing or number of predicted Fed rate cuts . Q5: How might Fed rate cuts impact the cryptocurrency market? A5: Lower interest rates can make traditional, lower-risk investments less attractive, potentially encouraging investors to seek higher returns in more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. This could lead to increased interest and investment in the crypto market.

According to an outlook by Ali Martinez, a strong resistance has formed around $2.90, where recent price action has shown multiple failed attempts to break higher. In a September 6 post on X, Martinez noted that if XRP faces another rejection at this level, the asset could retreat toward the $2.70 support zone, which has previously served as a crucial floor during recent pullbacks. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView On the upside, a decisive breakout above $2.90 would be needed to rekindle bullish momentum. However, the analysis suggested that XRP may continue to oscillate between $2.70 and $2.90 in the near term. Impact of XRP ETF Adding to the technical tension is the upcoming October SEC deadline on multiple spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) applications, including filings from Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and WisdomTree. Decisions are expected between mid- and late October, with approval odds seen as high. Analysts suggest institutional inflows could exceed $5 billion if approved, potentially sparking the momentum needed to push XRP beyond $3 and toward higher targets. In the meantime, XRP may retest the $2.90 resistance before either breaking higher or retreating toward $2.70, with a deeper slide to the $2.73 and $2.69 range possible if bearish pressure builds. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.81, down about 2% in the past 24 hours but up 0.84% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical standpoint, XRP’s current price sits slightly above its 200-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.50, signaling long-term bullish support. However, it remains below the 50-day SMA of $3.07, pointing to short-term weakness and a struggle to regain upward momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI stands at 43.67, below the neutral 50 level. This suggests XRP is leaning toward bearish momentum but is not yet oversold, reflecting limited buying pressure in the near term.

The project team responded to community concerns, stating that blacklisting is only for user protection purposes and will never interfere with normal market activities. According to the statement, a total of 272 addresses have been blacklisted in the past few days. This number represents a relatively small portion of the total number of investors. These steps are intended as temporary measures to prevent harm to vulnerable users. According to the details: 215 addresses (79%) were linked to phishing attacks. The WLFI team said it intervened to prevent the hackers from transferring the funds and attempted to secure the assets by contacting the rightful owners. 50 addresses (18.4%) were reported to support by their owners as stolen. These wallets were blacklisted for protection at the user's request. 5 addresses (≈1.8%) were flagged for high-risk exposure (security risk under review). 1 address (≈0.4%) suspected of embezzling funds from other owners; under extensive internal review.

As of September 6, 2025, Cronos (CRO) is trading at $0.2661, reflecting a 0.82% decline over the past 24 hours.

However, it is still up by over 220% from its all-time low of $0.2617 in December 2018. Cronos daily price chart: CRO price action and market structure Looking closely at the daily chart for Cronos, the price has been oscillating within a relatively tight range. Over the past 24 hours, the price has fluctuated between $0.2617 and $0.275. The resistance level at $0.275 has proven to be a significant point of contention, with the price facing repeated rejections when attempting to move higher. On the downside, the support at $0.2617 has held firm, limiting further downside movement and suggesting that buyers are stepping in to prevent deeper losses. This tight range indicates that CRO is currently in a phase of consolidation, awaiting a catalyst to drive a breakout or breakdown.

The rejection at $0.2699 has led to the current pullback, as the price now attempts to stabilize near $0.2661. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The RSI has dropped below 50, showing that sellers are starting to gain control in the shorter term.

Given the current price range of $0.2617 to $0.275, Cronos is in a consolidation phase, and the market is awaiting a breakout or breakdown. If the price successfully breaks above the $0.275 resistance level, we may see further upward momentum, testing higher levels. Conversely, if the support at $0.2617 is breached, the token could face a deeper retracement, potentially moving toward the $0.25 zone. In the short term, traders should remain cautious as the market sentiment is neutral, with neither bulls nor bears taking complete control. A clear break from this tight range will likely define the next significant price move. Whether it’s a push higher or a further decline, the key levels of $0.275 and $0.2617 will be crucial in determining Cronos’ next steps. Is Cronos a good investment? Cronos (CRO) is currently in a consolidation phase, trading between $0.2617 and $0.275. While the token has gained over 220% from its all-time low, it remains significantly lower than its peak. The market is neutral, and the price is range-bound, awaiting a breakout or breakdown. Investing in Cronos carries some risk due to its uncertain short-term outlook. A breakout above $0.275 could lead to gains, but a fall below $0.2617 might result in further declines. Investors should monitor these key levels before making decisions, as short-term volatility persists. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? As of September 6, 2025, Cronos (CRO) has seen a slight decline of 0.82% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.2661. This downtrend is part of a broader market consolidation in the cryptocurrency space, where many assets are showing signs of indecision and a lack of clear direction. CRO’s price movement is being influenced by a neutral market sentiment, with neither bulls nor bears gaining a decisive edge. This indecision has kept Cronos in a tight range between $0.2617 and $0.275, and it appears the market is waiting for a catalyst to push the price out of this consolidation. The broader market environment, combined with ongoing market uncertainty, is contributing to this mild decline in CRO’s value. Recent news As reported by Cryptopolitan , Cronos has released its 2025–2026 roadmap, detailing plans to position itself as a key infrastructure provider for tokenized assets and AI-powered finance. Over the next 12 to 18 months, it will launch a comprehensive tokenization platform covering asset classes such as equities, real estate, commodities, funds, insurance, and forex, with features like instant settlement, yield generation, lending, and DeFi integration. To make its ecosystem AI-native, Cronos will introduce an AI Agent SDK and a Proof of Identity standard, enabling direct interaction between AI agents and onchain finance. Adoption will be driven by integration with Crypto.com ’s 150 million users and 10 million merchants, while institutional demand will be supported through CRO ETFs in the U.S. and Europe, backed by partners like 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Trump Media Technology Group. The roadmap also highlights support for CRO-based digital asset treasuries, bolstered by the recent $6.4 billion Trump Media– Crypto.com SPAC merger aimed at establishing a dedicated CRO treasury and validator. Will Cronos reach $0.5? Based on long-term forecasts, Cronos (CRO) is projected to reach $0.5 by 2026 as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Cronos reach $1? Projections for Cronos estimate it could reach $1 by 2028, driven by its expansion in DeFi, NFT integrations, and partnerships. Will Cronos reach $100?

Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility.

In 2020, CRO rose steadily, reaching above $0.20 by August before dropping to $0.06 by year-end. In 2021, CRO followed the crypto bull run, surpassing previous highs and achieving an all-time high of $0.9698 on November 24, boosted by listings on Coinbase Pro and Bitrue. CRO opened 2022 at $0.5575 but fell to $0.4409, partially due to concerns over a potential security breach on the Crypto.com platform, which temporarily suspended withdrawals in January. In 2023, Cronos experienced a peak in mid-March near $0.80, followed by a steep decline and stabilization around $0.20 by mid-year. It maintained a slight oscillation around this range in the following months. CRO started 2024 at $0.10, rallied to a yearly high of $0.18 in March, and declined to $0.12 by June. It stabilized between $0.08 and $0.10 from July to October, traded at $0.07193 and $0.09521 in November, and ended the year in a range of $0.138 and $0.234 in December.

XRP and Stellar have returned to headlines following ETF speculation and major protocol upgrades. Analysts are increasingly converging around one unexpected frontrunner called Remittix (RTX) . This rising PayFi token is quickly gaining traction for its real-world payment infrastructure and massive growth potential. XRP’s ETF Buzz and Technical Breakout Setup The XRP price is currently hovering around $2.84, gaining traction from analysts who believe it may soon break into price discovery territory. Technical analysts point to a broader altcoin “cup-and-handle” formation that includes XRP, projecting targets as high as $19.27 before year-end. This aligns with growing demand for XRP-based ETFs 19 dedicated filings and another 7 in diversified crypto baskets have already been submitted. CME futures data shows XRP reached $1 billion in open interest faster than any other token, further boosting the bullish narrative. Meanwhile, Ripple has inked new deals with global finance firms like Thun and Linklogis, while companies like VivoPower explore XRP for treasury and asset management. The combination of institutional adoption and regulatory clarity following the SEC case resolution is strengthening XRP’s position, though execution risks still remain. Stellar’s Protocol 23 Sets the Stage for RWA Growth Stellar (XLM) trades at $0.364 following the rollout of its game-changing Whisk upgrade. Known officially as Protocol 23, the update enables parallel transaction processing, enhanced Soroban smart contract performance and standardization for developer interactions. These changes allow for up to 5,000 transactions per second, laying the foundation for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) at scale. Archax’s plan to tokenize a $99 billion fund and Stellar’s growing ties to firms like PayPal and VersaBank are early signs of adoption. In Q1 2025 alone, the network processed $3.4 billion in RWA-related payments. On-chain accumulation by institutions has grown 39% in six months, suggesting deepening interest. Analysts say Stellar may target $0.60 to $1.00 over the medium term if the upgrade delivers lasting performance benefits. However, caution remains, with muted derivatives activity and ongoing regulatory uncertainty around tokenized assets. Why Remittix Is Becoming the Best Crypto to Buy Now While XRP and Stellar bring legacy worthy credibility, Remittix (RTX) is quickly rising as the best crypto to buy now, according to a growing number of analysts. Unlike many speculative altcoins, Remittix is executing on a clear PayFi vision. Its merchant-ready Pay API, flat transaction fees and support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies make Remittix a practical tool for freelancers, global businesses, and borderless commerce. Analysts argue that RTX offers exponential growth potential that established projects may struggle to match in this cycle. Key Highlights Behind Remittix’s Momentum Remittix has raised $24 million in funding, signaling strong global investor interest Over 645 million tokens have already been sold, reinforcing market demand The token is currently priced at $0.1030, offering deep value at entry Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBANK provide credible CEX exposure Its PayFi wallet beta launches Q3 2025 with cross-border utility for real users Final Thoughts As real-world utility reshapes the crypto landscape, XRP and Stellar are making strides. Analysts say Remittix is setting the new benchmark. Backed by a clear PayFi use case, confirmed exchange listings and fast-growing investor support, Remittix offers a utility-first roadmap with massive upside. Its focus on cross-border payments and rapid development makes it one of the best crypto to buy now, with analysts projecting up to 30x gains in 2025.

The system, built with support from French IT firm Atos and German company ParTec, now ranks as the fourth-fastest supercomputer in the world. It’s also the first in Europe to reach Exascale class, capable of performing one quintillion operations per second, or about the combined processing strength of 10 million laptops. Friedrich called the machine a “historic European pioneering project” and said it is Europe’s way of responding to the United States and China, both of which lead in the push toward an AI-driven economy. “We in Germany and in Europe have all the opportunities to catch up and then to hold our own,” he said at the launch. Jupiter is designed for use in scientific fields like biotechnology and climate research, areas where supercomputing is essential for running simulations, building models, and processing massive datasets. But the installation is also seen as a political signal. European institutions are trying to reduce dependence on foreign-controlled digital infrastructure and chips, especially from US tech giants and Chinese manufacturers. Officials say Jupiter should stay accessible to firms and researchers Ralf Wintergerst, who leads Germany’s digital business association Bitkom, said the new machine will push Germany to the front of the global high-performance computing field and help expand the country’s AI capabilities. He urged that Jupiter be made easily accessible for use. “Access to it should be made as unbureaucratic as possible for start-ups and established companies,” Ralf said on Friday. The European Union has lagged behind in developing the kind of hardware needed to support large-scale AI development. While engineers in Silicon Valley run their models on dense racks of Nvidia GPUs, and Chinese labs scale up through state-funded manufacturing, Europe has mostly stayed on the sidelines. Nvidia pushes back against proposed US export law limiting chip sales On the same day Jupiter went online, Nvidia issued a public warning about a proposed US law that could block machines like Jupiter from ever being upgraded again. The law, titled the GAIN AI Act (short for Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence ) was introduced under the National Defense Authorization Act and would require AI chipmakers to prioritize US domestic orders over international shipments. A spokesperson for Nvidia said the bill would do more harm than good. “We never deprive American customers in order to serve the rest of the world,” the company said. “In trying to solve a problem that does not exist, the proposed bill would restrict competition worldwide in any industry that uses mainstream computing chips.” The bill proposes strict licensing rules. Any chip with a performance score above 4,800 would require an export license, and the US Department of Commerce would have the power to deny licenses altogether. The draft legislation says that exports of advanced chips should be blocked if US buyers are still waiting for supply. It follows the AI Diffusion Rule implemented under former President Joe Biden, which placed limits on how much processing power US companies could export to other countries. The goal was to prioritize US access to critical AI infrastructure and to prevent China from gaining the hardware needed to strengthen its military through artificial intelligence. Despite these restrictions, President Donald Trump struck a deal with Nvidia in August, agreeing to let the company resume exports of banned AI chips to China, in exchange for giving the government a percentage of Nvidia’s sales tied to those exports. The agreement raised questions about whether economic interest is now being weighed more heavily than security concerns in the regulation of AI technology. While the US tightens control, Germany is trying to open things up… at least internally. Europe’s goal is to build infrastructure that can handle next-generation AI development without needing constant permission from Washington. The problem is that most of the world’s best chips are still made in the US, and Nvidia remains the core supplier for nearly every major AI system globally.

An Ethereum whale address, known for accumulating the asset over the past two years, recently transferred a substantial 3,711 ETH, valued at approximately $15.93 million, to the Binance exchange. This significant move, highlighted by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, immediately raised questions about the whale’s intentions and potential market implications. What Does This ETH Whale Deposit Mean for the Market? Whenever a large holder, often referred to as a ‘whale,’ moves a considerable amount of cryptocurrency to an exchange, it typically signals a potential intention to sell. This specific ETH whale deposit is no exception. The analyst’s findings reveal that the whale’s average purchase price for this Ether was around $3,912. Should these assets be liquidated at current prices, the whale stands to realize a profit of approximately $1.41 million. This figure alone underscores the financial magnitude of such a transaction and its potential to influence market dynamics. Accumulation History: The whale had been accumulating ETH for two years, indicating a long-term conviction in Ethereum’s value. Profit Potential: A realized profit of over $1.4 million from this specific transfer is substantial. Exchange Destination: Moving funds to Binance, a major exchange, is often a precursor to selling activity. Is This Just Profit-Taking, or Something More Strategic? While the immediate assumption for any large ETH whale deposit to an exchange is profit-taking, it’s crucial to consider other possibilities. Whales, by their nature, often employ complex strategies. The transfer could be part of a portfolio rebalancing, preparing for an Over-The-Counter (OTC) deal, or even moving funds to participate in new DeFi opportunities that require assets on an exchange. However, given the substantial profit margin, a simple profit-taking scenario remains highly plausible. Interestingly, the whale’s wallet still retains a significant holding of approximately 3,000 ETH. This remaining stash represents an unrealized profit of around $1.13 million, based on the same average purchase price. This suggests that while a portion of their holdings might be cashed out, the whale maintains a considerable long-term position in Ethereum, potentially waiting for further price appreciation or strategic opportunities. How Does This ETH Whale Deposit Impact Investor Sentiment? The actions of crypto whales are closely watched by traders and investors because their large movements can significantly impact market sentiment and price action. A major ETH whale deposit like this can sometimes trigger a short-term dip in price due to increased selling pressure, or it could simply be absorbed by market demand without much volatility. Understanding these movements is part of ‘whale watching,’ a common practice in crypto analysis. For everyday investors, monitoring such on-chain data provides valuable insights into the intentions of major players. It helps in assessing potential market trends and making informed decisions. While one whale’s actions don’t dictate the entire market, they are certainly a data point worth considering when evaluating Ethereum’s immediate future. Key Takeaways from This Event: A long-term holder is realizing significant gains. Potential for short-term selling pressure on ETH. The whale still holds a substantial amount of ETH, indicating continued conviction. Reinforces the importance of on-chain analysis in understanding market dynamics. In conclusion, the recent $15.9 million ETH whale deposit to Binance is a clear signal of a major player taking profits after a two-year accumulation period. While the immediate impact on Ethereum’s price remains to be seen, this event provides valuable insight into whale behavior and the ongoing dynamics of the crypto market. It serves as a reminder that even long-term holders strategically manage their portfolios, often capitalizing on opportune moments to secure gains. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ETH whale? A1: An ETH whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum, enough to potentially influence its market price through significant buy or sell orders. Q2: Why is an ETH whale deposit to an exchange significant? A2: When a whale deposits a large amount of ETH to an exchange, it often indicates an intention to sell, which can increase selling pressure and potentially lead to a price drop in the short term. Q3: How do analysts track whale movements? A3: Analysts use on-chain data tools and blockchain explorers to monitor large transactions, track specific wallet addresses, and identify significant movements of cryptocurrencies. Q4: Does this ETH whale deposit guarantee a price drop? A4: Not necessarily. While it indicates potential selling pressure, the market’s demand might absorb the supply without a significant price impact. It’s one factor among many influencing price. Q5: What does ‘unrealized profit’ mean? A5: Unrealized profit refers to the profit a holder would make if they sold their assets at the current market price, but they haven’t actually sold them yet. It’s profit ‘on paper.’ If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network! Stay informed about crucial market movements and the fascinating world of cryptocurrency whales.

According to sources, Sun had spent around $75 million to purchase the project’s WLFI token. The Tron founder has been one of the biggest backers and an early investor in World Liberty Financial. Justin Sun’s WLFI Tokens Frozen The Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial has frozen the tokens of one of its biggest supporters. Billionaire Justin Sun revealed on Friday that the project had frozen over $100 million in cryptocurrency that he had purchased. Sun revealed his assets were frozen in a post on X, stating, “To the World Liberty Financials team and the global community, as one of the early major investors in World Liberty Financials, I have contributed not only capital but also my trust and support for the future of this project. My goal has always been to grow alongside the team and community, and to jointly build a strong and healthy WLF ecosystem. However, during the course of operations, my tokens were unreasonably frozen. As one of the early investors, I joined together with everyone—we bought in the same way, and we all deserve the same rights.” Sun is a highly controversial figure and was a prominent guest at a dinner hosted by President Trump to reward the biggest supporters of World Liberty Financial. However, Sun seems to have fallen afoul of the President and his allies after moving a portion of his position to a different Trump-linked cryptocurrency. Sun Moved Assets After Price Drop According to data from Arkham Intelligence, Sun moved around $9 million worth of WLFI tokens on Thursday, following a 40% drop in its value since it became tradable on Monday, according to data from Binance. Sun acknowledged that he had transferred some of his holdings, but insisted he was not responsible for the drop in WLFI’s value. The Tron founder even offered to buy $10 million worth of stock in any Trump-linked company and another $10 million in WLFI tokens. “No buying or selling was involved, so it could not possibly have any impact on the market. I am innocent.” World Liberty Financial has not responded to Sun so far. However, the project’s social media account posted on Friday, stating, “We do not seek to blacklist anyone. We respond when alerted to malicious or high-risk activity that could harm community members.” Action against The Project’s Biggest Supporter World Liberty Financial’s decision to freeze Sun’s assets could potentially alienate one of its biggest supporters. The project was launched in October, and counts President Trump and his sons, Eric, Barron, and Donald Trump Jr. as co-founders. World Liberty Financial is also aiming to create and launch an application for Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Sun had announced in January that he had purchased $75 million worth of WLFI tokens.

At its core, tokenization is the process of converting ownership of real-world assets, from stocks and bonds to real estate, private equity, and even art, into digital tokens recorded on a blockchain. Tokenization follows a lineage that began with mutual funds and expanded through separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and according to the bank's analysts, this model could reshape the way investors access and manage assets by offering a number of advantages over traditional structures. Among the most important benefits are enhanced liquidity, analysts led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote, adding that 24/7 trading could open up secondary markets for previously illiquid private assets, and faster, frictionless settlements that eliminate the multi-day delays common in today’s financial markets. Tokenization also allows for fractional ownership, the analysts said, reducing investment minimums and broadening access to portfolios. Transparency is another advantage, as blockchain ledgers provide immutable and publicly accessible records of ownership and transactions. Lower fees are possible by cutting out intermediaries, and smart contracts can automate key processes such as dividend payments, coupon distributions, and voting rights, while also helping to navigate regulatory requirements and even the complexities of private equity capital calls, the report noted. According to data provider RWA.xyz the value of real-world assets represented on-chain exceeds $28 billion . Tokenization risks Still, Bank of America cautioned that tokenization faces significant hurdles before it can achieve widespread adoption. Regulatory uncertainty remains the biggest challenge. While U.S. policymakers have signaled support, future administrations could reverse course, and many jurisdictions are still in the process of writing rules. The bank said custody is another concern, as investors risk losing access to assets if private keys are misplaced, and institutional-grade custody solutions are still developing. On the technology side, vulnerabilities in smart contracts or blockchain platforms leave room for exploitation, and integration with legacy financial infrastructure presents additional obstacles, given the reliance of most institutions on traditional systems. And when it comes to publicly traded assets, existing U.S. markets already offer deep liquidity, low fees, and strong investor protections, making the case for tokenized versions less compelling, the report added.

Mutuum Finance has already sold 6 rounds during its presale and is now is at $0.035. Individuals who are able to hedge their coins at this point will be earning over 500% when the token becomes listed in exchanges. So far, the presale has succeeded in drawing in 16100 participants and raising over $15.45 million worth of capital. Whereas Ethereum is standing firm in a turbulent market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is coming out as a potential disrupter in the decentralized finance market. Ethereum (ETH) Holds at $4.300 As Market Changes Ethereum (ETH) is at the moment priced at $4,308.85, and it has gone as low as $4,269.20 and as high as $4,430.67 over the last 24h. The cryptocurrency has remained stable around the $4,300 mark regardless of the overall uncertainty in the market due to the steady trading volumes and the continued institutional investment. Analysts report that this support zone will preserve the trend ETH is experiencing today, and a breakout over the $4,500 mark remains a crucial mark to monitor in the event of a positive trend. Meanwhile, new decentralized finance projects, including Mutuum Finance, are also starting to attract more investors. Mutuum Finance Bug Bounty Program of $50,000 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has developed a Bug Bounty Program along with CertiK, which gives white-hat hackers, developers, and security researchers a chance to find bugs. These reward scales are promoted by the level of vulnerability that has been identified and the reward is further divided into small and big security concerns and the total reward is $50,000 USDT. This initiative will help to prove the security of the platform, protect user money and investor trust in the Mutuum Finance system. Mutuum Finance is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway as part of its rewarding its early adopters, grow its user base, and in addition to Bug Bounty. The ten participants will be rewarded with tokens worth $10,000 MUTM each as the project is investing in building a long-term, and loyal community. What Mutuum Finance does with Market Risk, Volatility and Liquidity Mutuum Finance uses both caps and liquidation parameters to actively modify exposure and reward liquidators in times of low liquidity to stabilize the ecosystem. Asset volatility is an absolute indicator of Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation: more volatile assets will be less conservative and less volatile assets will be more conservative. The risk rating also determines reserve factors in order to provide a protocol as safe as possible and as viable as possible as wide as possible. Community Oriented Development and Security Mutuum Finance is trying to make sure that it is not just creating a secure and scalable DeFi platform; it is also trying to create an ecosystem where users, token owners and investors can gain through its security efforts and community programs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining momentum with Ethereum (ETH) at approximately $4,300. Stage 6 tokens cost $0.035 and early investors are looking to make 500 percent or more after listing. There are 16,100 participants and the presale has already raised more than $15.45M, indicating high demand. Supported by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, $100K community giveaway, and strong risk controls, MUTM is developing all the markings of an excellent DeFi opportunity.

A midday selloff to $0.213 was quickly absorbed by buyers, underscoring institutional support and ETF-driven speculation. Traders now view $0.22 as the key breakout threshold that could define near-term momentum. News Background • Dogecoin reached a local high of $0.2157 , its strongest level in weeks, with trading volume 29.19% above weekly benchmarks. • Reports surfaced of a $200 million Dogecoin treasury initiative , led by Elon Musk’s legal counsel, boosting institutional credibility. • REX Shares and Osprey Funds reportedly filed the first U.S. Dogecoin ETF applications , with decisions expected in October. • Futures activity surged 119% in August, reflecting heightened institutional positioning around meme-based digital assets.

Major Banks Predict At Least 2 Rate Cuts After Weak Labor Data,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-boom-soon-major-banks-predict-two-rate-cuts/,"The crypto market has been quite excited about the possibility of the United States Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in the remaining months of the year. This display of emotions could be seen in the last crypto market rally on the back of a positive Jackson Hole speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. A different reaction was felt across the cryptocurrency market after a weaker-than-expected Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data was released on Friday, September 5. However, the general consensus seems to be that this latest weak job data release could be rather positive in terms of interest rate cuts. Weak Labor Data Increases Likelihood Of Rate Cuts: Major Banks The US labor market data released on Friday was weaker than expected, as only 22,000 jobs were added to the economy in August, falling short of the 75,000 job expectations. Major banking firms have now come forward with how this new report could impact the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)’s meetings in the coming months. According to a Bloomberg report , Bank of America analysts have softened their stance on no interest rate cuts in 2025 as a result of Friday’s labor data release. The analysts now expect the Fed to cut rates at least twice before year-end—two 25 basis points (25BPS) cuts in September and December 2025. Meanwhile, analysts at investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs are projecting three 25BPS cuts before the year runs out. The first interest rate cut is expected to occur in September, with two additional cuts anticipated in October and November. In a separate Reuters report from June , Citigroup had always expected three 25BPS cuts in the remaining months of the year. However, unlike Goldman Sachs, the banking titan projects these interest rate cuts to September, October, and December. How Successive Rate Cuts Could Catalyze Crypto Bull Run Lower interest rates have always been viewed as a positive macroeconomic indicator for the risk assets, including the crypto market. With fixed-income assets becoming less attractive, investors tend to have a risk-on attitude towards the riskier assets. Hence, periods of low interest rates or rate cuts have often been associated with an increase in crypto prices and sustained bullish runs. Meanwhile, higher rates tend to lead to a decline in crypto liquidity, as investors are less incentivized to enter the market. According to data from CoinGecko, the total crypto market capitalization stands at around $3.09 trillion, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past day.",Crypto News|Bank of America|crypto|Crypto Market|Federal Reserve|goldman sachs,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 15:00:30

BlockchainFX is making its mark with a multi-asset trading super app vision, drawing attention with staking mechanics and a presale that has already raised millions. Lyno AI is also making waves, using an AI-powered arbitrage system with early incentives to capture strong presale momentum. Both projects prove that crypto presales in 2025 can attract meaningful participation and offer compelling narratives. Their strategies are bringing in early traction and signaling potential long-term appeal. Yet BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping ahead with results that few can match. With 3 million miners active through its X1 app before mainnet, nearly $400M already raised in presale, and a major deployment event and $0.0013 entry until October 1, BDAG is showing what it means to turn early interest into undeniable growth. BlockchainFX Presale Builds Strong Momentum BlockchainFX is capturing attention as it positions itself as a multi-asset super app that merges crypto with traditional markets. With more than $6.1 million raised from over 6,300 participants, and the current presale price at $0.021 against a confirmed launch at $0.05, early buyers are lining up for substantial upside. Confidence is being reinforced by its fee model, which recycles 70% of trading fees into staking rewards, buybacks, and burns. Half of those buyback tokens are permanently removed from circulation, creating long-term deflationary support for price growth. With a beta app already active, CertiK audits completed, and KYC checks in place, BlockchainFX is building credibility while driving FOMO. Lyno AI Presale Gains Traction in DeFi Lyno AI is aiming to become a leading AI-powered DeFi solution, with its system designed for lightning-fast cross-chain arbitrage. Operating across more than 15 blockchains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon, it executes trades in milliseconds while managing risk autonomously. Its presale began at $0.050, with over 350,000 tokens already sold and $17,500 raised in the opening round. The next stage is set to increase the price to $0.055, with a long-term target of $0.10. The tokenomics structure gives it strong appeal, allocating 30% of trading fees to stakers and another 30% to buy-and-burn mechanics. This not only incentivizes holding but also reduces supply over time, creating scarcity that supports growth. BlockDAG’s Miner Surge & Near $400M Presale Build Unstoppable Momentum BlockDAG has secured a lead that few projects can replicate, capturing mass adoption even before listings open. The X1 miner app has now passed 3 million users worldwide, transforming everyday smartphones into daily BDAG mining hubs. This kind of traction ahead of launch proves that BlockDAG has unlocked a viral model for entry, one that ensures mining is both accessible and rewarding. The presale performance adds weight to this foundation. BlockDAG has raised almost $400 million and sold more than 26 billion coins in record time. Those who joined during Batch 1 at just $0.001 are already sitting on 2,900% returns. Visibility is also fueling the story. BlockDAG is ready to host a major Deployment Event in Singapore. After withdrawing from Token2049 due to local restrictions on presale promotions, the team opted to launch its own flagship event. Additionally, despite being priced at $0.03 in Batch 30 of its presale, BlockDAG has introduced a new special price of $0.0013 per BDAG until October 1. This rate will remain in effect for the final 30 days leading up to deployment. This comes alongside a scheduled live AMA on September 4 and a highly anticipated sponsorship. With BDAG priced at $0.0013 until October 1 adds to the urgency. This incentive is creating a rush that strengthens community ties while amplifying presale growth. With scale, exposure, and incentives all in motion, BlockDAG has redefined how a presale strategy can capture the market’s focus and dominate attention. Final Analysis Both BlockchainFX and Lyno AI highlight how crypto presales in 2025 can combine utility with strong incentives. BlockchainFX is developing a multi-asset trading super app with staking rewards and deflationary mechanics, while Lyno AI is driving attention through its arbitrage model powered by AI, complete with fee-sharing, token burns, and contests to keep early participants engaged. Yet BlockDAG is moving faster than either. With 3 million miners already active through the X1 app, nearly $400M raised in presale, a $0.0013 entry active until October 1, BDAG has transformed demand into measurable growth. It is the benchmark presale of 2025.

The Bitcoin price keeps flirting with resistance, Dogecoin is still running on nostalgia, and traders looking for that next explosive run are getting restless. That’s why a new contender— Layer Brett —is turning heads. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin price stalls as appetite shifts to higher upside For over a decade, Bitcoin has been the standard, the original, the safe-ish play in an otherwise chaotic market. But lately, even die-hard Bitcoiners are admitting the energy is fading. The Bitcoin price keeps testing upper resistance bands—$112K here, $115K there—but there’s no real momentum. It’s like watching an old heavyweight shadowbox himself. Macro conditions aren’t helping. Inflation signals, ETF chatter, and Fed jawboning have all been priced in. So, while long-term holders keep stacking sats, the more speculative crowd? They’re losing interest. Why hold one coin when you could hold 100,000? That’s where the new meme plays come in—cheap entries, viral upside, and actual activity. The Bitcoin price might still command respect, but it’s not commanding the degens anymore. And with the next rally looking more like a meme-fueled frenzy than a macro-driven grind, Bitcoin may end up playing second fiddle to projects with sharper fangs. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still beloved, still stalled Dogecoin isn’t dead. It’s still one of the most recognisable names in crypto. Elon still drops the odd tweet, Reddit still rallies around it, and it still ranks high on coin trackers. But recognition isn’t the same as momentum—and that’s where Dogecoin is falling short. The charts tell the story. Despite occasional meme surges, Dogecoin keeps getting stuck under resistance, with traders hoping for a breakout to $0.36 that never quite arrives. Volume is middling, social chatter is thinning, and for all its charm, there’s nothing new in the pipeline. The original meme coin hasn’t really evolved. In a market obsessed with next-gen Bitcoin price plays and meme coins that actually do something, Dogecoin looks… static. Loyal? Absolutely. But exciting? Not anymore. That’s why speculative capital is starting to drift—towards meme coins with staking, speed, and something to prove. Coins like Layer Brett. Layer Brett (LBRETT): The meme coin with actual teeth While the Bitcoin price hovers and Dogecoin recycles nostalgia, Layer Brett is carving out something sharper—a meme coin with utility, speed, and a community that isn’t stuck in 2015. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, Layer Brett offers near-instant transactions, barely-there gas fees, and live staking that’s already paying out eye-watering APYs. But it’s not just the tech. Layer Brett has meme culture in its DNA—NFT tie-ins, gamified staking, and branding that actually feels alive. This isn’t a ghost chain with a dog mascot; it’s a working ecosystem with a presale price still under a cent. Early adopters are loading up now, chasing the kind of upside Bitcoin and Dogecoin can’t offer anymore. With Layer 2 speed and meme coin volatility, Layer Brett is quickly becoming the project traders mention when they’re done being polite. If there’s a breakout coming, this might be where the real rally begins. Conclusion The Bitcoin price still sets the tone, and Dogecoin will always have its cult following—but momentum is shifting. With staking rewards live, gas fees near zero, and a presale entry point that still feels like a cheat code, Layer Brett is capturing the one thing every rally feeds on: belief. If you’re looking where the action might actually be next cycle, start there.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $113,390 but lost momentum, settling at $110,679. The current session sees the price marginally up, trading around $110,818. With BTC unable to push above resistance levels, an analyst has warned of a deeper correction that could push the price below $95,000. Bitcoin ETFs Register Outflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered substantial outflows of $160 million. According to available data, none of the listed US Bitcoin ETFs registered positive inflows, marking a rare moment of synchronized withdrawals. The outflows suggest growing investor caution across the crypto and ETF markets. However, spot Bitcoin ETFs remain the dominant force in the crypto ETF sector, holding substantially more assets than spot Ethereum ETFs. However, the absence of inflows suggests investors are re-evaluating risk exposure and rebalancing their portfolios. According to data from SoSoValue, cumulative net inflows into crypto ETFs remain positive at $12.7 billion. Total net assets for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs now stand at $27.6 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) Must Cross Resistance Levels Bitcoin (BTC) faces a major hurdle above $114,000, which has become a major source of concern for analysts. The flagship cryptocurrency has also dipped below key support levels, including the $110,000 mark. However, analysts believe the biggest hindrance at the moment is the $114,000 level. According to crypto analyst BitBull, the recent rejection from $114,000 is a cause for concern. The analyst believes $114,000 is the level to beat for BTC to make a significant recovery. The analyst also highlighted the timeframe issue, stating that the longer it takes for the price to reclaim $114,000, the higher the chances of a crash. He also said that until this happens, any recovery is a bull trap before another wave of selling. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp decline on Friday after being rejected from the $113,000-$114,000 range again. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped to an intraday low of $109,321 on Thursday, reclaiming $110,000 and settling at $110,720. It reached an intraday high of $113,390 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, the price fell to $110,670, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $110,870. With BTC struggling to push above key resistance levels, an analyst has warned that a deeper correction could push prices below $100,000, potentially as low as $95,000. Analysts from Bitfinex have identified the $93,000-$95,000 zone as the range for the ongoing corrective phase. The analysts also noted that BTC has entered its third consecutive week of decline. Historically, bull market corrections have averaged around 17% from peak to trough. However, analysts have cautioned that the short-term holder realised price sits at $108,900, just below current levels. A break below this level could trigger a deeper correction, dragging BTC below $100,000 towards the $93,000-$95,000 zone. September is historically one of BTC’s weakest months, with investors and analysts expecting continued consolidation. BTC registered a sharp drop on Sunday (August 24), falling to an intraday low of $110,635 before settling at $113,478. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 3% and settled at $110,127. BTC faced volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price rose 1.51% to $111,788. BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping 0.48% and settling at $111,253. It recovered on Thursday, rising 1.19% to reach an intraday high of $113,480 before settling at $112,574. Bearish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC fell nearly 4%, losing the crucial $110,000 level and settling at $108,378. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC rose 0.41% on Saturday before dropping 0.53% on Sunday to settle at $108,247. The flagship cryptocurrency started the current week in positive territory, rising 0.92% to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,240. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose nearly 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,247. BTC continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising 0.46% to $111,756.

He pointed directly to the latest job report, which showed unemployment climbing and job growth slowing, and blamed Trump’s trade agenda for making things worse. Schumer made it clear this is about pushing back against economic damage caused by the White House. The timing couldn’t be more amusing. Just as Democrats prepare for their tariff push, Trump is facing a flood of legal losses. A week after an appeals court struck down part of his tariffs, federal judges issued multiple rulings against key parts of his agenda. Trump is appealing the tariff ruling to the Supreme Court, and has warned it would be a “disaster” if the decision isn’t overturned. Still, this week’s court activity was a sharp blow to his administration, the most damaging stretch in months. Courts block immigration and education orders as Trump turns to executive power Federal judges blocked Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations, halted his move to deploy the National Guard for law enforcement in California, and shut down his order to freeze $2 billion in federal funds for Harvard University. Another ruling stopped the White House from ending legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Haitians and Venezuelans, who had previously been shielded under special immigration status. The White House’s strategy has been to flood the legal system with executive orders, hoping not all would be struck down. “The courts aren’t going to strike down all that they’re doing,” said a White House-connected lawyer in May, adding, “they’ll end up accomplishing more by flooding the zone.” Despite the lower court rulings, the Trump administration continues to win at the Supreme Court. NBC reports the administration has made 22 emergency requests to the justices, and 17 have been granted so far. Still, this week’s rulings were labeled “unlawful” and “unconstitutional” by judges, a clear rejection of Trump’s latest legal pushes. Abigail Jackson, Trump’s spokesperson, responded Friday by slamming the coverage. “Fake News NBC is trying to push the left’s narrative in a new way,” she said. “Here’s the reality: with almost 20 Supreme Court victories, the Trump Administration’s policies have been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court as lawful despite an unprecedented number of legal challenges and unlawful lower court rulings. And the winning will continue.” Tariffs isolate U.S. as foreign allies move toward China Trump’s foreign policy is, of course, also taking hits geopolitically. China’s massive military parade this week featured Narendra Modi, Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un walking together; a blunt image of coordination between three of America’s adversaries. Just two days earlier, China’s Shanghai Cooperation Organization had welcomed leaders from India, Turkey, Vietnam, and Egypt, countries that had historically leaned closer to Washington. Now, Trump’s tariffs, harsh rhetoric, and ideological demands are pushing those countries away. This realignment, which includes key global players, may be one of the most damaging changes in U.S. diplomacy in recent decades. Even in the BRICS alliance, where Brazil, India, and South Africa had once resisted Chinese and Russian dominance, things are changing, as India’s Modi was seen walking hand-in-hand with Putin, his new best friend. India was hit with the world’s highest tariff rate, while Brazil got high tariffs, sanctions, and visa bans on its officials. South Africa is facing 30 percent tariffs, no foreign aid, and potential sanctions targeting its leadership. These decisions formed a pattern that many countries now see as hostile. And the backlash is growing. In India, pro-American sentiment has plummeted, and there’s growing distrust of Washington. In Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been struggling in the polls, has gained public support by resisting Trump’s pressure. In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa earned political credit for standing up to Trump during a tense Oval Office exchange. The global effects of Trump’s trade policy are eroding U.S. influence. Nations that used to align with American goals are drifting, not because of ideology, but because they feel punished and disrespected. Tariffs have become more than economic tools; they’ve become symbols of diplomatic breakdown. Get seen where it counts.

In a post on X, he shared a TradingView snapshot showing a golden cross forming on the hourly timeframe, with XRP trading around $2.82–$2.84. The signal has sparked excitement among traders who view it as a potential catalyst for the next upward leg. The Golden Cross A golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, signaling a shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. While the classic golden cross uses the 50-day and 200-day averages, shorter timeframes can also reflect the same principle. In this case, the 9-period moving average has crossed above the 26-period moving average, suggesting buyers are beginning to regain control. Traders often treat the golden cross as a lagging but reliable indicator. It shows that recent momentum favors the upside, but confirmation is still required. Sustained closes above the crossover level, paired with increasing trading volume, typically strengthen the bullish case. #XRP Set for Explosive Surge as Golden Cross Forms! pic.twitter.com/kNshqFOHjy — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) September 6, 2025 Current Market Picture As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.80, with real-time data from CoinMarketCap confirming active price action and healthy intraday volume. The crossover on the hourly chart appears around $2.82, aligning with the level highlighted in JackTheRippler’s post. Immediate resistance lies between $2.94 and $3.00, a psychological and technical barrier that XRP needs to break decisively. A strong hourly close above this range could validate the golden cross and open the door to a more pronounced rally. On the flip side, if XRP fails to hold the $2.82 level, bears could push the price back toward the $2.70–$2.75 zone, weakening the short-term bullish outlook. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Wider Market Context Although the golden cross is a bullish indicator, it cannot be read in isolation. Broader crypto market sentiment—particularly Bitcoin’s performance—will play a crucial role in determining whether XRP can sustain momentum. Historically, altcoin rallies gain strength when Bitcoin trends higher and overall market liquidity improves. Volume also remains a key factor. A golden cross supported by strong, above-average trading volume often carries more weight, while weak participation can result in a false signal. For now, XRP’s uptick in volume offers early encouragement, but traders are closely watching whether momentum can build. Outlook JackTheRippler’s observation of the golden cross highlights a genuine shift in XRP’s short-term momentum. The technical setup is promising, but traders will be looking for confirmation through stronger closes above the $3.00 threshold and continued volume growth. If these conditions align, XRP could indeed be positioned for the kind of explosive move many are anticipating.

As evolving monetary policy casts a spotlight on a fragmented global economy, the stability of infrastructure for borderless transactions with digital assets stands out as a superior alternative to the traditional system. Blockchain is a viable solution to many of today’s financial challenges. Uniquely, its clearest beneficiaries are two distinctly different groups: financial institutions and the 1.4 billion people who are unbanked. The former gains next-generation speed and scalability while the latter benefits from newfound accessibility and equity. Our charge as builders of this industry, if we want to actualize blockchain’s full potential, is to account for the needs of both. While the financially marginalized have long sought solutions in bleeding-edge tech, the legacy world is just beginning to get the appeal. ""We have to be thinking about how we leverage [blockchain] in our environment,"" said Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson recently, discussing how costs in asset management are up 80% in the last decade, while revenues are down 15%. Franklin Templeton's breakthrough illustrates this institutional awakening. Their first-ever tokenized money market fund reduces transaction costs from $1 to less than a penny – for an institution managing $1.7 trillion, the efficiency gains are transformative. But this institutional adoption does more than cut costs; it validates the infrastructure that can serve both boardrooms and the billions still excluded from traditional finance. The same blockchain rails enabling Franklin Templeton's efficiency gains can deliver $50 remittances from Dubai to the Philippines in seconds rather than several business days. The technology removes friction, whether you're settling $100 million in tokenized assets or sending $100 to family abroad. Major institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and JPMorgan are proving blockchain's institutional viability at unprecedented scale. Aid organizations, such as the United Nations Refugee Agency, are simultaneously demonstrating its humanitarian potential, distributing assistance directly to those in need without traditional intermediaries. These parallel developments reflect blockchain's unique capacity to serve both efficiency and equity. The institutional momentum creates crucial infrastructure benefits for everyone. When major financial players invest in blockchain networks, they strengthen the rails that underbanked populations can also access. When regulatory frameworks emerge to support institutional adoption, they create legal clarity that benefits all users. Consider the numbers that drive both institutional interest and human need. Global transaction banking generates nearly $1.4 trillion in annual revenue, yet operational inefficiencies cost an estimated 8-10% of that revenue. For institutions, blockchain technology offers clear solutions to these challenges. For the unbanked, the stakes are different but equally compelling. Remittances – which exceeded $900 billion globally in 2024 – carry average fees of 6.62% worldwide, with some corridors reaching 10% or more. Working families lose billions annually to these costs. When a domestic worker sends $500 home, losing $50 to fees represents not inefficiency but genuine hardship. The convergence becomes clear: the same technology solving institutional inefficiencies can address human exclusion from the financial system. Blockchain networks processing transactions for fractions of a penny with 3-5 second settlement times serve both institutional treasuries and individual remittances equally well. Real-world stress tests prove blockchain's dual utility. In Argentina, where inflation reached 236.7% by late 2024, both institutions and individuals are embracing digital assets out of necessity. Data shows 61.8% of Argentina's crypto transactions now involve stablecoins — not as speculation, but as economic survival tools preserving purchasing power against peso devaluation. This crisis-driven adoption reveals blockchain's fundamental value proposition: removing dependence on fragile intermediaries and national monetary systems. Whether you're a fund manager hedging institutional exposure or a family protecting savings, the infrastructure provides the same essential service: stable, borderless value transfer. The infrastructure exists. Modern blockchain networks have processed tens of billions of operations, serving millions of accounts worldwide. The technology handles institutional scale while remaining accessible to individual users. But actualizing blockchain's full potential requires intentional design for both audiences. This means building interfaces sophisticated enough for institutional treasury management yet simple enough for first-time users. It means creating compliance frameworks that satisfy regulatory requirements while preserving accessibility for underserved populations. Success requires partnerships spanning both worlds – working with established financial institutions to build robust infrastructure while partnering with mobile money operators, community organizations, and fintech companies serving underbanked populations. The goal isn't choosing between efficiency and equity, but achieving both simultaneously. Blockchain's unique promise lies precisely in its ability to serve these seemingly different constituencies with the same fundamental infrastructure. The networks enabling pension funds to tokenize assets can help farmers access credit. The rails facilitating institutional settlement can deliver humanitarian aid directly to refugees. As builders, our responsibility extends beyond technological capability to purposeful implementation. We must ensure that institutional adoption strengthens rather than supplants financial inclusion efforts. We must design systems that leverage institutional resources to extend access rather than create new barriers. The infrastructure for borderless, frictionless value transfer is ready. The regulatory frameworks are evolving. The institutional adoption is accelerating. Our success will be measured not just by efficiency gains in existing systems, but by how many people we bring into economic participation for the first time. The choice we make today determines whether blockchain becomes another tool serving the already-served or the bridge finally connecting everyone to the global economy. Both institutions and the unbanked are counting on us to get this right.",Opinion|Wall Street|Remittances|Unbanked|Stellar Development Foundation|Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-06 15:08:10

While this sounds alarming, the team stresses it’s a protective measure, not a restriction on regular users. WLFI only triggers blacklist or pause functions when there’s a clear fraud or security risk. Why 272 Wallets Were Flagged The blacklist spans only a tiny fraction of WLFI’s total holders. Still, the breakdown offers insight into how threats unfold in real time: 215 wallets (≈79.0%) tied to a phishing attack. 50 wallets (≈18.4%) linked to compromised access. 5 wallets (≈1.8%) flagged for high risk. 1 wallet (≈0.4%), belonging to Justin Sun, suspected of misappropriating funds from other holders. This action shows WLFI’s unique balance between decentralization and user protection. The project is not aiming to control behavior but to block damage before it spreads. We’ve heard community concerns about recent wallet blacklists. Transparency first: WLFI only intervenes to protect users, never to silence normal activity. — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) September 5, 2025 Blacklist and Pause: Why These Functions Exist Decentralized contracts usually leave communities exposed during emergencies. WLFI takes a different approach by embedding blacklist and pause functions into its contract. Blacklist Function: Freezes compromised wallets to stop fund drainage. Pause Function: Temporarily halts transactions in extreme events like exploits or technical failures. WLFI emphasizes these are last-resort safety tools, not everyday controls. Their purpose is protection, ensuring the ecosystem can respond to real-world risks without long-term centralization. How WLFI Detects and Responds to Threats WLFI runs a layered monitoring system to keep its network safe. Each tool brings a different angle: TRM Labs, Provides real-time blockchain forensics, scoring wallets for risk and sanctions exposure. Sumsub, Rescreens KYC data to ensure early participants aren’t linked to sanctioned or fraudulent activity. On-Chain Analytics, Flags unusual trading or transfer patterns. Community Reports, Direct submissions from users feed into blacklist reviews. Multi-Sig Oversight, Any blacklist or pause action requires multiple signatures, cutting down unilateral decision-making risk. This framework builds an audit trail. Every action ties back to data, not personal judgment. Justin Sun’s Controversial Role A unique twist in this case is the involvement of Justin Sun (@justinsuntron). His history with WLFI has been turbulent: Joined the presale, growing his stack to a 10x profit worth over $750M. Publicly claimed he would not sell a single token. Later moved $9M worth of WLFI across accounts, sparking allegations of dumping on the open market. Result: His entire holdings, over $750M in WLFI, ended up blacklisted. This remains one of the most high-profile blacklist cases in DeFi so far. WLFI isn’t leaving affected users in the dark. The team confirmed a review process is underway: Rightful owners of compromised wallets will regain secure access. Once reviews conclude, WLFI will publish a public update on outcomes. Broader ecosystem plans, including new integrations and tradability expansions, remain on schedule. The blacklist, while disruptive in the short term, hasn’t slowed WLFI’s growth roadmap. Staying Safe as a WLFI Holder Security is a shared responsibility. WLFI encourages holders to follow these steps: Only trust links and updates from @worldlibertyfi and the official website. Ignore unsolicited DMs or suspicious replies. Use hardware wallets and enable 2FA where possible. Contact WLFI support before making moves you’re unsure of. The rise in phishing and wallet compromises shows just how quickly attackers adapt. Staying alert is key. WLFI’s design challenges the binary narrative of decentralization vs. control. By embedding safety tools like blacklist and pause, the project creates a middle path. It lets decentralization thrive while still protecting users during crises. The recent blacklisting of 272 wallets is proof of that balance in action. It’s not about restriction. It’s about stability, security, and transparency in a space where billions of dollars move without pause. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Does LTC have a good long-term future? Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might reach $1000 in no time. Recent news/opinion on Litecoin A lighthearted spat between Litecoin’s official X account and crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen amused the crypto community heading into the weekend. Cowen poked fun at Litecoin’s long-term performance against Bitcoin, quipping “the quiet part.” Litecoin clapped back , “Your head reminds me of the great recession,” sparking a string of playful jabs. The back-and-forth included jokes about market cap, headwear, and chart patterns, keeping traders entertained beyond price charts. Litecoin price prediction September 2025 Litecoin’s price shows signs of bullish moves as it has been surging toward $130. However, as BTC’s price aims for a hold above the $120K mark in September, Litecoin’s price intends to end this month on a bullish note. As a result, we might see the LTC price record a low of $90, with a maximum price of $130 and an average price of $105.

On September 1, 2025, the WLFI governance token had its token generation event (TGE), which unlocked 20% of the total 100 billion tokens, with Justin Sun claiming 600 million tokens valued at approximately $200 million. Justin Sun publicly stated that he had no plans to sell his unlocked tokens, emphasizing his alignment with the project’s long-term vision and commitment to increasing the USD1 stablecoin supply by $200 million. However, after supposedly making an on-chain move of roughly $9 million worth of the asset, World Liberty Financial blocked his ability to transfer or use his multi-million dollar stash of WLFI. What happened to Sun’s WLFI tokens? Sun condemned the move and has since explained that the address involved “only carried out a few general exchange deposit tests with very small amounts, followed by an address dispersion.” “No buying or selling was involved, so it could not possibly have any impact on the market,” he wrote on X. Despite his firm denial , some still think that Sun was secretly selling his allocation as the suspicious transactions were flagged by blockchain analytics platform Nansen and Arkham Intelligence. If it is confirmed that he was selling the tokens before they vested, some believe it is grounds for account action. Of course, Sun continues to deny any wrongdoing, and he has asked that his tokens be unlocked so he can continue supporting the project. Other WLFI wallets also got frozen Sun’s dispute with World Liberty Finance is the most popular, but it is not the only case of token freezing involving the project. World Liberty Finance’s response to a user who reported that their token was frozen. Source: @bitfalls viax/Twitter Another user has also reported their tokens were frozen, and the reason they were given in an email from the project was that their wallet had been flagged due to its “high risk blockchain exposure.” However, while Sun seems to be holding out hope his tokens will be unlocked, perhaps because of his status in the industry, this user seems to have given up hope. In a recent tweet, they referenced the email they got from WLFI and wrote: “just got a reply from @worldlibertyfi. TLDR is, they stole my money, and because it’s the @POTUS family, I can’t do anything about it. This is the new age mafia. There is no one to complain to, no one to argue with, no one to sue. It just… is.” The user also tagged the famous ZachXBT, calling it “the scam of all scams.” When the crypto sleuth replied, he seemed to confirm that it was possible the user’s account was a false positive and expressed hope that things would be resolved soon. Others who weighed in on the subject asked important questions too, like why the project did not decide the wallet was high risk while it accepted funds from them. In fact, one user went as far as accusing World Liberty of just trying to stave off sell pressure by “blacklisting wallets of ICO participants,” a theory many others believe, as they joked about how the user was being punished for attempting to sell before the team.

The raise comes as the firms prepare to merge and list on the Nasdaq under the StablecoinX name under the ticker “USDE.” The funds will support a long-term treasury strategy built around Ethena’s ENA token. StablecoinX is expected to hold more than 3 billion ENA, the companies said, adding that the company is expected to be the first dedicated treasury vehicle for the stablecoin protocol. Investors include Brevan Howard, Susquehanna Crypto, and IMC Trading, alongside repeat backers Dragonfly and ParaFi. The Ethena Foundation is matching the effort with a fresh $310 million buyback program, bringing total announced purchases to $570 million. Proceeds will be used to acquire ENA on public markets. To align their strategy with market structure, StablecoinX formed a new advisory board chaired by Rob Hadick of Dragonfly. The board will focus on governance, partnerships, and long-term shareholder value as the company links public equity capital with Ethena’s token economy.

This comes as SHIB bulls eye a new all-time high (ATH), with the meme coin potentially reaching $0.00009. Shiba Inu Holders Are Refusing To Sell Despite SHIB’s Underperformance Glassnode data shows that Shiba Inu’s holder retention rate is currently at 96%, having been on an uptrend over the last thirty days. The metric tracks the percentage of addresses that have held SHIB over the past 30 days. An uptick indicates that holders aren’t selling but instead even accumulating more coins. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Market Maker Is On The Move With Billions Of SHIB, Here’s What We Know Furthermore, Santiment data confirms that investors are still accumulating Shiba Inu, despite SHIB’s underperformance. Notably, the number of holders have continued to rise amid the price downtrend, and there are now 1.53 million SHIB holders. This comes as the meme coin looks to hold above the psychological $0.000010 price level. However, a negative for SHIB is the downtrend in the holdings of Shiba Inu whales. Santiment data shows these whales have continued to offload their coins amid the meme coin’s underperformance. These whales refer to those holding 10 million coins and above. Notably, they account for over 98% of the meme coin’s total supply. This also explains why there have been more exchange inflows than outflows, highlighting the fact that there is currently more supply than demand. On September 5, the exchange inflows were 73.73 billion SHIB while the outflows were 46.25 billion coins. Meanwhile, supply on exchanges remains sideways, with whales choosing to offload their coins and stay on the sidelines rather than actively buying the dip. SHIB Bulls Eye New ATH Shiba Inu bulls are eyeing a new all-time high for the meme coin despite its underperformance this year. Crypto analyst Javon Marks has also fuelled the bullish outlook for the SHIB price, predicting that it could record a rally of over 500%, which would bring it close to its current ATH of $0.00008845. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Forms Double Bottom At Demand Zone — What To Expect In an X post, Marks said that Shiba Inu has confirmed a bullish pattern in a regular bull divergence with the MACD Histogram. He explained that this suggests that the SHIB price is about to record a major bullish reversal to the upside, which can include a move of over 163% back into the $0.00003 range. The crypto analyst further remarked that this move may only be the start. He stated that the 163% move could be part of an over 570% run to the $0.000081 breakout target if the Shiba Inu price continues to hold well broken out of an older structure.

Next Pump Is Coming Soon,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-be-ready-next-xrp-pump-is-coming-soon/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a popular crypto analyst on X, has issued a new update on XRP’s price trajectory. The analyst asked investors to prepare for a massive XRP pump and attached a chart suggesting that a significant move is imminent. XRP’s Current Position At the time of press, XRP trades close to $2.8, a level that has acted as short-term support. This follows a pullback from highs seen in July , where the token briefly touched $3.65. The decline stretched through late August and continued into early September , with the market unable to sustain momentum. Despite this weakness, XRP has largely held above the $2.7 threshold, consolidating in a narrowing structure . The patterns on Steph’s chart suggest that the digital asset is nearing a crucial decision phase that could put an end to weeks of underperformance. Be ready. The next #XRP pump is coming soon pic.twitter.com/3vKaupgqS5 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 5, 2025 XRP Technical Structure in Focus Steph’s chart highlights this consolidation clearly. XRP price action has been confined within a symmetrical triangle, formed by lower highs since July and steady support in the $2.7 to $2.8 area. This pattern typically reflects market indecision but also sets the stage for a breakout once one side gains control. The symmetrical triangle is tightening, and the recent candles suggest that XRP is nearing the apex. Historically, when assets reach this stage, a sharp directional move often follows. Steph’s projection shows XRP breaking upward from the triangle, with dotted arrows suggesting a rapid push toward higher levels. XRP Potential Targets The chart illustrates that if XRP successfully breaks above the upper trendline, the next major target lies in the $4 to $4.5 range. This would represent a gain of roughly 42% to 60% from current prices. A move of this scale would align with the pattern’s measured objective. Symmetrical triangles often resolve in a move that mirrors the prior leg of momentum. In XRP’s case, the strong surge in July brought the token from around $2.2 to $3.65 in a short span, and a breakout could produce a similar magnitude of gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The $3.65 level, where XRP topped out in July, may be the first resistance point, but Steph’s analysis sees continuation beyond that mark if buying pressure accelerates. Another analyst has also noted that beating $3.65 could open the door to double-digit targets , and Steph’s $4 to $4.5 target could be the first phase of a much larger climb for XRP. For now, traders are closely watching the $2.8 support and the descending trendline overhead. A decisive move beyond either boundary will likely determine XRP’s next major phase.

The CRO tokens were purchased at $0.153 each, representing about 2% of the token’s circulating supply. The acquisition is part of a broader plan to integrate CRO into the Truth Social ecosystem, including the upcoming Truth+ streaming service. According to the company, CRO will be used within a new incentive system, with the Crypto.com wallet serving as a key component. Launch of New CRO-Focused Entity In addition to the token purchase, Trump Media announced the creation of Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, Inc., a subsidiary that will manage a $6.42 billion CRO treasury. The new entity has already signed a definitive merger agreement with Yorkville’s SPAC firm, YA II PN, Ltd., paving the way for a public listing. CEO Devin Nunes called the move a strategic step forward: “We believe CRO has tremendous potential for widespread adoption as a universal utility token and a secure, fast payment solution. We’re excited to add this innovative asset to our balance sheet.” Following the announcement, CRO prices climbed over 3% on Binance, signaling market optimism about the deal. Trump Media is already a significant holder of Bitcoin and has previously applied to launch an ETF backed by a basket of crypto assets, now including CRO.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Northern California on Friday, claims Apple used pirated copies of books by Grady Hendrix and Jennifer Roberson to build its OpenELM large language models without authorization, credit, or payment. The proposed class action adds Apple to a growing list of technology companies facing litigation over their use of copyrighted material in training datasets. “Apple has not attempted to pay these authors for their contributions to this potentially lucrative venture,” the complaint said. Hendrix, based in New York, and Roberson, in Arizona, allege their works were part of a dataset of pirated books long known to circulate in machine learning research circles. AI firms are facing copyright lawsuits The action against Apple comes amid a series of high-profile legal battles over the use of copyrighted material in AI development. On the same day, AI startup Anthropic said it would pay $1.5 billion to settle claims from a group of authors who alleged it trained its Claude chatbot without appropriate permission. Lawyers for the plaintiffs described the deal as the largest copyright recovery in history, even though Anthropic did not admit liability. Other tech giants are also facing similar litigation. Microsoft was sued in June by a group of writers who claim their works were used without permission to train its Megatron model. Meta Platforms and OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, have likewise been accused of appropriating copyrighted works without licenses. The stakes for Apple For Apple, the lawsuit is a setback as the company seeks to expand its AI capabilities after unveiling its OpenELM family of models earlier this year. Marketed as smaller, more efficient alternatives to frontier systems from OpenAI and Google, the models are designed to be integrated across Apple’s hardware and software ecosystem. The plaintiffs argue that Apple’s reliance on pirated works taints those efforts and leaves the company open to claims of unjust enrichment. Analysts say Apple may be especially vulnerable because it has positioned itself as a privacy-first, user-centric technology provider. If courts find that its AI models were trained on stolen data, the reputational blow could be even more impactful than any financial penalty. The lawsuits also highlight the unresolved question of how copyright law applies to AI training. Supporters of “fair use” argue that exposure to text is akin to a human reading, providing context for generating new material rather than reproducing originals. Opponents contend that wholesale ingestion of copyrighted works without a license deprives creators of rightful compensation. Anthropic’s record settlement may tilt the balance. By agreeing to a massive payout, even without admitting liability, the company has signaled the risks of fighting such cases in court. Apple now faces the prospect of similar financial exposure if its case proceeds to trial.

51293905,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/blockdag-turns-quiet-execution-into-400m-firepower-latest-on-uniswap-toncoin-ton-price-prediction,1757173194,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png,BlockDAG Turns Quiet Execution Into $400M Firepower; Latest on Uniswap & Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/blockdag-turns-quiet-execution-into-400m-firepower-latest-on-uniswap-toncoin-ton-price-prediction,"In a market driven by momentum, ecosystem strength, and community conviction, investors are increasingly turning toward projects that balance utility with scalability. Toncoin (TON) price prediction models suggest cautious optimism as bulls defend the $313 level, betting on messaging integrations and payment use cases. Similarly, the Uniswap (UNI) price prediction highlights potential upside as DeFi regains liquidity, with UNI trading at attractive accumulation ranges. Yet both carry the familiar risks of established tokens, slower growth curves and dependency on broader market sentiment. In contrast, BlockDAG has ignited fresh debate about what qualifies as the best long term crypto. With $400M already raised and 312,000 holders backing its presale, BDAG’s trajectory looks less like speculative hype and more like the early structural resilience seen in Bitcoin’s formative years. While TON and UNI remain relevant, BlockDAG stands apart as the emerging ecosystem designed for exponential adoption. TON Coin Holds $313 Support, Bulls Target $327 Breakout The Open Network’s native token, TON, is showing resilience as it consolidates around the $313 mark. Traders are closely watching this level, with immediate resistance seen near $327. A decisive breakout above could open the path for stronger bullish momentum, while failure to hold support at $300 risks deeper pullbacks. For investors, the consolidation signals a tug-of-war between buyers defending key support and sellers capping short-term rallies. What makes TON worth monitoring is its expanding ecosystem, particularly in messaging integrations and payments, which may add long-term value beyond the current price swings. In simple terms: if $300 holds firm, TON could be primed for a push higher, making this an attractive accumulation zone. But if support breaks, a wider correction may follow. For traders seeking exposure to growth-driven altcoins, TON remains one to keep on the radar. UNI Set to Rebound? Momentum Builds Toward $17 Uniswap’s native token, UNI, is trading around $9.41, holding above key support near $9 despite recent downward pressure. The 50-day simple moving average stands at $10.24, while the longer 200-day average is near $7.58, suggesting short-term weakness but underlying stability. Looking forward, analysts see room for recovery. Projections show UNI could climb as high as $17.16 in 2025, with lower targets near $3.85 and an average around $14.30. These wide ranges highlight both upside potential and the risks investors must weigh. Why consider UNI now? Uniswap remains a leading decentralized exchange in the DeFi sector, facilitating billions in trading volume. If overall crypto market activity picks up, UNI could benefit directly from higher network usage, renewed liquidity, and greater adoption of decentralized trading. For investors, current levels may represent a calculated entry point before possible long-term growth. BlockDAG: $400M Raised, The Countdown to $600M Begins BlockDAG has set the stage for one of the most closely watched crypto presales of the year. With $400M already secured, the project is now more than halfway to its ambitious $600M target, positioning itself as one of the largest community-driven raises in crypto history. What makes this raise unique is its grassroots strength. Unlike projects such as Aptos or Avalanche that leaned heavily on venture capital, BlockDAG’s funding comes from a broad base of 312,000 holders and 19,000 miners shipped worldwide. This wide distribution not only boosts legitimacy but also provides a structural resilience that’s rare in early-stage networks. The tone of the market mirrors the dynamics seen with TON’s $313 support level and UNI’s recovery potential , both tokens show how strong ecosystems and investor conviction create long-term value beyond short-term swings. BlockDAG taps into the same narrative, with its ecosystem integrations, X1 mining app, and expanding utility laying the groundwork for exponential adoption. In simple terms: the presale price at $0.0013 won’t last forever. Once momentum spills into listings, early entry points will be long gone. TON defends. UNI rebuilds. BDAG accelerates When comparing these three contenders, the contrast sharpens. Toncoin (TON) price prediction hinges on whether bulls can sustain momentum above $313, while the Uniswap (UNI) price prediction depends on renewed DeFi activity to lift UNI toward $17 projections. Both remain tied to existing narratives, offering measured growth but little to surprise seasoned investors. BlockDAG, however, presents a different story. With $400M raised en route to a $600M presale target, its community-driven model, 19,000 miners shipped, and X1 mobile app ecosystem combine into a growth blueprint rarely seen in crypto launches. For investors scanning for the best long term crypto , BlockDAG is not just another altcoin , it is a grassroots-powered system with scale, credibility, and the structural backbone to rival the earliest breakout projects. In the end, TON defends, UNI rebuilds, but BDAG accelerates , and acceleration often defines the winners.

Each offers unique propositions in the realms of utility, scalability, and investment potential. In recent developments, Toncoin's adherence to the $313 support level has sparked discussions among investors, anticipating a rise in its valuation based on its expanded utility in payment solutions and messaging systems. Meanwhile, Uniswap seems poised for a rebound in the DeFi space, maintaining its position above significant support levels and suggesting possible future appreciation. Separately, BlockDAG has captivated the crypto community by securing a staggering $400 million during its presale, marking a significant milestone in its journey towards reinventing blockchain technology's scalability and efficiency. This accomplishment not only strengthens its market position but also sets the stage for future growth and integration. Toncoin's Strategic Market Positioning As Toncoin stabilizes around the $313 mark, eyes are on the potential upward movement towards the $327 resistance. The resilience of this level is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum, with implications for both short-term trades and long-term holdings. Strategic developments in Toncoin's ecosystem, particularly in enhancing its functionality with messaging and payment systems, have bolstered its market standing, making it a noteworthy consideration for investors focused on utility-driven crypto assets. Uniswap's Resurgence in the DeFi Arena Despite recent market volatilities, Uniswap has shown commendable stability, demonstrating strong support levels and potential for recovery. Analysts suggest a bullish outlook with forecasts reaching as high as $17 by 2025, reflecting confidence in its underlying fundamentals and its pivotal role in the DeFi sector. Here's why investors might consider Uniswap a viable candidate for portfolio inclusion: The platform's strategic improvements and growing adoption provide a strong case for its potential uplift in the burgeoning DeFi market. BlockDAG's Presale Success and Future Prospects BlockDAG's recent financial achievement in its presale phase, reaching $400 million, distinguishes it as a formidable player in the cryptocurrency arena. This success is underpinned by substantial community support and the deployment of innovative technologies like the X1 mining app and broad ecosystem integrations. The prospects for BlockDAG continue to brighten as it approaches its next financial milestone of $600 million, with profound implications for its scalability and adoption across crypto networks. Comparative Overview: TON, UNI, and BDAG The trajectories of TON, UNI, and BDAG reflect varying investor sentiments and market dynamics. While TON and UNI offer robust, utility-based growth, BDAG's aggressive presale strategy and community backing position it as a potentially revolutionary force in the crypto space. For those seeking long-term value, BlockDAG’s model presents a compelling case, as evidenced by its strategic roadmap . The ongoing developments and strategic positioning of these cryptocurrencies make them noteworthy considerations for both seasoned and new investors.

Why BlockDAG Is The Best Crypto To Buy In September Over PEPENODE & Mirror Token,https://timestabloid.com/400m-raised-why-blockdag-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-in-september/,"In a market flooded with meme coins and Layer 2 solutions, choosing the right project to invest in can be overwhelming. Among the top crypto coins to invest in for 2025, three standout projects have managed to capture the attention of the crypto community: PEPENODE, Mirror Token, and BlockDAG. While PEPENODE brings an innovative, interactive mining approach and Mirror Token promises a scalable solution to Ethereum’s congestion problems, its BlockDAG that takes the spotlight with its massive community backing. With over 312,000 holders and 325,000 community members, BlockDAG’s deep market infrastructure offers the kind of stability that most projects can only dream of. As the presale nears its close, the BlockDAG community is primed for unprecedented growth, making it the best crypto to buy now. Why PEPENODE Could Be the Dark Horse Meme Coin of 2025, Presale Active PEPENODE is standing out in the crowded meme coin market with its innovative concept. Unlike typical meme coins, PEPENODE gives users a chance to deploy virtual mining nodes. These virtual rigs can be upgraded, and the mining results are tracked just like real mining operations, making the experience interactive and rewarding. The system offers PEPENODE tokens and other meme coins as rewards for active participation. What sets PEPENODE apart is its deflationary model, a portion of every transaction and upgrade is burned, reducing token supply over time and creating scarcity. Early presale participants have the chance to earn rewards of over 4,000% through staking, with no need to wait for future utility to unlock. If you’re looking for a meme coin that offers more than just speculative hype, PEPENODE is showing signs of building a sustainable ecosystem. With Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake model, its mining approach is environmentally friendly and doesn’t require expensive hardware. Plus, the referral system provides incentives for long-term growth. Why Mirror Token Could Be the Scalable Ethereum L2 Solution You Need in 2025 Mirror Token offers a promising solution for Ethereum’s scaling issues with its Layer 2 platform. Built using Zero-Knowledge Rollups and EVM compatibility, it ensures faster transactions and lower fees compared to Ethereum’s Layer 1. The platform also features built-in rewards for holders through its reflection mechanism, making it stand out among other presales. This system mirrors data and redistributes rewards, providing value to both developers and users. Mirror Token has already raised over $807K in its presale, demonstrating strong demand. With its strong infrastructure and passive reward system, it’s positioning itself as a top contender for 2025. For those looking for a crypto project with both utility and growth potential, Mirror Token could be a solid option in the evolving blockchain space. BlockDAG’s Massive Community: Why It’s More Than Just Hype and Could Make You Big Returns BlockDAG isn’t just another crypto project, it’s building its market infrastructure, and it’s doing it with impressive speed. With 312,000 holders and over 325,000 community members, BlockDAG has already achieved a scale that most projects don’t hit until after they’ve launched. This massive user base means that when BlockDAG enters exchanges, it won’t have to rely on retail hype or speculative buying to establish liquidity. Instead, it has a strong, active community that will drive governance, staking, and trading activity from day one. This kind of community density is powerful because it ensures the token’s value isn’t just tied to fleeting hype cycles. BlockDAG’s user base is already functioning as market infrastructure, meaning real utility and engagement are built into the project. This is a project that’s not just about attracting attention in the short term but about creating sustainable value for years to come. Currently priced at $0.0013 in the presale, BlockDAG has already sold over 25.8 billion coins across 29 batches. Early investors from batch 1 have seen 2,900% growth and with the launch price projected to be $0.05, there’s a chance to secure a major upside at today’s price. As the presale nears its close, BlockDAG’s momentum is unstoppable. If you’re looking for the next big crypto to buy, BlockDAG’s embedded community and strong presale numbers make it a standout choice with huge potential for massive gains. BlockDAG’s Community-Driven Approach Is the Key to Dominance Over PEPENODE and Mirror Token While PEPENODE offers an exciting meme coin experience with unique mining features and Mirror Token addresses Ethereum’s scalability woes, BlockDAG stands out as the top contender in the best crypto coins to invest in. BlockDAG’s massive community isn’t just about hype – it’s about building a sustainable ecosystem that ensures value for its users. With a $400M presale, 3 million mobile miners, and a robust, active user base, BlockDAG is far more than just a speculative bet. The underlying infrastructure, built on a solid foundation of EVM compatibility and parallel processing, ensures long-term success and market dominance. As BlockDAG moves toward mainstream adoption, investors have the chance to secure a high-reward position before the launch price hits. If you’re looking for a proven and scalable top crypto to invest in, BlockDAG is where you should place your bet.

51293840,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82061,1757174758,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Time Traveler: 2000 XRP Is Enough Money for Me and My Family,https://timestabloid.com/time-traveler-2000-xrp-is-enough-money-for-me-and-my-family/,"Time Traveler recently made a bold statement that resonated across the XRP community: “Amazingly, all I need is 2000 XRP tokens and I can just leave it there. That’s more than enough money for me and my family.” The post reflects the optimism many investors hold, but it also raises key questions about what 2,000 XRP truly represents today, and how its value could change under different price scenarios. The Value of 2,000 XRP Today As of report time, XRP trades at $2.81; a holding of 2,000 XRP equals $5,620. For many households, this is a meaningful sum — enough to cover several months of rent, settle debts, or act as a short-term financial cushion. Still, its impact varies greatly depending on local living costs and broader economic realities. It's amazing that all I need is 2000 XRP tokens and I can just leave it there. That's more than enough money for me and my family. — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) September 6, 2025 Scenarios at $10, $100, and $1,000 The bigger story lies in the potential for future price appreciation. If XRP were to reach $10 , 2,000 tokens would be worth $20,000 — enough to cover a year or more of expenses in many regions. At $100, the value would climb to $200,000, creating life-changing financial security for most families. In the most ambitious scenario of $1,000 per token, the holding would be worth an extraordinary $2 million, shifting from short-term relief to generational wealth . These scenarios capture why XRP continues to inspire holders who view it as a possible gateway to lasting prosperity. Purchasing Power and Practical Considerations Even at today’s levels, the usefulness of 2,000 XRP depends heavily on geography. In lower-cost economies, it could sustain a household for a year, while in high-cost cities, it might only cover a fraction of annual expenses. Converting XRP to fiat currency also involves trading fees, potential slippage, and tax obligations. That said, XRP’s liquidity gives it an advantage over smaller tokens, making cashing out more straightforward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risks and Volatility Time Traveler’s optimism, while inspiring, overlooks the reality of volatility. XRP, like most cryptocurrencies, experiences sharp swings, and a balance valued at $20,000 one month could fall significantly the next. Depending solely on 2,000 XRP for family security exposes holders to risks tied to market downturns, global economic shifts, and regulatory changes. A Balanced Approach If 2,000 XRP represents a personal safety net, pairing optimism with strategy is essential. Protecting holdings in secure wallets, keeping a fiat emergency fund, and diversifying across other assets can help manage risk while preserving long-term potential. A Hopeful Yet Realistic Outlook Time Traveler’s words capture the dream that drives many in the crypto space: the belief that a modest stash can transform into financial freedom. Today, 2,000 XRP equals about $5,600 — a useful cushion but hardly life-changing. Yet if XRP reaches $10, $100, or even $1,000, the story becomes one of complete independence. Until then, ambition must walk side by side with careful planning. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the report, ENA and TRUMP stand out among the altcoins with the highest leverage in the market. Both assets record the highest open interest/market cap ratios relative to their market capitalization, signaling high speculation and risk. Related News: Trump's Altcoin WLFI Explains Why It Froze Justin Sun and Other Users' Assets The report also noted that ENA, OKB, ARB, and MKR recorded their highest Liquidation/Open Position ratios in the last 24 hours. This ratio is considered a key indicator of market volatility and mass liquidations, as it indicates how much of an open position is liquidated quickly. Alphractal argued that for more cautious investors, staying away from these altcoins could reduce liquidation risk. The company cautioned that these assets, fueled by high speculation, are more susceptible to volatility. *This is not investment advice.

The board approved it on Friday, and the final vote is expected at the company’s annual meeting in November. According to Reuters, those guys framed the proposal as the only way to keep Elon from walking away, while also calming concerns about Tesla’s future in artificial intelligence and robotics. The deal gives Elon 96 million restricted shares up front. That stock, worth over $31 billion based on Friday’s trading, can’t be touched for five years. Equilar, a firm that tracks executive pay, estimated that Elon’s total 2025 compensation would go past $113 billion if all targets are hit. The board called it “A Super Ambitious Incentive Package for a Pioneering, Ambitious and Unique CEO,” and said he’s the only one who can take Tesla to the next level. Elon demanded control and raised threats to leave This pay plan didn’t fall from the sky. It took seven months to put together. The board’s compensation committee started talks in February, meeting with lawyers 37 times and with Elon himself 10 times. Three things were off the table from the start: Elon wanted 25% ownership, full say in Tesla’s direction, and complete payout for the 2018 package that got wiped out in court. No compromise. Tesla’s board said in their filing that Elon threatened to leave multiple times, and they were worried the company’s AI talent would follow him. The $31 billion in restricted stock is partly a payback for the $56 billion plan from 2018 that got voided by a Delaware court last year. The board added that if Elon wins his legal challenge fast enough, he won’t receive the new stock payout, “so there can be no ‘double dip.’” In the same filing, they wrote, “Elon also raised the possibility that he may pursue his other interests and leave Tesla if he did not receive such assurance.” The board tied the plan directly to Tesla’s goal of becoming a robotics and AI leader, stating Elon is the only person on the planet who can “unlock Tesla’s full potential.” Investors split while public voices raise alarms Courtney Yu, research director at Equilar, said: “Time and time again, Tesla’s shareholders have approved these grants over the years. While it may seem outlandish now, shareholders will get tremendous value out of it if Elon Musk is successful.” But not everyone’s on board. Kristin Hull, founder of Nia Impact Capital, said the package was “irresponsible.” She argued, “This is investor money that could go into R&D or acquisitions, places that would really benefit Tesla in the long term.” She’s considering a joint challenge with other investors. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said the package is excessive and could be dangerous for corporate governance. “He also presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Elon’s actions outside of Tesla,” Dan said. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called for rejection. “We urge shareholders to reject Elon’s money grab, take away the Tesla board’s rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards,” she said. None of the three biggest outside investors (Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street) said how they’d vote. Last year, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Elon’s $56 billion plan. State Street did not. Elon currently owns around 13% of Tesla. The board says the 303 million stock options from 2018, still under legal dispute, push that up to 19.7%. If this new plan is approved and Elon hits his goals, he could own 25% within seven years. The deal pays out in 12 tranches, only if milestones are met. If everything clicks, the board says Tesla’s market value could hit $8.5 trillion, higher than Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet combined. On Friday, Tesla’s stock closed 3.6% higher at $350.84. But it’s still down 13% in 2025. Investors are uneasy about Tesla’s struggling EV business and global competition. Dan summed up the mood: “One minute Tesla’s board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they’re effectively saying ‘pick a number, any number’ to lock him in for as long as possible.” He added, “Surely Elon should be fighting for his job, not Tesla’s board fighting to keep him?” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|Tesla,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-06 16:30:22

Bitcoin is still a solid store of value but according to some traders, outsized returns might be elsewhere at this point. Analysts suggest that while Solana strengthens its network, the real 7,000% growth opportunity in 2025 is unfolding with Remittix , a PayFi altcoin that has already raised over $24 million through the sale of 645 million tokens at $0.1030 each. Bitcoin Holds Its Ground At $110,000 Source: TradingView Bitcoins have begun the week on an upswing, and it is now over its 100-day EMA of $110,748, then moving up to regain its strength at $112,000 . Fading bearish momentum is exhibited by technical indicators like the RSI, which are pointing upwards to neutral levels. In the meantime, the MACD is shaping a bullish crossover, which indicates that Bitcoin might hit resistance again in the near future at the level of $116,000. Analysts are, however, alerting that in case BTC does not maintain this trend, then there is a possibility of a drop to about the support level of $105,573. Bitcoin remains stable with 90% of the supply already profitable, but it might only offer moderate returns relative to small and high-growth tokens . Solana Price Still Faces Resistance Source: BitGuru Solana price action has been mixed, currently trading around $206 . Despite strong developments such as the Alpenglow upgrade that slashes transaction finality to 150 milliseconds and new tokenization projects attracting institutions, SOL remains capped below $217. Short-term outlooks suggest potential gains toward $220–$230, but volatility persists as the MACD indicator shows bearish signals. For investors, Solana offers innovation and speed in DeFi, but the upside appears limited compared to emerging PayFi challengers . This explains why attention is increasingly shifting to projects like Remittix. Why Remittix Is Seen As The 7,000% Moonshot Remittix is positioning itself as the next big crypto launch, aiming to solve real-world payment challenges with blockchain rails that connect crypto directly to bank accounts. With Solana still consolidating and Bitcoin holding as a safe haven, Remittix is gaining traction as the best crypto project of 2025 for outsized gains. Investors see it as a next 100x crypto opportunity that combines real utility with explosive growth potential. Here are some reasons why Remittix is being tipped as the altcoin to watch: Over $24M raised with more than 645M tokens sold at $0.1030 each Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank once the $20M milestone is crossed Beta wallet launch on September 15 with real-time FX conversion features Business API designed to onboard remitters, freelancers and global merchants $250,000 community giveaway fueling massive retail engagement The Shift From Safe Havens To High-Growth Plays Although Bitcoin and Solana will likely continue to form the backbone of the crypto market, traders seeking the most favorable crypto to invest in today are also diversifying into asymmetric projects. Remittix is projected to grow by up to 7,000 percent and is not only another DeFi project, but it may be the fastest-growing crypto by 2025.

According to Santiment, BTC dominated conversation as users debated its role as “digital gold,” its long-term investment appeal and the significance of growing government and institutional involvement. The firm noted that discussion also emphasized self-custody and the use of nodes as a way to secure the network. ETH also featured prominently. Santiment observed that ETH was frequently referenced in promotional materials for short-lived tokens marketed as easily transferable and spendable, suggesting ether continues to play a role in how new products are presented to crypto audiences. DOGE's surge in attention came from two developments, Santiment said. Rex-Osprey is preparing to launch what would be the first U.S.-listed Dogecoin exchange-traded fund, while Trump-backed Thumzup announced an expansion of its mining operations with the purchase of 3,500 rigs. Tether drew interest over its strategy to invest more heavily in the entire gold supply chain, Santiment reported. The firm said Tether executives described the metal as “natural bitcoin,” underscoring how the stablecoin issuer is broadening its portfolio beyond digital assets. Finally, Santiment said discussion around MultiversX centered on concerns about dilution from an increase in EGLD supply. Users expressed worries about projects leaving for other chains such as Sui, though some noted ongoing work on services like xPortal and xMoney. Founded in 2016, Santiment tracks market, sentiment and on-chain data across thousands of crypto assets.

Something BIG Is Brewing,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-volume-explodes-something-big-is-brewing/,"Markets have been unsettled in recent weeks, with several leading cryptocurrencies experiencing sideways movement after strong rallies in July. Amid this uncertain backdrop, Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a prominent crypto influencer on X, highlighted a sharp increase in XRP activity that has begun to capture interest across the market. According to Xaif, the digital asset had a trading volume of more than 5.94 billion tokens before a swift rise sent it up by 44% to reach $6.61 billion. This surge in activity coincided with XRP’s price shifting direction after its recent decline, raising speculation that momentum could be turning in the asset’s favor. XRP VOLUME EXPLOSION $XRP activity just surged 5.94B+ tokens traded Volume spiked 44% to $6.57B shocking the market as price flips direction! Something BIG is brewing… pic.twitter.com/h44ni4Tgeb — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) September 5, 2025 XRP’s Recent Struggles Despite the encouraging rise in activity, XRP has struggled in recent sessions. After reaching an all-time high in July , the asset entered a consolidation phase before falling below the $3 support in late August. It retreated to $2.7, scaring many investors who had anticipated a continued climb. This period of decline was marked by subdued momentum and a lack of clear catalysts, leaving the asset lagging behind several other large-cap cryptocurrencies in terms of performance. The asset’s price currently hovers above $2.8, but failure to sustain that level could cause a deeper retracement. However, Xaif’s comments suggest the market may be shifting in XRP’s favor. Signs of a Possible Recovery The surge in volume and the accompanying uptick in market capitalization provide a potential counterpoint to the recent weakness. High volume often precedes meaningful price action, and the data suggests that traders are once again engaging with the asset in significant numbers. The asset experienced massive sell-offs in August, contributing to its decline. However, rising volume suggests some of these large investors could return, seeing the current low price as an opportunity to accumulate. Xaif’s emphasis on the volume spike reflects this shift, framing it as evidence that “something BIG is brewing.” If XRP maintains the current momentum, it could begin to recover from its recent decline and break out of this consolidation phase to reestablish support at higher levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The increase in activity may represent the first sign of renewed strength in a while.

The announcement arrived as the ENA token price surged more than 12% in a single day, outpacing most of the broader crypto market. ArkStream Doubles Down on Ethena This new funding follows a $5 million injection made at the end of 2024, raising ArkStream’s total support to $15 million. ArkStream Capital praised Ethena Labs for its quick progress in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The firm said Ethena’s steady growth and adoption led to its decision to invest more. It also noted that Ethena’s mix of equity and crypto-native protocol creates a “flywheel effect” between its USDe and ENA token. The effect is clear. As more people use USDe, ENA becomes more central to the ecosystem, fueling both adoption and investor confidence. This is not ArkStream’s first major investment in Ethena. MEXC previously committed $20 million to USDe adoption. Support from Major Investors and Buyback Programs The Ethena Foundation launched a $360 million buyback program that has steadily supported ENA prices. The Foundation is buying back $5 million worth of tokens each day, similar to how companies return capital in traditional markets. Investors also show strong confidence in the project. In August, wallets holding 100,000 to 1 million ENA grew by 12%, and while some tokens moved to exchanges for profit-taking, big holders kept increasing their positions. Ethena is not stopping at product adoption. The firm recently partnered with Anchorage Digital to develop USDtb, a GENIUS-compliant stablecoin for the U.S. market. This makes Ethena one of the first issuers preparing for the incoming regulatory framework. On the settlement side, Ethena co-developed Converge Chain, a modular blockchain where USDe and USDtb will serve as gas and settlement assets. ENA staking will secure the network, directly linking the token’s value to the growth of on-chain financial activity. USDe Growth and Market Recognition Ethena’s USDe stablecoin continues to gain traction. At the end of August, the token’s supply had crossed $12.5 billion, making it the third-largest stablecoin in circulation. Its delta-neutral yield model currently offers annualized returns between 9% and 11%, and many in the market now view it as a “quasi-risk-free” rate for decentralized finance. Demand for USDe on lending platforms is rising. Aave reported $4.7 billion in assets linked to Ethena, with steady growth in daily trading revenue. This shows that USDe is becoming a popular choice for collateral and payments. Ethena is also expanding into new channels. With its integration on the TON Blockchain, USDe will soon be available on Telegram. This could bring yield-bearing digital dollars to billions of users and take crypto beyond the traditional DeFi space.

According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC has notably fallen below the critical $110,000 mark. This movement, with BTC trading at $109,990.6 on the Binance USDT market, signals a moment of caution and re-evaluation for many. What Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Signify? When Bitcoin, the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, experiences a significant shift like a Bitcoin price drop below a key psychological and technical level, it often triggers a ripple effect across the entire digital asset ecosystem. This particular dip below $110,000 is more than just a number; it represents a potential shift in market sentiment and could influence short-term trading strategies. Historically, such price movements are not uncommon in the volatile crypto market. However, each instance provides valuable insights into market dynamics and investor behavior. This recent decline prompts important questions about underlying factors and what lies ahead for BTC. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop Below This Key Level? Understanding the catalysts behind a Bitcoin price drop is crucial for informed decision-making. While pinpointing a single cause is often challenging, several factors typically contribute to such market movements: Macroeconomic Pressures: Global economic indicators, such as inflation data, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical events, can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Whale Activity: Large transactions by significant holders (often called ‘whales’) can exert considerable pressure on prices, either by selling off substantial amounts or accumulating. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding new regulations in major economies can create uncertainty and lead to selling pressure. Technical Indicators: Breaking through key support levels, like the $110,000 mark, can trigger automated sell orders and further accelerate a decline. Market Sentiment: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) can quickly spread through social media and news outlets, impacting investor confidence and leading to panic selling. It is essential to remember that the crypto market is interconnected, and a downturn in one major asset can often affect others. How Should Investors React to a Bitcoin Price Drop? For both seasoned and new investors, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling. However, it also presents an opportunity for strategic thinking. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor reliable news sources and market analysis to understand the broader context. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Panic selling often leads to losses. Base your decisions on research and your long-term investment strategy, not on immediate fear. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: A market correction can be a good time to review your asset allocation and risk tolerance. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, buying smaller, fixed amounts regularly, regardless of price, can average out your purchase cost over time. Look for Opportunities: For some, a dip represents a chance to buy at a lower price. Always do your due diligence before making any investment. Remember, the crypto market is known for its volatility, and price fluctuations are a normal part of its cycle. What’s Next After This Bitcoin Price Drop? Predicting the exact future trajectory of Bitcoin is impossible, but historical patterns suggest resilience. Markets often consolidate after significant moves, searching for new support levels before potentially recovering. The current Bitcoin price drop could be a temporary correction or the start of a longer consolidation phase. Market participants will now be closely watching for signs of stabilization, increased buying volume, and positive news developments. Institutional adoption, technological advancements, and a clearer regulatory landscape could all play a role in Bitcoin’s next major move. While the immediate sentiment might be cautious, the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin, such as its scarcity and decentralized nature, remain strong. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $110,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can trigger anxiety, they also underscore the importance of informed decision-making, strategic planning, and a long-term perspective. Staying calm, conducting thorough research, and understanding your personal risk tolerance are paramount to navigating these exciting yet volatile digital frontiers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a Bitcoin price drop below $110,000 mean for the overall crypto market? A significant Bitcoin price drop often acts as a leading indicator for the broader crypto market. Many altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s movements, so a dip in BTC can lead to similar corrections across other digital assets. However, some altcoins might show independent strength or weakness. Q2: Is this Bitcoin price drop a good opportunity to buy BTC? Whether a Bitcoin price drop is a good buying opportunity depends on your personal investment strategy, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook for Bitcoin. Many investors use such dips to ‘buy the dip’ if they believe in the asset’s future growth. However, it’s crucial to do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q3: How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? The duration of a Bitcoin price drop can vary significantly. Some dips are short-lived corrections that last days or weeks, while others can extend into longer bear markets lasting months or even over a year. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has always recovered and reached new highs eventually, but past performance is not indicative of future results. Q4: What are the key indicators to watch after a Bitcoin price drop? After a Bitcoin price drop, investors should monitor several key indicators: trading volume (to see if buying pressure is returning), technical support and resistance levels, news regarding macroeconomic trends, regulatory updates, and on-chain metrics (like exchange inflows/outflows or whale movements). These can provide clues about potential market direction. Q5: Does a Bitcoin price drop affect the underlying technology? No, a Bitcoin price drop does not affect the underlying blockchain technology. Bitcoin’s network continues to operate securely and efficiently regardless of its market price. The technology’s fundamentals, such as its decentralization, security, and immutability, remain unchanged. Did you find this analysis helpful?

He said the job market was weaker than it looked and warned that keeping interest rates high would hurt businesses and workers. This week, the labor data proved him right. More than 300,000 jobs were erased from the last four months of reports, exposing just how broken the Fed’s data really was. The numbers that Jerome Powell used to hold rates steady were simply wrong. The labor market appeared healthy earlier in 2025. Inflation still wasn’t at the Fed’s 2% target, but the job growth seemed strong enough to stay the course. Then came the revisions. Hundreds of thousands of jobs disappeared from the books, and it became obvious that something was off. Trump had seen it coming. Powell didn’t. But Powell’s decision to hold wasn’t random; it was based on what the faulty data showed at the time. According to a report from Yahoo Finance, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said, “Jerome Powell needs to do his job and cut those interest rates now.” She asked, “What is he waiting for?” Trump followed up on Truth Social, calling him “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell” and slamming him for not acting sooner. Fed prepares to cut after weak August jobs report The jobs report released Friday was the last one before the Fed’s September 16–17 meeting. The U.S. economy added just 22,000 jobs in August. Analysts had expected 75,000. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, up from 4.2%. That was the third straight month of slower job growth. June was revised down to -13,000, and July also came in weak. On August 28, Powell gave a speech at Jackson Hole, where he said the “balance of risks” was changing, and the Fed may need to adjust its policy stance. By the time Friday’s numbers hit, most analysts and investors already saw what was coming. Leslie Falconio, head of taxable fixed income strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management, told Yahoo Finance, “The question of a cut is no question. There is going to be a cut.” Greg Daco, chief economist at EY, still expects a small cut this month. But he says the bigger question is what the Fed will do at the final two meetings of 2025 and into 2026. Right now, the market puts the chance of a cut this month at 99%. White House turns up pressure, Fed officials respond Chavez-DeRemer has been one of the loudest voices pushing Powell to ease policy. She said, “If he doesn’t cut rates, the American people will continue to suffer.” She pointed out that companies are investing trillions into the economy and need cheaper money to grow their workforces. “Why he’s waiting boggles my mind,” she said. “He knows the data, he knows how important this is, and if it’s a political move, it’s nonsense. He needs to go ahead and move forward and cut those rates.” Inside the Fed, not everyone is silent. Chris Waller, a Fed Governor, supported a 25-basis-point cut as early as July. On August 28, before the latest report dropped, Waller said risks to the labor market were growing and that a cut this month could help stop further damage. He said the Fed still wasn’t behind the curve but needed to act before it got worse. Even though the jobs data was disappointing, some economists still see limits. Bradley Saunders from Capital Economics said a bigger 50-basis-point cut was unlikely. “While the weak 22,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in August confirms what already looked like a nailed-on rate cut at this month’s FOMC meeting, the limited rise in the unemployment rate to 4.3% will curb calls for a larger 50bp move,” Saunders said. The 22,000 job gain is now below what economists call the break-even rate, the amount of jobs needed each month just to keep up with population growth. That number used to be above 100,000, but has dropped recently. Lower immigration and fewer available jobs have pulled that number down. Earlier this week, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said the economy may now only need 30,000 to 80,000 jobs each month to support population growth, not the old 100,000+. That changes how the Fed might judge job gains going forward.",OP-ED|Bureau of Labor Statistics|Federal Reserve|FOMC,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-06 16:42:40

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $1.57. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $13.01. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery above $0.28. WLFI price chart prediction: World Liberty Financial faces buying pressure above $0.28 WLFI price is facing a surge as buyers push the price above $0.28. WLFI price is aiming for a hold above the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged toward $71.5 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.2841, surging over 8% in the last 24 hours. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and currently hovers around 64, showing that bulls are aiming to control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. WLFI/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour WLFI price chart suggests WLFI continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the Fib level, bears prepare for a domination by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.29, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost an upward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening bullish positions.

However, if WLFI’s price successfully breaks above $0.2895, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.3066. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, WLFI’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2607, resulting in a correction to $0.2319. WLFI crypto news World Liberty Financial, the Trump-backed crypto project, froze Justin Sun’s wallet after he sent $9 million in WLFI tokens to his HTX exchange. Sun pushed back, saying he would buy $10M of ALTS and another $10M of WLFI, even though he already holds a $75M stake as one of the project’s biggest investors. The clash comes as WLFI has dropped 40% since launch, sparking rumors that insiders and early backers are selling off their tokens. Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. I predicted big things for this project. I feel they ran into a problem on launch by partnering with a toxic individual (not confirmed) but with him out of the picture I’m long. When it didn’t immediately shoot up a few crybabies tweeted at me. Keep in mind everybody bought… https://t.co/YmOzuWLlhE — Tristan Tate (@TateTheTalisman) September 6, 2025 However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price down today? TBD What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction September 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in September month.

The WLFI token price initially surged toward $0.478 but it later declined toward $0.1611. On 6 September, the WLFI price again attempted a surge toward $0.2.",Crypto Price Predictions|WLFI|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-06 16:51:59

However, the presale performance of PEPENODE, Snorter, and BlockDAG offers a rare opportunity to look beyond the noise and focus on real innovation. While PEPENODE captures attention with its unique virtual mining game and innovative tokenomics, and Snorter stands out for its trading bot’s low fees and rug pull detection, neither can compare to the structured ROI BlockDAG delivers. With 76,815% upside from the presale price of $0.0013, BlockDAG isn’t just another project hoping for a pump. It’s a top crypto to invest in, providing early buyers a clear, well-supported path to substantial gains. Unlike the speculative meme coins or trading bots with unpredictable outcomes, BlockDAG’s growth is anchored in solid technology and real-world use cases, setting it apart as a long-term investment. As PEPENODE and Snorter ride the wave of meme coin popularity, BlockDAG offers a structured, undeniable growth trajectory, making it the best option for investors who are serious about 2025 and beyond. PEPENODE Presale: Why It’s One of the Best Crypto Opportunities Right Now PEPENODE is changing the game with its unique approach to mining. Unlike most projects that rely on hype, PEPENODE offers a virtual mining game where users can earn actual crypto by building and upgrading digital mining rigs. The presale price is set at $0.0010325, making it affordable for many to get involved early. The project’s deflationary model burns a significant portion of tokens spent on upgrades, ensuring reduced supply over time. Users can also stake tokens for up to 4,000% rewards, earning passive income as they engage with the platform. The development plan includes NFT upgrades and token listings, making PEPENODE a solid investment with a real-use case and a straightforward presale setup. PEPENODE offers an interesting chance for those looking for an innovative project in the crypto space. Snorter Presale Surpasses $3.5M: A Game-Changer for Crypto Traders Despite the ongoing market dip, Snorter, a new Solana-based meme coin trading bot, has raised over $3.5 million in its presale. The bot offers users a unique advantage by identifying promising meme coins, charging low fees, and protecting against rug pulls. With features like copy trading, automated token sniping, and AI-powered rug pull detection, Snorter addresses common crypto trading risks while improving user experience. The presale is currently priced at $0.1029, with the price increasing over time, making it a good entry point. Analysts predict Snorter could offer significant returns, with some even projecting 100x gains once it hits the open market. The tool’s low fees and smart features position it as a strong contender in the growing meme coin space. If you’re looking for a secure, low-fee trading option with high potential, Snorter may be worth considering. BlockDAG’s $1 Target: A Structured 76,815% ROI You Can’t Afford to Miss BlockDAG’s presale is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about opportunities in the crypto world. Early investors who bought at $0.001 are already sitting on a 2,900% return, and for those getting in now at the $0.0013 Deployment Event price, the math still points to a jaw-dropping 76,815% upside. Unlike many of the hyped-up meme coins that rely on empty promises, BlockDAG offers a structured ROI that’s built into its presale ladder. The beauty of BlockDAG’s presale is that the returns aren’t just a pipe dream; they’re tied to real, measurable growth. Whale investors, with $4.4M and $3.6M entries, have validated this structure, showing that big players are confident in the project’s long-term prospects. This isn’t about chasing random pumps; it’s about backing a project with a clear trajectory for growth. With 25.2 billion tokens already sold across 29 batches, BlockDAG’s presale is nearing the final stages. The price is set to climb, and as demand increases, those who act now will still be able to buy at the $0.0013 price. Once the price hits $1, early investors will see returns that few other projects can match. If you’re looking for the best crypto presale to buy now, BlockDAG offers a structured path to exceptional returns. Don’t wait—this opportunity won’t last long. BlockDAG’s 76,815% ROI Makes It The Clear Winner Among PEPENODE & Snorter If you’re serious about finding the best crypto to invest in, look no further than BlockDAG. While PEPENODE and Snorter bring innovation to their respective niches, BlockDAG’s ROI trajectory is unmatched. With whale-backed confidence, $400M raised, and millions of users already on board, its presale structure guarantees a much higher likelihood of substantial returns, making it the standout contender. By contrast, PEPENODE offers an interesting model but lacks the broad utility and structured growth of BlockDAG, while Snorter capitalizes on the meme coin frenzy with its trading bot but faces uncertain long-term scalability. BlockDAG’s combination of high-speed transactions, scalability, and deflationary tokenomics makes it the top crypto to invest in for those looking for long-term, sustainable gains. As $0.0013 still offers an entry point into what could become a $1 asset, now is the time to act. Don’t miss out on BlockDAG, a future-proof investment that leaves PEPENODE and Snorter in the rearview.

BONK price prediction analysis shows the meme coin battling for stability, trading near $0.00002157 and testing key support. In contrast, the Stellar (XLM) price outlook looks brighter, powered by four major developments including U.S. government data integration, Telegram payments, NEAR Intents interoperability, and UNDP partnerships. Stellar is clearly carving real-world use cases. Yet both pale compared to BlockDAG , where execution and adoption are setting historic precedents. With $400M raised, 312,000 holders, 3M mobile miners, and whales investing $4.4M in single buys, BlockDAG’s momentum is unmatched. Early buyers at the Stage 1 price of $0.001 now face the possibility of 76,815% ROI, making it the standout among top crypto coins right now. Why 2025 Could Be Pivotal for BONK? BONK (BONK) is drawing attention again as investors wonder whether it can sustain momentum heading into 2025. Currently priced at $0.00002157, BONK has slipped slightly in the past 24 hours but still shows gains over the past week. Analysts note that the coin is testing support near $0.000021, with a risk of sliding toward $0.000018 if selling pressure intensifies. Trading volume remains strong, showing that BONK continues to attract interest despite price weakness. This active engagement has fueled speculation that the coin could rebound if buyers step back in. Forecasts suggest that a return of bullish sentiment could push BONK toward the $0.00003–$0.00005 range in 2025. BONK is a token to watch, whether for a rebound story or a cautionary tale of meme coin fragility. Four Key Moves Set to Ignite Stellar (XLM) Growth Stellar (XLM) may be carving a path toward a brighter future, thanks to several meaningful developments that could fuel its next price rise. First up, the U.S. Department of Commerce is posting GDP figures on the Stellar blockchain, marking one of the most notable uses of public-sector data storage. This move adds credibility to the space and boosts confidence in XLM’s utility. Second, Telegram now lets users send and receive XLM directly within chats, giving it mainstream exposure among the platform’s 100 million users. Third, the NEAR Intents integration allows seamless transfers to Stellar from over ten other chains; no complex bridges needed. Finally, Stellar’s inclusion in the UNDP’s Blockchain Accelerator ties it to real-world applications like climate finance and healthcare. For anyone watching the top crypto tokens to buy, Stellar could be entering a pivotal growth phase. BlockDAG’s Community as Infrastructure: Why 325,000 Members Guarantee a Global Breakout When most crypto projects discuss community, they typically refer to followers or casual supporters. BlockDAG is different. With 312,000 holders and more than 325,000 active community members, this base is not passive; it is functioning as the project’s real infrastructure. This density of wallets creates built-in liquidity that few presales can claim, meaning that once BlockDAG lists, trading activity is guaranteed to be strong from day one. Communities of this scale do not fade, they compound. Each new holder adds to a network effect that amplifies visibility, strengthens trust, and turns BDAG into a global brand before its official debut. For perspective, most presales struggle to secure even 20,000 wallets, yet BlockDAG has crossed that milestone fifteen times over. The results are already clear. With over $400 million raised, 19,000 miners shipped, and 3 million mobile miners engaged, BlockDAG is executing on adoption while fueling one of the largest grassroots movements in crypto. Early buyers at the Stage 1 price of $0.001 are already sitting on significant returns, while those entering at the Deployment Event special price of $0.0013 now eye the possibility of 76,815% gains if BDAG hits $1. For investors, the message is simple: BlockDAG’s community is the foundation of its inevitability. BlockDAG Leads as the Only Clear Choice The contrast is striking. BONK price prediction suggests short-term volatility, where any rebound will depend on shifting sentiment in the meme coin space. The Stellar (XLM) price outlook benefits from adoption drivers, yet its growth remains gradual. Against this backdrop, BlockDAG is executing in real time. With 19,000 miners shipped, 325,000 active community members, and liquidity guaranteed by 312,000 holders, BlockDAG is already building the ecosystem others promise. Investors who entered at the Stage 1 price of $0.001 are securing exponential gains, while new buyers at $0.0013 still eye transformative upside. With the potential to reach $1, offering 76,815% ROI, BlockDAG stands apart. For those searching the market for top crypto coins right now, the choice is clear: BONK speculates, Stellar builds slowly, but BlockDAG is rewriting growth history.

As with all previous retracements after a new ATH, this recent correction has sparked much speculation on the market peak price. The Bitcoin Decay Channel, a market prediction model, has provided insights into the potential market top price zones for the present cycle. Related Reading: Safe Haven Split: Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Turns Negative For First Time In 6 Months Bitcoin Decay Channel Hints At $200K–$290K Top, Tips Cycle To Extend To 2026 In an X post on September 5, a Bitcoin researcher with the X username Sminston With shares some important data from the Bitcoin Decay Channel on a potential peak price for the current market cycle. For context, the Bitcoin Decay Channel is a long-term logarithmic regression model that attempts to map Bitcoin’s price cycles, specifically its historical peaks and bottoms, within statistically derived boundaries. This pricing model shows that while Bitcoin follows boom-and-bust patterns, its growth rate decays over time as each cycle delivers smaller percentage gains than the last. Notably, data from the Bitcoin Decay channel chart shows the premier cryptocurrency is steadily climbing within the 0.05 quantile support and upper bound resistance lines, with oscillations that mark historical overheated zones. The embedded oscillator suggests BTC is not yet at a euphoric peak, leaving room for further upside before a long-term top forms. Based on more data, Sminston With explains that the present Bitcoin market cycle could see a price top between late 2025 and late 2026. If Bitcoin peaks in December 2025, the price range would sit between $205,000 and $230,000. However, should the cycle extend into 2026, projections rise incrementally, i.e. $208,000-$235,000 by Jan 2026, $219,000–$250,000 by April 2026, $230,000-$265,000 by July 2026, $243,000-$282,000 by October 2026, and as high as $250,000–$292,000 by year-end 2026. Regardless of which price top scenario, the Bitcoin Decay Channel presents a potential peak zone between $205,000 and $292,000 within the next 12-15 months. This presents a possible price gain of 86% in the base case and 167% in a bull case scenario.

At the same time, meme coin watchers are buzzing about Layer Brett , an Ethereum Layer 2 project some believe could deliver the kind of explosive upside that Solana can’t. Solana (SOL): Solana price holds steady but resistance looms The Solana price is stuck in a tight dance that’s making traders restless. Hovering just above $200, Solana has shown plenty of resilience, but every time it tries to push past $210 or $215, the rally loses steam. Bulls point to the familiar playbook—if that resistance cracks, targets of $250 and even $300 are back on the table. Bears argue the opposite: this could be the ceiling, and a drop back under $200 isn’t just possible, it’s likely. It’s not that Solana lacks fundamentals. Institutional money has been flowing in, DeFi activity is up, and developers have finally shaken off the chain’s old reputation for outages. The Alpenglow upgrade has made a difference, keeping the network stable while volumes climb. But markets don’t trade on fundamentals alone, and momentum is proving slippery. Whales are booking profits, retail buyers aren’t piling in like they used to, and sentiment is more cautious than euphoric. That puts Solana in a strange middle ground. On paper, it’s one of the strongest altcoins out there—fast, cheap, and with genuine adoption. In practice, the Solana price feels capped by its size and maturity. Traders chasing explosive multiples are beginning to look elsewhere. If Solana smashes through resistance, the upside is solid. But if it keeps stalling, those who want 10x or 20x gains in 2025 might decide that other, riskier corners of the market offer a better shot at fireworks. Layer Brett (LBRETT): Meme energy with 8,000% upside on the table While the Solana price hangs around $205 and traders argue about resistance levels, Layer Brett is attracting a different kind of conversation—one centred on raw upside. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, Layer Brett combines meme culture with serious tech: near-instant transactions, gas fees that cost pennies, and staking rewards already clocking in at hundreds of percent APY for early adopters. That’s why analysts are tossing out wild numbers like an 8,000% run if the presale hype translates into sustained momentum. The appeal is obvious. For the cost of a single Solana token, traders can scoop up tens of thousands of Layer Brett, stake them instantly, and start earning real-time rewards. Add NFT tie-ins, gamified staking mechanics, and a community that thrives on meme energy, and you’ve got a cocktail that looks built for viral traction. It’s the exact kind of story crypto Twitter loves to amplify. The difference is that Layer Brett isn’t just a meme with a face; it’s an ecosystem with functionality. By anchoring to Ethereum but running activity off-chain, it offers the speed and scalability Solana is known for, while staying plugged into the most secure network in crypto. That’s why some traders are calling Layer Brett the “best of both worlds”—Layer 2 efficiency wrapped in meme-coin chaos. If 2025 really does deliver the next big rally, Layer Brett is positioned as the high-risk, high-reward play that could leave more established names like Solana looking tame by comparison. Conclusion The Solana price may still grind higher if resistance breaks, but its days of jaw-dropping multiples seem behind it. In contrast, Layer Brett is trading at a fraction of a cent, with meme-driven energy and Layer 2 utility fuelling predictions of 8,000% gains. If 2025 does bring another crypto supercycle, Solana will likely remain a steady player—but the real fireworks could come from the meme coin built to move faster.

The Oracle of Omaha told CNBC he’s “disappointed” the company is breaking itself into two pieces, a reversal of the 2015 merger he personally backed, which has now turned into one of the worst investment moves of his career. The news came out during a private phone call with “Squawk Box” co-host Becky Quick on Tuesday. Warren also said he’s angry that shareholders like Berkshire Hathaway weren’t given the right to vote on the decision. Right now, the company owns 27.5% of Kraft Heinz, a stake now worth $8.9 billion, making Warren the food company’s biggest shareholder. He confirmed that Berkshire’s next CEO, Greg Abel, already told Kraft Heinz executives they didn’t agree with the split, even before the company finalized the decision. Warren questions the cost and value of the split Warren told Becky Quick he’s against the plan, especially the $300 million in overhead costs that will be needed to break Kraft Heinz into two new entities over the next year. “It certainly didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together,” he said . “But I don’t think taking it apart will fix it.” The market didn’t like the news either. Shares of Kraft Heinz dropped by as much as 7.6% on Tuesday before recovering slightly. The stock ended the short trading week down 2.4% overall. That’s just the latest hit in a long stretch of pain for Kraft Heinz investors. Since the 2015 merger between Kraft and Heinz, the stock has lost 69% of its value. The original deal was a joint move between Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil-based 3G Capital, which teamed up in 2013 to buy H.J. Heinz for $23.3 billion. When the Kraft merger happened two years later, Berkshire walked away with over 325 million shares in the combined company, worth about $24 billion when the deal closed in July 2015. By 2016, that stake had climbed to $30 billion. But it collapsed over the next few years. Since 2020, the value of the stake has been stuck near $10 billion. Warren told shareholders in his 2015 letter that Berkshire spent $9.8 billion on the shares. With today’s valuation sitting below that, the company is sitting on a $1.0 billion paper loss. It’s not the first time Warren has been forced to face that. Berkshire already wrote down $3.0 billion of the investment in 2019, and just this past quarter, it wrote off another $3.8 billion to reflect current market value. Resignations, rumors, and legal implications add pressure In May, two Berkshire Hathaway board members resigned from Kraft Heinz after the company said it was reviewing options to boost shareholder value. That triggered speculation that Warren was planning to sell. Warren hasn’t said whether Berkshire will start selling its shares. But he hasn’t ruled it out either. He said, “We will proceed to do whatever we think is in the best interest of Berkshire.” He also added that if a buyer tries to take a big chunk of their stake, Berkshire won’t accept it unless the same offer is made to all other shareholders. The only exception would be a full buyout of Kraft Heinz. If Warren begins offloading shares, it could shake things up fast. Berkshire owns over 10% of the company, which means any open market sale must be reported within two business days. That could cause other investors to panic and follow suit, making things worse for Kraft Heinz. Warren is not alone in criticizing the split. The Financial Times reported that the company has failed to keep up with what consumers want. The paper wrote that the split isn’t bold or smart, it’s just a way to cover up years of poor results caused by endless cost-cutting and a lack of innovation. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway’s other holdings look more stable. As of June 30, the company’s 13F filing showed major investments in public companies across the U.S., Japan, and Hong Kong. Two of those (Itochu, as of March 17, and Mitsubishi, as of August 28) are listed in Tokyo, and their values are shown in U.S. dollars after converting from Japanese yen using prices from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/500-million-xrp-in-seven-days-heres-what-happened/,"On-chain trackers and market reporters have flagged a significant movement of XRP this week, after crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO revealed that nearly half a billion dollars’ worth of the token was transferred to exchanges over the past seven days. The move has sparked concerns that investors may be preparing to sell. Exchange Inflows Point to Possible Selling Pressure Blockchain scanners show that roughly 170 million XRP — valued at around $480–$500 million — was moved into exchange wallets in the span of a week. Such activity typically signals an increased likelihood of sell orders hitting the market. The highlighted data from STEPH IS CRYPTO drew sharp attention from traders, many of whom remain cautious about the implications of such large inflows. This is not the first time whale transfers have caused unease in the XRP community. Historically, heavy movements of tokens to centralized exchanges have been followed by a dip in price, as markets absorb the added supply. BREAKING: NEARLY $500M IN #XRP MOVED TO EXCHANGES OVER THE PAST 7 DAYS. DATA SHOWS INVESTORS PREPARING TO SELL. pic.twitter.com/2QdgLmAMTp — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 6, 2025 XRP Price Holds Steady Despite Whale Activity Despite the alarm, XRP’s price has remained relatively stable. As of report time, the token is trading at $2.80, holding within its recent seven-day range of $2.75 to $2.86. The stability suggests that, at least so far, markets have managed to absorb the pressure without significant downside. The muted reaction is notable, given the size of the transfers. Traders point out that while exchange inflows often precede selling, they do not always guarantee immediate liquidation, leaving room for speculation about the actual intent behind the transfers. Why the Transfers Matter Large wallet movements in the XRP ecosystem remain a key factor influencing sentiment. Previous reports of whale transactions linked to long-term holders have often been followed by short-term volatility. When tokens of such scale are directed to exchanges, the risk of a rapid downturn naturally increases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, not all inflows translate into sales. In some cases, institutional players and custodial services shuffle balances between different venues for operational reasons. This means that while the market must be cautious, the inflows do not definitively confirm a sell-off. Balancing Risks and Opportunities Some on-chain analysts have also observed continued accumulation patterns among long-term holders, which could counteract potential selling pressure. If accumulation persists while inflows slow, XRP could stabilize or even strengthen. The balance between exchange inflows, outflows, and actual executed sell orders will determine the token’s next major move. For traders, the key price levels to watch remain in the $2.70–$2.80 range, where support has so far held firm. If sustained selling pushes XRP below this zone, the downside risk increases. Conversely, if exchange balances begin to shrink, the current stability could provide a base for recovery. Final Takeaway The spotlight from STEPH IS CRYPTO has underscored a pivotal development: nearly $500 million in XRP shifted onto exchanges in just seven days. While the numbers are undeniable, their impact is not yet fully realized. Whether these tokens will be sold or simply repositioned remains the pressing question — one that traders will be watching closely in the days ahead.

51297742,1d750f9c-0bed-4148-b137-c0aa5984937d,1757178820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/51297742.jpeg,Bitcoin Stays Below $112K After Tough Jobs Report and Fed Cut Bets. What Next?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/06/bitcoin-doesn-t-cheer-fed-cut-bets-what-next,"Bad news has just been bad news over the past 24 hours. Friday’s weak U.S. jobs report bolstered bets on deeper Fed cuts, but bitcoin (BTC) hasn’t played along. The leading cryptocurrency by market value remains heavy below $112,000, instead of rallying on the prospect of easier monetary policy as many had anticipated. The inability to find upside suggests potential for a deeper sell-off ahead. NFP shock Job seekers had a tough time in August as the nonfarm payrolls revealed just 22,000 job additions, significantly less than the Dow Jones' projection of 75,000. The report also revised lower the combined job creation over June and July by 21,000. Notably, the revised June figure showed a net loss of 13,000. Nine sectors, including manufacturing, construction, wholesale trade, and professional services, registered job losses, while health services and leisure and hospitality were bright spots. The Kobeissi Letter called the jobs report ""absolutely insane."" The newsletter service described the downward revisions in prior months as a sign of a broken system and the labour market entering recession territory. Following the jobs data, the probability of a Fed rate cut at the Sept. 17 meeting surged to 100%, and the odds of a 50-basis-point cut jumped to 12%. The likelihood of additional rate cuts in November and December also increased, sending Treasury yields lower. The upcoming revisions to earlier jobs reports are expected to add fuel to the rate cut bets. ""The BLS will announce annual benchmark revisions on Tuesday, and they are expected to point to even weaker job growth earlier. Some surveys suggest between 500k and 1 mln jobs could be revised away,"" Bannockburn Global Forex's Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist, Marc Chandler said in a market update. BTC's double top is intact; volatility in Treasury yields may rise Bitcoin briefly rallied on hopes of a Fed rate cut and softer yields, reaching a high of over $113,300. But the bounce quickly faded, with prices slipping back under $111,982 — the double‑top neckline. Failing to retake that level underscored the late August double top breakdown and validates the bearish setup, keeping downside risks in focus. Prices crossing below the Ichimoku cloud further validates the bearish outlook, as Brent Donnelly, president of Spectra Markets, noted in a market update. The first line of support is located around $101,700, which corresponds to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). The latest double top breakdown in bitcoin closely mirrors the one from February this year, which led to a significant multi-week sell-off that pushed prices down to around $75,000. The double top is a bearish reversal chart formation that occurs after an asset has experienced an uptrend. It forms when the price reaches a high point (the first peak), then pulls back to a support level called the neckline. The price then rises again but fails to surpass the first peak, creating a second peak at roughly the same level. The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the neckline, signaling that the previous uptrend has lost momentum and a downtrend may follow. Treasury yields may turn volatile The bearish technical outlook, presented by the latest double top breakdown, is reinforced by the possibility of a pickup in volatility in Treasury yields, which often leads to financial tightening. The volatility could pick up in the coming days, as the impending Fed rate cuts could initially send the 10-year yield lower in a positive development for BTC and risk assets. That said, the downside looks limited and could be quickly reversed, much like what happened in late 2024. Last year, from September through December, the 10-year yield actually rose, even as the Fed began cutting rates, reversing earlier declines that had occurred in the lead-up to September. The 10-year yield bottomed out at 3.6% in mid-September 2024 and then rose to 4.80% by mid-January. While the labour market today appears significantly weaker than last year, inflation is relatively higher, and fiscal spending continues unabated, both of which mean that the yield could surge following the September rate cut. ""Why the 10yr yield rose from September through December 2024 is open to interpretation, but there was an underpinning of macro resilience, sticky-ish inflation and lots of talk on fiscal largesse as a medium-term risk. This time around, granted, worries on the economy are more intense. But offsetting this are ongoing fiscal concerns, and quite a different inflation dynamic,"" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. August CPI data due next week When the Fed cut rates last September, the U.S. consumer price index was well below 3%. Since then, it has edged back up to 3%. More importantly, the August CPI data, due next week, is likely to provide further evidence of inflation stickiness. According to Wells Fargo , the core CPI is likely to have risen by 0.3%, keeping the year-over-year rate at 3.1%. Meanwhile, the headline CPI is forecast to have risen 0.3% month-over-month and 2.9% year-over-year.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|market analysis|Bonds|Technical Analysis|Fed|Inflation|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-06 17:13:40

While investors look for the next big high-upside wager ahead of 2025’s anticipated bull cycle, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) have remained big names to watch. One is a veteran behemoth with an enormous infrastructure and population, and the other is a rapidly developing presale token gaining traction through its technological foundations and hyper-growth potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Stalwart with Structural Challenges Shiba Inu remains one of the best-known meme coin names. At around $0.000013, SHIB has enjoyed steady traction with analysts anticipating humble increases through late 2025. Forecasts suggest SHIB could hit the $0.0000165–$0.00002 mark in the fourth quarter of the year, with more upbeat predictions aiming for $0.00005–$0.0000666. While acceptable, these figures are still way below the multiples traders seek during a speculative meme bull run. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem has expanded with major projects like Shibarium, its Layer-2 scaling solution, ShibOS, and decentralized exchange ShibaSwap. All of these are aimed at increasing SHIB’s utility base. However, adoption is unfolding at a measured pace, leaving questions around how quickly these innovations will translate into sustained price appreciation. One of SHIB’s biggest structural hurdles remains its massive token supply and large market capitalization. These factors make achieving exponential returns, such as a 50× profit, far more challenging. While SHIB’s community and branding are undeniable strengths, the reality is that outsized gains are more likely for smaller, emerging tokens with capped supplies and more aggressive growth models. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Tech-Driven Meme Coin on the Rise In contrast to SHIB’s maturity, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is an early-stage contender making waves in 2025. Having only completed Presale Stage 11 at $0.0020 and moving on to Stage 12 at $0.0021, the project is already well over $24 million, selling more than 14.986 billion tokens. This rate shows vigorous investor demand and sets the stage for resplendent returns once the token begins trading on a public exchange. Presale investors at the current $0.0021 entry are guaranteed a 42.9% ROI upon launch at $0.003, a built-in advantage rarely offered in early-stage meme tokens. This strong presale structure has quickly made LILPEPE one of the most discussed projects across crypto forums and media outlets. Infrastructure Edge Unlike most meme tokens, which lean purely on hype, Little Pepe has been designed as a dedicated Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 blockchain. This gives it a significant infrastructure advantage: ultra-fast transactions, near-zero fees, anti-sniper bot protections, staking rewards, and a launchpad for new meme projects. By embedding these utilities from inception, LILPEPE positions itself as more than just another speculative meme; it’s building an entire ecosystem. Audits and Credibility Credibility has been bolstered through audits. LILPEPE scored 95.5/100 in a CertiK audit, alongside a positive review from Freshcoins, with no critical risks identified. Added features like a capped supply, no mint function, and zero transaction taxes reinforce investor trust in the project’s transparency. Hype and Visibility Momentum is not just financial. According to multiple reports, LILPEPE has outpaced SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE in ChatGPT-related search volumes between June and August 2025. Social buzz is a powerful driver in meme coin performance, and LILPEPE’s rise in online visibility has translated into presale strength. Marketing campaigns, including a $777,000 giveaway with ten winners receiving $77,000 tokens, have amplified attention and brought in new investors at scale. Final Verdict Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers a more compelling case for those chasing outsized returns. With presale momentum, infrastructure innovation, capped supply, and rapidly growing hype, it aligns with the speculative profile that has historically generated 50× or greater profits in meme coin cycles. If this trajectory holds, LILPEPE could rival SHIB’s past success and potentially surpass it, carving out a spot among the most influential meme assets of the next bull run. For traders ready to position early, the window to secure exposure before broader market adoption may close quickly.

Trump's shortlist includes White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett, former Fed member Kevin Warsh and current Fed member Christopher Waller. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he was considering Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent but that he wasn't interested in the job. Bessent, who was in the Oval Office, confirmed his lack of interest. Trump said, “I initially had four candidates, but now I'm talking to three. He (Bessent) told me, 'I'm not going.'” President Trump frequently criticizes Powell for acting “too late” to cut interest rates and blames the Fed for high mortgage rates. Under Powell's leadership, the Fed has held interest rates steady this year, citing concerns that Trump's tariffs could spark renewed inflation. However, Powell's recent focus has been on the weakening labor market. According to data from the US Department of Labor, job growth slowed sharply in August, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, a nearly four-year high. Powell also said last month that downside risks in the labor market could prompt a rate cut. While analysts interpreted these remarks as a signal of a quarter-point cut in September, Trump wants much more aggressive cuts. Related News: Giant Whale Suffers Millions in Losses on This Altcoin After a Major Short Position Among the candidates, Hassett is known as a staunch defender of Trump's trade policies and shares his view that the Fed keeps interest rates unnecessarily high. Warsh has frequently called for “regime change” at the Fed. Waller, appointed by Trump in 2020 after leading the St. Louis Fed Research Department, stands out as a more committed figure to the institution. Bessent, on the other hand, harshly criticized the FED, arguing that the institution needed a comprehensive review, from its staff and research activities to its monetary policy approach. *This is not investment advice.

The upward trend exhibited by SUI that shows 3.64% growth over the last 24 hours is a tribute to increasing confidence of the market in its capacity to scale well. Its attention to real-time data processing makes the project an excellent candidate to be adopted in fields such as gaming, DeFi, and NFTs. Although there was a small drop in volume, the general optimistic tone of SUI places it as a major player in 2025, particularly as additional tokens are unlocked into the market, which will potentially continue to drive its growth. Chainlink (LINK) LINK price has risen by 2.94% to hit an all-time high of $23.66 as the demand for the decentralized data oracles continues to rise. Chainlink has shown an outstanding performance by attaining a market cap of 16.04 billion with a total of 678 million LINK tokens in circulation. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin (BTC) continues to be the most popular and valuable asset on the crypto market. With a market value of 2.22 trillion and a supply of only 19.91 million BTC, Bitcoin is quickly nearing the 21 million cap. Over the past day, Bitcoin was moving in the positive direction, gaining a level of 1.24% and closing at a price of $111,879. This further expansion, and its growing institutional adoption, is an omen of Bitcoin as a permanent store of value. Bitcoin may not have the same explosive growth potential as some of the altcoins, but being the oldest of the cryptocurrencies, it has a high probability of continued growth to 2025 and beyond. Solana (SOL): Lightning Fast, Scalable and Inexpensive The Solana (SOL) blockchain is creating ripples because of its tremendous scalability and low transaction fees. Solana, with the market value of 113.16 billion and the price growth of 1.94 during the past 24 hours, is gradually becoming one of the most efficient blockchain platforms on the market. The capacity to execute thousands of transactions per second at low charges allows Solana to serve a broad variety of decentralized applications, such as NFTs and DeFi. However, even though there was a slight decrease in the volume of trade, the continued growth of Solana is a testimony of its value proposition. With the rapid influx of developers into Solana because of its scalability and friendly user experience, the project is poised to maintain its upward trend in 2025. Final Thoughts These five cryptocurrencies are outstanding not only in terms of their performance at the moment but also in terms of their potential in the future. Since Ozak AI was the first to introduce predictive AI, to the next level of blockchain design proposed by Sui, the DeFi dominance of Chainlink, the institutionalization of Bitcoin, or the scalability of Solana, all these projects are in the position to become the first to establish themselves as the new frontier of the developing blockchain technology.

Chainlink's (LINK) Rise in the Decentralized World Chainlink has seen a notable increase in its market value, up by 2.94%, reaching a new high of $23.66. This growth is a testament to the escalating demand for its decentralized oracle services, which play a crucial role in the broader blockchain ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC): The Pioneer's Progress The venerable Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market. With a staggering market valuation of 2.22 trillion and a limited supply approaching its cap, Bitcoin's daily trading activities and institutional adoption hint at its enduring value and appeal. Solana (SOL): Built for the Future Solana stands out with its exceptional ability to handle thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost. Despite minor fluctuations in trading volume, Solana's consistent performance and developer-friendly platform are set to maintain its growth trajectory through 2025.

While Ripple (XRP) is slowly rising through legal issues and growing adoption, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making its mark with a new DeFi lending system and a plan that helps the project grow quickly. Mutuum Finance has already launched the sixth stage of its presale, with each token selling for $0.035. The price will go up by 14.29% in stage 7 to reach $0.04. So far, the project has raised over $15.45 million and has over 16,100 participants. Because of its new and different approach, MUTM has the chance to become very valuable quickly, possibly making someone a millionaire overnight. XRP Stands Ground In the Face of Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Interest XRP is trading at around $2.81 at the time, and the intraday range is $2.78 to $2.86. The price action of XRP has been influenced in recent times due to the settlement of its protracted legal proceedings: the SEC lawsuit against Ripple has been officially terminated, with Ripple obliged to pay a fine of 125 million dollars and an injunction imposed on institutional sales. Markets are responding in a very composed manner, with traders closely looking at XRP sticking around key support levels at around $2.77 to $2.80, whereas resistance is at around $2.95 to $3.00 which could determine its short-term future. At the same time, fresh entrants such as Mutuum are starting to draw their own attention. Dual-layer DeFi Lending Protocol The project prides itself as the hybrid lending project, a blend of the Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer. P2C is easier to use when users prefer to be less involved, as it is driven by smart contracts. P2P on the other hand features communication between lenders and borrowers and no intermediaries. MUTM is also much more flexible, not to mention efficient, due to the unique dual-layer construction, which enables one to use high-risk assets like meme coins. Mutuum Presale Momentum Finance MUTM token sale round 6 testifies to the power of the project because it has already surpassed the mark of $15.45M. The project will feature a full ecosystem including a stablecoin. It will be developed on Ethereum blockchain to be safe and secure in the long term. The platform has a CertiK trust rating of 95.0 that can be considered a decent measure of the project commitment to transparency and security. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program In order to create an impression of confidence in the security protocols of the platform, Mutuum Finance has launched a Bug Bounty Program of up to USDT $50,000. The program quantifies the program outcomes as critical, major, minor or low severity to support sufficient risk mitigation. The Way to a Sustainable Economy Project tokenomics will fulfill long-term value creation, market health, and liquidity protection needs and reduce inflation risks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may be a developing quicker wealth-generating venture than Ripple (XRP). The presale has garnered 16,100+ small and medium-sized investors and has raised $15.45M. MUTM is a combination of speed, security, and scalability with two P2C and P2P lending protocols, USD-pegged stablecoin, 95.0 CertiK trust score, and a $50K bug bounty. As XRP trades around $2.81 and waits on additional market catalysts, Mutuum Finance has better short-term upside and millionaire-making potential. Take advantage of Stage 6 before the price goes up.

By 2028, HNT is expected to reach a new high of $11.49, driven by increased adoption of its decentralized network and IoT (Internet of Things) applications. Helium’s price could surpass the $26 mark, potentially reaching $26.31 or higher by 2031, as the ecosystem continues to expand and gain mainstream traction. Helium (HNT) stands out in the cryptocurrency space for its innovative approach to decentralized wireless networks, enabling a global, community-driven infrastructure for IoT devices. This makes it a popular choice for tech enthusiasts and businesses seeking cost-effective, scalable connectivity solutions. The Helium ecosystem continues to evolve, marked by significant milestones such as the expansion of its 5G network, partnerships with major telecom providers, and growing adoption across industries, which underscore its real-world utility. As Helium continues to progress, many wonder about its future price trajectory. Will its unique features and expanding use cases drive substantial value growth? Can it sustain its competitive edge in the ever-evolving crypto market? Will HNT recapture its all-time high (ATH) at $54.32? Overview Cryptocurrency Helium Token HNT Price $2.31 Market Cap $437 M Trading Volume 24-h $13 M Circulating Supply 186,010,358.23 HNT All-time High $517.62 Nov 13, 2021 All-time Low $0.213, Jun 10, 2020 24-h High $2.46 24-h Low $2.29 Helium price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bearish 50-Day SMA $2.92 200-Day SMA $3.13 Price Prediction $4.92 (112.34%) F & G Index 27.57 (fear) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 14-Day RSI 30.08 Helium price analysis: HNT falls to $2.30 TL;DR Breakdown: Helium price analysis shows fall towards 2.30 Resistance for HNT is at $2.40 Support for HNT/USD is at $2.30 The price analysis of Helium for September 6 shows that HNT has fallen to the $2.30 mark as bearish pressure continues to rise for the price.

As the price oscillates at the $2.30 – $2.40 level, HNT can be expected to continue consolidating at the current level for next week. However, if the price fails to defend the $2.30 support the price can be expected to fall towards the $2.00 mark. Is Helium a good investment? Helium distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market by focusing on decentralized wireless networks, enabling a global infrastructure for IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It aims to revolutionize connectivity by providing cost-effective, scalable solutions for businesses and individuals. Helium’s innovative technology and real-world utility make it an attractive option for those interested in the future of decentralized networks and IoT applications. With a focus on expanding its 5G network and forming partnerships with major telecom providers, Helium is well-positioned to drive significant growth in the decentralized connectivity ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional telecom industries and capture market share in the IoT space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in cutting-edge technological solutions. Why is HNT down? Helium observed a steady decline as the bears aimed to move below the $2.30 price level, but the bulls fought to defend the level. The recent recovery surged the HNT price toward $2.40 resistance line before falling back below $2.35 where it trades at the moment. Will HNT reach $10? Based on current forecasts, Helium is expected to experience steady growth, potentially reaching the $10 mark before the end of 2028. This projection depends on continued adoption of its decentralized network and advancements in IoT and 5G technologies. Will HNT reach $20? Helium is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 as the industry continues to see increasing adoption of decentralized wireless solutions. The bullish rally will be supported by Helium’s vision of a scalable, decentralized future and its user-friendly architecture, which sets it apart from other blockchain projects. Does HNT have a good long-term future? Yes, Helium (HNT) has a strong long-term future, with a unique market position and promising potential ROI due to its innovative decentralized wireless network model. Helium’s ability to provide low-cost, efficient connectivity for IoT devices, combined with its expanding ecosystem and global adoption, strengthens its outlook. The project’s growing community, technological advancements, and strategic partnerships further support Helium’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years. Will HNT reach $50? The chance of Helium reaching the $50 mark depends on various factors, including future network development, regulatory changes, and broader cryptocurrency market trends. If Helium continues its current trajectory of innovation and adoption, it could potentially reach $50 within the next decade. However, this outcome remains speculative and contingent on sustained growth and technological advancements. Recent News Dane County Regional Airport (MSN) was able to enhance the airport’s connectivity by using Helium’s Mobile Hotspots providing seamless coverage to travelers across the airport. It also enhances the business capabilities of the airport as data offloaded to the Helium network brings real rewards and potential to earn revenue.

Helium Historic Price Sentiment HNT Price History In 2021, the Helium Network secured $111 million through a token sale prominently led by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Following this achievement, Helium Network further advanced its financial standing in February by raising $200 million in a Series D funding round. This substantial investment valued the project at $1.2 billion and featured prominent backers such as Tiger Global and FTX Ventures. Helium Network transitioned from its proprietary blockchain to the Solana blockchain in September 2022 to enhance its technological infrastructure. In the 2021 bull run, HNT rose from $1.4 to its all-time high of $55.22 on November 12, 2021. HNT corrected to $26.03 in December before rising to $41 in January 2022. In the 2022 crypto winter, HNT started losing value and has not significantly recovered. By December 2022, HNT had dropped to as low as $1.18. At press time, HNT was down 92.66% from its all-time high. In 2023, the coin was bullish in the first and last quarter of the year. In December alone, it managed over 2X gains from the previous month. Across 2023, Helium’s price experienced significant fluctuations. The highest price recorded was $9.74 (on February 17, 2024), while the lowest dipped to $3.16 (on July 16, 2024). In January 2024, Helium remained relatively stable, trading around the $6.92–$8.96 range as market momentum stayed subdued. However, this stability was short-lived, as February saw a sharp decline to $8.90 (on February 22, 2024), marking one of the lowest points of the month. Despite this, Helium demonstrated resilience, recovering quickly to stabilize near the $9.00 mark by the end of the month. In March and April 2024, HNT experienced a steady decline from $9.07 (on March 1, 2024) to $5.64 (on April 1, 2024), where it found key support. This period was characterized by cautious trading and low volatility. In May 2024, Helium observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $5.04 (on May 1, 2024), gradually approaching resistance at $5.54 (on May 5, 2024). This upward trend was driven by renewed investor interest and broader market optimism. In June 2024, Helium traded within the $5.64–$6.11 range, with neither bulls nor bears managing to secure a decisive breakout. In July, the cryptocurrency hovered around the $7.59 mark, with price volatility remaining relatively low. HNT opened trading in August at $7.65 and ended the month at $8.70 , making notable gains. September turned bearish for Helium, as the price declined below the $7.80 mark by the end of the month. In October, Helium faced a steep crash but began a swift recovery shortly thereafter. In December, Helium made remarkable strides as the asset’s price briefly broke past the $9.00 mark, albeit closing the month just below that level. In January 2025, Helium saw a bullish start to the year, with the price rising from below the $4.21 mark to $4.27 by the end of the month. In February, however, the price trended downward toward the $3.19 mark as bears began to dominate the markets. A trend that continued through June as the price fell to $2.19. In July, the trend reversed as the price rose as high as $4.00 but could not maintain the heights as bears struck again. The market still faces the pressure of that bearish market as by early September the price has dwindled to $2.36.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|HNT|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-06 17:33:48

Trade disclosures show the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) collectively picked up 387,000 shares of BitMine and 144,000 shares of Bullish, worth over $23.5 million at Friday’s close.

Each is navigating crucial technical levels that could either set the stage for a rally or signal deeper retracements. Investors are closely watching whether Bitcoin’s stability provides a foundation for broader market strength or if altcoins will continue to lag behind. Much like Outset PR’s approach of blending timing with precision, this moment highlights how market positioning can make the difference between resilience and struggle. Bitcoin Eyes Possible Growth Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Bitcoin currently hovers between $105,942 and $112,110. The coin shows a modest weekly price increase of just over zero percent, down slightly over the past month. Looking ahead, Bitcoin could push toward $115,949, its nearest resistance level. If momentum builds, it might even touch $122,117, marking an impressive near 15% potential surge from its lower current price point. However, it's worth keeping an eye on $103,614 and $97,446, the nearest and secondary support levels, respectively, signaling where the price might settle in a downturn. Despite small recent gains, Bitcoin has shown a robust 31% increase over six months, hinting at potential growth if market trends remain favorable. Cardano (ADA) Shows Signs of Potential Upswing in Price Source: tradingview Cardano's price is currently between around 77 to 89 cents. It's recently seen a healthy one-month price rise of over 16%. With a relative strength index nearing 69, the coin is showing potential for further gains. If Cardano overcomes its immediate resistance at 97 cents, it could climb to a second resistance around $1.10, marking a potential rise of about 30% from its low end. The current moving averages also align closely, indicating stability. However, if it dips, there's support at 73 cents and further at 60 cents. This suggests Cardano is positioned for possible growth, yet is cushioned against significant drops. Outset PR Crafts Communications Like a Workshop, Powered by Data Founded by renowned crypto PR expert Mike Ermolaev , Outset PR operates like a hands-on workshop, building every campaign with market fit in mind. Instead of offering random placements or templated packages, Outset PR carefully weaves a client’s story into the market context, showcasing what organic PR looks like: Media outlets are selected based on metrics like discoverability, domain authority, conversion rates, and viral potential Pitches are tailored to fit each platform’s voice and audience Timing is mapped to let the story unfold naturally and build trust organically Outset PR occupies a unique niche as the only data-driven agency with a boutique-level approach.

Let Outset PR Tell Your Story With Verifiable Impact Solana Eyes Further Gains as It Resides Near Key Levels Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is currently priced between $184.88 and $217.32. Over the past month, it saw an impressive rise, climbing almost 27.5%. This has generated excitement among investors. The coin is slightly above its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, indicating an overall upward trend. There's potential for further growth if SOL breaks the nearest resistance at $233. If it passes this mark, it might aim for the second resistance at $266, representing a possible rise of around 22%. However, prices could dip towards the nearest support at $169 or even reach $136 if the trend reverses. Despite small recent losses, Solana shows promising prospects for the future. XRP Poised for Growth Amid Recent Price Dip Source: tradingview XRP is trading between $2.67 and $2.98 after a slight drop over the past week. It has lost about three percent in one week and nearly three percent this month. But over the last six months, it has grown by almost a quarter, showing strong potential for the future. The nearest resistance is just above $3, with the next significant barrier at about $3.50. If XRP breaks through these levels, it could see a growth of over ten percent. The coin's Relative Strength Index is under 65, suggesting it's not overbought yet. Recent trends hint that XRP might soon regain its upward momentum. Conclusion Bitcoin’s consolidation underscores the market’s cautious optimism, while ADA, SOL, and XRP reveal both vulnerabilities and opportunities in their respective setups. Each coin carries unique catalysts that could determine its next trajectory — from ADA’s structural growth to Solana’s momentum and XRP’s resilience. For investors, the key lies in recognizing the interplay between strong support levels and breakout potential. Just as Outset PR leverages data-driven insights to craft campaigns that resonate, navigating crypto markets requires clarity, timing, and a keen eye on signals that shape future moves.

BTC is consolidating within a tight range while ETH builds steady upward pressure, both hinting at moves that could define the next phase of the crypto cycle. Much like Outset PR’s ability to provide data-driven insights, recognizing these technical inflection points can be the difference between riding the wave and missing it. Bitcoin Eyes Possible Growth Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Bitcoin is trading between $105,942 and $112,110. While its weekly price increase is minimal (just above zero percent) and it has dipped slightly over the past month, the cryptocurrency has demonstrated a strong 31% gain over the last six months. Looking ahead, Bitcoin could see a push towards its nearest resistance level of $115,949. If this momentum continues, it has the potential to reach $122,117, representing an impressive nearly 15% surge from its lower current price point. However, it's important to monitor the support levels. A downturn could see the price settle at $103,614 (nearest support) or $97,446 (secondary support). Despite recent small gains, Bitcoin's robust six-month performance suggests potential for continued growth if market trends remain favorable. Ethereum Shows Promise with Stable Price Movements Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently priced between $4169 and $4710, showing steady movement. Despite a slight dip of about 1.2% this week, it's up over 23% in the last month, and an impressive 102% in half a year. The nearest hurdle for further growth is not far off at a bit over $5000. If Ethereum breaks this, it could aim for the next milestone above $5500. The RSI and stochastic indicators suggest room for more gains without being oversold. With the moving average holding steady, Ethereum could continue its climb, offering a potential for significant returns for investors.

It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. Conclusion As liquidity shifts and breakout zones take shape, Bitcoin and Ethereum are setting the stage for potential market-defining rallies.

Despite Trump’s import tariff drama, the Bureau of Labor Statistics botching job numbers, and Nvidia nosediving 8% in seven days, the S&P 500 is still up 10% year-to-date, less than 1% from an all-time high. That’s sheer stubbornness dressed as a bull. The mess started with Friday’s jobs report. Expectations were crushed. Forecasts saw 66,000 jobs coming in August. Reality brought just 22,000. That collapse dragged the three-month average payroll gain down to levels usually seen right before a recession. It looked like bear bait, and the bears snapped. But instead of a collapse, the market just rotated. Former winners fell, 2025 underdogs got a shot, and the engine kept moving. Nvidia falls, IPOs crumble, and Bitcoin bleeds Nvidia, the biggest damn stock in the market, is down 8% and has officially dipped below its 50-day moving average, despite a strong earnings quarter. Bitcoin followed, dropping 10% from its August high, breaking through its own trendline. This is happening in the worst historical month for equities. September has a track record of wrecking portfolios, and it’s living up to that rep. Then came the IPO disasters. Some of the most hyped names in tech are barely limping. Figma, Circle, CoreWeave, Chime Financial, and Bullish all got smoked. Every single one is down 40–60% from their day-one peaks. These weren’t small names either, they were the ones everyone chased on listing day. Now, they’re just wreckage. Despite the wreckage, the market isn’t dead. Friday showed it. Stocks jumped right after the jobs number hit, then sold off, then recovered again. The S&P barely slipped . The game hasn’t changed. Bad news just feeds more bets on Fed rate cuts. That jobs miss lit up bond traders. Treasury yields crashed, rate-sensitive names rallied, and traders jumped back into Broadcom, which popped after a strong earnings report. Broadcom’s run isn’t random. In the last two years, its stock has gained 283%, while Nvidia’s is up 244%. They now share the weight of AI momentum with Alphabet and Apple, while Nvidia and Microsoft get sidelined. Together, Broadcom and Nvidia control 10% of the S&P 500. So this shift matters. Fed caught between weak jobs and sticky inflation The garbage jobs report stirred doubts about economic growth. It forced analysts to change their tune. Bank of America, which had been predicting no cuts in 2025, suddenly forecasted two Fed cuts before year-end. Not just because of the jobs data, but also because Fed Chair Jerome Powell keeps focusing on labor weakness over inflation, which still feels pressure from Trump’s tariffs. That report isn’t even clean. The low numbers aren’t entirely about layoffs. Foreign-born workers are dropping off. The aging U.S. population is shrinking the labor pool. So, even small job gains now mean more than before. It may only take 50,000 new jobs a month to keep unemployment steady, way down from past assumptions. GDP growth still looks fine. Why? Capital spending, a strong services sector, wealth-driven consumption, and massive federal deficits are keeping it afloat. That’s why markets aren’t panicking. Even in the job data, some saw a silver lining: prime-age employment ticked up. Bulls took that and ran. And history says when the Fed cuts after a six-month pause, stocks usually rally hard. That’s the bet again. But the real economy could use a breather. Ned Davis Research dropped a new index, Main Street Financial Conditions, which uses real home prices, loan access, and more. It shows that real-world financial strain is way worse than what Wall Street metrics suggest. If Powell loosens up soon enough, the recent drop in mortgage rates, plus cheaper oil, might ease some of that pressure. But there’s still the question of valuation. Bulls haven’t gone wild yet. No euphoric blow-off top. Investor exposure is full, and the dip-buying habit hasn’t died. But strategists aren’t betting big either. Most year-end targets for the S&P 500 are barely above current levels. That says plenty. The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 keeps hitting resistance around 22.5, and the Nasdaq 100 P/E keeps getting rejected at 28. These numbers have stopped rallies cold more than once in this nearly three-year bull run. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

While the market is holding key support zones, momentum remains muted, and sentiment indicators like exchange reserves are pointing to long-term accumulation. By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has broken below its ascending channel but found support near the $110K region, which aligns closely with the 100-day moving average. The RSI sits around 44, showing that momentum is weak but not in oversold conditions yet. This suggests that the market is in a pause phase, waiting for either a rebound confirmation or a deeper retracement. If the buyers defend $110K successfully, the next resistance sits at $116K and then the $124K record high. However, a breakdown below $110K could extend the decline toward the $104K demand zone, which has acted as a strong base in the past. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin broke out of a steep descending channel but is now moving within a smaller rising channel. Price is currently retesting the $110K–$111K zone, which has become the key short-term pivot. The RSI is balanced around 49, reflecting market indecision and a lack of clear momentum. If this support zone holds, a push toward $114K is likely, where sellers could step in again. On the other hand, a clean drop below $109K would invalidate the short-term bullish structure and open the way for a deeper move toward the $104K demand zone previously mentioned. Onchain Analysis Exchange Reserve Exchange reserves continue to show a sharp and consistent decline, reaching multi-year lows. This indicates that more Bitcoin is moving off exchanges into cold storage, a clear sign of long-term accumulation and reduced sell-side supply. Historically, such drawdowns in reserves have supported bullish trends, even during corrective phases. The steady outflow suggests that despite short-term volatility, investor conviction remains high. With fewer coins available on exchanges, the supply shock narrative strengthens, which could support a bullish reversal once demand picks up again.

On top of this, the mining difficulty has continued to climb , making it more challenging to secure the Bitcoin network. Despite the rising price of BTC over the past year, the miners have struggled to remain profitable while securing the world’s largest blockchain. A crypto expert has shared insights into the Bitcoin mining industry over the past few months in the current cycle. Miners Could Be Forced To Shed BTC Holdings: Crypto CEO In a September 5 post on the X platform, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson discussed the Bitcoin mining landscape with insights from recent on-chain data. According to the on-chain analyst, the BTC mining sector has looked a bit unstable so far in the year 2025. Wedson attributed the Bitcoin mining industry’s struggles partly to the high price of BTC, which surged by almost 100% since the last halving event. The premier cryptocurrency is believed to be highly valued compared to what the blockchain validators earned during the peak years of 2017 and 2021. According to the Alphractal founder, the combination of rising hash rate and low on-chain volume has added to the competition for winning blocks on the BTC networks. These less-than-optimal conditions create extra pressure, forcing miners to invest in expensive modern equipment to compete. To put things into an on-chain perspective, Wedson highlighted the Mining Equilibrium Index (MEI), which measures current mining profitability against historical averages (a ratio of short-term to long-term mining revenue efficiency). This metric works by comparing the 30-day average revenue per hash to the 365-day average. The Alphractal founder shared that the MEI metric staying above 1 signals above-average mining conditions. Meanwhile, when this index falls beneath 0.5, it suggests a struggling mining industry, which could be linked to capitulation or hashrate adjustments. Wedson revealed that the Mining Equilibrium Index currently stands around 1.06, which is well above the stressed mining levels where miners can no longer sustain operations. However, the on-chain data expert noted that the current level is also beneath the highs of 2.5 seen between 2017 and 2021. With the growing competition and operational cost of securing the Bitcoin network, Wedson revealed that miners might be forced to offload some of their BTC holdings . Ultimately, this could put some downward pressure on the price of the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $110,700, reflecting no significant movement in the past day. However, the market leader seems to be making a recovery of some sort, jumping by nearly 3% in the past seven days.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Miners|bitcoin mining|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MINING|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-06 18:00:30

The looming delisting raises questions about SHIB's future and its market position. With liquidity set to shrink, the coin's value might face substantial pressure. Readers will discover other cryptocurrencies primed for potential growth amidst this turbulence. Shiba Inu Eyes New Heights Amidst Steady Market Moves Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading between $0.00001164 and $0.00001293. The coin is finding support near $0.00001108, while the resistance sits at $0.00001368. If SHIB can break through this level, it could climb towards the next resistance at $0.00001498. This would mean a potential growth of about 16% from the current high range. Over the last week, SHIB has seen a slight dip of approximately 1.7%. The coin's RSI at 62.01 suggests it's not overbought, leaving room for growth. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are closely aligned, hinting at ongoing stability in the price movement. Conclusion The removal of SHIB from a major exchange could lead to a drop in its value. Reduced liquidity may push SHIB below $0.00001. Loss of a key trading platform often affects market confidence. Investors might shift their focus to other coins. The move could signal a critical moment for SHIB’s future performance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As DOGE and PEPE reached a plateau, many people are asking whether Ozak AI ($OZ), a new AI-driven crypto project, can bring the same opportunities for massive returns. An overview of how a $500 investment in Ozak AI might possibly turn into $25,000 in the future is here, as other meme currencies such as DOGE and PEPE exhibit stagnation. Ozak AI Presale: A Unique Opportunity for Investors Ozak AI, combining AI automation with blockchain technology, is positioning itself as a groundbreaking project within the crypto space. The Phase 5 presale is currently priced at $0.01 per token, which offers a rare chance for early-stage investors to capitalize on significant growth potential. Over 847 million tokens have already been sold, raising more than $2.67 million. The presale is estimated to receive 30% of the tokens, which indicates that it is keen to develop the initial support and activity in its ecosystem. The success of the presale and the long-term growth curve offer an attractive opportunity to investors. This creates the potential for early-stage participants to see considerable returns as the token price targets $1 upon official listings. If you wish to invest $500 now, with the current price of $0.005 then it could easily translate to $50,000 when the price reaches $1. This represents a significant return in a relatively short period. Ozak AI’s Potential for ROI Growth Compared to DOGE and PEPE Whereas meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE have plateaued in their price dynamics, Ozak AI is a different offer. Although DOGE is popular with massive social media hype, it faces challenges with unlimited supply and limited use cases. Although whale movements have driven up DOGE's price to $0.24, its price potential is seen as capped by its supply dynamics. The fickle nature of social media-driven hype also limits its growth. Analysts believe that the price of DOGE will be between $0.30 and 0.45 by the end of 2025. However, potential institutional adoption could push its price closer to $1. PEPE, following the rising popularity of memes, is not an exception. Analysts fear its performance because it has low utility and worry about its price volatility. As PEPE struggles with its lack of real-world application, Ozak AI presents a more structured and sustainable investment. It is underpinned by its AI-driven analytics and blockchain-backed infrastructure. Ozak AI’s focus on predictive insights and automated trading tools makes it an appealing option for investors seeking value beyond the volatility of meme coins. Strong Partnerships and Long-Term Growth for Ozak AI Partnerships with such companies as SINT, Hive Intel , and Weblume provide great value and improve the ecosystem. These provide real-time signals, predictive analytics, and smooth AI integration, which solidifies the position of Ozak AI in the decentralized AI space. In addition, the online platform is based on DePIN technology, which guarantees a decentralized and secure environment. This provides investors with peace of mind. With a successful shift of the project to positive terms, Ozak AI has also attended events like Coinfest Asia 2025 in Bali and a global roadshow. These events will increase visibility and strengthen its community presence. These initiatives signal a robust marketing strategy that could propel Ozak AI into mainstream adoption. It could further drive up token demand and value. Conclusion: Is Ozak AI the Next Big Opportunity? With DOGE and PEPE plateauing, many investors are looking for new avenues to achieve substantial returns. With a presale price of $0.01 per token, Ozak AI presents a great idea where early investors can enjoy a well-organized and innovative cryptocurrency project. It is possible that a $500 investment can be increased to $25,000 or higher. This comes at a time when Ozak AI has a solid technological base, strategic alliances, and growth roadmap. As the presale progresses, those who act early could position themselves for significant long-term rewards.

The emerging AI-driven project, Ozak AI, is gaining attention as traditional options like DOGE and PEPE see diminishing growth rates. The Investment Potential in Ozak AI Ozak AI presents an intriguing prospect for those looking to diversify their crypto investments. Initiating its journey in the crypto world, Ozak AI is currently in the early stages of its Phase 5 presale , priced at an accessible $0.01 per token. This could be a strategic entry point for early investors aiming for high returns. Having already raised over $2.67 million and with more than 847 million tokens sold, the project is generating significant interest. This investment could potentially escalate, with a $500 stake transforming into $50,000 if the token price ascends to $1. Comparing Ozak AI with Established Meme Coins The investment scene in meme cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE has cooled, primarily due to their inflated market saturation and limited use cases. Despite DOGE's popularity, its unlimited supply and dependency on social media trends pose risks to sustainable growth. Similarly, PEPE's appeal, driven by meme culture, does not guarantee robust performance due to its inherent volatility and low utility. In contrast, Ozak AI leverages artificial intelligence to offer a more structured investment vehicle with comprehensive analytics and blockchain technology integration, setting it apart from typical meme coins. Strategic Partnerships and Market Growth Ozak AI has aligned with notable partners like Hive Intel and Weblume, enhancing its technological framework and market position. These collaborations aim to bolster Ozak AI's real-time analytics capabilities, promoting a stable and decentralized trading environment. The robust strategy and community engagement efforts, including participation in significant crypto events, are positioning Ozak AI for potential mainstream adoption, which could further drive token demand and value. Conclusion: A New Era of Investment? With the slow-paced growth of once-popular meme coins, Ozak AI offers a refreshing alternative with its innovative approach and potential for substantial financial growth. Investors could see a substantial increase in the value of an initial $500 investment, possibly reaching or exceeding $25,000.

In a recent X post, he shared a chart showing XRP’s price pushing into higher highs along a rising trendline while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been trending lower. The RSI currently sits around 54.8, signaling waning momentum despite the asset’s upward price action. Such divergences, particularly on higher timeframes like the weekly chart, often carry weight as early signals of weakening trends. Understanding the Signal Bearish divergence occurs when momentum indicators fail to confirm higher prices, suggesting that underlying buying strength is fading. In XRP’s case, the weekly RSI has formed a sequence of lower highs while price continues to test resistance. WARNING: #XRP Bearish Divergence! pic.twitter.com/XtSeH931a3 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 6, 2025 According to technical analysis principles, this scenario raises the probability of a corrective move or consolidation phase. While divergence does not guarantee an immediate reversal, it is considered a red flag for traders who may otherwise assume the uptrend remains firmly intact. XRP’s Current Market Position As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.80, giving it a market capitalization of roughly $168 billion. The token remains one of the most liquid digital assets, with multi-billion-dollar daily trading volumes across exchanges. This depth makes XRP highly sensitive to broader market flows, including investor risk appetite, institutional allocations, and regulatory news. In this context, a technical signal such as weekly divergence is amplified, as it may influence both retail sentiment and larger market participants. Key Technical Levels to Watch STEPH’s chart identifies two levels of importance. The first is the rising price trendline that has consistently acted as resistance on weekly closes. The second is the descending RSI line marking lower highs. A decisive breakout above both resistance levels would weaken the bearish divergence narrative and favor further continuation to the upside. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On the other hand, repeated failure at these levels could confirm weakening momentum and open the door for a corrective pullback toward structural supports that align with weekly moving averages. Market Flows and Risk Management Adding to caution, recent data shows significant XRP transfers to exchanges — a possible sign of selling pressure building in the background. Such flows often precede increased volatility, particularly when technical signals also point to exhaustion. For XRP holders, this underscores the importance of active risk management. Traders may consider moderating position sizes, tightening stops, or hedging exposure while waiting for a clearer breakout or breakdown confirmation. Final Take STEPH IS CRYPTO’s bearish divergence warning is not a prediction of collapse, but it is a clear reminder that momentum is weakening even as price challenges resistance. For disciplined traders and long-term holders, the signal suggests a period of vigilance. The coming weekly closes will be crucial in determining whether XRP can invalidate this setup and push higher, or whether the market is due for a corrective phase before any further advance.

Solana is riding a fresh wave of institutional interest, with some traders calling for a potential push toward $1000 by December. At the same time, Little Pepe , also known as LILPEPE, has turned its presale into one of the biggest stories of 2025, raising over $23.8 million and setting up what analysts believe could be a 5000% rally once it hits exchanges. Solana (SOL) Price and Technical Analysis Solana is trading around $208, with a 52-week high of $273.11 and a low of $106.99. It has been one of the most talked-about assets in 2025 and for good reason. The charts show a clear cup and handle pattern that technical analysts often associate with breakout runs. Analysts at CoinCentral say that if demand stays strong and the right factors line up, Solana could make a big push toward $1000 before the year ends. Market data shows consistent daily trading volume increases, reflecting growing interest from institutional players and whales. Indicators signal that momentum is building again after a healthy consolidation period. Platforms like InvestingHaven believe a realistic range for Solana would be between $350 and $400 by year's end. However, acknowledge that an extended rally fueled by ETF approval or stronger DeFi usage could push it closer to four figures. Little Pepe LILPEPE Sets the Pace While Solana builds toward a possible four-digit target, Little Pepe is already making its own waves. The meme coin is trading at $0.0021 in stage 12 of its presale and is now 95% sold out. With almost 15 billion tokens sold and a total presale cap of 15.75 billion, the community-driven project is moving faster than expected. What sets Little Pepe apart is its focus on real infrastructure. It is launching its own Layer 2 network built specifically for meme tokens. That means cheaper and faster transactions with sniper bot resistance for fairer trading when it lists. It is built on a dedicated Layer 2 chain for meme tokens. This means faster transactions, cheaper fees, and a sniper bot-resistant system that ensures a fair launch for everyone. The project has completed a full Certik audit and has already been listed on CoinMarketCap, boosting its credibility ahead of major centralized exchange listings expected later this year. At its current price, a successful rally to the projected target of $0.105 would deliver gains of up to 5000% for early backers. That potential fuels massive demand as traders look for the next big story in crypto after the historic runs of DOGE and SHIB. Why LILPEPE Could Outshine the Market Crypto is full of meme tokens, but LILPEPE proves it is not just another trend. The zero tax structure on buys and sells, combined with transparent tokenomics and strong community engagement, has made it one of the most anticipated launches of 2025. Add the ongoing $777k giveaway campaign, and the momentum is undeniable. Analysts are watching closely as the presale inches toward completion. With 19 stages in total and the final listing price expected to be around $0.0030, even investors entering now stand to see potential gains of 42% before trading officially begins. Final Thoughts Solana could climb to $350 or even $400 by December, and if the right market conditions align, the dream of a $1000 SOL is not out of reach. But it is Little Pepe that is turning heads for its combination of meme culture and utility. With a presale price of $0.0021 and a clear path to significant exchange listings, Little Pepe’s projected 5000% growth potential draws attention from retail and institutional traders. As the presale enters its final stretch, the question is not if it will sell out but how quickly it will make its mark on the market.

Here, we dissect their trajectories and market dynamics as 2025 progresses. Dynamics of Solana's Market Value As of now, Solana's trading dynamics present an intriguing study. Currently priced around $208, it remains below its annual high of $273.11 yet well above the low of $106.99. Solana's journey has been bolstered by institutional interest, with various analysts from platforms like CoinCentral suggesting a possible run-up to $1000 by year-end under optimal conditions. The Ascendance of Little Pepe In contrast, Little Pepe, currently trading at $0.0021 during its twelfth presale stage, has captured the market's imagination. The meme coin, characterized by its underlying technology supporting meme tokens, has nearly sold out its presale quota. The robust infrastructure and a Layer 2 network dedicated to meme tokens provide faster, cheaper transactions and resistance against sniper bots, which is highly valued in the crypto community. Further bolstering Little Pepe's appeal is a completed Certik audit and its listing on CoinMarketCap, predicting a potential increase in value by up to 5000%. This forecast has ignited interest comparable to past rallies seen in DOGE and SHIB, setting Little Pepe as a potential market leader. For more insights, visit Little Pepe's official site . Comparative Analysis and Future Outlook While Solana strives towards topping the four-figure mark, Little Pepe's strategic positioning in meme token infrastructure may pave the way for unprecedented growth. Those engaging with the platform can access various resources like the official whitepaper or join community discussions on Telegram and Twitter/X . Conclusion The duel between Solana's established market presence and Little Pepe's disruptive entry encapsulates the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency markets. As both entities navigate through the remainder of 2025, the landscape is set for potentially transformative shifts, reflecting the broader trends and investor sentiments within the crypto economy.

Investors are keen to know if it will hold strong or slide toward $3,800. This article delves into Ethereum's current status and possible future movements. Additionally, it explores other promising cryptocurrencies that could see growth despite the market’s current conditions. Ethereum Eyes Potential Growth Despite Recent Volatility Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is currently dancing between four thousand and a bit over four thousand seven hundred dollars. While it has seen a small dip of almost four percent in the past week, its value has grown by nearly 20% over the last month. In the past six months, it skyrocketed by more than 90%. If Ethereum manages to break through its nearest resistance at just over five thousand dollars, it could aim for the next target above five and a half thousand, a potential rise of over 18% from current levels. With its recent strong performance, Ethereum holds promise for further growth. Conclusion ETH is holding at $4,300, but market doubts persist. The price could either maintain this level or fall to $3,800. The coming days will be crucial. Traders will watch for any signals. The next moves could guide the broader crypto market.

Ripple’s courtroom wins and talk of institutional inflows keep analysts busy, but traders chasing quick upside aren’t hanging around. They’re drifting toward a meme coin built as an Ethereum Layer 2— Layer Brett —which is offering the kind of action an ETF filing never will. XRP (XRP): ETF talk dominates the headlines but trading tells another story Most of the current XRP news is built around one thing: exchange-traded funds. Analysts are buzzing that Ripple could be next in line for ETF approval, pointing to its legal clarity after years of SEC battles and its steady role in cross-border payments. For many, this is the narrative that gives XRP its staying power, with some suggesting a successful ETF could bring in fresh waves of institutional cash. But dig beneath the headlines and the picture feels less exciting. The XRP price has been pinned around familiar ranges, volume is patchy, and on-chain activity hasn’t shown the kind of acceleration you’d expect if traders were truly preparing for a breakout. Whales have trimmed exposure in recent months, and while ETF speculation makes good copy, it hasn’t translated into sustained momentum on the charts. Even loyal Ripple supporters admit the upside looks capped. It’s still one of the most liquid coins in the market, but liquidity doesn’t always equal excitement. Compared to meme-fuelled sectors where traders are chasing 10x or 50x returns, XRP’s story feels more like a steady bond than a moonshot. That’s why, while XRP news keeps circling around institutional approval and regulatory victories, actual trader flows are drifting elsewhere. The ETF may give XRP a credibility boost, but in terms of capturing speculative energy, other projects are running with the ball. Layer Brett (LBRETT): Viral momentum while XRP news circles the same theme While every headline screams XRP news and ETF speculation, the buzz on crypto Twitter is focused somewhere else entirely. Layer Brett , an Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin, is pulling the kind of attention that Ripple hasn’t seen in years. The Layer Brett pitch is simple but powerful: meme energy on the front end, serious Layer 2 tech under the hood. The difference shows up in behaviour. XRP investors might wait months or years for an ETF to be approved, but Layer Brett backers are staking tokens today and seeing daily returns. Layer Brett’s instant gratification in a space that thrives on it. Add in gamified staking, NFT tie-ins, and viral branding, and you’ve got the makings of a full-blown meme economy rather than a single-token story. Another factor is the Layer Brett price. At under a cent per token, Layer Brett gives retail traders the sense of loading up on millions of coins—something XRP simply can’t offer anymore. That psychological edge matters in meme culture. Combine that with Layer 2 scalability anchored to Ethereum, and you get utility alongside speculation, a pairing that sets it apart from typical hype coins. So while XRP news keeps investors glued to the ETF story, the market’s speculative capital is drifting. In 2025, the real story may not be about regulatory approval—it may be about the meme coin that built a real blockchain home. Conclusion ETF approval could give Ripple another round of credibility, but it won’t deliver the wild multiples speculators crave. That’s why the spotlight is shifting. XRP news may dominate headlines, yet the energy and capital are sliding into Layer Brett , a meme coin with speed, staking, and community heat. If 2025 is about big moves, it may not be Ripple making them.

The conversation isn’t just about virality or hype this time. Instead, it’s about how new entrants like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) build with scarcity and utility in mind. At the same time, established players like Cardano rely on institutional support and network stability. Cardano (ADA): Institutional Support and Supply Squeeze Cardano has held its ground in 2025. Trading near $0.87, ADA has been consolidating between $0.84 and $0.87, resisting broader market swings. Part of that stability comes from institutional flows. Data shows that around $170 million worth of ADA has been withdrawn from exchanges this year, tightening supply and lowering the risk of large sell-offs. Institutions are also quietly deepening exposure. Custody holdings of ADA rose by $73 million in 2025, pushing total managed assets close to $900 million. For a network that has long emphasized sustainability, this steady backing validates Cardano’s role as one of the safer long-term blockchain bets. On-chain metrics reinforce this picture. The network has processed more than 112 million transactions this year, with fees averaging under $0.25 — a figure that keeps Cardano competitive as a cost-effective platform for decentralized applications. Analysts are setting near-term upside targets around $1.19, while long-term forecasts stretching into the next cycle place ADA between $4.50 and $8 by 2030. Cardano’s appeal lies in consistency, but its trajectory suggests measured, incremental gains rather than the explosive surge many traders chase in altcoins. That’s where LILPEPE enters the story. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Tokenomics and Scarcity Driving Momentum Unlike ADA’s gradual climb, Little Pepe is structuring its growth around scarcity. The project caps its supply at 100 billion tokens and introduces a 12% burn rate, ensuring long-term pressure on circulating supply. Momentum from its presale tells the same story. Having already raised more than $23.8 million, LILPEPE has surged through its early stages and is now in Stage 12 at $0.0021 per token, more than double its starting price. Every stage incrementally increases the token price, rewarding early buyers with immediate upside and signaling strong community demand. Presale growth is not just about numbers. It’s also about confidence. Stages closing ahead of schedule suggest that retail investors and even whales treat LILPEPE as more than a short-term play. If it continues through exchange listings, that momentum could fuel the kind of breakout analysts are beginning to speculate on. Price Forecasts for Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Speculative models around LILPEPE vary, but they all point to significant potential. Should the market cap for the token hit $300 million, the value of the token would sit around $0.03. That would be an increase of roughly 1,300% from where it is currently. More aggressive forecasts envision a 234× increase, with price targets around $0.468. In extreme bull cases, which assume mass adoption of its Layer-2 ecosystem and continued meme market enthusiasm, some analysts propose 10,000% or more. Under those conditions, LILPEPE could reach $1.00 to $2.00, echoing historical meme runs that shocked even seasoned traders. While these outcomes remain speculative, the numbers highlight the asymmetric opportunity compared to Cardano’s steadier pace. Bottom Line The crypto market thrives on contrasts. Cardano (ADA) represents consistency: institutional backing, steady network usage, and reliable long-term projections. On the other hand, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) embodies asymmetry, limited supply, rapid presale momentum, and models that point to 17,500% gains in aggressive scenarios. ADA may continue to be a dependable backbone asset. However, LILPEPE may offer the sharper edge for those searching for outsized returns, especially if its Layer-2 ecosystem delivers on its promise. For anyone watching the next meme coin breakout, this could be the one worth circling on the 2025 radar.

Cardano (ADA), known for its solid institutional backing and consistent growth, contrasts sharply with the hype surrounding potential high-flyers like Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Cardano's Performance and Institutional Trust Even in a fluctuating market, Cardano has displayed remarkable resilience, trading near $0.87 and showing minimal volatility. The coin benefits significantly from institutional investments, with about $170 million in ADA being withdrawn from exchanges in 2025 alone. This supply squeeze, coupled with an increase in custody holdings by $73 million, underscores Cardano's appeal as a sustainable investment. Processing over 112 million transactions with fees under $0.25, Cardano positions itself as a competitive platform for decentralized applications, with price targets potentially reaching up to $8 by 2030. The Emergence and Strategy of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe , in stark contrast, has captured the market's imagination with its limited supply of 100 billion tokens and a high burn rate of 12%, promising significant reduction in future supply. The token's price has already seen a substantial increase from its initial stages, doubling in value, indicative of strong market demand and investor confidence. More details about Little Pepe can be found on its official website . Comparative Growth Predictions The speculative forecasts for Little Pepe are optimistic, with some analysts predicting a market cap increase to $300 million, which would raise its value by approximately 1,300%. More aggressive projections suggest a potential rise to $0.468 per token, representing a 234-fold increase. In scenarios of widespread adoption and continued market enthusiasm, Little Pepe could even touch the $1.00 to $2.00 mark, mirroring previous unprecedented rises in the crypto space.

Followers can also keep up with updates via Twitter/X . Conclusion: Stability vs. High Risk and Reward While Cardano continues to solidify its position as a reliable blockchain entity with steady growth, Little Pepe represents a volatile yet potentially rewarding investment, embodying the speculative spirit of the cryptocurrency market's more adventurous segment. For investors and enthusiasts keeping an eye on explosive growth opportunities, Little Pepe's innovative approach presents a noteworthy consideration for 2025.

This move is in response to proving his long-term commitment to the project after his wallet was frozen. This decision has sparked community uproar as it comes during a rising market doubts towards the new token. WLFI Freezes Sun’s Wallet, Sparks Controversy The conflict began when WLFI blocked Sun’s wallet following a $9 million transfer of WLFI tokens to his HTX exchange . The freeze covered 540 million unlocked and 2.4 billion locked tokens, worth more than $3 billion. The move surprised the crypto community because Sun had already put $75 million into WLFI’s token sale, making him one of the biggest supporters of the project. WLFI leaders gave no official reason for the freeze, but on-chain data showed Sun moving tokens to exchanges soon after WLFI was listed on Binance, which looked suspicious to some. Critics accused him of fueling WLFI’s steep decline. Justin Sun Pushes Back With $20M Commitment Sun, who is set to embark on a space journey , dismissed the allegations, calling them unreasonable. He explained that the transfers were small test deposits and dispersions, not sales that could impact the market. To show his commitment, he announced plans to market buy $10 million in WLFI tokens. He also pledged $10 million in ALTS shares, the Nasdaq-listed ticker of Alt5 Sigma, which manages WLFI’s $1.5 billion treasury strategy. In his X post, Sun tagged the Trump family directly and reiterated his long-term belief in WLFI. The crypto community remains divided on Sun’s latest move. Supporters view the $20 million pledge as proof that he believes in WLFI’s future. Critics argue it is a calculated attempt to restore his reputation after being blacklisted by the project. WLFI’s Price Struggles WLFI is still under heavy selling pressure, even after recently removing 47 million worth of tokens from circulation . The token has dropped 40% in value since launch, falling from an $8.6 billion debut to about $0.18. Many investors are now cautious and question why the project would freeze the wallet of one of its biggest backers. Experts say this kind of move is rare in decentralized finance (DeFi) and could scare off both small and big investors. WLFI first gained big attention because of its ties to U.S. President Donald Trump. One of Trump’s companies received 22.5 billion WLFI tokens, adding over $4 billion to his reported wealth. The token launch brought excitement, but that hype has now been replaced by price swings and conflicts like the one with Sun. Also, as prices tumble, early excitement has given way to hard questions about governance and sustainability. Either way, Sun’s actions highlight his determination to stay involved with WLFI despite the public fallout.

Another popular analyst also outlined XRP’s rather indecisive closure, but predicted a price surge if the same resistance is reclaimed. A rejection at $2.90 could send $XRP back to $2.70! pic.twitter.com/2EEtg34dK1 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 6, 2025 XRP made the headlines in mid-July when it finally broke its 2018 all-time high and set a new one at $3.65. However, the following month and a half has been an evident downfall as the asset has not only failed to maintain its run but has also lost the coveted $3 support line. It tried to breach it on a few occasions in the past several weeks, but to no avail. Moreover, the recent market-wide correction pushed it below $2.9, which, according to Martinez, is a vital step in returning to its bull run as reported before. Since the beginning of the month, the bulls attempted two breakouts, but both were halted in their tracks at just under $2.9. As such, Martinez believes $2.7 is the next logical step on the way south. CRYPTOWZRD also outlined XRP’s indecisiveness in the daily closure, indicating that the asset is at “its support territory.” The analyst predicted a big move north soon, but the XRP/BTC trading pair needs to garner some “bullish momentum.” They also highlighted the $2.88 resistance as crucial in XRP’s road to recovery.

XRP became the preferred digital asset for cross-border payments, and SHIB emerged as the so-called Dogecoin killer, transforming a meme into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. Yet it is not these established giants who will bear the next breakout winner, according to one crypto billionaire. In its place, it might be an emerging token that is less than half a cent in value - Little Pepe (LILPEPE) - that offers the energy of memes with the utility of the blockchain and may give Q4 returns that are exponential. Why Ripple (XRP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Might Not Be able to outperform XRP Ripple is still on a high momentum. Analysts have predicted that it could reach as high as $7.50 in December 2025, given the growing collaboration within the global financial framework and rising regulatory certainty following years of legal disputes in the United States. However, the positive side of XRP has a downside in its size. A valuation of over $178 billion, driven by substantial investments, is ultimately a challenging endeavor in a market, unlike smaller, leaner tokens. The same is the case with Shiva Inu. SHIB boasts a dedicated fan base within the Shib Army and has developed an ecosystem through various projects, including ShibaSwap, DeFi integrations, and the Shib Metaverse. The 589 trillion supply of the token, however, is its most significant drawback. Its route to dramatic price appreciation is limited compared to smaller meme coins with more streamlined structures and lower values, despite its continued burns. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Under $0.005 Rocket in Waiting The centre of the buzz is LILPEPE, which is available in presale at only $0.0021 at the moment. The one distinguishing characteristic of LILPEPE in an environment full of meme tokens is that it combines the cultural viral behavior of meme coins with actual utility by being an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. This provides it with the capability to support rapid, inexpensive, and secure transactions, resolving one of the most significant issues of the Ethereum mainnet, high gas fees and transaction delays. The appeal of the presale at LILPEPE has already proven its power. The project has already raised over $23 million, with 95% of tokens sold in Stage 12, indicating strong investor demand, despite not yet being listed on major exchanges. Credibility and security are also established. The project has undergone a CertiK audit, often touted as the gold standard of crypto smart contract validation, and implemented anti-sniper bot measures to enhance fairness in trading. The growth of LILPEPE is being projected aggressively but plausibly. According to analysts, it may rise to $0.50 over the next five years, with additional upward projections suggesting that it could reach as high as $3 if adoption and hype are aligned. That would be a 23,700% to more than 100,000% gain, based on its current presale value, which is reminiscent of SHIB's 2021 breakout run. Why LILPEPE Could Outpace XRP and SHIB in Q4 The case of the LILPEPE domination in this quarter has three pillars: accessibility, growth potential, and timing. Accessibility: LILPEPE, with its ultra-low entry price of less than $0.005, is also an appealing option for retail investors. Psychologically, tokens with a low unit price will attract investors because they can purchase millions of tokens with a relatively small amount of money, stoking the idea of higher potential. Growth Potential: LILPEPE has the potential to grow significantly faster than XRP and SHIB, which already have multi-billion-dollar valuations. Even small flows of capital can significantly shift its price, allowing it to gain an advantage in generating exponential profits. Timing: Timing Meme culture is an ongoing force in crypto cycles. Small, more speculative capital is likely to shift in as Bitcoin and Ethereum become concentrated. Q4 is historically a period of intense activity for altcoins, and LILPEPE's current presale momentum has positioned it well to capitalize on this trend. These are the reasons why a crypto billionaire has publicly forecasted LILPEPE to beat old players in the upcoming market boom. It is not intended to replace XRP or SHIB in terms of brand recognition or long-term adoption, but rather to provide the type of asymmetric returns that small-cap meme coins offer. Conclusion Both Ripple (XRP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are crypto market heavyweights with a record of stability and proven track records. But their great market fixed values and structural curbers guarantee that they are not likely to generate the type of outsized performance that had marked their earlier booms. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is taking center stage among investors seeking exponential upside in Q4 2025.

Ripple has carved out a niche in cross-border payments, while Shiba Inu has capitalized on the meme culture to build a robust ecosystem. Despite their strengths, the spotlight is now shifting towards a newer, promising candidate: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). An Emerging Contender Gaining Ground Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is stirring conversations not just for its price point under $0.005 but for its unique approach in the crypto space. As a token leveraging the Ethereum Layer 2 solution, LILPEPE is designed to offer rapid and cost-effective transactions, which address some of the most critical challenges faced by the Ethereum network such as high gas fees and slow transaction times. Intriguingly, the token's current presale price stands at $0.0021, a factor that adds to its allure among both seasoned and new investors. The Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presale has successfully captivated the market’s interest, showcasing a robust uptake with $23 million raised and 95% of the tokens sold in Stage 12. The Unique Appeal of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) What sets Little Pepe apart is its dual appeal: a meme-friendly character combined with serious blockchain utility. This dual nature supports its potential for rapid growth and widespread adoption. Further credibility is lent by a rigorous CertiK audit, ensuring that the token's framework meets high standards of security and reliability. Projected Growth and Market Impact Market analysts who have been closely watching the token’s trajectory suggest that LILPEPE could experience substantial growth, potentially increasing in value up to $0.50 in the next five years. This projection is based on its current trajectory and market conditions, which could see a staggering 23,700% to over 100,000% gain from its presale value. Such predictions echo the explosive growth seen by other meme coins in previous years, reminiscent of SHIB's remarkable rise in 2021. Distinguishing Factors: Beyond Just Another Meme Coin The allure of Little Pepe is not just its meme appeal but also its strategic position in the market. Unlike other meme coins, LILPEPE is entering the market at a time when low entry price tokens are becoming particularly attractive to retail investors. This strategy, combined with the token’s infrastructure on Ethereum's Layer 2, positions it well against giants like XRP and SHIB, which, despite their large market caps, confront limitations in achieving higher valuations.

The strategy centers entirely on Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , which has been advancing rapidly, having sold out stage 11 faster than expected and now in stage 12 at $0.0021, a 110% increase from its initial stage 1 price. With a confirmed listing price of $0.003, investors entering at this stage are guaranteed a 42.9% ROI, yet projections indicate that returns could exceed 40x before listing, driven by the project’s accelerated adoption and strong token demand.

The hunt for the top new meme coins to invest in now has never been more intense, and one contender is rewriting the rules of hype, community buzz, and ROI potential. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has just unlocked Stage 39 with an unprecedented 300% BAGS300 bonus, a gesture toward its loyal community and a clarion call to new investors. This is not just another meme coin presale, it’s a high-voltage event backed by confirmed Coinstore (CEX) and PancakeSwap (DEX) listings. Alongside APC, Bonk and Official Trump are also shaping their own narratives in 2025, but APC’s presale momentum stands in a league of its own. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Mystical 39th Stage | Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now Can a coin really blend myth, adventure, and massive ROI potential? Arctic Pablo Coin’s storyline takes holders on a mystical journey through frozen frontiers, where the explorer Pablo uncovers shimmering tokens worth far more than their weight in gold. But this journey isn’t just lore, it’s Stage 39 of the presale, known as Shiver Me Bags, where investors now receive triple tokens via the BAGS300 code. But APC isn’t just numbers. Holders can stake with a 66% APY, refer friends for juicy rewards, and compete in community contests that pay out in both USD and $APC. Weekly token burns shrink supply, ensuring scarcity and a stronger floor. With over 221.2 billion maximum supply running on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and whales beginning to circle, APC meme coin presale feels more like a CEXPedition than just a sale, especially with both Coinstore and PancakeSwap listings locked in. Is it any wonder that Stage 39 is racing toward a sellout? The clock is ticking, and the gateway to potential life-changing upside could close as the next stage rolls in. $5,000 Turns Into $1.51 Million? Arctic Pablo Coin’s Stage 39 Math At the heart of Arctic Pablo Coin’s Stage 39 presale lies a jaw-dropping calculation that’s fueling the frenzy. With the current price set at $0.00099, a $5,000 investment bags roughly 5,050,505 APC tokens. But here’s where things get electrifying, the 300% BAGS300 bonus triples that amount to an astonishing 15,151,515 tokens. When APC hits its confirmed listing price of $0.008, those tokens transform into a solid $121,212. And if analysts’ bold predictions of $0.1 come true? That same $5,000 could skyrocket to an incredible $1.51 million. With over $3.79 million already raised, early investors have seen up to 6,500% ROI, while current buyers eye a 708.08% gain before the listing even begins. This blend of hard math and massive potential is exactly why Stage 39 is buzzing like never before. Bonk News Update: Riding Solana’s Surge Bonk, the dog-themed token built on Solana, continues to draw headlines in 2025 as Solana’s network expands at breakneck speed. Often hailed as the ecosystem’s unofficial mascot, Bonk thrives on community-driven momentum and has quickly become a utility-backed meme coin. From powering decentralized applications to playing a role in Solana NFTs and gaming integrations, Bonk is evolving beyond its origins as a hype-driven project. Its grassroots adoption and meme energy make it a contender to watch, even as new players like APC make waves. Official Trump News Update: Political Energy Meets Crypto Culture Official Trump coin has cemented itself as a meme coin that thrives on pop culture and politics. Drawing attention through viral campaigns, social media buzz, and its ability to connect with a broad demographic, the project thrives on symbolism and branding. While not anchored in the same presale frenzy as Arctic Pablo Coin, its momentum lies in rallying a unique supporter base. With political cycles heating up, Official Trump continues to leverage headlines and cultural moments to cement its place among meme enthusiasts. Conclusion In the world of top new meme coins to invest in now , Arctic Pablo Coin is the one rewriting the rulebook. With Stage 39’s 300% presale bonus, confirmed Coinstore and PancakeSwap listings, and a deflationary model powered by token burns and staking, APC is setting the stage for potential 10,001.01% gains. Bonk rides the strength of Solana’s ecosystem, and Official Trump feeds off political hype, but neither offers the immediate presale opportunity APC currently delivers. For those watching from the sidelines, the numbers say it all: Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale window is closing quickly, and missing out now could mean looking back at one of 2025’s biggest stories with regret.

Analyst Predicts Altcoin’s Path To New ATH,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sui-price-to-7-analyst-predicts-altcoins-path-to-new-ath/,"After a strong start in August, the SUI price struggled to build on its momentum in the second half of the month. The altcoin’s price crashed from a local high of above $4.1, reaching around $3.2 to start the new month of September. However, the SUI price seems to have found a new lease on life in the past week, increasing by over 4% in the last seven days. Interestingly, the SUI token appears to only be at the beginning of what could be a journey to a new all-time high. Analyst Predicts SUI To Grow 110% Based On Chart Pattern In a September 5 post on social media platform X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that it might be time for investors to start loading their bags with SUI tokens. According to the online pundit, the SUI price just bounced back from a level that could see travel to a new high around $7. Related Reading: Ethereum Outflows Drive Binance Supply Ratio Under 0.037, Signaling Bullish Setup This prediction is based on the appearance of an ascending triangle pattern on the daily Bitcoin chart. The ascending triangle is a technical analysis pattern that features an inverse right-angled triangle with a horizontal upper boundary (connecting a series of lower highs) and a diagonal rising lower trendline (connecting the swing lows). An ascending triangle formation is typically considered a bullish chart pattern, signaling the continuation of the initial upward trend. Nevertheless, this chart pattern can also be viewed as a trend reversal pattern and a bearish sign—usually when the asset’s price breaches below the lower trendline and in the opposite direction of the initial uptrend. As shown in the highlighted chart, the SUI price did make a move for the lower trendline before bouncing back around the $3.1 level. The altcoin, which seemingly found a major support around this price level, looks set to break the upper horizontal trendline of the triangle. While Martinez still expects the SUI price to retest the lower trendline one more time before breaking out of this pattern, the final target for the altcoin is set around the $7 mark. The price target for an ascending triangle pattern is usually calculated by adding the vertical distance between the horizontal and lower trendlines to the breakout point. Going by this method, Martinez puts the target for the SUI at over 110% from the current price point and 30% from the all-time high of $5.8. SUI Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of SUI stands at around $3.38, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

While Ethereum remains the safe institutional bet, raising billions through spot ETFs, seasoned investors know blue chips won’t deliver 25x. That kind of upside is being reserved for disruptors like Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi juggernaut that’s rapidly becoming the most talked-about best DeFi altcoin under $1. Let’s see why top crypto ICO investors are already piling in. ETH Technical Breakout Eyes $5,000 Target Amid Institutional Momentum Ethereum is on solid footing. Trading around $4,400, ETH continues to build pressure against $4,550 resistance with clear technical momentum pointing higher. Analysts project a run to $5,000 as September unfolds, with bullish scenarios stretching to $7,000 or even $10,000 by year-end if ETF inflows persist. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF alone has amassed over $20 billion AUM and the broader market has poured more than $30 billion into Ethereum ETFs. On-chain strength is undeniable, with 36 million ETH staked representing nearly one-third of total supply, driving scarcity. But here’s the reality: Ethereum’s upside is steady, not explosive. A 50% rally is fantastic for institutions, but early-stage investors hungry for more aggressive gains are looking elsewhere. And that’s where Remittix changes the entire game. Remittix: The Cross-Chain DeFi Project No Investor Can Afford to Ignore If Ethereum is the blue-chip, Remittix is the moonshot. Positioned to disrupt the $19 trillion global remittance market, RTX is executing on a vision no meme coin or legacy DeFi project has matched: direct crypto-to-bank settlements in 30+ countries at just 0.1% fees. Western Union and MoneyGram can’t compete with that and neither can tokens that rely solely on hype. The numbers don’t lie. Over $24 million raised, more than 645 million tokens sold, and 25,000+ holders already locked in. To top it all off, CertiK has audited the Defi platform, ensuring institutional-grade security. The Q3 beta wallet launch will cement Remittix as the bridge between crypto efficiency and real-world payments, with seamless support for freelancers, businesses and remittance users globally. Why Investors Are Racing Into RTX Before It’s Too Late: 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiats supported at launch Enterprise-grade Business API fueling institutional adoption CertiK-audited, security-first framework Deflationary burns tied to transaction volume = built-in scarcity $250,000 community giveaway attracting over 310,000 participants This isn’t another “maybe” token. RTX is engineered for demand. The scarcity is real, the adoption is imminent and the upside is unmatched. If you wait for CEX listings, you’ll be buying at a premium while early adopters multiply their stacks 10x–25x. Community-Driven Expansion With Explosive Growth Potential The buzz isn’t fabricated, it’s measurable. A $250,000 giveaway campaign has supercharged viral adoption, proving Remittix isn’t just building tech, it’s building a movement. Over 310,000 entries and counting show investors everywhere are scrambling to get a piece of what analysts are already calling the next big altcoin of 2025. With presale stages selling out rapidly and exchange listings imminent, every day on the sidelines means fewer tokens and higher prices. Ethereum will keep growing steadily, but for those seeking life-changing returns, Remittix is the once-in-a-cycle play. Miss it now, and you’ll be kicking yourself when RTX is the coin everyone else brags about owning at pennies.

McGlone described Bitcoin's rise to $100,000 as the “peak of the bubble,” suggesting the price could drop to $10,000. He explained this potential decline as being due to Bitcoin becoming a risky asset and its high correlation with the S&P 500. McGlone argued that this correlation is at an all-time high and that the US stock market must remain elevated for Bitcoin to continue its rise. Related News: Analysis Firm Warns: “Stay Away from These 7 Altcoins for Now” He noted that another risk factor is that there are currently more than 21 million different cryptocurrencies in the cryptocurrency market, compared to just one, Bitcoin, in 2009. McGlone predicts that gold prices will continue to outperform most risk-on assets. McGlone, who sees a decline in the US stock market as the main catalyst for the gold price rally, sees gold heading towards $4,000. He argues that the final quarter of 2025 “will not be good for stocks, risk assets, and Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

The image reveals a large symmetrical triangle consolidation, almost identical to the formation that preceded XRP’s parabolic rally eight years ago. By overlaying both structures, MARKS suggests that if the breakout continues to track this fractal, XRP could be preparing for a surge of similar scale. Price Action and Key Levels As of report time, XRP trades at $2.81, hovering above critical support between $2.47 and $2.70. This zone has acted as a floor for several sessions, while resistance looms at $3.30 to $4.00. As long as this level holds, prices may only be prepping for another +66% upside, this points to a near-term target around $4.80 if buying momentum accelerates. If $XRP follows the same growth pattern this cycle as it did in 2017, this is the type of growth we're looking at. pic.twitter.com/mmPoBFFyZa — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) September 5, 2025 Other analysts back the idea of a potential rebound, with some projecting an 85% recovery should XRP maintain its footing above current support. Data from major trading platforms highlights this same zone as a decisive battleground for bulls and bears alike. Longer-Term Fractal Targets The real intrigue in MARKS’ analysis lies in the higher projections derived from Fibonacci extensions. The fractal overlay suggests possible price objectives at $9.63, which would mark a 251% rise from current levels, and intermediate resistance around $7.77. More daring projections extend as high as $127, reflecting a 50x surge based on the 2017 breakout model. In 2017, XRP multiplied thousands of percent in just months once its breakout was confirmed. Although today’s market conditions differ, the structural similarity offers traders a roadmap for what could unfold if momentum aligns with the fractal pattern. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risks and Market Signals As with any technical setup, risks remain. On-chain data shows nearly $500 million worth of XRP moved onto exchanges in the past week, potentially signaling heightened selling pressure. A failure to defend $2.47 or repeated rejection at $3.30–$4.00 would weaken the fractal case and increase the likelihood of extended consolidation. For investors and traders, the focus should be on whether XRP can hold above support and push through resistance with strong volume. Those markers will determine whether the bullish fractal is gaining traction or fading into another sideways phase. The Takeaway JAVON MARKS’ fractal analysis offers a compelling vision of what XRP could achieve if history repeats. Near-term projections cluster around $4.80 and $9.63, while longer-term extensions point to levels as high as $127. These numbers are not guarantees but scenarios based on structural parallels with 2017. For now, XRP sits at a pivotal point where holding support and breaking resistance will decide whether this cycle delivers the type of price surge that MARKS’ chart so vividly illustrates.

Here’s What Data Shows,https://cryptopotato.com/is-the-nft-market-making-a-comeback-heres-what-data-shows/,"The NFT movement appears to be gaining momentum once again, projected to grow substantially over the coming years, driven by increasing adoption levels. Certain metrics indicate a steady rejuvenation, but we remain far from the glory years experienced not long ago. Forecasted for Growth According to a report from analysis platform Coinlaw.io, the non-fungible token (NFT) market is showing signs of a revival . It is projected to grow by hundreds of billions by the end of the decade, by moving away from speculative art to an interconnected ecosystem spanning fashion, gaming, and even legal matters. Current projections see the 2025 global NFT market to reach over $60 billion, and with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 42%, to exceed $247 billion by 2029, of course, depending on adoption trends and market conditions. Source: Coinlaw.io Leading trends remain gaming and digital art, representing 38% of global NFT transactions and 21% market size, respectively. Some upcoming movements, such as real estate, surpassed $1.4 billion in volume, and phygital tokens, linked to physical goods, saw a 60% rise in transaction volume, led by luxury brands. Institutions and venture capital (VC) firms also seem to be drawn to this market, with the latter investing $4.2 billion in NFT projects for this year alone. Financial giants like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have explored tokenization for digital asset collateralization, while firms like SoftBank and Sequoia Capital are expanding into tokenized digital assets. Moreover, there has already been an application by the asset manager Canary Capital for a Pudgy Penguins ETF, which would potentially hold a mix of the PENGU meme coin and Pudgy Penguins NFT collection. Non-fungible tokens also have a firm grasp over industry dominance, specifically concerning unique active wallets (UAW) by having a bigger share than AI and social decentralized applications (dApps). Source: DappRadar Trading Volume And Sales NFT sales have been gradually increasing since the start of the year, while trading volume experienced a dip, with roughly a 2M jump and $419 million drop, respectively. Source: DappRadar As per the chart, July and August saw the strongest rebounds since the mid-year slump , adding roughly a billion to the NFT market cap and increasing wallet count by 90,000. While there are signs of a recovery, this market niche is still far from the 2022 peaks it saw of roughly $24.7 billion market cap, with current levels being just shy of $6B, a substantial drop of 76%, as per data at print time from CoinGecko.

The Cardano price is range-bound, the Chainlink price is consolidating, and both are testing the patience of traders who want something more exciting. That’s why attention is shifting to Layer Brett , a meme coin built as an Ethereum Layer 2 that’s offering speed, staking, and viral energy. In a market where sideways charts are wearing people down, Layer Brett is being pitched as the fresh play with explosive potential. Cardano (ADA): Cardano price drifts as momentum stays muted The Cardano market feels like it’s stuck on pause. Trading has been caught between tight support and resistance, with analysts pointing to a possible breakout above $1.00 if momentum builds—but that “if” has been hanging around for months. Even with Hydra upgrades and scaling improvements, the Cardano price hasn’t managed to ignite the kind of energy that makes traders pile in. It’s the story of ADA in a nutshell: strong fundamentals, cautious adoption, and a reputation for moving slower than the rest of the field. Developers praise its peer-reviewed approach, and long-term holders still talk about eventual targets of $2 or more, but short-term speculators aren’t seeing the fireworks. Compared to meme-fuelled sectors, Cardano feels more like a slow burn than a rocket. For investors seeking gradual growth, that might be fine—but for those hunting quick gains, attention is shifting elsewhere. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink price stuck in consolidation mode The Chainlink price has been circling the same levels for weeks, trading in a narrow band that has traders calling it a consolidation zone. Support sits around $22, resistance is in the mid-$20s, and the occasional push higher toward $30 has struggled to stick. Optimists argue that if LINK clears $30 with conviction, targets of $40 or even $50 come into play. Skeptics, however, see the sideways action as a sign of exhaustion. Chainlink is still the go-to name for oracles in crypto, and it remains deeply embedded in DeFi projects and enterprise integrations. The partnerships keep stacking up, and on paper the fundamentals look strong. But the market doesn’t always reward solid infrastructure right away. The Chainlink price has been moving sideways, dependable but dull, and in a trading environment obsessed with volatility and hype, steady progress isn’t always what gets people buying. Layer Brett (LBRETT): Meme coin momentum while majors stall As the Cardano price and Chainlink price drift sideways, Layer Brett is grabbing the spotlight. Layer Brett is built as an Ethereum Layer 2, combining meme-driven hype with real blockchain efficiency. Transactions are near-instant, gas fees are negligible, and the staking dApp is already paying out rewards that have traders buzzing. That’s why analysts are pointing to Layer Brett as the project with genuine breakout potential this month. The cultural side is just as strong. Layer Brett leans into meme identity with NFT drops, gamified staking, and a community that thrives on visibility and viral reach. Unlike Cardano or Chainlink, which require patience, Layer Brett gives traders the thrill of scooping up millions of tokens at entry-level prices. That psychological hook, matched with Layer 2 utility, is why meme experts keep calling Layer Brett the one to watch in 2025. If anything pops, Layer Brett looks ready. Conclusion Cardano and Chainlink remain credible projects, but their sideways action isn’t sparking speculative fire. Layer Brett , on the other hand, is delivering the mix of meme appeal and Layer 2 performance that traders crave. With analysts calling for breakout potential this month, the contrast is sharp: while ADA and LINK drift, Layer Brett could be the one making noise in 2025.

The trend follows a highly positive August in which Ether ETFs attracted $3.87 billion in inflows. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs suffered $751 million in outflows over the same month, according to Farside data. By Friday, Ether funds shed $446.8 million in a single session, bringing the week’s total to $787.6 million. During the same stretch, Bitcoin ETFs enjoyed $250.3 million in inflows, highlighting diverging investor sentiment. Market Awaits Rebound Some traders remain optimistic that the downturn is temporary. Crypto trader Ted commented: “I’m expecting inflows to return if Ethereum continues this pump.” Ether has climbed 16.35% in the past month but slipped 2.92% over the past week, trading around $4,301 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap. Overall market confidence remains mixed, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signaling ‘Neutral’ sentiment for two consecutive days. Long-Term Predictions Remain Bullish Despite the recent pullback, analysts continue to project strong upside for Ether. BitMine chairman Tom Lee reiterated his long-term forecast on the Medici Presents: Level Up podcast, stating that ETH could climb to $60,000. Lee suggested Wall Street’s growing interest in Ether may serve as a “1971 moment,” potentially unlocking historic gains. BitMine, which holds the world’s largest corporate Ether treasury, now owns $8.04 billion worth of ETH, according to StrategicETHReserve. Across all treasuries, institutional holdings amount to 2.97% of total supply, valued at $15.49 billion. Whale Activity Supports Outlook Blockchain analytics firm Santiment has noted that whale addresses have been steadily increasing their Ether exposure. “In exactly 5 months, they have added 14.0% more coins,” the company reported, referring to holders with between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH. This accumulation trend began after ETH’s yearly lows in April and reflects broader institutional appetite, even as ETF flows fluctuate. With treasury accumulation and whale purchases continuing, analysts argue the latest outflows may be more reflective of short-term adjustments than a long-term shift.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-06 19:28:58
51301452,https://nulltx.com/?p=152079,1757186998,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Solana DEX Addresses Cross 750 Million, But Most Last Just Minutes",https://nulltx.com/solana-dex-addresses-cross-750-million-but-most-last-just-minutes/,"Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem is booming in raw numbers. Over 750 million addresses have been recorded interacting with Solana DEXs. But a closer look shows a striking pattern, 96.6% of these addresses disappear within a day. That means the vast majority of trading addresses have a lifespan of less than 24 hours, often averaging just 15 minutes. Transaction Burst or Volume Inflation? The short-lived nature of most addresses raises questions about what’s driving the activity. On-chain analysts suggest these addresses are likely spin-ups for volume inflation. The trend is particularly strong with new memecoins, where trading bots create fresh wallets, transact rapidly, and vanish. It boosts reported volume but says little about long-term user adoption. In reality, Solana’s DEX scene may look busier than it actually is. The Sticky Side of Solana DEX Users Not everything is noise. When filtering past the one-day churn, the data tells a different story. More than 1.8 million addresses have remained active for over one year. These long-term DEX users hold an average lifespan of 655 days. That’s nearly two years of activity, proof of real commitment. Even more telling is the stickiness of addresses in the middle ranges. Between 1 day to 1 week, 1 week to 1 month, 1 month to 1 quarter, and 1 quarter to 1 year, the numbers are surprisingly close. In fact, there are more addresses lasting 3–12 months than those sticking around for just 1–3 months. That suggests Solana’s trading community doesn’t fade quickly once it settles in. Why Stickiness Matters Stickiness is a key metric for blockchain ecosystems. Short-term addresses inflate transaction numbers, but they don’t contribute to sustained liquidity or community growth. Addresses that last quarters or years drive the real value. They support consistent trading, provide liquidity, and engage across different DeFi protocols. For Solana, the data shows two extremes: a flood of fleeting addresses likely tied to memecoin speculation, and a solid base of loyal traders who stick around. Solana’s DEX Landscape in Context Solana’s DEX boom comes during a period of high activity in memecoins and automated trading strategies. The network’s speed and low fees make it a perfect playground for bots and volume pushers. Yet, the 1.8 million+ long-term addresses show Solana isn’t just hype-driven. These are real users engaging in swaps, liquidity provision, and long-term DeFi strategies. The balance between noise and genuine growth is critical. If Solana’s sticky base expands while the churn continues, the DEX ecosystem could mature into one of the strongest in crypto. What Analysts Are Saying A recent analysis shared by DeFi Oasis 探寻了 Solana DEX 交易者的生命周期（第一笔到最后一笔 DEX 交易的时间跨度），且过滤掉在近 24 小时内首笔 DEX 交易的新地址，发现许多有意思的点 – 总 Solana DEX 交易地址数超过 7.5 亿个，但 96.6% 的地址生命周期在 24 小时内，且平均生命周期大概在 15 分钟，大多数应该是被用于新 Memecoin… pic.twitter.com/HJsR0pw3XQ — defioasis.eth (@defioasis) September 6, 2025 highlighted the same contrast. While the headline number of 750 million addresses looks impressive, the short lifespans show the importance of digging deeper. The takeaway: address count alone is misleading. Stickiness and lifespan reveal the true health of a network. The future of Solana DEX trading hinges on whether sticky addresses keep growing. If new entrants convert into long-term users instead of one-day bots, Solana could lock in lasting adoption. The network already shows strong retention over months and years. With memecoin hype driving waves of short-term addresses, the challenge will be filtering the signal from the noise. For now, Solana holds a unique dual identity: A hotspot for fast, speculative memecoin trading. A sticky base of real traders with years of activity.

The withdrawals followed a record-setting August when spot ether ETFs pulled in $3.87 billion even as bitcoin ETFs saw $751 million in net outflows, according to SoSoValue data. Friday accounted for the sharpest decline, with $446.71 million leaving these ETH-linked funds. Spot bitcoin ETFs, in contrast, posted $246.4 million in net inflows over the past week. The contrast is notable, as funds investing in the flagship cryptocurrency saw $751.1 million in net outflows last month. Ether has climbed more than 16% over the past month, though it slipped 1.8% in the last week now trading just below $4,300. The cryptocurrency has been benefitting from the GENIUS Act passing into law , which restricted stablecoin issuers from paying interest and provided clarity which could lead to greater institutional investment. Its recent drawdown is likely related to a broader return from risk assets. That came after weak U.S. jobs data furthered expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month, along with growing fears of a recession . Traders are now weighing an 89% chance of a 25 bps rate cut, and an 11% chance of a 50 bps cut according to the CME’s FedWatch tool.On Polymarket , odds of a 50 bps rate cut are at 12%.

SOL Strategies has secured approval to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, making it the first Solana-focused treasury company to achieve this milestone. At the same time, DeFi Development Corp. crossed a major benchmark with over 2 million SOL in its treasury, tightening its grip as the leading public vehicle for long-term Solana accumulation. Together, these two moves signal a new phase for Solana, one where institutions no longer stand at the sidelines but anchor themselves directly into its ecosystem. 1/ Major Milestone Alert! SOL Strategies approved for @NasdaqExchange Global Select Market listing under the ticker “STKE” and trading will commence on Tuesday, September 9, 2025! As CEO Leah Wald noted: ""This represents more than just an achievement for SOL Strategies, it's… pic.twitter.com/tEJ6uBQahR — SOL Strategies (@solstrategies_) September 5, 2025 SOL Strategies Lands Nasdaq Approval SOL Strategies, a company built around managing and scaling Solana staking operations, received the green light from Nasdaq to trade under the ticker STKE. Trading will commence on Tuesday, September 9, 2025. The listing is a leap forward not only for the company but also for the broader Solana community. CEO Leah Wald put it plainly: “This represents more than just an achievement for SOL Strategies, it’s validation for the entire Solana ecosystem.” Validation is the key word here. A Nasdaq listing is not just about prestige. It’s about access. With a seat at the world’s most liquid equity market, SOL Strategies can unlock institutional partnerships that were previously out of reach. From pension funds to asset managers, doors are now open. The Nasdaq nod means three things for SOL Strategies: 1. Accelerated Validator Growth – With institutional backing, SOL Strategies can expand its validator operations faster, directly contributing to Solana’s network security and efficiency. 2. Scaling Operations – Demand for Solana staking has surged as SOL rallies in 2025. By scaling infrastructure, SOL Strategies positions itself as the go-to bridge for institutions looking to stake safely. 3. Institutional Bridge to Solana – Traditional finance has been circling crypto for years. With STKE on Nasdaq, they now have a regulated, accessible entry point into the Solana ecosystem. This positioning puts SOL Strategies in the driver’s seat as Solana transitions from being a retail-heavy chain to one increasingly supported by institutional flows. The Transition in Trading Currently, shares trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) under the ticker HODL. But with the Nasdaq listing live, shares will no longer trade on the OTCQB under CYFRF. For existing OTC shareholders, there’s no paperwork, no extra steps. Shares will automatically convert to Nasdaq-listed stock under STKE. This clean migration lowers friction and ensures liquidity moves where the action is, on Nasdaq. DeFi Development Corp. Crosses 2 Million $SOL in Treasury! @DeFiDevCorp $DFDV , the first public company with a Solana-focused treasury strategy, has officially surpassed 2 million SOL in holdings. Latest Update: • New Acquisition: 196,141 SOL at avg. price of $202.76 • Total… pic.twitter.com/xdpCbFLPAH — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) September 6, 2025 DeFi Development Corp Crosses 2M SOL While SOL Strategies was securing a place on Nasdaq, another major Solana-focused player made headlines. DeFi Development Corp. ($DFDV) surpassed the 2 million SOL mark in its treasury. The company announced its latest acquisition: 196,141 SOL purchased at an average price of $202.76 Total Holdings: 2,027,817 SOL (~$410M) Per Share Metrics: 0.0793 SOL per share (~$16.06/share) Shares Outstanding: ~25.573M At press time, SOL trades at $202.47, according to CoinMarketCap. That means DeFi Development Corp’s treasury is not just a passive holding, it’s a strategically growing bet aligned with Solana’s price strength. A Public Market Vehicle for SOL DeFi Development Corp. was the first public company to adopt a Solana-focused treasury strategy. By passing the 2M SOL mark, it cements its status as the largest public market vehicle for long-term Solana accumulation. All newly acquired tokens are being staked immediately. This serves a dual purpose: 1. Network Security – The staked SOL helps decentralize and secure the Solana blockchain. 2. Native Yield – Staking returns flow back into the treasury, compounding the company’s SOL position over time. For investors, DFDV offers a liquid equity proxy to Solana exposure. Unlike buying SOL directly, investors gain regulated access through equity markets, a major advantage for institutions barred from direct token purchases. The Bigger Picture: Institutions Enter Solana The timing of these two developments is not accidental. Solana has been building momentum all year. With DeFi activity climbing, network outages largely solved, and ecosystem liquidity deepening, institutions are now stepping in with conviction. SOL Strategies’ Nasdaq listing provides credibility and accessibility. DeFi Development Corp.’s treasury expansion demonstrates long-term conviction and balance sheet-level commitment. Together, they reinforce Solana’s narrative as not just a fast blockchain, but a financial system ready for institutional adoption. SOL Market Impact For SOL itself, institutional signals matter. Each headline listing or treasury acquisition adds credibility and demand. Staking inflows reduce circulating supply. Treasury growth locks up tokens long-term. As of today, Solana’s market capitalization sits at $92.1B, with 454.7M tokens in circulation. If DeFi Development Corp. continues accumulating and SOL Strategies scales its validator footprint, both moves could reinforce price momentum by tightening supply and amplifying demand from new entrants. SOL Strategies entering Nasdaq and DeFi Development Corp. crossing 2M SOL in treasury are not isolated events. They are twin milestones in Solana’s institutional journey. For investors, these moves provide two different but complementary entry points: STKE on Nasdaq – a validator-driven growth play. DFDV equity – a treasury accumulation vehicle. Both confirm the same truth: Solana is no longer just a playground for developers and retail traders. It’s a blockchain ecosystem maturing into institutional-grade infrastructure. As Leah Wald said, it’s validation. For Solana, it’s also acceleration. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Analysts are pointing to top 5 altcoins to buy 2025 with Bitcoin, ETH, and SHIB leading the charge. BNB continues to attract attention with its treasury-backed growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a fresh contender that investors are beginning to watch closely. Bitcoin: ETF Flows and Breakout Potential Bitcoin sits around $107,000–$110,000, about 13% under its August peak. Technical levels suggest downside risk to $100,000, but RSI divergence indicates underlying strength. ETF flows are shaping the market mood. After $751 million outflows in August, early September saw inflows of $333 million, led by Fidelity and BlackRock. ETFs now hold more than 1.47 million BTC, or 7% of supply. BTC 1W price chart Analysts’ Bitcoin price prediction 2025 ranges between $125,000 to $150,000 in the near term, with derivatives markets positioned for a $119K breakout. A Fed rate cut could fuel a Q4 rally, strengthening Bitcoin’s role among top analyst crypto picks . Ethereum: Setting Up for a Strong Fourth Quarter Ethereum trades near $4,300 after the recent pullback. A clean break could push ETH toward $4,950–$5,000, with end-of-year forecasts targeting $7,000 and bullish extremes at $10,000–$12,000. ETH 1W price chart Institutional flows support this outlook. While Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows, Ethereum ETFs pulled in nearly $4 billion in August. Network activity is also growing, with upgrades and Layer-2 adoption adding fuel. Analysts expect ETH to deliver one of the best quarters, making it a standout among the best altcoins before September . BNB: Corporate Strategy Drives Institutional Growth BNB trades around $850, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. A breakout could see $925, while downside risk sits near $775. The big story is institutional accumulation. Nasdaq-listed BNC has expanded its BNB treasury to $330 million, aiming for 1% of supply by 2025. This mirrors Bitcoin corporate strategies, providing structural support for BNB. BNB 1W price Forecasts project a trading range of $780–$1,020 through September, making BNB a contender in altcoins to invest in 2025 . Shiba Inu: Long-Term Community Strength SHIB trades near $0.000012, down from August highs. Historically, September has been mixed, but analysts spot bullish divergence with targets up to $0.00003. Extreme scenarios suggest as much as 570% gains. SHIB 1W price Ecosystem expansion continues. Shibarium has processed over a billion transactions, and new institutional ETPs are broadening access. With 76% of holders classified as long-term, SHIB remains a resilient meme coin. The SHIB price prediction for 2025 ranges from $0.000032–$0.00005, cementing its spot in the Bitcoin, ETH and SHIB outlook and among the best crypto investments for September 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Star Before the September Cycle While the market leans heavily on Bitcoin, ETH, and SHIB, analysts are starting to spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE. With seasonal flows and growing investor interest, it is being called one of the top 5 altcoins to buy before September 2025 . Strong fundamentals, a growing community and rising demand are helping the project gain attention. Some analysts even include MAGACOIN FINANCE in top crypto analyst picks for the September rally, pointing to its positioning as a fresh alternative alongside the established majors. Final Word: Altcoins Shaping the Q4 Narrative The best crypto to buy before September includes a mix of established leaders and fresh entries. Bitcoin’s ETF-driven push, Ethereum’s institutional flows, BNB’s treasury story, and SHIB’s ecosystem strength remain at the center. Yet the rising buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE adds a new name to the conversation. As investors weigh Bitcoin, Ethereum and Shiba Inu investment outlook, they are also seeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the best altcoins to buy now for the next bull run, making it a balanced mix of old powerhouses and new momentum.

The fintech company’s shares closed just above $101 and climbed above $108 in after-hours trading, marking a key milestone in its market journey. Robinhood Joins the S&P 500: A Major Milestone Robinhood’s inclusion in the S&P 500 index shows its growing role in the U.S. financial market. The S&P 500 includes the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States and serves as a standard for institutional investors. To qualify for the S&P 500, a company must meet six stringent requirements. A market capitalization of over $18 billion, a public float exceeding 10%, positive GAAP earnings for the most recent quarter and cumulatively over the last four quarters, high liquidity, more than 12 months since its IPO, and domicile in the U.S. However, inclusion in the S&P 500 is not automatic. The decision ultimately rests with the Index Committee, which considers sector diversification alongside numerical benchmarks. Notably, Strategy, a major player in the market, did not make it onto the S&P 500 list, despite reportedly having a market cap of $20 billion. There hasn’t been an official reason given for this. Analysts feel the S&P committee might have considered factors such as trading volume, profitability, or sector diversity in their decision. 25% of S&P 500 Firms Could Hold BTC by 2030 According to Elliot Chun, a partner at the tech-focused advisory firm Architect Partners, a growing number of major corporations could hold Bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets. Elliot predicted in March that nearly a quarter of the S&P 500 would adopt the cryptocurrency as a long-term treasury asset by 2030. This prediction came amid increasing pressure on treasury managers to explore Bitcoin or risk being seen as outdated. Currently, only two S&P 500 companies, Tesla and Block, hold BTC on their balance sheets . To meet Elliot’s projection, at least 123 additional S&P 500 firms would need to follow suit by 2030. Meanwhile, shares of Coinbase (COIN) recently recorded a significant spike. In June, the publicly-listed stock outperformed the broader market , including the other shares in the S&P 500. The spike is largely attributed to a shift in investor focus towards stablecoin revenue, triggered by Washington’s progress on the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation. Robinhood Revenue Nearly Doubles in Q2 In July, Robinhood reported a 98% year-on-year surge in its crypto revenue , reaching $160 million in the second quarter of 2025. Alongside this, the trading platform’s total net revenue climbed to $989 million, marking a 45% increase, while net income jumped 105% to $386 million. This surge comes as the company intensifies its focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, both in the United States and globally. CEO Vlad Tenez used the earnings call to emphasize the firm’s long-term strategy to lead in asset tokenization , following the launch of Robinhood Chain, a layer 2 blockchain designed for stock trading in Europe.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $13,443 and $15,841 with an average expected price of $13,824. In 2031, ETH could trade between $38,150 and $49,492 with an average price of $39,609. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $4,296 Market cap $519.05B Trading volume (24-hour) $24.84B Circulating supply 120.7M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $4,342.83 24-hour low $4,258.05 ETH price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 4.79% 50-day SMA $ 4,070 200-day SMA $ 2,725 Sentiment Neutral Fear and Greed Index 48 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis Ethereum is trading near $4,297 on the daily chart with resistance at $4,424 and $4,803 and support at $4,044 The 4-hour chart shows sideways movement with tight Bollinger Bands and resistance at $4,358 and $4,488 and support at $4,228 Momentum remains weak with sellers in control and the market awaiting a breakout Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum holds range near $4,300 as market awaits breakout On the 1-day chart on Sept 6, Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $4,297 after consolidating sideways for several sessions. The RSI at 49 signals neutral momentum, showing indecision between buyers and sellers. The MACD remains bearish, reflecting weak momentum. ETHUSD chart by TradingView ETH is trading below the Bollinger Band midline at $4,424, making this an immediate resistance level, while support lies at $4,044. A break above $4,424 could open the door for a push toward $4,803, the upper band resistance. On the downside, a fall below $4,044 could trigger a drop toward $3,800. Overall, ETH remains range-bound with a cautious market outlook. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum trades sideways with low volatility and bearish pressure On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $4,295, showing prolonged sideways movement with low volatility. The Bollinger Bands are tight, signaling compression and a possible breakout soon. The MACD is negative, reflecting weak momentum and a bearish undertone, while the Balance of Power also leans negative, showing sellers still in control. ETHUSD chart by TradingView Immediate resistance sits at $4,358, with stronger resistance at $4,488, while support is found at $4,228. A breakout above $4,358 could encourage a test of $4,488, but failure to hold $4,228 risks a move toward $4,100. Overall, ETH remains neutral to bearish until momentum changes.

On the daily chart, Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $4,297, consolidating after recent declines. The RSI near 49 signals neutral momentum, while the MACD is bearish, showing weak buying interest. Key resistance is at $4,424, with stronger resistance at $4,803, while support lies at $4,044. On the 4-hour chart, ETH is moving sideways with tight Bollinger Bands, indicating low volatility and a potential breakout. Resistance stands at $4,358 and $4,488, while support is at $4,228. The MACD and Balance of Power remain negative, suggesting sellers still dominate. Overall, ETH is consolidating with a bearish tilt, awaiting a decisive breakout. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum blockchain is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $4,800 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $33,171 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with a potential high of $10,700. Will ETH reach $25,000? Based on price predictions, Ethereum is unlikely to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029. By 2029, the ETH’s potential high is expected to be $23,496. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $49,492 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $49,492 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Kelly argued that the weak August employment report and other economic indicators pointed to further softening in the economy, saying, “The economy is not in recession, but it is slowing. All the data indicates that an economy that was already struggling is now nearing exhaustion.” Related News: US President Donald Trump Narrows Down List of Candidates for FED Chair - Announces Three Names Despite market optimism, Kelly argued that interest rate cuts won't boost growth, saying, “I saw the stock market rise today, which clearly reflects the expectation of a rate cut. However, this doesn't solve the fundamental problem. Lowering interest rates will reduce retirees' interest income and signal further rate cuts to the market. In such a scenario, borrowers will have no reason to borrow more.” Kelly, stating that the experience of the 2000s also proves this, added, “The entire 21st century has shown us that interest rate cuts do not stimulate economic growth. The post-financial crisis cuts had no effect. Don't expect the Fed to save the economy.” *This is not investment advice.

This new DeFi altcoin currently at only $0.035 has been voted as the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this month, and is attracting retail and institutional investors. To date, more than 16100 holders have joined in and over $15.45M have been raised. Mutuum Finance has an opportunity to change the industry focus while SHIB is unable to recover its momentum. Shiba Inu Endures Consolidation as Markets Attack Once More Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at a value of about $0.00001215 and has a small intraday variation between $0.00001203 and $0.00001241. The meme coin has recorded suppressed activity in September, with trading volumes being low and the 24-hour price behaviour showing a consolidation period, instead of an upwards trend. Technical indicators are vague and a golden cross has developed on the shorter terms with good bullish chances, higher measures have shown declining demand and minimal inflow of liquidity. Since old meme coins such as SHIB are lying flat, investors are now starting to gravitate toward upcoming and utility-oriented altcoins, with Mutuum Finance already beginning to pull a following. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 FOMO Investors are joining the project today at $0.035 per token. Waiting until the project progresses into phase 7 will mean paying 14.3% more per token. MUTM has already gained over 16,100 supporters and over $15.45 million. Official Bug Bounty Program An active $50,000 USDT bug bounty exists with CertiK and continues to reward and fix potential vulnerabilities in the project code. Once you are a part of this initiative, you will be rewarded according to 4 levels of severity, namely, critical, major, minor and low. Ethereum-Based Stablecoin The new entrant DeFi is also developing an overcollateralized USD-pegged Ethereum-based stablecoin. The idea is to prevent an asset that is prone to fluctuating market movements that would trigger depegging. The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol enables its users to handle their money in the simplest manner of imaginable through passive yielding lenders and liquidity mobilizing borrowers that commit their personal resources to asset securitized portfolios. By the algorithms that adapt the rates and stabilize the ecosystem in the long run, maximum efficiency of the capital is reached. Risk and Liquidity Management The protocol also considers the liquidity and the volatility of the market to allow closing the distress position. The exposure of the risk is in the caps and the liquidation parameters. Stablecoins and ETH are less volatile, and therefore can have a more favorable Loan-to-Value ratio, and there are fewer volatile holdings. In any form of token, reserve factors are shifted on the same basis as asset risk and opportunity to participate in the asset safety. Analysts see a strong rally brewing in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Meanwhile, lower lows are not out of the question for Shiba Inu (SHIB). Stage 6 tokens cost $0.035, increasing by 14.3% to 0.04 in Stage 7, and $15.45M+ have been raised with more than 16,100 holders on board. Supported by a $50k CertiK bug bounty, an Ethereum based USD stablecoin, and excellent risk management, MUTM has massive growth opportunities as investors start to focus more on utility assets rather than meme coins.

This is also a positive for XRP, which serves as the network’s bridge currency. Ripple’s XRP Ledger Gets A New Update In an X post, XRP validator Vet revealed that the credentials amendment on the XRP Ledger is now active. He explained that credentials can be applied to attest to compliance requirements, such as KYC and AML, for a user or institution and issued to their decentralized identity. This helps to further build trust in the network. Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SWIFT Battle Heating Up As Exec Lands Major Blow To XRP Vet also noted that the amendment has all been done natively on the XRP Ledger. Notably, this update is part of a larger move to enable compliance amendments on the network. With decentralized identities and credentials implemented, Vet indicated that their next focus is to work on the permissioned domains and permissioned DEX. Ripple and other XRP Ledger stakeholders aim to utilize these compliance amendments to attract more institutions to the network, enabling them to adhere to traditional finance (TradFi) standards even on-chain. This also comes as the network aims to become the go-to for tokenization. Ripple recently stated that 10% of global assets will become tokenized by 2030, and is undoubtedly looking to tap into this trillion-dollar market. Ripple Engineer Breaks Down Significance Of This Update In an X post, Ripple engineer Kenny explained that the credentials update gives developers and businesses a way to handle identity checks and compliance requirements directly on the XRP Ledger. With these, they do not need to approve each account one by one manually. The Ripple engineer noted that traditionally, verifying user credentials like KYC requires multiple checks across different platforms. Related Reading: Pundit Says Ripple Is The New SWIFT — Here’s What Is Driving It Kenny remarked that this process isn’t only inefficient but also increases privacy risks because sensitive information has to be shared multiple times. As such, this makes the XRP Ledger credentials update vital. The Ripple engineer revealed that this feature enables credentials to be issued, stored, and verified natively on the XRPL. He noted the benefits of how this allows users to prove a required criterion without undergoing repeated verification. Kenny also stated that this will improve the onboard process and enhance security, while maintaining privacy. The Ripple engineer further gave an example of what a typical flow will look like using this credentials feature. A business will define the credentials it requires, such as the KYC, then a trusted issuer creates and signs that credential. The user then accepts and stores these credentials in their XRP Ledger account. That way, the credential is checked on-chain whenever the user interacts with the business. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.83, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Here’s Another Proof,https://timestabloid.com/interoperability-between-ripple-xrp-and-swift-heres-another-proof/,"A recent post by SMQKE on X has reignited the debate around Ripple’s interoperability with SWIFT. By sharing content from Ripple’s official documentation, SMQKE spotlighted two crucial details: the RippleNet Integration Module explicitly includes “SWIFT messaging interoperability,” and the RippleNet Payment Object is based on the ISO 20022 pacs.008 standard. These findings provide concrete evidence that RippleNet is designed with compatibility in mind for traditional banking systems that rely on SWIFT. Ripple’s Integration Module and SWIFT Messaging Ripple’s documentation describes the Integration Module as a software layer connecting a company’s internal systems to RippleNet. Among its listed features is “SWIFT messaging interoperability,” which indicates Ripple anticipated the need for banks and financial institutions to bridge messaging flows between RippleNet and SWIFT. This is not a speculative claim but a documented feature, meaning the infrastructure to handle SWIFT messages is formally recognized within Ripple’s system design. By allowing automated orchestration and third-party extensions, the module further strengthens Ripple’s case as a flexible integration partner for institutions still entrenched in legacy rails. Yes, RippleNet includes features that enable interoperability with SWIFT messaging. Documented. pic.twitter.com/B7SiMxHnht — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 6, 2025 ISO 20022 and the Role of pacs.008 Equally significant is RippleNet’s adoption of ISO 20022 standards, specifically aligning its payment object with pacs.008, the widely used message type for cross-border financial transactions. ISO 20022 has been embraced globally as the next-generation messaging standard, and SWIFT itself has been migrating toward its adoption. RippleNet’s alignment with pacs.008 ensures that data formats between RippleNet and ISO 20022-compliant institutions are consistent. This reduces friction, minimizes translation errors, and allows RippleNet to operate seamlessly alongside existing financial infrastructures. In effect, Ripple has built its system to “speak the same language” as SWIFT-enabled banks and payment providers. Compatibility Versus Partnership It is important to draw a line between technical interoperability and business collaboration. Ripple’s documentation demonstrates that the network can interact with SWIFT messaging and ISO 20022 formats. However, this does not mean Ripple and SWIFT have an official commercial partnership or direct operational integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Instead, what the documentation shows is Ripple’s forward-thinking approach in designing a system that banks can adopt without overhauling their existing SWIFT-based operations . This creates optionality for financial institutions, allowing them to transition toward blockchain-powered settlement while maintaining connections to legacy rails. The Practical Implications For banks, the implications are significant. RippleNet’s SWIFT interoperability and ISO 20022 alignment mean reduced onboarding friction and streamlined messaging translation. Institutions can integrate Ripple’s solutions without sacrificing compatibility with global networks already adopting ISO standards. This design approach positions Ripple as a strong contender in the cross-border payments sector, where the ability to integrate rather than replace existing systems often determines adoption speed. In other words, RippleNet does not seek to dismantle SWIFT but to coexist, offering a bridge between blockchain efficiency and traditional messaging infrastructure. Final Takeaway SMQKE’s discovery from Ripple’s own documentation provides strong, verifiable evidence that RippleNet was deliberately engineered to interoperate with SWIFT. The Integration Module’s SWIFT messaging interoperability and RippleNet Payment Object’s alignment with ISO 20022 pacs.008 stands as clear proof of Ripple’s technical readiness to integrate with global banking systems. While this does not signal a formal partnership, it shows Ripple’s determination to position itself as a key player in modern financial messaging.

The crypto anti-scam platform disclosed this in its August 2025 phishing report, noting a 72% increase in the amount lost compared to July. According to the report , the amount lost to phishing scams in August was $12.17 million. This represents one of the highest this year and is a sign that the activity is seeing a resurgence. In the first half of the year, losses to phishing scams reached a monthly high of $10.25 million in January and dropped to their lowest level at $2.80 million in June. August 2025 Phishing report (Source: ScamSniffer) With the losses reaching the highest level in 2025, the number of victims also reached a new yearly high. According to the data, 15,230 users were victims of phishing scams in August, a 67% jump compared to July, when it was just 9,143. It is also the first time this year that monthly victims have surpassed 10,000 users, with January having just 9,220. The biggest loss that month was a whale who lost $3.08 million on August 6 after signing a phishing transaction. The victim unknowingly approved a malicious transaction that transferred their aEthUSDT tokens to a phishing contract. Losses from three users combined account for 46% of all the amount lost in August. In one of those incidents, the user lost $1.54 million after signing an EIP-7702 phishing batch transaction. Another victim also lost around $1 million in cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens in similar circumstances. EIP-7702 batch-signature scams dominate phishing activity Meanwhile, ScamSniffer observed that August saw a surge in EIP-7702 batch signature scams, with this type of scam responsible for many of the losses in the month. Beyond accounting for two of the top three biggest monthly losses, other users also suffered the same incident. These include a victim 0x4897e losing $235,977 and 0x5ad31d losing $66,000 to batch transfers disguised as Uniswap swaps. There were several other incidents, leading security experts to identify a pattern of phishing scammers targeting addresses that upgraded to EIP-7702. EIP-7702 is an Ethereum upgrade introduced by the Pectra upgrade that allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to have smart contract capabilities. Although its goal was to improve Ethereum user experience by enabling EOAs to have temporary smart contract abilities, such as transaction batching, it has created a vulnerability for scammers to exploit. ScamSniffer said: This time attackers use batch transfers (vs previous batch approvals), routing through Uniswap Universal Router to appear legitimate. Interestingly, phishing attacks targeting the EIP-7702 have been happening since the Pectra upgrade in June, but it has increased recently, showing that bad actors are getting more adept at exploiting the vulnerability. With hackers mostly using automated sweeper attacks, they can steal any funds going into a compromised address. The concerns around the EIP-7702 vulnerability have become even more pronounced among World Liberty Financial WLFI token holders. SlowMist founder Yu Xian also observed a few days ago that bad actors are using the features to steal funds from addresses holding WLFI. He explained that scammers are gaining access to the private keys of the victims through phishing and setting up the EIP-7702 exploit mechanism for the address. This allows them to steal tokens from compromised addresses immediately once the tokens are unlocked. One user has now asked the WLFI team to implement a direct transfer option to protect addresses on the WLFI whitelist that have already been compromised. Address poisoning remains an issue Meanwhile, crypto users still have other phishing exploits to grapple with, as August is also seeing a rise in other phishing attacks. ScamSniffer observed that direct transfers to phishing contracts also increased in August. The prevalence of phishing ads might have contributed to this, with ScamSniffer noting that these malicious ads on Google Search use Google Sites to host fake DeFi interfaces. Bing even ranked phishing sites as #1 for searches for DappRadar. Interestingly, address poisoning remains a major issue for crypto users, with several victims losing funds to it. One user lost $636,559 after copying the wrong deposit address from their contaminated address. As is usually the case, the wrong and correct addresses have the same first six and last four characters. Two other users lost $500,000 and $19,000 to a similar cause.

51305025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=800872,1757192100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51305025.jpeg,Here’s Why Many Solana Supporters Are Now Diversifying Their Portfolios With High-Potential Altcoins Like Remittix,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/heres-why-many-solana-supporters-are-now-diversifying-their-portfolios-with-high-potential-altcoins-like-remittix/,"Solana’s recent strength has drawn attention, yet many holders are growing restless and seeking fresh opportunities. Remittix is capturing interest with its bold promise reinforced by a $250,000 giveaway and a Q3 wallet beta launch scheduled for September 15. That move signals a departure from mainstream Solana performance to sharper, utility-driven altcoins. As Solana maintains momentum, more of its community is pivoting to Remittix for a higher growth narrative and stronger monetization path. Solana Holds Strength but Faces Strategic Fatigue With ongoing upgrades and growing adoption, Solana continues to be a standout. The price of SOL is currently sitting at $206, having recovered from the $190 level, thanks to rising activity across DeFi platforms and NFTs. Despite this, the path to a breakout above $215 remains uncertain, raising concern over stagnation for traders craving acceleration. Smart money appears to be diversifying into assets with higher implied upside potential. This growing discomfort among Solana holders reflects a broader trend: loyalty to technical robustness, yes, but also a hunger for clearer monetization and unleashing speculative gains sooner rather than later. Remittix Stands Out Where Solana Momentum Taps Out Remittix has emerged as an alluring pivot for former Solana supporters chasing sharper returns. Solana’s upgrades and ETF outlook offer stability, yet Remittix introduces a focused PayFi utility, immediate product events and a defined growth trajectory. That contrast, with Solana delivering incremental upgrades and Remittix promising fast-moving infrastructure, makes Remittix compelling. Remittix has sold over 645 million tokens, is priced at $0.1030 and has raised upwards of $24 million. It earned its BitMart exchange listing after surpassing $20 million in funding and followed with LBANK at $22 million raised. Now, its third centralized exchange listing is in progress. That sequence offers clarity and rollout pace that Solana’s deeper ecosystem updates have not matched. Here are five reasons why Remittix draws capital that might otherwise stay with SOL: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Wallet beta launches this quarter with multi-currency support Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth These traits underline Remittix’s focus, tangible PayFi utility, vetted security, institutional-friendly tokenomics and a launch schedule that beckons faster upside. It is not just another altcoin; it is structured for adoption, not speculation. Strategic Diversification Between SOL and Remittix Solana continues to command respect for its ecosystem, performance, and institutional appeal. Yet, a growing subsection of its holders is exploring alternatives like Remittix , drawn by its roadmap, incentives and monetisation clarity. For Solana supporters seeking sharper returns without sacrificing credibility, Remittix offers an impactful option.

From presale milestones and whale moves to ETF updates and new integrations, the strongest names are rising to the top. While some coins are consolidating near support zones, others are preparing for bigger rallies fueled by major developments. These trends define what makes the top crypto coins worth tracking this year. BlockDAG, XRP, ADA, and TRX are four names commanding attention. Each brings unique progress, from record presale numbers to growing adoption, regulatory clarity, and ecosystem expansion. Here’s why they are considered among the top crypto coins shaping the current cycle. 1. BlockDAG Secures the Lead BlockDAG has cemented itself as one of the standout stories of 2025 through the scale of its presale and the speed of its adoption. Currently in Batch 30 at $0.03, the project has already raised nearly $400 million and sold more than 25.9 billion coins. Those who joined in Batch 1 at just $0.001 are now sitting on gains of about 2,900%. In the final run-up to its BDAG Deployment Event in Singapore, BlockDAG has set the presale price at $0.0013. The confirmed $0.05 launch means holders at this stage are positioned for gains as high as 38x. The growth isn’t confined to presale numbers alone. More than 3 million people are actively mining BDAG through the X1 mobile app, making it one of the most widely adopted mining tools. At the same time, the X10 hardware miners are shipping across global markets, ensuring the ecosystem expands through both digital and physical channels. Large-scale commitments add another layer of strength. Two whale entries have each crossed $4.4 million and $4.3 million, heating up competition on the leaderboard and reinforcing confidence in the project’s scale. Upcoming milestones, including a September 4 AMA and a major sponsorship reveal, are expected to keep attention firmly on BlockDAG . By merging fundraising success, wide adoption, and strong whale activity, BlockDAG has firmly secured its position as a leading name among the top crypto coins for 2025. 2. XRP Targets Higher Levels XRP is trading around $2.98 after a brief pullback, holding support at $2.89 and facing resistance near $3.08–$3.20. Analysts note a bull-flag setup that could trigger an upward breakout if resistance is cleared. Futures activity on CME has surged past $1 billion in open interest, marking the fastest growth rate for a crypto contract. Clarity from Ripple’s resolved SEC case, where XRP was confirmed not to be a security, has restored confidence across global markets. Demand in South Korea has been particularly strong, with XRP trading at ₩3.25 locally. Forecasts vary, with some calling for $4 short term and long-term outlooks pointing toward $27. With rising futures activity and regional demand, XRP is cementing its place as one of the top crypto coins to watch. 3. ADA Builds Toward ETF Catalyst Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.87, posting a small gain despite overall market consolidation. The SEC delayed its decision on the Grayscale spot Cardano ETF to October 26, 2025, which is seen as a potential game-changer for ADA’s future flows. On-chain, Cardano continues to expand, with more than 2,006 projects in development and over 1.33 million delegated wallets. Whale accumulation has also increased, with 150 million ADA purchased recently, supporting a market cap of about $32 billion. Analysts are tracking a possible breakout toward $1.20 in the near term, with longer-term projections ranging from $2 to $4.83. Key events like the Cardano Summit in Berlin this November and the launch of the Techstars + Cardano Founder Catalyst pre-accelerator in October could further strengthen its outlook. With this combination of growth and anticipation, ADA remains among the top crypto coins in 2025. 4. TRX Expands Through Stablecoin Activity TRON (TRX) is trading near $0.347, moving within a daily range of $0.3446–$0.3514. Technical signals show consolidation, with the possibility of retesting $0.330 if resistance isn’t reclaimed. A recovery above $0.345, however, could push the coin toward $0.370 or higher. Despite the chart challenges, TRX has maintained an eight-week winning streak supported by strong whale engagement and dominant stablecoin settlements. Recent data highlights TRON’s momentum: the network processed $23.5 billion in daily USDT transfers compared to Ethereum’s $20 billion. MetaMask integration has also been introduced, reducing reliance on third-party bridges and expanding access. TRON has further strengthened its security with the launch of the Beacon Network alongside TRM Labs. A governance proposal to cut transaction fees is under review, signaling continued focus on adoption. If momentum holds, forecasts suggest TRX could climb toward $0.45–$0.50, securing its role as one of the top crypto coins for 2025. Final Thoughts BlockDAG, XRP, ADA, and TRX each bring a different advantage to the table. BlockDAG is setting records with nearly $400 million raised, over 25.9 billion coins sold, and millions of active miners. XRP is leveraging legal clarity and futures activity to strengthen its global presence. ADA is anchored by developer growth and the prospect of an ETF decision, while TRX is expanding its lead in stablecoin settlements and ecosystem upgrades. Together, these names highlight what defines the top crypto coins in 2025. Whether through presale momentum, regulatory clarity, technical adoption, or payment dominance, each demonstrates how multiple paths can create lasting influence in the months ahead.

According to the announcement, this comes as the platform prepares to return to the United States. Polymarket is Bent on Setting New Records Shayne Coplan, the CEO of Polymarket, noted that the platform has also received important support from regulators. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) decided not to take action on certain reporting and recordkeeping rules for event contracts. This decision followed a formal request from QCX, a group that supports clear regulations in decentralized finance (DeFi). It is also worth noting that the CFTC’s no-action letter is important for the platform as it re-enters the U.S. market, which it had left due to regulatory issues. Last month, Polymarket users created 13,800 new markets, beating the previous record of 11,800 set in July. The rise in market creation indicates a greater demand for decentralized forecasting tools and real-money betting on real-world outcomes. Polymarket Set to Hit $1 Billion Valuation In June, the leading decentralized prediction market platform nearly raised $200 million in new funding . As reported by TheCoinRise, the investment brought the company’s total value to $1 billion, marking a major milestone in its growth. Notably, the new funding round comes when the prediction market platforms started regaining attention. Last year’s U.S. presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris brought a lot of excitement to Polymarket . Reportedly, millions of users placed bets on who would win. This new $200 million deal adds to Polymarket’s earlier funding rounds. Recall that last year, the platform also considered raising $50 million and was working on launching its own token , which users could use to settle their bets on the platform. With this deal, it means Polymarket has raised far more than one of its main competitors, Kalshi. Furthermore, Polymarket’s total funding would place it in a much stronger financial position within the prediction market space. Polymarket Strives Abroad After U.S. Regulatory Setback Polymarket enables users to predict events, ranging from politics and sports to economics and global news. The platform runs on blockchain technology, meaning all trades are secure, transparent, and peer-to-peer. However, Polymarket has had some trouble with U.S. regulators . In 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined the company $1.4 million, forcing Polymarket to shut down some of its services in the United States. Now, most of its trading volume comes from users outside the country. Meanwhile, Thailand’s cybercrime investigation bureau is also looking to ban Polymarket , citing online gambling concerns.

While ETH holdings make up the majority of his wealth, Buterin's portfolio is also supplemented by various altcoins and crypto venture investments. Buterin's known wallets hold approximately 240,000 ETH, making his wealth heavily dependent on the price of Ethereum. With the price of ETH rising above $3,000 in 2021, 2024, and 2025, Buterin re-entered the billionaire list. However, due to fluctuations in the price of ETH, his wealth has occasionally dipped below $1 billion, but has since recovered. Among his assets outside of ETH, he stands out for his investments in projects like AAVE V3 WETH, MOODENG, and WHITE tokens, as well as StarkNet. Buterin's memecoin holdings consist of tokens gifted by developers. He also acquired half of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) supply from the developer in 2020, which at one point led to his fortune reaching $20 billion. Buterin has burned or donated most of these tokens. Buterin's wealth was shaped by his share of Ethereum's founding. A 16.5% stake was distributed to the founders during the 2014 ETH presale. Buterin's share of this share has helped him grow his crypto holdings. As the only founder to remain active in the project since Ethereum's official launch in 2015, he has played a critical role in the network's development.

While his stake in companies like StarkWare remains unclear, his contributions to leading projects in the industry are contributing to his net worth. As of today, Vitalik Buterin is the largest individual ETH holder on Ethereum. Wallets holding larger amounts of ETH are primarily controlled by exchanges and institutional funds. Buterin entered the crypto world in 2011 and paved the way for decentralized applications with the Ethereum Whitepaper he published in 2013. Ethereum's transition to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system in 2022 also took place under his leadership. *This is not investment advice.

This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that has already blown past $1.8 million in its presale. Analysts are whispering about 70x gains by 2025. Could this be the next big crypto to truly shake things up, offering genuine utility where many meme tokens just offer hype? Layer Brett is the best-looking crypto for the future Forget the struggles that some significant cap altcoins, like SOL and PI, face. Layer Brett offers something genuinely different. We’re talking about lightning-fast transactions, often clocked at 10,000 TPS, with gas fees that drop to an almost unbelievable $0.0001. That kind of performance is a game-changer. For those weary of high Ethereum gas fees or the congestion seen on other chains, this Layer 2 blockchain is an absolute breath of fresh air. It’s also offering a mind-boggling 917% APY on staking. No wonder investors are flocking to this best crypto presale. Layer Brett is a next-generation memecoin, yes, but one fused with real blockchain utility, built directly on Ethereum’s Layer 2. Picture the vibrant energy of meme culture meeting the serious power of scalability. It’s Brett, but evolved, escaping the limitations of its original Base chain. This project aims to disrupt the entire meme token landscape. The magic happens through its Layer 2 architecture, which allows Layer Brett to process activity off-chain while still drawing on Ethereum’s rock-solid security. This means transactions are nearly instantaneous and incredibly inexpensive. Users can jump in, buy, and stake $LBRETT in mere seconds using ETH, USDT, or BNB through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Plus, those early staking rewards? They are amplified due to the lower operating costs that this efficient Layer 2 crypto provides. It’s a sweet deal for early birds seeking a top-performing crypto. Solana price and Pi Network price prediction general SOL (Solana) burst onto the scene, promising speed and low transaction costs, aiming to rival Ethereum. It’s a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, hosting a vast array of DeFi and NFT projects. Pi Network, on the other hand, is a more enigmatic project. It attempts to allow everyday users to “mine” cryptocurrency on their phones, though its mainnet launch and practical utility remain topics of intense debate and speculation. The Solana price has experienced its share of volatility, while the Pi Network continues to expand its community. While the Solana price has shown resilience, it, like many altcoins, faces market headwinds and occasionally experiences trading volume dips. The Pi Network price prediction remains theoretical, mainly due to its unlaunched mainnet and limited practical application. Both SOL and PI are established in their own ways, but they don’t offer the fresh, hyper-incentivized opportunity Layer Brett presents. Investors often seek out new crypto coins with explosive growth potential when larger projects consolidate. Layer Brett is the future With its unique blend of meme power and robust Ethereum Layer 2 technology, Layer Brett is positioned for truly significant growth. The current presale price, coupled with that jaw-dropping 917% APY staking, suggests immense upside. $LBRETT could easily be a next 100x altcoin, even a next 100x meme coin, during the upcoming crypto bull run in 2025. It has a much smaller market cap than SOL or PI, creating a wider runway for astronomical gains. This is why it’s considered the best long-term crypto by many discerning investors right now. Get ready to connect your wallet, buy $LBRETT, and stake for those eye-watering rewards. This is the best crypto to buy now, and it won’t be in presale forever.

However, the premier cryptocurrency’s progress hit a stumbling block following the release of weaker-than-expected United States payrolls data on Friday, September 5. Despite the bearish pressure triggered by the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) release, the price of Bitcoin managed to stay above the psychological $110,000 level. Interestingly, the latest analysis suggests that the latest job data could guide the Bitcoin price to a new high. Macro Shift To Kickstart Next BTC Price Rally? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analysis firm XWIN Research Japan explained how weak labor data in the US could see the Bitcoin price embark on its next bullish wave. According to the analytics firm, history shows a paradox despite rising unemployment often linked to weak performances by risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Nears Its Climax: Cycle Peak Indicates 95% Completion XWIN mentioned that on-chain stablecoin data offers insight into how this “macro story” could unfold, especially in relation to the cryptocurrency market. The crypto trading firm then highlighted two “distinct waves of activity” that establish the connection between unemployment and crypto market positioning. In the first wave (between late 2024 and early 2025), investors expected the Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut interest rates as the labor market weakness first emerged. Capital flowed into exchanges with the surge in stablecoin reserves from $30 billion to $50 billion, showing the investors’ preparedness for a macroeconomic shift. The second wave (from mid-2025 to present) has seen unemployment rising again. Similarly, stablecoin exchange reserves recently hit $58.5 billion, while depositing addresses have frequently surpassed 30,000 BTC, with highs near 40,000 BTC. “This isn’t just accumulation—it reflects broader participation, from whales to retail, mobilizing funds in anticipation of easier policy,” XWIN added. According to XWIN, the thinking is that the rising unemployment in the United States could be linked to stronger expectations of Fed rate cuts. With more capital stored in stablecoins on exchanges, ready to buy more coins, the weak jobs data could be the foundation for a fresh rally for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $110,780, reflecting no significant changes in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader is up by almost 3% in the last seven days.

Imagine a world where AI doesn’t just generate text or images, but resurrects lost cinematic masterpieces, challenging our very understanding of authorship and intellectual property. This isn’t a scene from a sci-fi film; it’s the audacious reality unfolding with Fable, an Amazon-backed AI startup, and its controversial plan to digitally reconstruct Orson Welles’ ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’. For anyone tracking the intersection of technology and creative industries, especially within the crypto and digital asset space, this development raises profound questions about ownership, authenticity, and the very soul of art in the age of advanced AI filmmaking . What is Fable AI and Its Ambitious Vision? On the surface, Fable AI presents itself as a pioneering force, often dubbed the ‘Netflix of AI.’ This ambitious startup, which recently secured significant funding from the Amazon Alexa Fund , aims to democratize content creation through artificial intelligence. Their core platform empowers users to craft their own animated stories using intuitive AI prompts, effectively putting a virtual animation studio at their fingertips. While currently focusing on its own intellectual property, Fable has openly expressed aspirations to extend these capabilities to established Hollywood IP, a move that has already seen it used to generate unauthorized ‘South Park’ episodes. The company’s latest innovation is a powerful new Generative AI model designed to produce long, complex narratives. This is where the story takes an intriguing turn, moving from cartoon creation to the ambitious task of cinematic resurrection. Fable’s technological prowess lies in its ability to understand and extend storylines, generate characters, and even simulate visual styles, making it a formidable player in the emerging field of AI-driven content creation. The Audacious Plan: Resurrecting Orson Welles’ ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ The specific project causing a stir involves filmmaker Brian Rose, who has already dedicated five years to digitally reconstructing the lost 43 minutes of Orson Welles ‘ 1942 classic, ‘The Magnificent Ambersons.’ Rose now plans to leverage Fable’s advanced AI model over the next two years to complete this digital resurrection. But why ‘Ambersons’? For many, it might seem like an obscure choice, overshadowed by Welles’ more famous work, ‘Citizen Kane.’ However, among cinephiles, ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ holds a special, tragic place as a lost masterpiece, severely truncated and altered by the studio after Welles was removed from the project. The film’s reputation as a ‘what could have been’ fuels the fascination. It’s a testament to Welles’ genius, even in its compromised form, and the destruction of his original vision remains a poignant moment in film history. Rose, in his statement, lamented the loss of a ‘four-minute-long, unbroken moving camera shot whose loss is a tragedy,’ with only 50 seconds remaining in the studio-recut version. This sense of profound loss is presumably what drew Fable and Rose to this particular project, seeing it as an ultimate test of AI filmmaking ‘s potential. Ethical Minefield: The Orson Welles Estate and Intellectual Property in Generative AI Herein lies the project’s most significant controversy: Fable has not obtained the rights to ‘The Magnificent Ambersons,’ nor has it consulted with the estate of Orson Welles . This omission has drawn sharp criticism from David Reeder, who manages the estate for Welles’ daughter, Beatrice. Reeder vehemently described the project as an ‘attempt to generate publicity on the back of Welles’ creative genius,’ asserting that it would amount to nothing more than ‘a purely mechanical exercise without any of the uniquely innovative thinking [of] a creative force like Welles.’ The estate’s reaction highlights a critical dilemma in the age of Generative AI : the clash between technological capability and artistic rights. While Reeder expressed less anger over the idea of recreation itself, he was deeply offended by the lack of ‘even the courtesy of a heads up.’ Interestingly, the estate itself has ’embraced AI technology to create a voice model intended to be used for VO work with brands,’ indicating a pragmatic openness to AI when handled respectfully and with proper authorization. This distinction is crucial: the estate acknowledges AI’s potential but insists on ethical engagement and proper compensation. The situation with Fable and the Welles estate underscores the urgent need for clear guidelines and legal frameworks governing the use of AI in creative endeavors, particularly concerning existing intellectual property. Without such frameworks, the line between innovation and infringement becomes dangerously blurred, setting a precedent that could destabilize entire creative industries. AI Filmmaking: A Double-Edged Sword for Creativity The Fable project forces us to confront the profound implications of AI filmmaking . On one hand, the technology offers tantalizing possibilities: Reviving Lost Works: The potential to reconstruct films, music, or literature lost to time or censorship. Democratizing Creation: Lowering barriers for aspiring filmmakers and artists to create complex narratives. New Storytelling Forms: Enabling interactive or dynamically generated content that adapts to viewers. However, the challenges and ethical quandaries are equally significant: Authenticity vs. Recreation: Can an AI truly recreate an artist’s vision, or does it merely produce a convincing imitation? The author of the original article aptly notes, ‘this is a tragedy that AI cannot undo.’ Artistic Intent: Without the original creator’s guidance, how can AI accurately interpret and extend their artistic intent? Intellectual Property: The Fable case exemplifies the legal quagmire when AI operates without proper rights, raising questions of ownership and fair use. The ‘Frankenstein’ Effect: As the original piece points out, using AI to swap faces onto new actors creates ‘Frankensteined replicas,’ which might lack the soul of the original performances. Historically, filmmakers have attempted to ‘fix’ or finish Welles’ movies, but these efforts typically involved using footage he himself had shot. Fable’s approach, described as a hybrid of AI and traditional filmmaking (reshooting scenes with contemporary actors and then face-swapping), goes a step further, entering entirely new territory. It’s a fascinating technical demonstration, but as Reeder suggests, it risks being ‘a purely mechanical exercise’ divorced from the human genius that defined Welles’ work. Beyond Hollywood: Generative AI’s Impact on Digital Assets and Events like Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 The debate surrounding Fable AI extends far beyond the confines of Hollywood, resonating deeply within the broader tech and digital asset communities. The innovations in Generative AI are not just about film; they are reshaping how we perceive digital ownership, content creation, and even the value of unique artistic expressions. Events like Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 serve as crucial platforms where such cutting-edge developments are dissected and discussed by industry heavyweights. Imagine the insights from leaders at Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, and Elad Gil, all slated to speak at Disrupt 2025. Their discussions will undoubtedly touch upon how AI is transforming media, investment, and the very fabric of startup growth. For those immersed in cryptocurrency and blockchain, the Fable scenario offers a preview of challenges related to provenance and intellectual property that Web3 technologies aim to address. How will NFTs and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) play a role in authenticating and compensating creators for AI-generated or AI-assisted works in the future? The 20th anniversary of Bitcoin World Disrupt promises to be a melting pot of ideas, where the future of tech, including AI’s role in creative industries and its intersection with digital assets, will be sharply defined. Learning from these top voices is crucial for anyone looking to sharpen their edge in this rapidly evolving landscape. Don’t miss the opportunity to gain insights into how technologies like Generative AI are shaping not just entertainment, but the entire digital economy. The Future of Storytelling: Who Owns the Narrative? Ultimately, Fable’s ambitious project with Orson Welles ‘ ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ is more than just a tech demo; it’s a litmus test for the future of creative industries. It forces us to ask fundamental questions about the nature of art, the rights of creators, and the role of technology. While filmmaker Brian Rose seems genuinely motivated by a desire to honor Welles’ vision, the path chosen – without rights or estate consultation – undermines that very intention. The promise of AI filmmaking is immense, offering unprecedented tools for creativity and preservation. However, its ethical implementation will define its true legacy. If AI is to truly serve art, it must do so with respect for authorship, intellectual property, and the human element that imbues art with its profound meaning. Otherwise, we risk creating technically perfect but emotionally hollow imitations, forever chasing a ghost that technology, for all its power, cannot truly bring back.

This comes as the overall crypto market is uncertain and investors are unsure about where DOGE might go next. Because of this, investors are shifting their interest towards upcoming protocols in DeFi such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an up-and-coming player valued at $0.035. MUTM is in the sixth presale level and missing an entry here will mean paying 14.28% more when phase 7 comes along. Over $15.45 million has been raised so far and the project has already registered over 16,100 investors. As liquidity flows and risk-on capital seek utility-oriented applications, the focus is quietly shifting off the better-known names such as Dogecoin and onto emerging DeFi coins, possibly paving the way to a new phase of decentralized finance development. Dogecoin Liquefies as Wider Market Swings Play out Dogecoin price has slipped over the last week, now just above $0.20. DOGE has seen mild price swings over the last 24h. This recent dip is part of a broader change in market sentiment and is influenced by technical factors such as resistance levels and low activity from large investors. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is getting a lot of attention in this changing market. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is allowing investors to buy in cheap while the project is still in its early stage. It is currently priced at $0.035, but will go higher to $0.04 in an upcoming phase 7 of token sale. There is also a very high interest in investment and the amount of funds raised has surpassed $15.45 million and the number of individuals holding tokens has surpassed over 16,100. This makes MUTM one of the most qualified within the market of DeFi. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program As the presale progresses, MUTM has launched a new initiative where, users of the project can share in a $50,000 USDT pool for identifying bugs within the platform. The $50k reward will cover four different weak areas. These include: critical, major, minor, and low. The initiative is already live and anyone can participate. Dual-Lending, Bending The dual-lending frame of the project is a hybrid of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Since P2C is actively studying the market environment to pay interest, one can borrow at a reasonable rate and guarantee that the investors can be paid interest through smart contracts. P2P offers direct lending and borrowing without an intermediary and is highly decentralized, a feature particularly useful to risky assets such as meme coins. Infrastructure and Price Discovery The project relies on Chainlink to obtain the correct price in the market and ties it to the price of USD and tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Other tools such as fallback oracles, aggregated feeds and in-chain metrics can assist in offering reliable and timely prices to manage collateral and undertake liquidations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has grown into a key player this cycle. Expert analysis show DOGE could soon slip below $0.20 as bears take control. Buying MUTM today means getting into the project at the lowest price it will ever be, while waiting until the next phase, means buying in over 14% higher. The project has already collected more than $15.45M and received 16,100+ investors, which indicates a good movement. MUTM is utility-oriented with a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and powerful oracle-driven price discovery. Stage 6 price is currently lower than it will be after the additional presale.

51307133,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=177732,1757196007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51307133.jpeg,"Why Bitcoin, ADA and LINK Are Called “Digital Blue Chips” by Fund Managers",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-bitcoin-ada-and-link-are-called-digital-blue-chips-by-fund-managers/,"Traditional finance has long had the concept of “blue chip” stocks — stable, established companies with a track record of performance. In 2025, fund managers are increasingly applying that same label to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK) are now frequently described as “digital blue chips,” reflecting their maturity, utility, and resilience across multiple cycles. Analysts argue that this recognition is a sign of how far crypto has come, moving from speculative fringe to mainstream allocation. Alongside these established assets, discussions also touch on cultural-driven plays with unusual credibility, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is drawing early interest as a high-beta complement to the blue chip core. Bitcoin: the foundation of digital finance Bitcoin remains the most secure, recognized, and widely adopted cryptocurrency. With ETF inflows surpassing $20 billion in 2025 and adoption growing among sovereign wealth funds, its role as “digital gold” is cemented. Its scarcity and decentralization make it the anchor of every institutional crypto portfolio. While its multiples may be smaller than in early cycles, its reliability and recognition make it the quintessential blue chip. ADA: governance and sustainability Cardano has emerged as a long-term project with an emphasis on research and governance. Its Voltaire upgrade is introducing on-chain voting and treasury management, giving ADA holders direct influence over the network’s future. This governance-first approach appeals to institutions looking for projects that can withstand regulatory scrutiny. Cardano’s steady growth and commitment to sustainability strengthen its claim as a digital blue chip alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. LINK: the oracle powerhouse Chainlink’s role as the leading decentralized oracle network makes it indispensable for DeFi and beyond. By connecting blockchains to real-world data, LINK powers smart contracts in finance, insurance, and supply chains. With institutional partnerships expanding and more networks integrating its services, Chainlink has cemented its reputation as critical infrastructure. Fund managers now see LINK as one of the safest bets among altcoins, given its unique and defensible use case. Fund managers are quick to point out that portfolios often balance stability with growth. While Bitcoin, ADA, and LINK represent the “blue chip” core, analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most aggressive high-beta plays of 2025 . Passed audits from CertiK and HashEx add a level of credibility rare in cultural-driven tokens. Combined with its deflationary tokenomics and surging community growth , forecasts call for up to 55x upside before major listings . The PATRIOT50X bonus code has also amplified demand, giving early adopters a 50% boost in allocations. Analysts argue this mix of credibility and hype makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a perfect complement to digital blue chips: while the core provides resilience, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers asymmetric upside that can transform portfolio returns. Why fund managers mix core and growth In traditional investing, blue chips anchor portfolios, while growth stocks provide potential for higher returns. The same principle is increasingly applied to crypto. Bitcoin, ADA, and LINK deliver security and trust, while projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE bring innovation and volatility. Fund managers stress that the combination allows them to manage risk while staying positioned for exponential growth if emerging narratives explode. Conclusion Bitcoin, ADA, and LINK have earned their reputations as digital blue chips, cementing their place in institutional portfolios. Yet, even the most conservative managers recognize the need for higher-beta assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its rare mix of audits, scarcity, and cultural firepower, is being framed as that complement – the growth play to balance the blue chip core. For investors, combining both strategies could define success in the next market cycle.

With ETF demand absorbing new supply and miners selling less post-halving, traders are mapping the next major target at $135k . If spot ETF inflows remain positive and macro data stays friendly, that level becomes a reasonable stretch before the cycle cools. Dogecoin, meanwhile, is holding a broad range near the $0.20 zone while liquidity improves. The community’s long-standing $1 goal is back in conversation as on-chain activity rises and derivatives funding normalizes. Historically, DOGE’s biggest moves have arrived late in bull phases, which is why some traders are preparing for a momentum push if Bitcoin breaks into new highs again. As capital looks for higher multiples beyond large caps, attention is turning to smaller, earlier-stage plays that could deliver outsized returns. That’s where a growing number of retail traders and some crypto funds say they’re hunting for asymmetric upside. Bitcoin’s Route to $135k For BTC, the setup is simple: steady ETF inflows, thinning exchange balances, and resilient risk appetite. A weekly close above the recent local high would open room toward the mid-$120k area; from there, momentum and positive funding could carry price into the $135k magnet. Key risks are a hot inflation print or risk-off equities, either of which could stall the move and force a retest toward the low-$100k band. Can Dogecoin Really Reach $1? DOGE tends to run when retail participation spikes. If Bitcoin refreshes all-time highs, liquidity usually spills into high-beta names. A clean break above $0.30 would strengthen the argument for a stair-step advance toward $0.50 and, in a euphoric tape, a shot at $1. The bear case remains a failure to clear resistance with volumes fading, which would keep the range intact. The MAGACOIN FINANCE angle Early-stage capital is also chasing what they see as the cycle’s next breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been drawing that crowd with a mix of scarcity and utility: limited early allocations, simple tokenomics, and a roadmap built around expanding real-world use. Community growth has accelerated, and multiple rounds have filled fast. The combined pitch is clear: early access is limited , the community is swelling, and upside projections from supporters point to potential 45x-style returns if adoption keeps building. In plain terms, some investors believe a small stake today could scale meaningfully if the project lands its next milestones. What Could Keep BTC and DOGE Moving Macro remains the biggest tailwind – cooling inflation and easier liquidity keep risk assets bid. On the crypto side, product expansion matters: more brokerages adding ETFs, new payments integrations, and healthy derivatives structure (no overheated funding) all help. Watch for sustained ETF net inflows, rising stablecoin supplies, and higher spot volumes; that trio has preceded most major legs up this cycle. Bottom Line Bitcoin has a credible path toward $135k if inflows stay firm, and Dogecoin’s $1 dream lives on whenever liquidity rotates to high-beta. At the same time, investors chasing bigger multiples are scanning earlier-stage opportunities in the middle of the market – where MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a talking point thanks to its fast-filling rounds, expanding community, and limited early access with high-upside potential .
