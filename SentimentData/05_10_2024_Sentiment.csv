According to CoinGecko, RENDER fell by nearly 13% since last week, putting into perspective the bearishness that overcame the market’s bulls in the start of October. Related Reading: Is Crypto Losing Steam? Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024 Although the market fell by a small margin, it caused a massive liquidations of both long and short positions holding the token. For Render, “Uptober” might come later this month as the token recovers lost ground against the bears. However, on-chain developments continue to come for one of the most well-known decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) protocol. Render Displays September Achievements September for Render is incredibly bullish in terms of developments, one of the most notable is their support for Redshift, Mavon’s in-house 3D renderer. The tool itself has features that would heavily leverage Render’s decentralized compute niche that artists use in their workflow. With the coin already supporting the platform’s C4D file support of Mavon’s Cinema 4D, users of Redshift should not expect a hitch in using the integration. https://t.co/cSZk9wpIaK — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) October 1, 2024 Annabele Siconolfi, a 3D artist that tried Redshift integration on the platform, estimates the time saved in a recent render job by over 70-80 hours. The Render Network’s X account has also grown by 100%; from 100k to 200k. Render’s X account is one of the ways the platform can engage with the community, further enhancing its connection with the users of Render. https://t.co/SLedMsVO7X — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) September 30, 2024 Community engagement is important for decentralized networks as it helps with including the community in the decision making process. With this huge jump in community following, trust and belief on Render’s worth might have improved over the past month. RENDER Breaks $5.3 – Can It Continue Its Trajectory? At its current pace, RENDER bulls have broken through the $5.3 resistance– flipping it to support– after a brief breakthrough by the bears in the short term. As RENDER tries to settle above its current support level, the token might have enough momentum to continue its current trajectory. Related Reading: What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number However, the relative strength index (RSI) of the token is entering a possible bearish reversal zone that might support bearish movement in the medium term. If this occurs, RENDER’s position will be compromised with a possible return to $4.9 in the short term. If the bulls continue to wrestle for control of RENDER’s momentum, the token will stabilize on $5.3 in the short to medium term before the bulls can move upward, possibly targeting $6.3 in the long-term.

Admittedly, meme coins have been dominating headlines, especially on Solana. From MooDeng to Bonk and Pepe, traders are on the lookout. Meme Coin Trader Misses A $25 Million Payout In the past week, eyes have been on Sui Network, a modern blockchain that claims to process over 50,000 transactions every second (TPS) and is faster than Solana. The spike in activity results from the success of what’s arguably one of the largest meme coins in its ecosystem. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Jumps 11% Following Acquisition Of Japanese Blockchain Developer HashPallette After launching nearly six days ago, Sudeng (HIPPO) is on fire, posting impressive higher highs. The surge over this time has pushed HIPPO’s market cap and, thus liquidity, higher, looking at swaps at Sui Network‘s decentralized exchange, Cetus 4. Changing hands at over $0.010 means traders who got in early, choosing to HODL on and not getting concerned with the sell-off across major markets like Bitcoin could be neck-dip in profits. According to trackers, one meme coin trader is regretting after exiting early, dumping HIPPO for a small profit. On launch, the trader sold 258 SUI, worth around $433, for 1.8 billion HIPPO. This is nearly 20% of the total supply standing at 10 billion. However, the trader chose to sell all this stash for 6,299 SUI days later, racking in nearly $11,000. The problem is, if the trader had chosen to wait, even for another 36 hours, it would have turned out to be major gains. As of October 4, the 1.8 billion HIPPO, is now worth over $25 million. The premature decision to sell is proving costly and is a missed opportunity. All the same, the trader shouldn’t be blamed. The $11,000 earned represents a more than 200X gain. Moreover, even if the trader would have held on, becoming a diamond hand and waiting for prices to rally, it would have been tough for the trader to exit all at once. HIPPO Concentration A Concern: Will The Sudeng Pump? HIPPO is not very liquid, and looking at ownership from SuiScan, one address controls over 7.6 billion tokens, which is more than 76% of the total supply. If the trader held on, the address would be the second largest. Any attempt to sell would force prices lower, triggering panic as other holders scramble to the exits. Related Reading: XRP Crashes 14% As Whales Send Deposits To Exchanges Currently, traders will be closely monitoring how HIPPO performs. As a meme coin, much depends on hype and whether there is a fear of missing out (FOMO). If that’s the case, the meme coin will float higher, outperforming SUI, which is also relatively firm.

Posting on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst focused on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, an important metric in the Bitcoin market. According to tugbachain, the MVRV ratio shows a historical downward trend. Should this trend continue or get breached, it may lead to a major impact on Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s NVT Cross Signals a Local Top – Is a Major Correction Looming? MVRV Ratio And Its Impending Impact On Bitcoin The MVRV ratio, as explained by tugbachain, is a tool used to gauge whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued. This ratio is calculated by comparing the market value to the realized value of Bitcoin, providing insights into investor behavior and market trends. The analyst highlighted that the MVRV has proven useful in identifying market tops, bottoms, and notable peaks and troughs over the years. The MVRV ratio has historically demonstrated three major Bitcoin halving cycles, each marked by unique price behavior and investor sentiment. The current ratio sits around 1.9, with significant support noted at 1.75. The question raised by tugbachain is whether breaking the downtrend could lead to a rise in the MVRV ratio to the 4-6 range, which has historically signaled a Bitcoin peak. The analyst wrote in the post: Currently, the MVRV ratio shows a historical downtrend with significant support at 1.75. With the ratio now sitting at 1.9, the question arises: if it breaks the downtrend and reverses the downtrend, could it once again climb to the 4-6 range, marking a Bitcoin peak as seen in previous cycles? BTC Market Performance And Technical Outlook Bitcoin has seen heightened price activity in recent weeks in the broader market context. The asset rallied above $66,000 last week, sparking enthusiasm in the crypto community with hopes for a bullish October, playfully termed “Uptober.” However, this upward momentum was short-lived, as BTC experienced a notable price correction soon after. Within the past week alone, Bitcoin has seen a decline of around 7.2%, falling to a trading price of $61,496 at the time of writing. Despite this correction, BTC has rebounded slightly, posting a modest 1.9% gain over the past 24 hours. Aside from tugbachain’s analysis, other crypto market analysts have provided additional perspectives on the MVRV ratio’s implications for BTC. Ali, a prominent analyst on the social media platform X, has pointed out that the MVRV ratio’s behavior since May has notably impacted Bitcoin’s price movements. Related Reading: Here Is Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Hasn’t Started, According To Analyst Ali observed that each rejection of the MVRV ratio from its 90-day average has historically led to a significant correction in Bitcoin’s price. According to Ali, the latest rejection has already resulted in a 10% drop, suggesting the possibility of further downside pressure.

Among those closely monitoring the price action in anticipation of an uptrend is a well-known analyst on the social media platform X. This analyst, who goes by the name Ash Crypto, recently highlighted a striking similarity between Bitcoin’s current price behavior and a notable pattern observed earlier in 2023. Ash Crypto pointed to Bitcoin’s decline in early October 2023, which ultimately reversed into a multi-month rally to its current all-time high. Explaining The Similar Price Action October 2023 was the turning point for the price of Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies. It was during this month that the crypto industry finally broke out of a lengthy bear cycle, with Bitcoin heralding the charge toward renewed optimism and significant price gains. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally For the first time since January, Bitcoin’s market capitalization surged by an impressive 28.52%, sparking a shift in market dynamics that rippled throughout the industry. Although altcoins followed a similar upward trajectory, their gains were modest compared to Bitcoin. However, their collective impact was able to push the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization past the $1.25 trillion mark for the first time since May 2022. However, while October 2023 was the start of the new bull cycle, what most investors don’t know or have forgotten is that the month started on a negative note. As Ash Crypto pointed out, the price of Bitcoin dropped by 7.5% in the first week of October 2023. According to the BTC/USD price chart, this decline saw the price of Bitcoin fall below $26,500. However, it soon rebounded from this point. By the end of October 2023, Bitcoin had rallied to close the month at over $35,000, representing a remarkable 33% increase from the month’s low. Fast forward to October 2024, and it appears that Bitcoin is once again repeating its pattern from the previous year. At the start of the month, Bitcoin was trading just below $64,000, a strong position given its recent bullish trends. However, in a movement similar to October 2023, the cryptocurrency experienced another sharp decline, this time dropping by 6.5% within the first three days. Notably, the price briefly touched $60,750 during this period. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? If history were to repeat itself in full, Bitcoin could maybe or maybe not drop a little bit more before rebounding to the upside. According to Ash Crypto’s projection, a similar 33% surge would see Bitcoin shooting above its current all-time high, with a monthly close right in the middle of $75,000 and $76,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has recovered a bit and is now trading at $61,580. Despite this early setback, many bullish investors are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin in anticipation of Uptober coming to fruition.
