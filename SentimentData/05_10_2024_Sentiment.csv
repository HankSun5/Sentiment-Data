According to CoinGecko, RENDER fell by nearly 13% since last week, putting into perspective the bearishness that overcame the market’s bulls in the start of October. Related Reading: Is Crypto Losing Steam? Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024 Although the market fell by a small margin, it caused a massive liquidations of both long and short positions holding the token. For Render, “Uptober” might come later this month as the token recovers lost ground against the bears. However, on-chain developments continue to come for one of the most well-known decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) protocol. Render Displays September Achievements September for Render is incredibly bullish in terms of developments, one of the most notable is their support for Redshift, Mavon’s in-house 3D renderer. The tool itself has features that would heavily leverage Render’s decentralized compute niche that artists use in their workflow. With the coin already supporting the platform’s C4D file support of Mavon’s Cinema 4D, users of Redshift should not expect a hitch in using the integration. https://t.co/cSZk9wpIaK — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) October 1, 2024 Annabele Siconolfi, a 3D artist that tried Redshift integration on the platform, estimates the time saved in a recent render job by over 70-80 hours. The Render Network’s X account has also grown by 100%; from 100k to 200k. Render’s X account is one of the ways the platform can engage with the community, further enhancing its connection with the users of Render. https://t.co/SLedMsVO7X — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) September 30, 2024 Community engagement is important for decentralized networks as it helps with including the community in the decision making process. With this huge jump in community following, trust and belief on Render’s worth might have improved over the past month. RENDER Breaks $5.3 – Can It Continue Its Trajectory? At its current pace, RENDER bulls have broken through the $5.3 resistance– flipping it to support– after a brief breakthrough by the bears in the short term. As RENDER tries to settle above its current support level, the token might have enough momentum to continue its current trajectory. Related Reading: What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number However, the relative strength index (RSI) of the token is entering a possible bearish reversal zone that might support bearish movement in the medium term. If this occurs, RENDER’s position will be compromised with a possible return to $4.9 in the short term. If the bulls continue to wrestle for control of RENDER’s momentum, the token will stabilize on $5.3 in the short to medium term before the bulls can move upward, possibly targeting $6.3 in the long-term.

Admittedly, meme coins have been dominating headlines, especially on Solana. From MooDeng to Bonk and Pepe, traders are on the lookout. Meme Coin Trader Misses A $25 Million Payout In the past week, eyes have been on Sui Network, a modern blockchain that claims to process over 50,000 transactions every second (TPS) and is faster than Solana. The spike in activity results from the success of what’s arguably one of the largest meme coins in its ecosystem. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Jumps 11% Following Acquisition Of Japanese Blockchain Developer HashPallette After launching nearly six days ago, Sudeng (HIPPO) is on fire, posting impressive higher highs. The surge over this time has pushed HIPPO’s market cap and, thus liquidity, higher, looking at swaps at Sui Network‘s decentralized exchange, Cetus 4. Changing hands at over $0.010 means traders who got in early, choosing to HODL on and not getting concerned with the sell-off across major markets like Bitcoin could be neck-dip in profits. According to trackers, one meme coin trader is regretting after exiting early, dumping HIPPO for a small profit. On launch, the trader sold 258 SUI, worth around $433, for 1.8 billion HIPPO. This is nearly 20% of the total supply standing at 10 billion. However, the trader chose to sell all this stash for 6,299 SUI days later, racking in nearly $11,000. The problem is, if the trader had chosen to wait, even for another 36 hours, it would have turned out to be major gains. As of October 4, the 1.8 billion HIPPO, is now worth over $25 million. The premature decision to sell is proving costly and is a missed opportunity. All the same, the trader shouldn’t be blamed. The $11,000 earned represents a more than 200X gain. Moreover, even if the trader would have held on, becoming a diamond hand and waiting for prices to rally, it would have been tough for the trader to exit all at once. HIPPO Concentration A Concern: Will The Sudeng Pump? HIPPO is not very liquid, and looking at ownership from SuiScan, one address controls over 7.6 billion tokens, which is more than 76% of the total supply. If the trader held on, the address would be the second largest. Any attempt to sell would force prices lower, triggering panic as other holders scramble to the exits. Related Reading: XRP Crashes 14% As Whales Send Deposits To Exchanges Currently, traders will be closely monitoring how HIPPO performs. As a meme coin, much depends on hype and whether there is a fear of missing out (FOMO). If that’s the case, the meme coin will float higher, outperforming SUI, which is also relatively firm.
