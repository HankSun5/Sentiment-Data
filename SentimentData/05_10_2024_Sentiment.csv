According to CoinGecko, RENDER fell by nearly 13% since last week, putting into perspective the bearishness that overcame the market’s bulls in the start of October. Related Reading: Is Crypto Losing Steam? Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024 Although the market fell by a small margin, it caused a massive liquidations of both long and short positions holding the token. For Render, “Uptober” might come later this month as the token recovers lost ground against the bears. However, on-chain developments continue to come for one of the most well-known decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) protocol. Render Displays September Achievements September for Render is incredibly bullish in terms of developments, one of the most notable is their support for Redshift, Mavon’s in-house 3D renderer. The tool itself has features that would heavily leverage Render’s decentralized compute niche that artists use in their workflow. With the coin already supporting the platform’s C4D file support of Mavon’s Cinema 4D, users of Redshift should not expect a hitch in using the integration. https://t.co/cSZk9wpIaK — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) October 1, 2024 Annabele Siconolfi, a 3D artist that tried Redshift integration on the platform, estimates the time saved in a recent render job by over 70-80 hours. The Render Network’s X account has also grown by 100%; from 100k to 200k. Render’s X account is one of the ways the platform can engage with the community, further enhancing its connection with the users of Render. https://t.co/SLedMsVO7X — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) September 30, 2024 Community engagement is important for decentralized networks as it helps with including the community in the decision making process. With this huge jump in community following, trust and belief on Render’s worth might have improved over the past month. RENDER Breaks $5.3 – Can It Continue Its Trajectory? At its current pace, RENDER bulls have broken through the $5.3 resistance– flipping it to support– after a brief breakthrough by the bears in the short term. As RENDER tries to settle above its current support level, the token might have enough momentum to continue its current trajectory. Related Reading: What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number However, the relative strength index (RSI) of the token is entering a possible bearish reversal zone that might support bearish movement in the medium term. If this occurs, RENDER’s position will be compromised with a possible return to $4.9 in the short term. If the bulls continue to wrestle for control of RENDER’s momentum, the token will stabilize on $5.3 in the short to medium term before the bulls can move upward, possibly targeting $6.3 in the long-term.

Admittedly, meme coins have been dominating headlines, especially on Solana. From MooDeng to Bonk and Pepe, traders are on the lookout. Meme Coin Trader Misses A $25 Million Payout In the past week, eyes have been on Sui Network, a modern blockchain that claims to process over 50,000 transactions every second (TPS) and is faster than Solana. The spike in activity results from the success of what’s arguably one of the largest meme coins in its ecosystem. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Jumps 11% Following Acquisition Of Japanese Blockchain Developer HashPallette After launching nearly six days ago, Sudeng (HIPPO) is on fire, posting impressive higher highs. The surge over this time has pushed HIPPO’s market cap and, thus liquidity, higher, looking at swaps at Sui Network‘s decentralized exchange, Cetus 4. Changing hands at over $0.010 means traders who got in early, choosing to HODL on and not getting concerned with the sell-off across major markets like Bitcoin could be neck-dip in profits. According to trackers, one meme coin trader is regretting after exiting early, dumping HIPPO for a small profit. On launch, the trader sold 258 SUI, worth around $433, for 1.8 billion HIPPO. This is nearly 20% of the total supply standing at 10 billion. However, the trader chose to sell all this stash for 6,299 SUI days later, racking in nearly $11,000. The problem is, if the trader had chosen to wait, even for another 36 hours, it would have turned out to be major gains. As of October 4, the 1.8 billion HIPPO, is now worth over $25 million. The premature decision to sell is proving costly and is a missed opportunity. All the same, the trader shouldn’t be blamed. The $11,000 earned represents a more than 200X gain. Moreover, even if the trader would have held on, becoming a diamond hand and waiting for prices to rally, it would have been tough for the trader to exit all at once. HIPPO Concentration A Concern: Will The Sudeng Pump? HIPPO is not very liquid, and looking at ownership from SuiScan, one address controls over 7.6 billion tokens, which is more than 76% of the total supply. If the trader held on, the address would be the second largest. Any attempt to sell would force prices lower, triggering panic as other holders scramble to the exits. Related Reading: XRP Crashes 14% As Whales Send Deposits To Exchanges Currently, traders will be closely monitoring how HIPPO performs. As a meme coin, much depends on hype and whether there is a fear of missing out (FOMO). If that’s the case, the meme coin will float higher, outperforming SUI, which is also relatively firm.

Posting on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst focused on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, an important metric in the Bitcoin market. According to tugbachain, the MVRV ratio shows a historical downward trend. Should this trend continue or get breached, it may lead to a major impact on Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s NVT Cross Signals a Local Top – Is a Major Correction Looming? MVRV Ratio And Its Impending Impact On Bitcoin The MVRV ratio, as explained by tugbachain, is a tool used to gauge whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued. This ratio is calculated by comparing the market value to the realized value of Bitcoin, providing insights into investor behavior and market trends. The analyst highlighted that the MVRV has proven useful in identifying market tops, bottoms, and notable peaks and troughs over the years. The MVRV ratio has historically demonstrated three major Bitcoin halving cycles, each marked by unique price behavior and investor sentiment. The current ratio sits around 1.9, with significant support noted at 1.75. The question raised by tugbachain is whether breaking the downtrend could lead to a rise in the MVRV ratio to the 4-6 range, which has historically signaled a Bitcoin peak. The analyst wrote in the post: Currently, the MVRV ratio shows a historical downtrend with significant support at 1.75. With the ratio now sitting at 1.9, the question arises: if it breaks the downtrend and reverses the downtrend, could it once again climb to the 4-6 range, marking a Bitcoin peak as seen in previous cycles? BTC Market Performance And Technical Outlook Bitcoin has seen heightened price activity in recent weeks in the broader market context. The asset rallied above $66,000 last week, sparking enthusiasm in the crypto community with hopes for a bullish October, playfully termed “Uptober.” However, this upward momentum was short-lived, as BTC experienced a notable price correction soon after. Within the past week alone, Bitcoin has seen a decline of around 7.2%, falling to a trading price of $61,496 at the time of writing. Despite this correction, BTC has rebounded slightly, posting a modest 1.9% gain over the past 24 hours. Aside from tugbachain’s analysis, other crypto market analysts have provided additional perspectives on the MVRV ratio’s implications for BTC. Ali, a prominent analyst on the social media platform X, has pointed out that the MVRV ratio’s behavior since May has notably impacted Bitcoin’s price movements. Related Reading: Here Is Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Hasn’t Started, According To Analyst Ali observed that each rejection of the MVRV ratio from its 90-day average has historically led to a significant correction in Bitcoin’s price. According to Ali, the latest rejection has already resulted in a 10% drop, suggesting the possibility of further downside pressure.

Among those closely monitoring the price action in anticipation of an uptrend is a well-known analyst on the social media platform X. This analyst, who goes by the name Ash Crypto, recently highlighted a striking similarity between Bitcoin’s current price behavior and a notable pattern observed earlier in 2023. Ash Crypto pointed to Bitcoin’s decline in early October 2023, which ultimately reversed into a multi-month rally to its current all-time high. Explaining The Similar Price Action October 2023 was the turning point for the price of Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies. It was during this month that the crypto industry finally broke out of a lengthy bear cycle, with Bitcoin heralding the charge toward renewed optimism and significant price gains. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally For the first time since January, Bitcoin’s market capitalization surged by an impressive 28.52%, sparking a shift in market dynamics that rippled throughout the industry. Although altcoins followed a similar upward trajectory, their gains were modest compared to Bitcoin. However, their collective impact was able to push the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization past the $1.25 trillion mark for the first time since May 2022. However, while October 2023 was the start of the new bull cycle, what most investors don’t know or have forgotten is that the month started on a negative note. As Ash Crypto pointed out, the price of Bitcoin dropped by 7.5% in the first week of October 2023. According to the BTC/USD price chart, this decline saw the price of Bitcoin fall below $26,500. However, it soon rebounded from this point. By the end of October 2023, Bitcoin had rallied to close the month at over $35,000, representing a remarkable 33% increase from the month’s low. Fast forward to October 2024, and it appears that Bitcoin is once again repeating its pattern from the previous year. At the start of the month, Bitcoin was trading just below $64,000, a strong position given its recent bullish trends. However, in a movement similar to October 2023, the cryptocurrency experienced another sharp decline, this time dropping by 6.5% within the first three days. Notably, the price briefly touched $60,750 during this period. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? If history were to repeat itself in full, Bitcoin could maybe or maybe not drop a little bit more before rebounding to the upside. According to Ash Crypto’s projection, a similar 33% surge would see Bitcoin shooting above its current all-time high, with a monthly close right in the middle of $75,000 and $76,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has recovered a bit and is now trading at $61,580. Despite this early setback, many bullish investors are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin in anticipation of Uptober coming to fruition.

Injective is one of those altcoins facing massive losses with the token’s price slashed by 20% since last week, representing a strong bearish sentiment in INJ’s market. Related Reading: What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number Despite the market’s underperformance, the platform continues to cement itself as a premier Layer 1. Although the losses for investors and traders are painful, continued developments like these will stabilize the shaken investor confidence in both Injective and the token. Network Metrics Show Stable Growth October started wonderfully for Injective as the platform announced that the network had processed a whopping 1 billion total transactions. This metric shows that the network can cater to a growing number of users which also grew in conjunction with the transactions. 1 BILLION TOTAL TRANSACTIONS ON INJECTIVE 🚀 This is just the beginning. Nothing can stop the rise of ninjas. pic.twitter.com/iwUX4uEmzE — Injective 🥷 (@injective) October 2, 2024 Injective Hub, an X account dedicated to showing the latest developments on the platform, recently shared that Injective experienced a huge growth spurt in active addresses. According to the post, the platform encountered an astonishing 126% average active address growth, ranking Injective to be top 1 in the metric outpacing the likes of Sei, Ethereum, Base, and Solana. Top Blockchains by Average Active Addresses Growth (7D) No need for words, just don’t fade this, nINJas! 🚀#Injective $INJ pic.twitter.com/rAITgiAkTU — INJ Hub 🥷 (@Injective_Hub) October 3, 2024 This month, investors and traders should expect more users in the coming weeks as Injective enters into a partnership with Caldera, an Ethereum roll-up platform, becoming a part of Metalayer. This interoperability layer enables omnichain operability for users of the platform. This will enable a new generation of interoperability for the participating blockchains and Injective, introducing the platform to new users on Metalayer. Injective Poised For Higher Levels As of writing, INJ is trading on a green candle as the bulls attempt to break through the $19.94 resistance level in the short term which might be the sign investors and traders are waiting for in the coming days. The relative strength index also suggests this thesis. Right now, the token is entering a possible reversal area that will affect the growing bullish momentum. The past few days have been bloody for INJ, but the market’s strength coupled with strong on-chain development will affect the token’s price positively in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Is Crypto Losing Steam? Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024 INJ’s significant correlation with Bitcoin and the broader market will also play a big role on the token’s future performance. If the major cryptocurrencies continue to slip in the coming days, investors and traders should expect INJ to experience a drop towards $17.71. However, a return to bullishness in the next couple of days will drive the token to stabilize on its current support at level at $18.57.

Analyst Suggests Local Bottom May Be Here,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-the-worst-over-for-bitcoin-analyst-suggests-local-bottom-may-be-here/,"A CryptoQuant analyst known as “caueconomy” recently published a post indicating that Bitcoin (BTC) may have reached a local bottom. The analyst points to a significant liquidation event as a key sign that a short-term recovery could be on the horizon. Although caueconomy acknowledged that Bitcoin has been going through a period marked by bearish price sentiment and technical indicators suggesting potential further decline, the analyst also highlighted that emerging signs may indicate a stabilization in the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Selloff Is Calming Down: Green Sign For Rally To Continue? How Is BTC Long Liquidations Suggesting Local Bottom? The post by caueconomy on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform titled “Liquidation of long positions may have established a local bottom” sheds light on how long-position liquidations in the futures market could influence Bitcoin’s price. Caueconomy elaborates that in the face of notable price declines, long contracts bought on future exchanges tend to experience sharp reductions due to mass liquidations. This process, in turn, diminishes the selling pressure that often exacerbates price drops, potentially setting the stage for a recovery in the asset’s price in the short term. On October 1st, over 4,000 BTC long positions were liquidated, marking the second-largest liquidation event of 2024 based on data compiled by CryptoQuant. The analyst mentioned that such significant liquidation events often indicate potential market reversals or local bottoms, as the selling pressure from these positions is removed from the market. However, caueconomy points out that it is crucial to keep a close eye on the buying strength to gauge whether it can offset the decline and facilitate recovery. The analyst advises that although the current range may be sustained in the short term, the potential for upward movement is contingent on renewed buying interest and market activity. The analyst concluded in the post: At this point, the price is likely to sustain the current range in the short term, but it will be necessary to watch the buying strength to be able to recover the decline. Is there Any Sign Of Buying Interest In Bitcoin Currently? So far, Bitcoin appears to be seeing a gradual rebound in price registering a 3.5% increase in the past day to reclaim the $62,000 mark. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $62,238. This increase in BTC has been reflected in the overall crypto market, with the global crypto market cap now up by 2% in the past day to a current valuation of 2.26 trillion. Meanwhile, a renowned crypto analyst known as Ali on X recently reported a form of Bitcoin buying interest ongoing on an exchange. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin On The Brink Of A Reversal? Here’s What This Key Indicator Suggests In a post uploaded earlier today on X, Ali pointed out that there has been a surge in the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio on OKX, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour trading volume.

Political turmoil has hurt Bitcoin before. When tensions grow, cryptocurrency prices fall, unlike gold, market analysts say. Related Reading: Is Crypto Losing Steam? Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024 Bitcoin shot down to about $59,000 as the Middle East’s crisis worsened, and then recovered somewhat, but continuing volatility is probably in the cards. In spite of this uncertainty, CoinCodex’s latest BTC price prediction offers a huge 40% gain in the price of the crypto asset, which could top out at $86,428 by November 2024. Market expert Ali Martinez notes that Bitcoin is moving in a descending parallel channel, a pattern generally associated with price drops. Bitcoin’s technical setup says it might drop to $52,000, increasing uncertainty.

According to CryptoQuant, Long/Short Volume to Open Interest Ratio is a notable indicator that reflects trader positioning: when this ratio grows, it indicates that long positions are dominant and it is commonly seen as an indication of positive market movement. A little too much optimism in the markets, however, produces prices to be corrected downwards. On the other hand, too much short position also hints at bearish sentiments, but at the extreme, it can be a precursor to the rebound of prices. BTCUSD trading at $61,696 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Currently, Bitcoin’s sentiment remains neutral, with the Fear & Greed Index at 41, reflecting the caution in the market. This suggests that, despite its stable performance with 60% green trading days over the last month, investors are still wary. Geopolitical Factors While geopolitical events influenced the price movement of Bitcoin aside from technical analysis, its movements are varied. According to cryptocurrency analyst Jesse Colombo, the coin usually traded downhill during periods of increased global tensions. So far, there is a rebound due to the Middle East crisis, and its traders are expecting more of the same. This has the consequence of making the alpha crypto experience drastic value changes mainly when the tensions in different parts of the world keep rising.

This surge was primarily driven by a broader market rally and bolstered by excitement surrounding crypto asset manager Bitwise’s filing for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) earlier this week. However, the enthusiasm was short-lived. XRP has since lost nearly 12% of its value on the weekly time frame, following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to appeal a partial victory for Ripple, the blockchain payments company associated with XRP. XRP Price Strength During Legal Battles The SEC’s appeal has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, raising concerns about the future of XRP and its regulatory status. Market expert Bobby A addressed these concerns in a recent social media post, arguing that the macro charts do not indicate the onset of a prolonged bear market for the XRP price due to the appeal. Instead, Bobby A suggests that such events often lead to missed opportunities for “uninformed or impatient investors” who may react impulsively to market news, and claims that despite these short-term challenges, the token can continue its upward trajectory in the coming months. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Crash Might Not Be Over, Why $60,365 Is Important The expert points out that the XRP price has shown resilience in the face of regulatory challenges. For example, during the SEC lawsuit that began in 2020, XRP was able to rise from $0.11 to $1.95 despite significant legal headwinds. Bobby A emphasizes that the XRP price has been consolidating sideways for nearly seven years, indicating a strong macro base that could pave the way for future price appreciation. No Indications Of A Bear Market From a technical analysis perspective, Bobby A highlights that the monthly time frame for the XRP price reveals critical patterns. Following Bitcoin’s Halving cycles, XRP has historically experienced rapid price surges during cyclical rotations of momentum oscillators. This pattern was evident in previous years, particularly in 2017 and 2020. Moreover, the Bollinger Bands—a technical indicator that measures market volatility—are currently at their tightest levels in XRP’s history. The expert suggests that tight Bollinger Bands often precede significant price movements, which can be “deceptive at first,” as they may initially mislead market participants. Bobby A argues that current market conditions should not be misinterpreted as the start of a bear market. Instead, he suggests that XRP is positioned for potential capitulation in “deep value areas.” With legal clarity, a real use case and what he sees as the imminent ETF, he believes XRP is poised for mass adoption.

Finally, the market expert pointed to the upcoming US general election, which could play a crucial role in XRP’s future. Bobby speculated that if former President Donald Trump is re-elected, it could lead to significant changes within the SEC, potentially alleviating some of the regulatory concerns that have plagued the asset. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.522, up 0.6% over the past 24 hours.

Ethereum Issuance Rate Continues To Surge In its October 2024 Monthly Market Insights report, Binance Research highlighted that the ETH issuance rate continued its ascent in September, moving away from its previously deflationary status. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Primed For Surge? Analyst Reveals Key Levels to Watch For A $8,100 Rally The second largest digital asset by reported market cap had a 30-day annualized inflation rate of approximately 0.74%, a level not observed in the last two years. The sharp uptick in ETH supply inflation has questioned its “ultrasound money” positioning. Interestingly, the term “ultrasound money” draws inspiration from Bitcoin’s (BTC) “sound money” narrative. While BTC’s supply is capped at 21 million, ETH’s supply can become deflationary, theoretically increasing scarcity and protecting it from inflation-driven erosion of purchasing power. Ethereum’s high issuance rate could be attributed to several factors, including low mainnet on-chain activity, leading to a low transaction fee and, consequently, lower ETH burn rates. In 2021, Ethereum core developers implemented EIP-1559, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism that aimed to reduce ETH’s circulating supply, thereby creating deflationary pressure on the token. However, with declining mainnet activity, the amount of ETH being burned is lagging behind the ETH issuance rate, leading to a net inflationary trend. Notably, September 2024 experienced one of the lowest ETH burn rates since the highly anticipated Merge event, when Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions To Blame For Low ETH Burn Rate? The report points to March 2024 as the starting point of Ethereum’s inflationary trend, following the implementation of EIP-4844 or the Dencun upgrade, which reduced transaction costs on layer-2 scaling platforms such as Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Base, and Polygon (MATIC). The report adds: As L2s cannibalized network activity throughout the year – further impacted by broader market conditions – transaction fees and, consequently, burned fees on Ethereum declined, with September recording one of the lowest levels since the Merge. This has prevented ETH from decreasing in supply to remain deflationary, leading to the net positive daily supply changes we now see. Recent trends corroborate the assertion above, as network activity on layer-2 solutions grows across different metrics. For instance, a report in July 2024 noted that daily active addresses and transaction volume on Polygon had soared significantly. Related Reading: Ethereum Solo Staking Made Easier? Vitalik Buterin Supports Lower Entry Requirements Similarly, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Arbitrum increased earlier this year when decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap surpassed $150 billion in total swap volume on the network. Another report found that over 48% of digital assets bridged from the Ethereum network end up on Arbitrum, indicating users’ high trust in the layer-2 network’s robust security and reliability. ETH trades at $2,385 at press time, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

Hoskinson, who is also known for his role in co-founding Ethereum (ETH), has consistently praised Cardano’s progress over the past month following the recent upgrade, asserting its superiority over the largest cryptocurrencies on the market such as Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of decentralization. Hoskinson Declares Cardano Remains Top Dog In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson reaffirmed Cardano’s status, claiming it is “still number 1.” This statement follows his remarks at the Token2049 Conference in Singapore, where he discussed the new governance model of the Cardano network. Hoskinson emphasized that this model “redistributes power” from a select few to the broader community, addressing a key concern he sees with Ethereum’s “centralized structure.” Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash Hoskinson pointed out that Ethereum’s reliance on its founder, Vitalik Buterin, creates “a bottleneck for innovation,” whereas Cardano’s Chang hard fork has established a framework that ensures ongoing development regardless of individual involvement. Hoskinson further highlighted how delegated representatives (DReps) can now engage with one another, vote, and utilize a blockchain-based governance system to regularly ratify the network’s roadmap. He stated emphatically, “Charles, alive or dead, doesn’t matter. There’s still going to be innovation on a daily basis.” In addition, the Cardano blockchain has shown significant growth in key metrics, boasting over 74,000 Plutus scripts and the creation of 1.3 million delegated wallets over the last seven years. Additionally, approximately 1,373 projects have been launched on the platform, as highlighted in a commemorative video by Input Output Global (IOG), the development company behind the blockchain. Final Transition To Decentralized Governance? In his latest social media update, Hoskinson also remarked on Cardano’s advancements in decentralized governance, suggesting that the network is on the cusp of achieving remarkable milestones with upcoming features. Looking ahead, Cardano aims to replace its initial genesis keys, which have been instrumental in managing the network since its inception. This transition will be supported by increased participation from stake pool operators (SPOs) and DReps, as well as the establishment of a Constitutional Committee (CC).

The final transition to the Voltaire era, signifying a fully self-sustaining blockchain, will occur with the final use of the Genesis keys, triggering another hard fork. However, further announcements and dates for these developments have yet to be released by IOG or the blockchain’s founder. At the time of writing, Cardano’s native token ADA trades at $0.352, recording a 2% price surge in the last 24 hours.
