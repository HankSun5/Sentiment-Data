The transaction serves as a move in state-level financial policy and sets a precedent for how U.S. public institutions may treat digital assets in the years ahead. State officials confirmed that the acquisition, valued at $10 million and completed at an approximate basis of $87,000 per Bitcoin, is the opening step in a reserve plan that has been under development for more than a year. Texas first allocation completed through BlackRock’s IBIT ETF According to Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council, the initial purchase was executed through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). At the same time, the state finalizes the process for direct self-custody. Information shared by Bratcher indicates that $5 million of the allocation was applied at the time of purchase, and the remaining balance aligns with the structure of the state’s broader reserve commitment. TEXAS BOUGHT THE DIP! Texas becomes the FIRST state to purchase Bitcoin with a $10M investment on Nov. 20th at an approximately $87k basis! Congratulations to Comptroller @KHancock4TX and the dedicated investments team at Texas Treasury who have been watching this market… pic.twitter.com/wsMqI9HrPD — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 Bratcher stated that Texas intends to self-custody its Bitcoin once the request-for-proposal process concludes. Until then, ETF exposure acts as the mechanism needed to initiate the reserve without delaying the legislative timeline. How Texas built its strategic Bitcoin Reserve The acquisition is preceded by legislative actions that occurred earlier this year. In June, the Texas governor signed a bill that established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , following lawmakers’ analysis of a proposal version during the last legislative session. The legislation was based on a bill submitted by State Representative Giovanni Capriglione of Texas, who suggested considering Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. The proposal outlined cold-storage requirements, minimum holding periods of years, and access to voluntary contributions made by Texas residents. It also allowed state agencies to receive cryptocurrency payments and convert them into Bitcoin for deposit in the reserve. This move by Texas occurs amid a period during which several institutional investors have grown their investments in regulated Bitcoin vehicles. The Harvard University Foundation recently increased its stake in IBIT to the highest point of investment, at $442.8 million, marking the largest single reported investment the foundation has ever made. Al Warda Investments of Abu Dhabi and Emory University have also increased their investment in Bitcoin ETFs over the past several months. Other governments explore Bitcoin-linked instruments The U.S. jurisdiction is not the only one looking into digital-asset approaches. New Hampshire recently became the first government to issue a Bitcoin-backed municipal bond in the world, which was issued earlier this month. The Business Finance Authority of the state sanctioned a 100 million conduit system, which enables private companies to borrow funds using the over-collateralized form of Bitcoin deposited in trust. In the arrangement, borrowers are required to pledge Bitcoin to the value of approximately 160% of the loan amount. The liquidation is automated to safeguard bondholders if the collateral’s value decreases. Fees, as well as any appreciation in the posted Bitcoin, are used to fund the Bitcoin Economic Development Fund in the state of New Hampshire. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Here’s Why BNB Could Plunge Even Lower",https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-price-prediction-missed-the-1000-exit-heres-why-bnb-could-plunge-even-lower/,"After hitting an all-time high of $1,370, BNB has reversed sharply during the latest market downturn and now the BNB price prediction is in focus. Is this just a healthy pullback, or the start of a deeper trend? On-chain data may hold the answer. According to BSC Scan, daily transactions on the BNB Chain have dropped significantly since peaking at 31.3 million on October 8. With network activity cooling fast, traders are watching closely to see whether BNB can hold its ground or if further downside is ahead. As of yesterday, the blockchain’s daily TXs had dropped by 50%. The reason? Traders were flushed out of the market by a cascade of forced liquidations. Network activity had been steadily growing amid the rising popularity of protocols like Aster, a perpetual futures trading platform that is now contending with Hyperliquid for the lead in this important segment of the market. In addition, Pancake Swap, the largest BNB-native decentralized exchange (DEX) for spot trades, has seen its trading volumes explode this year. As long as transaction volumes remain this low, BNB could struggle to make it back to $1,000 . In fact, the token could actually dip lower if it fails to recapture some key price zones. BNB Price Prediction: 20% Downside Risk as BNB Struggles to Clear $900 The latest price action has formed a falling wedge that could result in a bullish breakout down the road for BNB. However, momentum remains heavily depressed as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has collapsed near the 30 level. The token’s 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) could act as a strong resistance now, currently sitting at $883. Even if the price breaks above this wedge, the long-term trend remains bearish. Meanwhile, failing to recapture the $900 area could result in a move toward $750 first and then to $680, meaning a 20% downside risk. Paired with this on-chain sell signal (lower network activity), recapturing the $1,000 level seems difficult at a point when market sentiment is still heavily depressed. In contrast, top crypto presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) have been resilient to the latest downturn. This mine-to-earn (M2E) continues to attract investors as it makes crypto mining possible without hardware. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Gamifies Mining and Makes It Hardware-Free Mining cryptocurrencies is usually considered an expensive way to earn cryptocurrencies, but Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is here to change that. This mine-to-earn game reimagines crypto mining by letting players build unlimited virtual rigs and grow their digital mining empire with zero hardware or technical hassle. The more rigs launched and upgraded, the more mining power earned, and the higher players climb on the leaderboard. Top performers unlock airdrops of major meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Pepe ($PEPE) , adding real value to every upgrade. Even better, up to 70% of the $PEPENODE tokens used to upgrade rigs are permanently burned, creating powerful deflation and long-term scarcity. As the game’s popularity grows, $PEPENODE is shaping up to be one of the most promising opportunities in the next wave of crypto gaming. To buy $PEPENODE during its presale stage, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead. Visit the Official Pepenode Website Here The post BNB Price Prediction: Missed the $1,000 Exit?

These two launches mark a hugely significant milestone for XRP, initiating a phase in which institutional money could pile into the coin’s market, much as we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP had been suffering in recent weeks, along with the wider market, with negative sentiment dragging the coin down by 10% in a fortnight and by 17% in a month. However, the token remains up by 50% in a year, and with more XRP ETFs likely to follow in the coming weeks , the XRP price prediction looks incredibly positive right now. XRP Price Prediction: Trillion-Dollar Wall Street Fund Manager Goes All In – Could XRP Be the Next Institutional Favorite? In fact, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has predicted a surge of XRP ETF launches , providing this forecast last week, when Bitwise launched its own ETF for the coin. The pre-thanksgiving rush (shall we say, 'turkey trot'!?) for XRP ETFs starts now.. congrats @BitwiseInvest on today's launch! https://t.co/EgYVrm0TmM — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) November 20, 2025 Bitwise’s launch prepared the ground for yesterday’s listings, with Franklin Templeton and Grayscale joining what may be a race for institutional money. That three different asset managers have launched XRP ETFs so close together may indicate that they expect strong demand from institutions, and that their competing to capitalize on such demand. Either way, the launch of three ETFs is incredibly positive news for XRP, which is now showing some very strong momentum. Its chart today shows that it’s beginning to bounce after hitting a bottom several days ago. For instance, its relative strength index (yellow) has risen to 50 today, after touching an oversold 30 last week, Source: TradingView Likewise, it seems that its MACD (orange, blue) has also bottomed out, ready for a recovery as the XRP price rises. Of course, the overarching investment climate still remains fairly unsteady, given the fears surrounding the possible overvaluation of AI-related stocks. That said, Nvidia posted better-than-expected earnings last week (and a better-than-expected forecast), something which has helped to stabilize investor mood. And with asset managers now seemingly rushing to launch XRP ETFs, this could be a very profitable period for the altcoin. It could reach $2.50 in early December, while a rate cut from the Fed could even send it above $3.00 by 2026. A Layer-Two Network for Bitcoin? Why Bitcoin Hyper Could Be One of the Big New Alts of 2026 As promising as XRP now looks, it won’t be the only altcoin to rally during the inevitable market-wide recovery. It’s likely that a host of new alts will also do well in the coming months, including several promising presale tokens. One of the most interesting of these is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a layer-two network for Bitcoin that has now raised a very impressive $28.4 million in its ongoing presale. This is an encouraging figure for such a new project, yet it shows how the market’s faith in Bitcoin Hyper is growing. Hyper is getting HYPED! 28M Raised! pic.twitter.com/LxiuHbDpAH — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) November 19, 2025 As an L2, Bitcoin Hyper will enable investors to tap into the enormous value of the BTC hold, without having to sell their coins. Instead, they can bridge their BTC to Bitcoin Hyper’s sidechain, using the equivalent HYPER they receive with the L2’s ecosystem of apps. In other words, Bitcoin Hyper will enable traders to put their BTC holdings to work, wither by staking HYPER or by making use of the L2’s various DeFi apps. It’s worth pointing out that Bitcoin Hyper will make use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and of zero-knowledge rollups, providing superior speed, scalability and privacy. This will make it more efficient than preexisting sidechains for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network (which is primarily a payment rail anyway). This helps to explain why the token has raised so much in its presale, with investors able to join by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . HYPER is currently available at a price of $0.013325, although this will rise later today.

DOGE jumped 2.2% following the launch, as Wall Street’s growing appetite for crypto strengthens the case for a bullish Dogecoin price prediction . Grayscale secured the first-mover advantage, getting its fund listed ahead of competitors. While REX-Osprey recently launched a Dogecoin ETP, this marks the first pure spot DOGE vehicle to go live on U.S. markets.

I'm going with $12m. *33 Act pic.twitter.com/QbdLLxejhr — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 24, 2025 Alongside this new fund, Bitwise is also ready to launch its Dogecoin ETF this week. As the U.S. government shutdown has finally ended, a flood of altcoin-linked vehicles seems ready to hit the trading floor. Trading volumes have stood above average levels as buying interest seems to be increasing. A total of $1.5 billion worth of DOGE has exchanged hands in the past 24 hours. These volumes account for nearly 7% of the token’s circulating market cap. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Huge Rally Could Begin if $0.14 Support Level Holds The daily chart shows that DOGE has bounced off a key support at around $0.14. It now seems headed to retest the upper bound of a falling wedge that has formed as a result of the latest price action. Positive momentum could be picking up its pace, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) just stuck its neck above the 14-day moving average. The $0.18 area seems to be decisive in determining if Dogecoin is about to start its next leg up. If the token rises above this mark, it would break out of this wedge and could be propelled to $0.20 in the near term. This would mean a 33% upside potential. If momentum continues to build, DOGE could push toward $0.28 by year’s end, nearly doubling from current levels. In the longer term, continued adoption and fresh developments could pave the way for Dogecoin to make a run toward $10 . As meme coins begin to rally, early-stage presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are catching serious attention. It captures that early Dogecoin energy while building a tight-knit trader community where members share exclusive alpha, early setups, and high-upside plays, all before the rest of the market catches on. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Unite ‘Degens’ as They Prepare for the Next Big Pump Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is not just another Ethereum meme coin, it’s a trader-first project built for degens who want to ride early trends and capitalize on momentum. This community thrives on sharing trading setups , spotting exclusive opportunities before they go mainstream, and dropping real alpha , all while having fun in a high-energy environment. With competitions like Maxi Gains and Maxi Ripped , traders can earn rewards and climb the leaderboard while showcasing their best calls. To push things further, 25% of the presale funds will be used high potential trades, with any profits fueling bigger marketing campaigns and deeper reach. As meme coins heat up again, early-stage projects like $MAXI could offer the kind of upside legacy tokens can’t match, especially when backed by a tight community that knows how to spot the next move.

Before wider market FUD took over, the privacy coin narrative was gaining traction as the next major touch point for real-world adoption through tokens like Zcash. Vitalik’s recent commentary that “Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene” has revived interest, this time placing Ethereum in the conversation. Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 23, 2025 The argument arises in response to the recent breach of client data at major U.S. banks like JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley, first reported by the New York Times. The privacy narrative has found new relevance in this institution-led market cycle: Institutional use-cases need rails that offer privacy, yet are compliant with selective disclosure. In October, the Ethereum Foundation launched a new privacy-focused cluster and released initial details about Kohaku, a privacy-centric browser wallet and software development kit. This is a step towards an essay written by Vitalik in April, outlining a path for Ethereum to address the kind of structural data exposure seen in both TradFi and public blockchains. Ethereum Price Prediction: Could the Privacy Coin Narrative Boost ETH? As the native blockchain of potential privacy solutions bridging Web 2 to Web3, fresh demand stands to aid Ethereum in filling out the final shoulder of a potential bullish head-and-shoulders pattern. And with supportive momentum indicators and a decisive bounce from a historical demand zone around $2,750, it may have just hit its bottom. ETH / USD 1-day chart, bullish head and shoulders pattern.

The RSI has made a sharp bounce from the 30 oversold threshold after months of steady decline, while the MACD approaches a golden cross, readings that have historically marked local bottoms for the Ethereum price. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 90% move . But as the bull market matures, if Ethereum finds a bigger part to play in the transition from Web2 to Web3, the move could extend 250% to $10,000 .

This legislation will focus on modernizing the existing U.S. fraud laws so that they account for the role artificial intelligence technology has played in recent high-profile incidents where AI-generated audio or video tricked officials or the public. More about the bipartisan bill The bill, proposed by Representatives Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Neal Dunn, R-Fla., two lawmakers who have had enough of the ease and audacity with which criminals now use AI in their deceptive practices, seeks to expand penalties for AI scams and criminalize impersonating federal officials using AI. “As AI technology advances at a rapid pace, our laws must keep up,” Dunn said in a statement announcing the bill. “The AI Fraud Deterrence Act strengthens penalties for crimes related to fraud committed with the help of AI. I am proud to co-lead this legislation to protect the identities of the public and prevent misuse of this innovative technology.” Lieu agrees and last week, told NBC News that the majority of Americans want “sensible guardrails on AI,” as they don’t think a “complete Wild West is helpful.” Under the proposed law , the maximum penalty for defrauding is to be doubled from $1 million to $2 million in cases where AI is deliberately used to facilitate the crime. It would also include AI-mediated deception in the definitions of both mail fraud and wire fraud, which means it could be possible to charge individuals who use AI to conduct either type of fraud. In either case, criminals could get slammed with million-dollar fines and up to two decades behind bars for mail fraud and three for wire fraud. The draft also frowns upon the impersonation of federal officials with AI deepfakes , highlighting cases in which AIs were used in attempts to mimic White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this year. Fraud has been around for as long as humans have, but experts say that thanks to AI, the quality of fraudulent outputs has gone up. In December, the FBI warned that “generative AI reduces the time and effort criminals must expend to deceive their targets,” adding that AI “can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs for fraud.” Maura R. Grossman, a research professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario and a lawyer, also believes AI enables a new era of deception: “AI presents a scale, a scope, and a speed for fraud that is very, very different from frauds in the past.” AI models have become more advanced However, the fact that it facilitates crime is not the biggest problem. Observers are now worried that current institutions, like the judicial courts, are struggling to keep up with the rapid development happening in the AI sector. “AI years are dog years,” Hany Farid, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-founder of GetReal Security, a leading digital-media authentication company, said of the speed of AI progress. In the past, it was not too difficult to tell AI content apart from real content, especially where images were concerned; however today, they have become more advanced, and even the most experienced users now struggle to determine if a media piece is real or generated. The FBI’s warning in December advised individuals to keep an eye out for discrepancies in images and videos to identify AI-generated media: “Look for subtle imperfections in images and videos, such as distorted hands or feet.” However, Farid believes this old advice is wrong and even harmful. “The multiple hands trick, that’s not true anymore,” Farid said. “You can’t look for hands or feet. None of that stuff works.” Lieu and Dunn’s proposed bill lays emphasis on the importance of labeling AI-generated content. It also clarifies that there is a time and place for AI-generated media. For instance, if a content is labeled satirical, the tag clarifies it is not authentic and so is exempted from punishment. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Free-tier users will be limited to playing and sharing music within the platform. “This landmark pact with Suno is a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone,” said Robert Kyncl, Warner Music’s chief executive officer (CEO), in a statement . “With Suno rapidly scaling, both in users and monetization, we’ve seized this opportunity to shape models that expand revenue and deliver new fan experiences.” “Our partnership with Warner Music unlocks a bigger, richer Suno experience for music lovers, and accelerates our mission to change the place of music in the world by making it more valuable to billions of people,” Mikey Shulman, CEO, Suno, said, adding that “this means we’ll be rolling out new, more robust features for creation, opportunities to collaborate and interact with some of the most talented musicians in the world, all while continuing to build the biggest music ecosystem possible.” As part of the deal, Suno has acquired Songkick, Warner Music’s live music and concert-discovery platform, for an undisclosed amount. Suno’s settlement comes roughly one week after it announced it had raised $250 million at a valuation of $2.45 billion. The startup says nearly 100 million people have used its platform to create music over the past two years. Warner Music has now also settled with both Suno and Udio, with the latter also settling with Universal Music . SAP faces allegations of systematic theft On the same day Warner Music announced its settlement with Suno, a fresh case was opened in Dallas federal court as o9 Solutions accused SAP of orchestrating a campaign to steal trade secrets related to supply-chain management software. The lawsuit names three former o9 executives now in senior positions at SAP, alleging they downloaded over 20,000 confidential files before departing to join the German software giant. o9 Solutions, which is backed by KKR and General Atlantic and valued at $3.7 billion as of 2023, said it understood the importance of fair competition and employee mobility but could not allow its trade secrets to be misappropriated. o9 claims that SAP, facing customer losses due to its outdated platform, targeted the startup’s proprietary technology and has since altered its software to closely mirror o9’s offerings. The three defendants are Stephan de Barse, now president of SAP’s global business suite; Sean Zonneveld, now global chief revenue officer for procurement at SAP; and Stijn-Pieter van Houten, now chief product officer for supply chain management planning at SAP. “SAP is committed to the highest standards of business ethics and respects the intellectual property rights of others,” the company said in a statement. “We will review o9’s complaint and will respond, as appropriate, within the legal process.” Don’t just read crypto news.

This means that Bitcoin has risen by 1.6% in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum and Solana have risen by 3% and 5.5%. With the market beginning to stabilize after a difficult couple of weeks, now may be an opportune time to make some buys, before prices mount a sustained recovery. And one way of achieving sizeable gains during a recovery is to diversify into newer coins, with this article covering new ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , our best altcoin coin to buy today. Best Altcoin Coin to Buy As Cryptos Bounce – 25 November PEPENODE is currently holding its presale, which has so far raised in excess of $2.1 million, despite having been running for only a couple of months. The appeal of the token is already very clear, with PEPENODE offering users the chance to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, without having to invest in expensive mining equipment. APY so good even mother nature wants a taste https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/LUszW4YwYp — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 25, 2025 In the past, miners would have to buy and operate increasingly resource-hungry machines in order to mine coins, with only large companies now undertaking Bitcoin mining on a significant scale. However, all PEPENODE requires is that investors use the PEPENODE token itself to buy virtual mining nodes, which they can accumulate in order to grow their virtual rigs. The more nodes they own, the greater their rewards will be, with PEPENODE paying out mining yields in the form of external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe. Given that you will need PEPENODE in order to build a rig, the demand for the new token could also be substantial. What’s also interesting is that, after they’ve earned tokens from mining, users can sell their own virtual mining nodes to other users, and so on. This should help create a virtuous circle of buying, mining, and reselling, helping to support the PEPENODE price for the longer term. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE , with this supply allocated between rewards, development, its treasury, listings, and marketing. PEPENODE Could Go 100x in 2026: Here’s How to Buy Also bullish is the fact that holders of PEPENODE will also be able to stake the token for a passive income, with its staking protocol currently paying out an APY of 589%. While this rate will decline as staking numbers increase, it’s still a very generous rate, and one which could encourage substantial interest in PEPENODE. The token will list once its presale has closed, although investors can join the sale now by going to its official website and connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet). You can buy PEPENODE using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat currency, with the current presale price at $0.0011638. This will rise every three days until the sale ends, so interested buyers should act quickly or miss out on locking in the best possible returns. And because the market may begin recovering more vigorously once it launches, it has every chance of surging in the coming weeks, which is why it’s our best altcoin coin to buy today.

54897778,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90686,1764113414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Who Called 800% XRP Surge Shares New Insight,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-who-called-800-xrp-surge-shares-new-insight/,"XRP has faced sustained downward pressure in recent weeks, even though the broader market experienced intermittent recovery periods. Despite this weakness, a market commentator known as MichaelXBT believes that the asset’s current performance reflects a reallocation of value from short-term holders to investors with a longer outlook. His position draws from previous cycles in which XRP experienced long periods of stagnation before advancing sharply. Extended Price Weakness Despite ETF Launches Over the past seven weeks, XRP has closed in negative territory for six of them, with only the week of October 20 showing an upward movement, recording a 10 percent gain. During this period, the asset declined by more than 23 percent, although it began the current week with an 8 percent advance. This downturn persisted even after the introduction of multiple XRP exchange-traded funds, which have collectively attracted approximately $586 million in inflows since mid-November. I called XRP before it pumped 800% Many are once again losing faith in XRP That’s the purpose of this correction, It’s a transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient. XRP is ready to surprise everyone once again… That’s all I’m going to say. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) November 24, 2025 Even so, XRP is down nearly 17% for the month, indicating that institutional demand generated through the ETF market has not yet produced a noticeable effect on spot pricing. Some analysts attribute this to broader market weakness and uncertainty among retail participants. Analyst Revisits Earlier Successful Forecast MichaelXBT recently commented on the ongoing retracement by referencing his earlier analysis from mid-2024. At that time, XRP traded around $0.58 and showed limited volatility. He identified what he described as a multi-year consolidation pattern, which he believed could precede a substantial upside move. His assessment was followed by an extended rally, in which XRP rose from approximately $0.50 in November 2024 to $3.66 by July 2025, representing a gain of more than 600 percent. Market Confidence Declines as Consolidation Continues According to the analyst, XRP has once again entered a consolidation phase, and many traders appear discouraged by the lack of upward momentum. He stated that declining sentiment is contributing to increased selling activity, particularly among long-term holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Data from Glassnode indicates that profit-taking behavior intensified earlier in the year. On July 24, sales by long-term XRP holders reached an estimated $375 million, marking the highest level recorded in eight months. This development reflects a shift in market posture, with some participants reducing exposure while others continue to increase their positions. Accumulation by Larger Holders Underscores Divided Market Strategy Contrary to the trend among some retail holders, wallet analysis suggests that large XRP accounts have expanded their holdings significantly. Recent findings show that major XRP holders accumulated roughly $7.7 billion worth of tokens between August and the time of the latest analysis. This divergence highlights a clear division between investors reacting to short-term volatility and those adopting a long-term strategy. MichaelXBT interprets this behavior as evidence that the current correction is functioning as a redistribution phase. In his view, the conditions resemble those that preceded XRP’s breakout in late 2024, when extended weakness prompted selling from less confident holders while long-term investors increased their exposure. Although he did not provide a specific forecast in his latest remarks, the analyst stated that XRP may again deliver a strong upward movement once the consolidation period concludes. Earlier this year, he described the next upward phase as potentially parabolic and weeks later asserted that XRP was unlikely to remain below the $4 range for an extended period. While short-term sentiment remains divided, his latest commentary suggests that he views the current correction as a possible setup for another major trend in the future.

This potential legislative breakthrough could finally bring the regulatory clarity that cryptocurrency investors and industry participants have been eagerly awaiting. What Is the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill? The digital asset market structure bill represents a comprehensive framework designed to establish clear rules for cryptocurrency markets. According to journalist Eleanor Terrett’s reporting, bipartisan senators are gearing up for substantive discussions that could shape the future of digital asset regulation in the United States. This legislation aims to address several critical areas including: Market oversight and consumer protection Classification of digital assets Exchange registration requirements Investor safeguards Why December Matters for Crypto Regulation The timing of these discussions is particularly significant. Industry sources indicate that a group of Democratic senators plans to conduct a markup of the bipartisan bill during the week of December 8th. A markup session involves detailed debate and amendment of legislation before it moves to the full chamber for voting. Moreover, Senator John Boozman, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has expressed his desire to conduct a markup of his committee’s draft bill in early December. This coordinated effort suggests serious momentum behind the digital asset market structure bill. What Could This Mean for Crypto Investors? The potential passage of a digital asset market structure bill could bring much-needed clarity to the cryptocurrency space. Regulatory uncertainty has been a major concern for both institutional and retail investors, often creating hesitation in market participation. Key benefits of establishing clear regulations include: Enhanced investor protection through defined rules Increased institutional adoption with regulatory certainty Market stability through standardized practices Innovation encouragement within clear boundaries Challenges in Passing the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill While the potential December discussions are promising, several challenges remain. The complexity of digital assets requires careful consideration across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. Additionally, achieving bipartisan consensus on specific provisions may prove challenging given the technical nature of cryptocurrency markets. However, the growing recognition of digital assets’ importance in the global financial system creates strong incentives for lawmakers to find common ground. The digital asset market structure bill represents a crucial step toward integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial landscape. The Path Forward for Crypto Regulation As December approaches, all eyes will be on the Senate’s progress with the digital asset market structure bill. Successful markup sessions could pave the way for full chamber consideration in 2024, potentially establishing the United States as a leader in balanced digital asset regulation. The outcome of these discussions could significantly impact how cryptocurrencies are traded, stored, and regulated for years to come. Market participants should closely monitor developments around the digital asset market structure bill as they unfold throughout December. Frequently Asked Questions What is the digital asset market structure bill? The digital asset market structure bill is proposed legislation that aims to create comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency markets in the United States, addressing issues of classification, oversight, and consumer protection. When will the Senate discuss this bill? Industry sources indicate substantive discussions may begin in December, with potential markup sessions scheduled for the week of December 8th. Why is this bill important for cryptocurrency? This legislation could provide the regulatory clarity needed to encourage institutional adoption, protect investors, and establish standardized market practices for digital assets. Who is leading these discussions? Both Democratic senators and Republican members including Senator John Boozman, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, are involved in advancing the digital asset market structure bill. What happens after the December discussions? If markup sessions are successful, the bill could proceed to the full Senate for voting, potentially moving toward becoming law in 2024. How will this affect current cryptocurrency holders? Clear regulations could increase market stability and investor confidence, potentially leading to broader adoption and more secure trading environments. Found this information valuable?

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Crash To Continue If This Level Isn’t Reclaimed, Analyst Warns The launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF, along with rising on-chain activity and renewed retail enthusiasm, has combined to push DOGE into a breakout zone that analysts say could define its next major trend. As the broader crypto market remains volatile, Dogecoin is proving once again that its unique blend of cultural appeal and market structure can create outsized momentum. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Grayscale’s GDOG ETF Ignites Fresh Institutional Demand The biggest catalyst of the week is the debut of Grayscale’s GDOG, the first U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF, an unprecedented milestone for any memecoin. Listed on NYSE Arca with a temporary 0% fee for the first $1 billion in assets, GDOG offers regulated exposure to DOGE without the need for wallets or direct custody. Early inflows have already surpassed expectations, signaling significant institutional interest ahead of fierce competition from Bitwise, which is launching its own Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, later in the week. The ETF arrival comes as Dogecoin maintains its position among the top 10 cryptos, boasting billions in daily trading volume and a market capitalization rivaling that of established traditional companies. Analysts note that ETF access could unlock new capital from retirement accounts, advisory firms, and institutions that have been previously restricted from buying the asset directly, potentially reshaping DOGE’s liquidity profile. Dogecoin Price Momentum Builds as On-Chain Activity Surges DOGE’s price climbed over 2% to trade around $0.15, breaking short-term resistance as volumes exceeded $1.5 billion. On-chain data shows more than 1.5 million daily transactions, reflecting heightened network usage driven by low fees and rapid confirmation speeds. Technical indicators also reinforce the bullish turn, as the RSI has rebounded from oversold territory, while support at the $0.13 zone remains intact. Market watchers say a move toward $0.18 is possible if ETF inflows remain strong. The long-monitored $0.17–$0.16 support cluster remains the key downside zone that bulls must defend to maintain control. Memecoin Era Strengthens as DOGE Enters Regulated Finance Dogecoin’s ETF debut is more than a market event. It’s a cultural benchmark that cements the evolution of memecoins from online jokes to regulated financial instruments. With Grayscale securing first-mover advantage and Bitwise close behind, Wall Street has formally opened the door to a new class of assets powered by community identity rather than traditional fundamentals.

With the price hovering around the $87,000 range after a brief dip to $81,000, on-chain data, macro shifts, and ETF flows are painting a picture of both caution and opportunity. Whales Accumulate as Retail Capitulates New on-chain figures from Santiment reveal a sharp divergence between large and small Bitcoin holders. Since November 11, wallets holding at least 100 BTC have surged, adding 91 new large addresses even as prices trended downward. This growing whale accumulation has historically appeared near long-term market bottoms, suggesting that strategic buying occurs during periods of weakness. Conversely, wallets holding 0.1 BTC or less continue to decline, reflecting elevated fear among retail investors. Santiment notes that heavy retail selling often sets the stage for later recoveries, once large entities absorb the supply and market pressure eases. The pattern mirrors earlier cycles in which deeper retail capitulation preceded major trend reversals. Mixed Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Signals Several key indicators are offering conflicting signals on Bitcoin’s next move. CryptoQuant data indicate that Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio is dipping into its “green zone,” suggesting that risk-adjusted returns are becoming more attractive, similar to levels observed before major uptrends in 2019, 2020, and 2022. Capriole Investments’ “Bitcoin Heater” metric has also returned to deep green, suggesting strong potential for upside movement. Yet not all metrics signal immediate recovery. The aSOPR (Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio), a reliable cyclical indicator, has spent nearly two years consolidating without reaching the “red line” levels that marked tops in previous bull runs. Analysts warn that a decisive breakout of this long consolidation pattern is imminent, though the direction remains unknown. Macro Forces and ETF Outflows Fuel Uncertainty Arthur Hayes believes that Bitcoin may retest the low $80,000s but expects the $80K level to hold as firm support, especially as the Federal Reserve ends quantitative tightening on December 1. Markets are also pricing in a 77% chance of an interest rate cut at the December 9–10 meeting, driving renewed optimism across risk assets. However, institutional flows tell a different story. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has recorded a staggering $2.35 billion in withdrawals this month, its largest outflow since launch. The wave of redemptions underscores weakening confidence among big-money players amid price volatility and macro uncertainty. Even so, Bitcoin’s recent 1.3% recovery to $88K, alongside strong rebounds in Ethereum, XRP, and major altcoins, shows that buyers are stepping back in. Analysts warn that volatility will remain elevated, however, if whale accumulation continues and macroeconomic conditions ease, Bitcoin may yet defend the crucial $80K support and attempt another push toward the $90K barrier.

Recent trading activity shows XRP rebounding from levels below $2.00 and moving back toward the upper section of its current range. Over the last 24 hours, the token has fluctuated between $2.06 and $2.20, i ndicating increased participation from market participants looking to support further upside. The current price behavior reflects an improvement in sentiment following a period of volatility earlier in the month. Since the initial decline, XRP has gradually formed higher price points, although it has not yet surpassed critical resistance thresholds. Analysts are watching for additional confirmation before identifying this move as a sustained recovery trend. Technical Overview A broader assessment of XRP’s daily chart shows that the token is attempting to rebuild bullish momentum following a notable correction in mid-November. However, the Ichimoku Cloud continues to signal a challenging environment for upward movement. XRP remains positioned beneath the cloud, which means that the area above the current price still acts as a significant resistance zone. The lower boundary of the cloud is located near $2.24, while the upper edge extends toward approximately $2.38. As long as XRP remains under these levels, the cloud will function as an obstacle preventing a transition into a stronger bullish phase. A decisive break above this region would be needed before the asset can move toward higher targets such as $2.80. On the downside, immediate support is situated around $2.06, aligned with the current position of the Tenkan-sen. A decline toward this level may occur if the ongoing resistance persists. For a stronger bullish signal to develop, the Tenkan-sen must rise above the Kijun-sen, which would indicate a shift toward positive short-term momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) is presently at 47.83. This shows that selling pressure has eased following the recent oversold reading, but buying strength has not yet reached the neutral midpoint of 50. A move above 50 would represent renewed accumulation and increase the likelihood of a breakout attempt. Liquidation Trends Liquidation figures highlight notable changes in trader positioning over multiple timeframes. During the last 4-hour window, total liquidations rose to $989.38K. Although long positions accounted for $547.12K of this amount, short liquidations also increased sharply, reaching $442.26K. The data suggests heightened volatility affecting both sides of the market. Over 12 hours, liquidations expanded to $3.13M, with short positions experiencing a significant portion of the losses. Nearly half a million dollars in short liquidations occurred as XRP’s price began to recover. This indicates that traders anticipating further declines were forced to exit positions as the asset moved higher. The 24-hour statistics present a clearer picture of market pressure on bearish traders. Total liquidations surged to $13.54M, including $8.66M from short positions and $4.88M from long positions. This imbalance shows that market participants betting against XRP have experienced greater losses, suggesting increased strength from buyers even though the asset has not yet overcome the major resistance defined by the Ichimoku Cloud.

Dell booked $12.3 billion worth of AI server orders in its fiscal third quarter that ended Oct. 31, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Dell shipped $5.6 billion of servers and finished the quarter with a backlog of $18.4 billion. The company raised shipment estimates for the year to $25 billion from $20 billion. Rival vendors see AI orders soar amid fierce market competition Rivals such as Super Micro Computer and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have also seen soaring AI-heavy orders, as cloud providers and enterprises rush to build systems that can train more complex models. Market research companies estimate that global spending on AI servers could exceed $200 billion annually by the end of the decade — another indication of the fierce competition among hardware suppliers to secure long-term contracts with hyperscalers. Huge spending on AI data centers and work has fueled demand for machines made by companies including Dell, Super Micro Computer Inc., and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Inc. that use powerful chips to train and run AI models. But winning and filling those orders has led to higher costs for Dell, and the company is trying to make its AI server business more profitable. Operating margins in Dell’s infrastructure unit, which includes server and networking sales, were 12.4% during the period. Analysts, on average, said 11.2 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The costs of memory chips needed for servers and PCs are rising much faster than is typical, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in a conference call after the results were announced. “We’re going to do everything we can to minimize the impact,” he said. “But the fact is, the cost basis is going up across all products. No one is more unique than others.” Strong earnings and strategic leadership position Dell for AI growth Dell’s overall gross margin was 21.1%, compared with the average estimate of 20.4%. The shares rose about 2% in extended trading after closing at $125.92 in New York. The stock had gained 9.3% this year before the announcement of the results. Earnings, excluding some items, will be about $9.92 a share in the fiscal year ending in January. Sales are expected to be approximately $111.7 billion. In August, the company projected earnings of approximately $9.55 billion and sales of around $107 billion. Analysts, on average, projected a profit of $9.55 a share on revenue of $107.9 billion. “AI momentum is accelerating in the second half of the year,” Clarke said in the statement, leading to “an unprecedented $30 billion in orders year to date.” Total sales rose 11% to $27 billion in the third quarter, slightly below the $27.2 billion analysts had expected. Commercial PC revenue grew 5% to $10.6 billion but still fell short of consensus estimates. Earnings came in at $2.59 per share, excluding certain items, topping the projected $2.48. The company has also appointed David Kennedy as its Chief Financial Officer, following his interim service in the role. Kennedy’s permanent appointment as CFO occurs as Dell navigates increased demand and operational risks. He was in charge of financial strategy during the company’s restructuring efforts and will likely be key to steering long-term investments in AI infrastructure while hitting profitability objectives.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing about the dramatic Ethena USDe TVL collapse that saw over $7 billion vanish from the protocol. This stunning development raises crucial questions about stablecoin sustainability in volatile markets. What Caused the Ethena USDe TVL Meltdown? The Ethena USDe TVL catastrophe didn’t happen overnight. Several factors converged to create this perfect storm. First, the annual percentage yield plummeted from double digits to just 5.1%. This massive yield compression made the protocol less attractive to yield farmers. Meanwhile, borrowing costs on established platforms like Aave remained higher at approximately 5.4%. This created a negative carry situation where it became cheaper to borrow elsewhere. The Ethena USDe TVL suffered as investors sought better opportunities. How Did Leveraged Positions Accelerate the Ethena USDe TVL Decline? The yield structure shift triggered massive liquidations across the board. Many investors had employed looping strategies using sUSDe as collateral. When yields dropped below borrowing costs, these positions became unsustainable. Leveraged traders faced margin calls sUSDe collateral values declined rapidly Forced liquidations created selling pressure The Ethena USDe TVL hemorrhage accelerated This domino effect demonstrates how interconnected DeFi protocols can amplify market movements. The Ethena USDe TVL drop serves as a cautionary tale about over-leverage in yield farming strategies. What Does This Mean for Stablecoin Investors? The Ethena USDe TVL situation highlights several important lessons for cryptocurrency participants. Stablecoins promising high yields often carry hidden risks. When market conditions change, these protocols can unravel quickly. Investors should carefully assess: Sustainable yield levels Protocol collateralization Market correlation risks Liquidation mechanisms The current Ethena USDe TVL of $7.6 billion represents a significant cooling from October’s $14.8 billion peak. However, this recalibration might create healthier long-term foundations. Where Does Ethena USDe TVL Go From Here? Recovery paths for Ethena USDe TVL depend on multiple factors. Protocol developers might introduce new mechanisms to stabilize yields. Market conditions could improve, making current yields more competitive. Alternatively, investors might permanently reallocate to other stablecoin options. The Ethena USDe TVL story underscores that in DeFi, nothing stays the same forever. Successful investors adapt to changing conditions rather than clinging to past performance. FAQs About Ethena USDe TVL Drop What is Ethena USDe TVL? Ethena USDe TVL refers to the Total Value Locked in Ethena’s USDe stablecoin protocol, representing the amount of assets deposited by users. Why did Ethena USDe TVL drop so dramatically? The drop resulted from yield compression triggering liquidations of leveraged positions that used sUSDe as collateral. Is Ethena USDe still safe to use? While the protocol continues operating, investors should carefully assess current yields against borrowing costs and market risks. Can Ethena USDe TVL recover? Recovery depends on yield stabilization, market conditions, and protocol improvements that make USDe competitive again. What alternatives exist to Ethena USDe? Investors can consider other stablecoin protocols, though each carries unique risks and reward profiles. How does this affect the broader DeFi market? Significant TVL drops in major protocols can reduce overall DeFi liquidity and increase scrutiny on yield sustainability. Found this analysis helpful?

That’s exactly what’s happening in Goyang City, South Korea, as municipal authorities launch a groundbreaking cryptocurrency sales program that could reshape how cities handle digital asset enforcement. How do cryptocurrency sales work for tax collection? Goyang City has taken a bold step by opening non-profit corporate accounts on South Korea’s four major cryptocurrency exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. Starting in December, the city will begin transferring seized virtual assets from delinquent taxpayers’ accounts directly to its own exchange wallets. This direct approach to cryptocurrency sales eliminates traditional barriers that previously complicated digital asset seizure. The process involves several key steps: Identification of tax delinquents holding cryptocurrency assets Legal seizure authorization through proper channels Transfer of assets to city-controlled exchange accounts Strategic cryptocurrency sales to maximize returns Deposit of proceeds into the municipal budget Why is this cryptocurrency sales approach revolutionary? Traditional asset seizure faced significant challenges with cryptocurrency. Unlike bank accounts or physical property, digital assets require specialized handling and immediate action due to market volatility. Goyang City’s direct cryptocurrency sales method addresses these challenges head-on by establishing official exchange relationships. The city’s November 26th announcement marks a significant advancement in municipal finance technology. By creating non-profit corporate accounts, Goyang ensures proper legal standing for all cryptocurrency sales activities while maintaining transparency in asset management. What benefits do direct cryptocurrency sales provide? This innovative approach offers multiple advantages for both the city and taxpayers. The streamlined cryptocurrency sales process reduces administrative costs and speeds up revenue collection. More importantly, it allows the city to respond quickly to market conditions, potentially maximizing returns from seized digital assets. Key benefits include: Faster revenue generation for public services Reduced administrative complexity in asset liquidation Market-responsive timing for cryptocurrency sales Legal clarity through established exchange partnerships Budget stability through diversified revenue streams What challenges might affect cryptocurrency sales success? While promising, this cryptocurrency sales initiative faces several potential hurdles. Market volatility remains the most significant concern, as sudden price drops could reduce the value of seized assets before liquidation. Additionally, the technical complexity of managing multiple exchange accounts requires specialized expertise that municipalities might lack. Legal considerations around cryptocurrency sales timing and pricing also present challenges. The city must balance rapid liquidation against optimal market conditions while maintaining proper documentation for all transactions. Security measures for storing and transferring digital assets add another layer of complexity to the cryptocurrency sales process. How will cryptocurrency sales impact future tax enforcement? Goyang City’s cryptocurrency sales program could set a precedent for municipalities worldwide. As digital asset ownership becomes more widespread, cities need effective methods to include cryptocurrency in tax enforcement strategies. Successful implementation here might inspire similar programs across South Korea and beyond. The program’s success metrics will likely influence how other municipalities approach cryptocurrency sales for tax collection. Key performance indicators include recovery rates, administrative costs, and legal compliance. These metrics will determine whether this cryptocurrency sales model becomes standard practice or requires significant modification. Conclusion: A new era for municipal cryptocurrency sales Goyang City’s direct cryptocurrency sales initiative represents a significant step forward in digital asset enforcement. By establishing formal relationships with major exchanges and creating a streamlined seizure process, the city positions itself at the forefront of municipal cryptocurrency management. This approach could revolutionize how local governments handle tax collection in the digital age while providing valuable lessons for other cities considering similar cryptocurrency sales programs. Frequently Asked Questions Which cryptocurrency exchanges is Goyang City using? The city has opened accounts on South Korea’s four major exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. When will the cryptocurrency sales begin? The program starts transferring and selling seized assets beginning in December. What happens to the proceeds from cryptocurrency sales? All proceeds go directly into the city’s budget to fund public services and municipal operations. How does the city identify tax delinquents with cryptocurrency? The city uses legal channels and financial investigation methods to identify digital asset holders who owe taxes. Is this the first such program in South Korea? While other cities have seized cryptocurrency, Goyang’s direct sales approach through established exchange accounts appears innovative. What protections exist for taxpayers during cryptocurrency sales? The process follows legal seizure procedures, and taxpayers receive proper notification and can address any disputes through established channels.

The latest figures extend Solana’s streak of 20 consecutive days of positive inflows, marking one of the most resilient ETF runs seen in the digital asset market this year. the unbroken streak of daily inflows to the solana etf (topped off by a record day of inflows) is greatly under appreciated. thank you for your attention to this matter https://t.co/8ItbDL85JO — raj (@rajgokal) November 25, 2025 Solana ETFs Surge While Bitcoin and Ethereum Shed Billions in Monthly Outflows According to data from SoSoValue, the inflows were led by Bitwise’s BSOL, which drew $39.5 million on the day, the third-largest single-day inflow since the products launched in late October. That pushed total net inflows for Solana ETFs to $568.24 million since debut, while combined net assets climbed to $843.81 million, equal to 1.09% of Solana’s market capitalization. Source: SoSoValue The sustained activity stands out sharply against the broader market backdrop, where both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced weeks of heavy redemptions. Source: SoSoValue Bitcoin ETFs recorded a monthly outflow of $3.70 billion between November 3 and November 24, while Ethereum ETFs saw an outflow of $1.64 billion during the same period. Solana remains the only major asset to post persistent inflows throughout November, attracting $369 million over the past three weeks as BTC and ETH funds continued to lose capital. Analysts say recent flows point to a broader shift in how institutions are positioning themselves in the digital asset market. Solana’s ETF has performed far better than early forecasts, which expected slower traction amid the recent downturn. According to market researchers, the consistent inflows signal that Solana is increasingly being viewed as a “blue-chip” asset. They noted that this steady capital base could help provide support even as risk appetite across the crypto sector weakens. Observers also noted the growing number of traditional finance firms choosing Solana for tokenization efforts. Projects such as xStocks, which brings U.S. equities and ETFs on-chain, were cited as examples of rising institutional activity. Even so, analysts warned that ETF strength does not guarantee immediate price appreciation. SOL remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment, and any sustained reaction in the token may take longer to materialize. Solana ETFs Approach $1B AUM After Strong Weekly Inflows Across individual issuers, Bitwise’s BSOL remains by far the dominant product, with $567.10 million in net assets. Grayscale’s GSOL follows at $117.90 million, after taking in $4.66 million in new capital on Monday. Fidelity’s FSOL and VanEck’s VSOL also recorded some of their highest single-day inflows to date, with $9.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively, while 21Shares’ TSOL and Canary’s SOLC continued to report positive but moderate activity. Over the six-day window between November 17 and November 24, Solana ETFs added $177.93 million in new capital, rising from $390.31 million in cumulative inflows to $568.24 million. Meanwhile, the total AUM of Solana ETFs is nearing a major milestone. With combined assets now above $870 million, the products are on track to reach $1 billion in the near term. A new inflow catalyst is also approaching: Franklin Templeton’s Solana ETF , which has not yet launched, is expected to bring additional institutional demand once approved. The flows contrast sharply with weakening market conditions. SOL remains down 30% in the past 30 days, and recent trading has shown declining volume and negative perpetual funding rates. The token is trading around $137, down 1% on the day and 13% in the past two weeks. In January 2025, JP Morgan originally forecasted that Solana ETFs could see between $3-6B in inflows within their first 6-12 months. The bank re-evaluated its position in October, changing its projections to ~$1.5B in the first year. Technical indicators show that SOL is still locked in a broader corrective phase. Analysts tracking the asset’s Elliott Wave structure say the market may be moving through a deeper Wave C decline, with potential downside targets between $80 and $95 if current support levels fail. The token is also trading below its 200-day EMA, a condition often associated with extended consolidation periods.

This dramatic five-point decline from yesterday’s reading signals growing anxiety among crypto traders and investors worldwide. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market emotions, operating on a scale from 0 to 100. When the index hits extreme lows like 15, it indicates widespread panic and uncertainty. This comprehensive tool analyzes multiple market factors to gauge collective investor psychology.

When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaches extreme fear levels, it often presents unique opportunities for savvy investors. Historically, periods of maximum fear have frequently preceded significant market rebounds. However, understanding the underlying causes is crucial for making informed decisions. Current market conditions reflect several concerning factors. Increased volatility has shaken investor confidence, while reduced trading volume suggests many participants are sitting on the sidelines. Social media sentiment has turned predominantly negative, amplifying the fear cycle. How Can Investors Navigate This Extreme Fear Environment?

This decision followed reports indicating that the bank had abruptly closed accounts belonging to Strike CEO Jack Mallers, sparking tension in the crypto industry due to concerns about crypto debanking in the US. The latest incident involves Houston Morgan, who serves as the Head of Marketing and Protocol Relations at ShapeShift, a non-custodial crypto trading platform. Following the bank’s move, Morgan mentioned that Chase decided to close his business bank account on Friday, November 21. He also informed reporters that his personal account is next in line, scheduled to be shut down this week. According to a notable figure in the crypto industry, the bank’s move was conducted without any warning. Notably, Morgan lives in Los Angeles, a city in California in the US. On the other hand, ShapeShift does not hold its clients’ funds and operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Chase shuts down Morgan’s business account In a statement, Morgan mentioned that he received a text from Chase at about 3:40 PM PST on November 21. The text stated that the bank required more details from him and that his business account was at risk of being shut down. Morgan pointed out that such a move was unexpected, as no one had earlier contacted him about any issues with his account, reported a situation where documents were missing, or any unusual activity . Meanwhile, just after receiving the text from the bank, he noticed that he could no longer log into either his business or personal accounts at Chase. After this finding, Morgan stated that he immediately took action and called the bank to inquire about the incident. This took him around thirty minutes as he was transferred between various departments in Chase. These departments included: general support, business banking, and account review. Still, he claimed that no one gave him a straightforward answer. Additionally, no one in these departments requested details about his business or any supporting documents. Morgan expressed that he felt as if these people were passing him around without any attempt to solve his problem. Finally, he got the chance to speak to a representative in the bank, who was known as “Andre.” Andre openly told Morgan that a decision about the bank account had already been made, informing him that Chase was ending business with him to safeguard the institution of the bank, Morgan reported. “He couldn’t give me any more information because of policy. I wasn’t given a chance to fix anything, submit documents, or appeal the decision,” he added. At this point, Morgan mentioned that his business account, connected to ShapeShift’s DAO structure, was frozen. When reporters asked him about the total amount of money currently in the bank account, he estimated that it contained approximately $40,000 but could not confirm the exact figure, as Chase no longer provides him with access to his statements. Concerning the operations of ShapeShift’s DAO, it is worth noting that each workstream functions as its own unit. Morgan maintained a business account specifically created to handle payments and contracts related to his workstream. Therefore, this activity led analysts to conclude that the account was a type of ShapeShift account. Morgan further explained that he could use it frequently to carry out 30–50 transactions monthly. Andre warns Morgan about Chase’s plans on his personal account Morgan publicly stated that Andre had cautioned him that his personal account would be closed the following week during their call. As it had not been frozen yet, he was instructed to transfer his funds, which he did. Morgan said he was not aware of any other ShapeShift-associated accounts being affected yet, but hopes to ask his colleagues about it during a soon-to-be-held internal meeting. In the meantime, Mallers from Strike complained last week that JPMorgan Chase had closed down his accounts and rejected some deposits to Strike, saying the business was participating in fraudulent activities. This situation prompted US Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming to weigh in on the topic of discussion. Lummis remarked that these closures illustrate that “Operation Chokepoint 2.0 unfortunately continues,” and said that actions of this nature “undermine trust in traditional banks and push the digital asset industry overseas.” These events occurred even after a recent executive order from President Donald Trump telling federal regulators not to penalize banks working with crypto firms.

The cryptocurrency fell from $106,000 to $80,600 in just 10 days, prompting renewed speculation over whether BTC has reached a local bottom. The rebound comes even as major whale holders continue to sell their BTC, though mid-sized holders and long-term accumulators are showing increased conviction in the market. Accumulation and Distribution Patterns Onchain analytics reveal significant differences in behavior between various BTC holder cohorts. Wallets holding more than 10,000 BTC, along with institutional investors holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, acted as consistent sellers during the correction, contributing to downward pressure. Retail wallets, defined as holding less than 10 BTC, also sold off over the past 60 days, providing little market support. In contrast, mid-sized holders in the 10–100 BTC and 100–1,000 BTC ranges accumulated BTC, helping absorb sell-side pressure and stabilize prices. Demand from Bitcoin “accumulator addresses” hit a record 365,000 BTC on Nov. 23, up from 254,000 BTC on Nov. 1, indicating growing long-term confidence among certain investors. Futures Market and Short Squeeze Potential The recent BTC crash was largely fueled by futures markets , where cascading long liquidations, forced selling, and margin calls pushed BTC into the $80,000 range. CryptoQuant data shows that traders attempting to long the correction have been squeezed out, with daily funding rates briefly turning negative. Analyst Darkfost warned that if shorts continue to pile up while BTC gradually rises, the market could enter a “disbelief phase,” creating the conditions for a sharp short squeeze. Long liquidation heatmaps from Hyblock Capital indicate $2.6 billion in long liquidations at $80,000, while short liquidations surged over $8.4 billion near $98,000, showing the influence of liquidity bands at $94,000, $98,000, and $110,000. These dynamics suggest that BTC’s rebound may continue toward the $90,000 mark as mid-sized holders and accumulators provide steady support.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-26 00:53:01

YBTC's upside is capped and downside risk is significant; timing entry is critical, and a small, gradual position is recommended due to Bitcoin's volatility. Compared to peers like YBIT, YBTC has a lower expense ratio more resilient performance, and is best used as a supplement for investors already holding Bitcoin. I rate YBTC a buy after Bitcoin's pullback, highlighting its income potential, tax-efficient distributions, and suitability for those seeking high-risk, high-reward exposure. Overview I've accumulated a plethora of these higher-yield option ETFs, but I've avoided many of the crypto-focused choices out there due to timing. However, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has recently pulled back nearly 30% from its all-time highs, and entry into some of these high yield ETFs seems a lot more enticing now. More specifically, I believe that the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ) is an attractive way to harness the volatility of Bitcoin and turn it into a weekly income stream. YBTC now offers a starting dividend yield of approximately 49.2%, with payouts being issued every Friday. Data by YCharts However, there are plenty of risks with a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin that should be considered. For instance, it's entirely possible that we see a continued decline further over the next twelve months. If the price of BTC continues to fall, the underlying NAV and payout amounts will also decrease for YBTC. So timing is very critical when it comes to a fund like YBTC. For this reason, I have only initiated a very small starting position and will gradually build more shares over time. Therefore, I would consider YBTC to be one of the higher risk/reward assets within the Roundhill arsenal. Despite the risk, YBTC has proven its ability to provide favorable returns when BTC is rallying higher. While you would certainly be better off directly owning BTC, I believe that a strategic use of YBTC can help investors benefit from the ongoing volatility in the near term. The fund is still relatively new with an inception dating back to only January of 2024. YBTC has a gross expense ratio of 0.96%, but this may be worth it considering the yield that's paid out to investors. So let's start by taking a look at the underlying strategy that YBTC implements to generate its income. Fund Strategy According to the latest fact sheet , YBTC has total assets under management of $326.3M. The fund's ultimate goal is to provide indirect exposure to the daily price movement of Bitcoin while also amplifying the income levels generated through the use of an option strategy. However, it's important to understand that YBTC technically implements a synthetic option writing strategy against Bitcoin. The term 'synthetic' simply means that YBTC does not directly own any Bitcoin. This can increase the overall risk profile due to the price volatility, but this can also allow YBTC to capture larger option premiums. As we can see from YBTC's holdings below, the fund holds no actual Bitcoin. Instead, YBTC is getting its exposure through call and put options written against the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), which does actually hold Bitcoin. So the fund is essentially selling Bitcoin ETF call options at a strike price that is out of the money. This OTM (out-of-the-money) strategy allows some capital appreciation to be captured during rallies. However, the growth is still capped at whatever the selected strike price is. For instance, the prospectus lays out the following tradeoff: If the value of the Bitcoin ETFs appreciates in value beyond the strike price of one or more of the Bitcoin ETF Call Options that the Fund has sold to generate income, the Fund will lose money on those short call positions, and the losses will, in turn, limit the upside return of the Fund’s synthetic long exposure. Roundhill Investments While the upside growth is capped by the options, the downside risks are not. Simply put, if Bitcoin experiences a large pullback in price, so will YBTC. Therefore, the primary risk is a scenario where Bitcoin pulls back even further. BTC is a highly volatile asset that is known for very large price swings. So despite BTC's price falling back below $90,000, it can easily go much lower. It's so hard to gauge these price movements because sentiment among crypto investors can shift so rapidly. Since the upside movements are capped, this means that YBTC is unlikely to recover all of its share price when BTC finally does bounce and rally upwards. As we can see below, YBTC basically follows the same price movement as Bitcoin, so it's safe to assume that a continued decline would result in larger losses for existing YBTC holders. This is why I want to emphasize that timing on the entry is very important. Therefore, I've opted to implement a dollar cost average approach starting with a very small position size, just in case the share price falls even lower. Data by YCharts Performance Risk & Comparison I also want to emphasize that investors that are bullish on the outlook of Bitcoin are likely better off simply owning the underlying. Since YBTC's growth potential is capped, it's very probable that YBTC will underperform Bitcoin during a rally. Additionally, YBTC's high dividend yield doesn't automatically result in a higher total return over time. Just to demonstrate this weakness, we can refer to the performance chart below. As we can see, YBTC's share price has fallen by 38.77% since inception. When including all distributions paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up above 43% over the same time frame. Meanwhile, BTC's price has increased over 103% over the same time frame. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend a position in YBTC if you aren't already exposed to Bitcoin in some capacity. Data by YCharts Therefore, it makes sense to utilize YBTC as an accompanying position, rather than a standalone fund. For instance, I currently own Bitcoin directly and have no intentions to sell. YBTC makes the most sense when utilized as a strategic way to harness the current volatility and choppiness of the price. Since the options will cap the upside growth, I believe that there are three ways to summarize the movement of YBTC. Bitcoin Rises = YBTC will underperform, but will provide attractive returns. YBTC's share price and payout amounts may rise. Bitcoin Trades Flat/Choppy = YBTC has the potential to outperform since the distributions can amplify returns. Bitcoin Declines = YBTC will suffer a large decline and payouts are at risk of being decreased. While there's a chance that payouts can help offset losses, YBTC will still likely lose value. Additionally, there are several peers out there that now implement a similar option strategy to generate income from Bitcoin. I believe that the most similar peer in terms of operating strategy and risk, is the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Strategy Income ETF ( YBIT ). As we can see below, YBIT is smaller in size since it only has $81.2M in assets under management, while also being less cost-efficient since the expense ratio sits at 4.76%. However, YBIT offers a slightly higher estimated annual distribution rate of 52%. Seeking Alpha These funds are very similar because YBIT also implements a synthetic option writing strategy to generate its income. Additionally, YBIT also issues payouts on a weekly basis. However, a quick performance comparison reveals that YBTC has been able to experience less of a price decline, while maintaining a higher total return when including all distributions. So despite YBIT's higher dividend yield, YBTC seems like the more resilient choice in the space. Data by YCharts Dividend Utility As of the latest declared weekly distribution of $0.2813 per share, the current dividend yield sits around 49.2%. However, the payout amounts are determined by factors like the success of the written options, momentum of Bitcoin, and implied volatility levels. Therefore, the yield is likely to be different by the time you read this article. Since the payout amounts are always shifting week after week, so is the estimated annual yield. Therefore, YBTC is not a great choice for investors seeking income reliability and consistent payout amounts. As we can see from the dividend history below, YBTC previously issued distributions on a monthly basis. The shift to weekly payouts only happened at the start of 2025. This weekly frequency can be appealing to investors seeking income flexibility within their portfolio. For instance, more frequent payouts means that investors have the ability to manually reinvest these distributions in other areas of their portfolio. Or perhaps these frequent payouts can be a supplemental income stream for retirees. Seeking Alpha However, we are talking about a distribution that is over 49%. I believe that if you time your entry correctly, investors have the ability to reach house money status within a two year time span. House money refers to the concept of receiving your initial investment back in the form of distributions. For instance, $10,000 invested is estimated to yield ~$4,920 annually. ~$4,920 X two years = $9,840 So within about a two-year time span, it's entirely possible to reach this house money status. Once this is achieved, an investor's risk profile is drastically reduced since the initially invested capital has been repaid. However, the investor would still own the shares that are consistently paying them income. Of course, this is a simplified view of the yield and this assumes that payouts remain consistent. Lastly, the fund seems to prioritize distributions that are tax-efficient. For instance, the latest section19(a) notice indicates that 100% of the latest payout was made up of return of capital. Unlike net investment income, return of capital distributions are not classified as income and therefore, aren't taxed as such. Instead, a return of capital distribution reduces an investor's cost basis and allows taxes to be deferred until the time of sale. However, it's important to note that the funding method for distributions change frequently, so there may still be tax consequences that investors need to consider. YBTC Section19(a) Notice Takeaway In conclusion, I rate YBTC as a buy at this time following Bitcoin's recent pullback. Although there can be further downside risk, I believe that this serves as a nice entry point for a smaller starting position. YBTC has proven that it can harness the volatility of Bitcoin and turn this into weekly income for shareholders. I believe that YBTC is the more compelling choice over YBIT, but the caveat is that a position only makes sense if you already hold Bitcoin in some capacity. Lastly, the distributions can be tax-efficient depending on their reliance on return of capital.",IBIT|YBIT|YBTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-26 00:54:39

This substantial Multicoin Capital AAVE investment comes despite the firm currently facing millions in unrealized losses, showing remarkable confidence in the DeFi sector’s future. What Does Multicoin Capital’s Latest AAVE Purchase Reveal? According to blockchain analytics firm EmberCN, Multicoin Capital acquired 60,000 AAVE tokens through Galaxy Digital’s OTC desk. This strategic Multicoin Capital AAVE investment represents their continued accumulation of the DeFi giant’s tokens. The firm has now purchased 338,000 AAVE over the past six weeks, demonstrating persistent conviction in their investment thesis. The timing of this Multicoin Capital AAVE investment appears counterintuitive to some observers. However, veteran investors often increase positions during market uncertainty. This approach aligns with traditional investment wisdom about buying when others are fearful. Why Continue Investing Amid Significant Losses? Multicoin Capital currently faces $13.5 million in unrealized losses on their AAVE holdings. This situation raises important questions about their investment strategy. Several factors might explain their continued commitment: Long-term vision for DeFi adoption Confidence in AAVE’s fundamental technology Strategic positioning during market lows Portfolio diversification across crypto assets The Multicoin Capital AAVE investment strategy suggests they see current prices as attractive entry points. Their consistent buying pattern indicates systematic accumulation rather than emotional trading decisions. How Does OTC Trading Benefit Large Investors? Multicoin Capital executed this Multicoin Capital AAVE investment through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter desk. OTC trading offers significant advantages for large-scale transactions: Avoids market impact from large orders Provides price stability during execution Offers privacy from public order books Enables customized settlement terms This approach demonstrates how sophisticated players navigate crypto markets differently from retail traders. The Multicoin Capital AAVE investment through OTC channels reflects institutional-grade execution strategies. What Does This Mean for AAVE’s Future?

Prices slipped below the $2 mark and recently hit about $1.83 before a small rebound. Volatility has been sharp, and many traders are being pushed into quick exits.

Fear is back, and it always hits those who don’t understand what it means to hold XRP. Most won’t survive the engineered volatility ahead. The system shakes out the weak long before real valuation even begins. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 23, 2025 Those swings left behind gaps in liquidity, including a zone around $1.98 to $1.99 that traders are watching closely. Price action has been messy but not one-directional. XRP was trading around $2.22, up about 1.8% in the last 24 hours, and in another snapshot it was reported changing hands close to $2.24 amid a rebound. Over the most recent 72 hours, the token posted a rally of more than 18%, showing how fast sentiment can flip. According to Aljarrah, fear has returned, and “it always hits those who don’t understand what it means to hold XRP.” The analyst pointed out that a good number of people will fall before they could even make it and “survive the engineered volatility ahead.” The system, he said, “shakes out the weak” long before actual market valuation takes its course. History And Psychology At Work Analysts and market observers point to XRP’s stop-and-go history as part of the problem. In 2017, the coin lingered for months before surging roughly 70,000% and then dropping by as much as 95% at certain stretches. In 2024, it traded quietly for much of the year before jumping over 600% near year end. That pattern makes holding the token psychologically hard for many. People sell too soon, often right before big moves. Support levels are being watched closely. Reports list key buffers at $1.95, $1.75, and $1.60. On the upside, some analysts are projecting a rebound to $4 by 2026, with longer-range targets of $13 and $27. Those are forecasts, not promises, and they assume steady market conditions and continued interest.

The sharp downturn has shaken investors who expected continued upside, and many analysts are beginning to argue that the cycle has already peaked. Price action remains fragile, with buyers struggling to regain control and momentum indicators pointing to exhaustion rather than strength. Yet, despite the bearish tone, there are emerging signs that the current phase may be approaching an inflection point. According to top analyst Axel Adler, both the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Index and the Futures Flow Index remain firmly within a bearish regime, signaling that market structure still favors downside risk. However, Adler highlights that Bitcoin is currently trading 11% below its 30-day fair value of $99.2K, suggesting a notable disconnect between price and underlying derivatives positioning. This divergence has historically appeared near corrective exhaustion zones rather than early-stage declines. Additionally, short-term dynamics across both indices indicate the first signs of an attempted reversal, with selling pressure slowly weakening and momentum beginning to stabilize. Bearish Structure Weakens as Bitcoin Attempts to Stabilize The daily Bitcoin bull and bear structure index shows a sustained shift to the bearish side since November 11, reflecting the strongest downside momentum of this cycle. The red BEAR line moved deep into negative territory at -36%, signaling persistent dominance of selling pressure. However, the indicator is now starting to reverse, suggesting that the most aggressive phase of bearish control may be fading. At the same time, Bitcoin is consolidating around $87,000 after briefly plunging to $80,000, marking an early attempt to stabilize and rebuild support following the sharp decline. Fast versions of the index highlight increased volatility, with the metric rising from -43 to -20 — a clear sign that bear pressure is easing. Although this does not yet indicate a trend reversal, it reflects a meaningful reduction in downside intensity. In the futures market, the index remains in a bearish regime as well, with values rising but still failing to break above the key 55 threshold. A move above that level would signal the first structural attempt to transition back into a bullish phase. The fair value level, currently positioned at $99,000, shows Bitcoin trading $11,000 below equilibrium, reinforcing undervaluation. Together, both indices indicate that the market is attempting to exit the bearish regime it has been trapped in for more than a month, though confirmation will require stronger follow-through. Weekly Structure Tests Key Support Amid Attempted Stabilization Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after a sharp decline from its all-time high near $126,000. Price is currently trading around $87,300, reflecting a significant drawdown of more than 30% from the peak. The recent candle structure highlights a temporary rebound after tagging lows near $80,000, suggesting that buyers have stepped in at a critical support zone. The 100-week moving average, sitting close to current levels, is acting as an important dynamic support and has historically served as a threshold separating bullish continuation from deeper cyclical breakdowns. Despite the bounce, the price remains below the 50-week moving average, which is beginning to curl downward, signaling weakening trend strength. Volume increased noticeably during the selloff, reflecting capitulation behavior and aggressive repositioning among market participants.

However, if selling pressure resumes and the price loses the 100-week moving average, the next downside magnet sits near the $75,000–$78,000 range. The weekly structure shows a market in correction but not yet in a confirmed macro reversal, with the upcoming candles likely determining whether the cycle continues or breaks down further.

BMNR's unique model accumulates Ethereum as a treasury asset, avoids debt risk, and recently initiated dividend payments, differentiating it from peers like MSTR. BMNR's performance is highly correlated to ETH price; technical and fundamental analysis suggest medium- to long-term upside driven by deflation, Fed policy, and L2 activity. Despite risks of further volatility, BMNR offers speculative growth potential if Ethereum recovers, but is best suited for investors comfortable with high-risk assets. Investment Thesis Ever since my last thesis , Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) shares have dropped 41%. My “Hold” recommendation was based on wanting to open a buy position at more favorable prices. In spite of all the hype around this asset, in my opinion, it was still overbought. One month ago, I thought that BMNR's price of around $50 was too high and not suitable for long positions. At the moment of this analysis, the price of the asset is around $29, which, in my opinion, is more than enough of a correction to open the previously desired purchases. At the same time, I initially expected a potential corrective decline in BMNR to the price range of $31–39 per share. But due to the more aggressive continuation of the downward trend for Ethereum (ETH-USD) on the daily chart, correction turned out to be deeper. At this point, I see a number of fundamental factors that suggest a potential recovery in the value of the cryptocurrency. As such, now my previous recommendation of “Hold” has been revised to “Buy.” What is Bitmine and what makes it unique? I wouldn't call Bitmine a unique project because it is essentially a copy of MicroStrategy (MSTR). The major difference between them is that each of these organizations has chosen its own underlying asset, on which it acts as a treasury holder. In MSTR's case, it's Bitcoin (BTC-USD), and in BMNR's case, it's Ethereum. Although Bitmine's fundamental business idea copies MicroStrategy's basic principles, it does have a competitive advantage that sets it apart from other assets. It is not just a bet on Ethereum, which is a major altcoin in the cryptocurrency market, but using the proceeds to purchase digital tokens of its own shares rather than corporate bonds, like MSTR does. By doing so, BMNR (at least for now) eliminates the risk of debt and possible insolvency in the future, which could arise for MicroStrategy if it is unable to pay its debts to creditors (because if the value of Bitcoin falls sharply, this could lead to significant financial problems). Bitmine's Ethereum purchase process began on July 8, 2025, when it made its first purchase of 1.15 million digital tokens. At the time, the ETH-USD price was around $2,500 per coin. Chart of ETH purchases for Bitmine reserves The main goal of Bitmine in accumulating Ethereum is to achieve a 5% share of ownership of this digital token out of the total issuance. The total ETH issuance as of November 22, 2025, is 120.69 mln tokens. Thus, 5% of this amount will be 6.0345 mln digital tokens. As per Bitmine's latest press release , they hold about 3.63 mln Ethereum tokens. That is, the goal has been achieved at 3% of the total cryptocurrency circulation in the network. Since I last published, their stake has increased from 2.8%, which is a pretty good result for one month. If we assume that the company will increase its share by 0.2% every 30 calendar days, then overall, the company will achieve an additional 2.4% share over the course of the year. So, considering the current level of 3%, Bitmine has about 10 months left to reach its stated goal of 5%. But I think these estimates for when the goal will be reached are a bit too optimistic. After all, most of the Ethereum buying happened in the last month or so. I doubt it'll keep up like that. However, the value of the cryptocurrency is falling, and therefore its purchase will cost less. But these operations require an additional issue of shares. And as the value of ETH falls, the BMNR exchange rate falls even more sharply. For instance, over the last month, Ethereum has lost 24.29% of its value, whereas BMNR has lost 45.67%. So, a 1% drop in the market cap of the cryptocurrency means a 1.88% loss in the value of Bitmine. In the end, the extra BMNR shares bring in less money, which is distributed for buying ETH. Bitmine's first financial report and dividend payment What makes BMNR more unique compared to MSTR and other cryptocurrency treasury holders? It's that they were the first to announce dividend payments on their shares. Those payments will only be $0.01 per share, less than 0.4% in annual yield. Still, it is the first indication that treasury holders can pay dividends to their shareholders. To me, this decision is more of a marketing move aimed at highlighting Bitmine's uniqueness. But this is just my opinion, and it is not negative, but positive. I don't mind such decisions on the part of the company's management, as this will only add support to the potential growth of BMNR's market value. The company also shared its financial results. The net profit for the 2025 fiscal year was $328.1 mln, which equates to $13.39 per share. Also, Bitmine said that Ethereum staking will start in early 2026. According to my personal opinion, this will give the company a return on digital token staking of about 2-3% per annum. The more detailed financial results are shown below and are taken from the 10-K. Financial results of Bitmine Assessing Bitmine shares through the lens of Ethereum's growth prospects I think the main assessment of BMNR's prospects should be done by looking at Ethereum's price. As Bitmine is the world's largest treasury holder of ETH, the market trends in the cryptocurrency market affect its investment appeal. In order to evaluate BMNR shares, I propose looking at the Ethereum chart. Let's first determine the global trend for ETH using technical analysis of the 1W time frame. Technical analysis of the Ethereum chart on the weekly timeframe On the weekly chart, we can see that a global upward trend channel has formed. The lower boundary was temporarily broken during the collapse of Ethereum prices from March 2025 to May 2025, after which the rapid growth phase began. The bullish momentum was formed at the moment of testing the support level of $1,521. As a consequence, price growth allowed the asset to move towards the upper boundary of the upward trend channel, thus testing the strength of the historical maximum level of $4,868. On the 1D timeframe chart, the Ethereum price shows an acceleration of the downtrend, though it matches the bearish momentum on the weekly chart. The confirmation of the acceleration of the downtrend is that the asset has broken out of the initial downtrend channel by breaking through the lower boundary in the price area of $3,200. At this point, we have formed a new downtrend channel with an initial high of $4,755. If we believe these factors, the price of Ethereum may fall further. The price range ($2,111 - $2,463) is the target. This is formed by a cluster of liquidity in the form of equal lows ((EQL)) in the period May-June 2025. Technical analysis of the Ethereum chart on the daily timeframe Considering this situation based on technical analysis of the Ethereum chart, I suppose that there is still a possibility that the value of the digital token will reach the target range of $2,111–$2,463. Taking the current value of Ethereum at around $2,950, this potential decline could still be between 16.5% and 28.4%. Considering that a 1% decline in ETH over the past month represents a 1.88% loss in BMNR's market value, that could lead to a 31% to 53.4% loss in Bitmine's price. Regardless, I believe that BMNR can be purchased today, since there are a number of factors contributing to the potential recovery of Ethereum's price as early as December 2025. 3 reasons for Ethereum's growth I want to briefly go over the fundamental factors that could cause the value of cryptocurrency to rise over the next month. Firstly, there is the impact of the deflationary mechanism on Ethereum. The point is that today we are seeing increased activity in DeFi, NFT, and L2 settlement networks. On this basis, the commission burning mechanism makes ETH more deflationary, creating a supply shock against a backdrop of increasing institutional demand, thanks in part to Bitmine and its stakeholders, Tom Lee and Cathie Wood (who recently bought 181,774 BMNR shares as head of Ark Invest). Second, I expect that the so-called “Santa Claus rally” may affect the cryptocurrency market for the first time. This is because it has become more correlated with US stock market indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq). The traditional trends might add some pre-New Year optimism and, most importantly, the expectation that the Fed will keep easing its monetary policy. As Ethereum is a high-beta asset, it might show ahead-of-the-curve growth, allowing prices to recover. Additionally, the probability of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points at its meeting on December 10, 2025, is 67.3%, while a week earlier the probability was only 39.8%. Fed Rate Monitor Tool Thirdly, the Layer 2 ecosystem is currently reaching its peak in terms of transaction activity. Ethereum is the settlement layer and the foundation for the functioning of this entire ecosystem. The rise in Total Value Locked in L2 networks can be seen as a fundamentally positive factor, which strengthens trust in smart contracts and the value of ETH itself in the eyes of users and investors. Therefore, the potential growth of cryptocurrency in December 2025 may be caused by deflation observed during high network load. Activity Layer 2 Risks of the investment thesis If the above-mentioned fundamental factors do not cause Ethereum to grow in the short term until the end of 2025, I anticipate a potential continuation of the downward trend. This could cause prices to correct further downwards to a price range of $15.5–20 per share. This would be due to the completion of the downward trend for Ethereum on the daily chart and a price rebound from the $2,111–$2,463 range. Conclusion In summary, the results of my fundamental analysis of Bitmine shares allow me to assess them as an active with potential for price growth in the medium and long term. In spite of the existing risks due to the negative impact of Ethereum's price environment, I think there are at least three fundamental reasons why we can expect the value of this token to increase. It will be primarily caused by deflation observed during high network load. Besides, I'm expecting a positive impact from the Fed's decisions, where interest rates might be cut as early as the December meeting. Moreover, according to my calculations, a 1% recovery in ETH could mean a 1.88% increase in BMNR. In summary, my recommendation has been revised from “Hold” to “Buy.” P.S. Do not forget that investments in assets such as BMNR carry an increased risk of market volatility. That's why buying Bitmine shares is a speculative venture. If such a strategy is not for you, ignoring such assets in favor of safer financial instruments would be the best solution",BMNR|ETH-USD,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-26 01:04:30
