The transaction serves as a move in state-level financial policy and sets a precedent for how U.S. public institutions may treat digital assets in the years ahead. State officials confirmed that the acquisition, valued at $10 million and completed at an approximate basis of $87,000 per Bitcoin, is the opening step in a reserve plan that has been under development for more than a year. Texas first allocation completed through BlackRock’s IBIT ETF According to Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council, the initial purchase was executed through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). At the same time, the state finalizes the process for direct self-custody. Information shared by Bratcher indicates that $5 million of the allocation was applied at the time of purchase, and the remaining balance aligns with the structure of the state’s broader reserve commitment. TEXAS BOUGHT THE DIP! Texas becomes the FIRST state to purchase Bitcoin with a $10M investment on Nov. 20th at an approximately $87k basis! Congratulations to Comptroller @KHancock4TX and the dedicated investments team at Texas Treasury who have been watching this market… pic.twitter.com/wsMqI9HrPD — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 Bratcher stated that Texas intends to self-custody its Bitcoin once the request-for-proposal process concludes. Until then, ETF exposure acts as the mechanism needed to initiate the reserve without delaying the legislative timeline. How Texas built its strategic Bitcoin Reserve The acquisition is preceded by legislative actions that occurred earlier this year. In June, the Texas governor signed a bill that established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , following lawmakers’ analysis of a proposal version during the last legislative session. The legislation was based on a bill submitted by State Representative Giovanni Capriglione of Texas, who suggested considering Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. The proposal outlined cold-storage requirements, minimum holding periods of years, and access to voluntary contributions made by Texas residents. It also allowed state agencies to receive cryptocurrency payments and convert them into Bitcoin for deposit in the reserve. This move by Texas occurs amid a period during which several institutional investors have grown their investments in regulated Bitcoin vehicles. The Harvard University Foundation recently increased its stake in IBIT to the highest point of investment, at $442.8 million, marking the largest single reported investment the foundation has ever made. Al Warda Investments of Abu Dhabi and Emory University have also increased their investment in Bitcoin ETFs over the past several months. Other governments explore Bitcoin-linked instruments The U.S. jurisdiction is not the only one looking into digital-asset approaches. New Hampshire recently became the first government to issue a Bitcoin-backed municipal bond in the world, which was issued earlier this month. The Business Finance Authority of the state sanctioned a 100 million conduit system, which enables private companies to borrow funds using the over-collateralized form of Bitcoin deposited in trust. In the arrangement, borrowers are required to pledge Bitcoin to the value of approximately 160% of the loan amount. The liquidation is automated to safeguard bondholders if the collateral’s value decreases. Fees, as well as any appreciation in the posted Bitcoin, are used to fund the Bitcoin Economic Development Fund in the state of New Hampshire. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Here’s Why BNB Could Plunge Even Lower",https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-price-prediction-missed-the-1000-exit-heres-why-bnb-could-plunge-even-lower/,"After hitting an all-time high of $1,370, BNB has reversed sharply during the latest market downturn and now the BNB price prediction is in focus. Is this just a healthy pullback, or the start of a deeper trend? On-chain data may hold the answer. According to BSC Scan, daily transactions on the BNB Chain have dropped significantly since peaking at 31.3 million on October 8. With network activity cooling fast, traders are watching closely to see whether BNB can hold its ground or if further downside is ahead. As of yesterday, the blockchain’s daily TXs had dropped by 50%. The reason? Traders were flushed out of the market by a cascade of forced liquidations. Network activity had been steadily growing amid the rising popularity of protocols like Aster, a perpetual futures trading platform that is now contending with Hyperliquid for the lead in this important segment of the market. In addition, Pancake Swap, the largest BNB-native decentralized exchange (DEX) for spot trades, has seen its trading volumes explode this year. As long as transaction volumes remain this low, BNB could struggle to make it back to $1,000 . In fact, the token could actually dip lower if it fails to recapture some key price zones. BNB Price Prediction: 20% Downside Risk as BNB Struggles to Clear $900 The latest price action has formed a falling wedge that could result in a bullish breakout down the road for BNB. However, momentum remains heavily depressed as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has collapsed near the 30 level. The token’s 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) could act as a strong resistance now, currently sitting at $883. Even if the price breaks above this wedge, the long-term trend remains bearish. Meanwhile, failing to recapture the $900 area could result in a move toward $750 first and then to $680, meaning a 20% downside risk. Paired with this on-chain sell signal (lower network activity), recapturing the $1,000 level seems difficult at a point when market sentiment is still heavily depressed. In contrast, top crypto presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) have been resilient to the latest downturn. This mine-to-earn (M2E) continues to attract investors as it makes crypto mining possible without hardware. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Gamifies Mining and Makes It Hardware-Free Mining cryptocurrencies is usually considered an expensive way to earn cryptocurrencies, but Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is here to change that. This mine-to-earn game reimagines crypto mining by letting players build unlimited virtual rigs and grow their digital mining empire with zero hardware or technical hassle. The more rigs launched and upgraded, the more mining power earned, and the higher players climb on the leaderboard. Top performers unlock airdrops of major meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Pepe ($PEPE) , adding real value to every upgrade. Even better, up to 70% of the $PEPENODE tokens used to upgrade rigs are permanently burned, creating powerful deflation and long-term scarcity. As the game’s popularity grows, $PEPENODE is shaping up to be one of the most promising opportunities in the next wave of crypto gaming. To buy $PEPENODE during its presale stage, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead. Visit the Official Pepenode Website Here The post BNB Price Prediction: Missed the $1,000 Exit?

These two launches mark a hugely significant milestone for XRP, initiating a phase in which institutional money could pile into the coin’s market, much as we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP had been suffering in recent weeks, along with the wider market, with negative sentiment dragging the coin down by 10% in a fortnight and by 17% in a month. However, the token remains up by 50% in a year, and with more XRP ETFs likely to follow in the coming weeks , the XRP price prediction looks incredibly positive right now. XRP Price Prediction: Trillion-Dollar Wall Street Fund Manager Goes All In – Could XRP Be the Next Institutional Favorite? In fact, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has predicted a surge of XRP ETF launches , providing this forecast last week, when Bitwise launched its own ETF for the coin. The pre-thanksgiving rush (shall we say, 'turkey trot'!?) for XRP ETFs starts now.. congrats @BitwiseInvest on today's launch! https://t.co/EgYVrm0TmM — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) November 20, 2025 Bitwise’s launch prepared the ground for yesterday’s listings, with Franklin Templeton and Grayscale joining what may be a race for institutional money. That three different asset managers have launched XRP ETFs so close together may indicate that they expect strong demand from institutions, and that their competing to capitalize on such demand. Either way, the launch of three ETFs is incredibly positive news for XRP, which is now showing some very strong momentum. Its chart today shows that it’s beginning to bounce after hitting a bottom several days ago. For instance, its relative strength index (yellow) has risen to 50 today, after touching an oversold 30 last week, Source: TradingView Likewise, it seems that its MACD (orange, blue) has also bottomed out, ready for a recovery as the XRP price rises. Of course, the overarching investment climate still remains fairly unsteady, given the fears surrounding the possible overvaluation of AI-related stocks. That said, Nvidia posted better-than-expected earnings last week (and a better-than-expected forecast), something which has helped to stabilize investor mood. And with asset managers now seemingly rushing to launch XRP ETFs, this could be a very profitable period for the altcoin. It could reach $2.50 in early December, while a rate cut from the Fed could even send it above $3.00 by 2026. A Layer-Two Network for Bitcoin? Why Bitcoin Hyper Could Be One of the Big New Alts of 2026 As promising as XRP now looks, it won’t be the only altcoin to rally during the inevitable market-wide recovery. It’s likely that a host of new alts will also do well in the coming months, including several promising presale tokens. One of the most interesting of these is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a layer-two network for Bitcoin that has now raised a very impressive $28.4 million in its ongoing presale. This is an encouraging figure for such a new project, yet it shows how the market’s faith in Bitcoin Hyper is growing. Hyper is getting HYPED! 28M Raised! pic.twitter.com/LxiuHbDpAH — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) November 19, 2025 As an L2, Bitcoin Hyper will enable investors to tap into the enormous value of the BTC hold, without having to sell their coins. Instead, they can bridge their BTC to Bitcoin Hyper’s sidechain, using the equivalent HYPER they receive with the L2’s ecosystem of apps. In other words, Bitcoin Hyper will enable traders to put their BTC holdings to work, wither by staking HYPER or by making use of the L2’s various DeFi apps. It’s worth pointing out that Bitcoin Hyper will make use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and of zero-knowledge rollups, providing superior speed, scalability and privacy. This will make it more efficient than preexisting sidechains for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network (which is primarily a payment rail anyway). This helps to explain why the token has raised so much in its presale, with investors able to join by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . HYPER is currently available at a price of $0.013325, although this will rise later today.

DOGE jumped 2.2% following the launch, as Wall Street’s growing appetite for crypto strengthens the case for a bullish Dogecoin price prediction . Grayscale secured the first-mover advantage, getting its fund listed ahead of competitors. While REX-Osprey recently launched a Dogecoin ETP, this marks the first pure spot DOGE vehicle to go live on U.S. markets.

I'm going with $12m. *33 Act pic.twitter.com/QbdLLxejhr — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 24, 2025 Alongside this new fund, Bitwise is also ready to launch its Dogecoin ETF this week. As the U.S. government shutdown has finally ended, a flood of altcoin-linked vehicles seems ready to hit the trading floor. Trading volumes have stood above average levels as buying interest seems to be increasing. A total of $1.5 billion worth of DOGE has exchanged hands in the past 24 hours. These volumes account for nearly 7% of the token’s circulating market cap. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Huge Rally Could Begin if $0.14 Support Level Holds The daily chart shows that DOGE has bounced off a key support at around $0.14. It now seems headed to retest the upper bound of a falling wedge that has formed as a result of the latest price action. Positive momentum could be picking up its pace, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) just stuck its neck above the 14-day moving average. The $0.18 area seems to be decisive in determining if Dogecoin is about to start its next leg up. If the token rises above this mark, it would break out of this wedge and could be propelled to $0.20 in the near term. This would mean a 33% upside potential. If momentum continues to build, DOGE could push toward $0.28 by year’s end, nearly doubling from current levels. In the longer term, continued adoption and fresh developments could pave the way for Dogecoin to make a run toward $10 . As meme coins begin to rally, early-stage presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are catching serious attention. It captures that early Dogecoin energy while building a tight-knit trader community where members share exclusive alpha, early setups, and high-upside plays, all before the rest of the market catches on. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Unite ‘Degens’ as They Prepare for the Next Big Pump Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is not just another Ethereum meme coin, it’s a trader-first project built for degens who want to ride early trends and capitalize on momentum. This community thrives on sharing trading setups , spotting exclusive opportunities before they go mainstream, and dropping real alpha , all while having fun in a high-energy environment. With competitions like Maxi Gains and Maxi Ripped , traders can earn rewards and climb the leaderboard while showcasing their best calls. To push things further, 25% of the presale funds will be used high potential trades, with any profits fueling bigger marketing campaigns and deeper reach. As meme coins heat up again, early-stage projects like $MAXI could offer the kind of upside legacy tokens can’t match, especially when backed by a tight community that knows how to spot the next move.

Before wider market FUD took over, the privacy coin narrative was gaining traction as the next major touch point for real-world adoption through tokens like Zcash. Vitalik’s recent commentary that “Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene” has revived interest, this time placing Ethereum in the conversation. Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 23, 2025 The argument arises in response to the recent breach of client data at major U.S. banks like JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley, first reported by the New York Times. The privacy narrative has found new relevance in this institution-led market cycle: Institutional use-cases need rails that offer privacy, yet are compliant with selective disclosure. In October, the Ethereum Foundation launched a new privacy-focused cluster and released initial details about Kohaku, a privacy-centric browser wallet and software development kit. This is a step towards an essay written by Vitalik in April, outlining a path for Ethereum to address the kind of structural data exposure seen in both TradFi and public blockchains. Ethereum Price Prediction: Could the Privacy Coin Narrative Boost ETH? As the native blockchain of potential privacy solutions bridging Web 2 to Web3, fresh demand stands to aid Ethereum in filling out the final shoulder of a potential bullish head-and-shoulders pattern. And with supportive momentum indicators and a decisive bounce from a historical demand zone around $2,750, it may have just hit its bottom. ETH / USD 1-day chart, bullish head and shoulders pattern.

The RSI has made a sharp bounce from the 30 oversold threshold after months of steady decline, while the MACD approaches a golden cross, readings that have historically marked local bottoms for the Ethereum price. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 90% move . But as the bull market matures, if Ethereum finds a bigger part to play in the transition from Web2 to Web3, the move could extend 250% to $10,000 .

This legislation will focus on modernizing the existing U.S. fraud laws so that they account for the role artificial intelligence technology has played in recent high-profile incidents where AI-generated audio or video tricked officials or the public. More about the bipartisan bill The bill, proposed by Representatives Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Neal Dunn, R-Fla., two lawmakers who have had enough of the ease and audacity with which criminals now use AI in their deceptive practices, seeks to expand penalties for AI scams and criminalize impersonating federal officials using AI. “As AI technology advances at a rapid pace, our laws must keep up,” Dunn said in a statement announcing the bill. “The AI Fraud Deterrence Act strengthens penalties for crimes related to fraud committed with the help of AI. I am proud to co-lead this legislation to protect the identities of the public and prevent misuse of this innovative technology.” Lieu agrees and last week, told NBC News that the majority of Americans want “sensible guardrails on AI,” as they don’t think a “complete Wild West is helpful.” Under the proposed law , the maximum penalty for defrauding is to be doubled from $1 million to $2 million in cases where AI is deliberately used to facilitate the crime. It would also include AI-mediated deception in the definitions of both mail fraud and wire fraud, which means it could be possible to charge individuals who use AI to conduct either type of fraud. In either case, criminals could get slammed with million-dollar fines and up to two decades behind bars for mail fraud and three for wire fraud. The draft also frowns upon the impersonation of federal officials with AI deepfakes , highlighting cases in which AIs were used in attempts to mimic White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this year. Fraud has been around for as long as humans have, but experts say that thanks to AI, the quality of fraudulent outputs has gone up. In December, the FBI warned that “generative AI reduces the time and effort criminals must expend to deceive their targets,” adding that AI “can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs for fraud.” Maura R. Grossman, a research professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario and a lawyer, also believes AI enables a new era of deception: “AI presents a scale, a scope, and a speed for fraud that is very, very different from frauds in the past.” AI models have become more advanced However, the fact that it facilitates crime is not the biggest problem. Observers are now worried that current institutions, like the judicial courts, are struggling to keep up with the rapid development happening in the AI sector. “AI years are dog years,” Hany Farid, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-founder of GetReal Security, a leading digital-media authentication company, said of the speed of AI progress. In the past, it was not too difficult to tell AI content apart from real content, especially where images were concerned; however today, they have become more advanced, and even the most experienced users now struggle to determine if a media piece is real or generated. The FBI’s warning in December advised individuals to keep an eye out for discrepancies in images and videos to identify AI-generated media: “Look for subtle imperfections in images and videos, such as distorted hands or feet.” However, Farid believes this old advice is wrong and even harmful. “The multiple hands trick, that’s not true anymore,” Farid said. “You can’t look for hands or feet. None of that stuff works.” Lieu and Dunn’s proposed bill lays emphasis on the importance of labeling AI-generated content. It also clarifies that there is a time and place for AI-generated media. For instance, if a content is labeled satirical, the tag clarifies it is not authentic and so is exempted from punishment. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Free-tier users will be limited to playing and sharing music within the platform. “This landmark pact with Suno is a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone,” said Robert Kyncl, Warner Music’s chief executive officer (CEO), in a statement . “With Suno rapidly scaling, both in users and monetization, we’ve seized this opportunity to shape models that expand revenue and deliver new fan experiences.” “Our partnership with Warner Music unlocks a bigger, richer Suno experience for music lovers, and accelerates our mission to change the place of music in the world by making it more valuable to billions of people,” Mikey Shulman, CEO, Suno, said, adding that “this means we’ll be rolling out new, more robust features for creation, opportunities to collaborate and interact with some of the most talented musicians in the world, all while continuing to build the biggest music ecosystem possible.” As part of the deal, Suno has acquired Songkick, Warner Music’s live music and concert-discovery platform, for an undisclosed amount. Suno’s settlement comes roughly one week after it announced it had raised $250 million at a valuation of $2.45 billion. The startup says nearly 100 million people have used its platform to create music over the past two years. Warner Music has now also settled with both Suno and Udio, with the latter also settling with Universal Music . SAP faces allegations of systematic theft On the same day Warner Music announced its settlement with Suno, a fresh case was opened in Dallas federal court as o9 Solutions accused SAP of orchestrating a campaign to steal trade secrets related to supply-chain management software. The lawsuit names three former o9 executives now in senior positions at SAP, alleging they downloaded over 20,000 confidential files before departing to join the German software giant. o9 Solutions, which is backed by KKR and General Atlantic and valued at $3.7 billion as of 2023, said it understood the importance of fair competition and employee mobility but could not allow its trade secrets to be misappropriated. o9 claims that SAP, facing customer losses due to its outdated platform, targeted the startup’s proprietary technology and has since altered its software to closely mirror o9’s offerings. The three defendants are Stephan de Barse, now president of SAP’s global business suite; Sean Zonneveld, now global chief revenue officer for procurement at SAP; and Stijn-Pieter van Houten, now chief product officer for supply chain management planning at SAP. “SAP is committed to the highest standards of business ethics and respects the intellectual property rights of others,” the company said in a statement. “We will review o9’s complaint and will respond, as appropriate, within the legal process.” Don’t just read crypto news.

This means that Bitcoin has risen by 1.6% in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum and Solana have risen by 3% and 5.5%. With the market beginning to stabilize after a difficult couple of weeks, now may be an opportune time to make some buys, before prices mount a sustained recovery. And one way of achieving sizeable gains during a recovery is to diversify into newer coins, with this article covering new ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , our best altcoin coin to buy today. Best Altcoin Coin to Buy As Cryptos Bounce – 25 November PEPENODE is currently holding its presale, which has so far raised in excess of $2.1 million, despite having been running for only a couple of months. The appeal of the token is already very clear, with PEPENODE offering users the chance to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, without having to invest in expensive mining equipment. APY so good even mother nature wants a taste https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/LUszW4YwYp — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 25, 2025 In the past, miners would have to buy and operate increasingly resource-hungry machines in order to mine coins, with only large companies now undertaking Bitcoin mining on a significant scale. However, all PEPENODE requires is that investors use the PEPENODE token itself to buy virtual mining nodes, which they can accumulate in order to grow their virtual rigs. The more nodes they own, the greater their rewards will be, with PEPENODE paying out mining yields in the form of external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe. Given that you will need PEPENODE in order to build a rig, the demand for the new token could also be substantial. What’s also interesting is that, after they’ve earned tokens from mining, users can sell their own virtual mining nodes to other users, and so on. This should help create a virtuous circle of buying, mining, and reselling, helping to support the PEPENODE price for the longer term. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE , with this supply allocated between rewards, development, its treasury, listings, and marketing. PEPENODE Could Go 100x in 2026: Here’s How to Buy Also bullish is the fact that holders of PEPENODE will also be able to stake the token for a passive income, with its staking protocol currently paying out an APY of 589%. While this rate will decline as staking numbers increase, it’s still a very generous rate, and one which could encourage substantial interest in PEPENODE. The token will list once its presale has closed, although investors can join the sale now by going to its official website and connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet). You can buy PEPENODE using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat currency, with the current presale price at $0.0011638. This will rise every three days until the sale ends, so interested buyers should act quickly or miss out on locking in the best possible returns. And because the market may begin recovering more vigorously once it launches, it has every chance of surging in the coming weeks, which is why it’s our best altcoin coin to buy today.

54897778,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90686,1764113414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Who Called 800% XRP Surge Shares New Insight,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-who-called-800-xrp-surge-shares-new-insight/,"XRP has faced sustained downward pressure in recent weeks, even though the broader market experienced intermittent recovery periods. Despite this weakness, a market commentator known as MichaelXBT believes that the asset’s current performance reflects a reallocation of value from short-term holders to investors with a longer outlook. His position draws from previous cycles in which XRP experienced long periods of stagnation before advancing sharply. Extended Price Weakness Despite ETF Launches Over the past seven weeks, XRP has closed in negative territory for six of them, with only the week of October 20 showing an upward movement, recording a 10 percent gain. During this period, the asset declined by more than 23 percent, although it began the current week with an 8 percent advance. This downturn persisted even after the introduction of multiple XRP exchange-traded funds, which have collectively attracted approximately $586 million in inflows since mid-November. I called XRP before it pumped 800% Many are once again losing faith in XRP That’s the purpose of this correction, It’s a transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient. XRP is ready to surprise everyone once again… That’s all I’m going to say. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) November 24, 2025 Even so, XRP is down nearly 17% for the month, indicating that institutional demand generated through the ETF market has not yet produced a noticeable effect on spot pricing. Some analysts attribute this to broader market weakness and uncertainty among retail participants. Analyst Revisits Earlier Successful Forecast MichaelXBT recently commented on the ongoing retracement by referencing his earlier analysis from mid-2024. At that time, XRP traded around $0.58 and showed limited volatility. He identified what he described as a multi-year consolidation pattern, which he believed could precede a substantial upside move. His assessment was followed by an extended rally, in which XRP rose from approximately $0.50 in November 2024 to $3.66 by July 2025, representing a gain of more than 600 percent. Market Confidence Declines as Consolidation Continues According to the analyst, XRP has once again entered a consolidation phase, and many traders appear discouraged by the lack of upward momentum. He stated that declining sentiment is contributing to increased selling activity, particularly among long-term holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Data from Glassnode indicates that profit-taking behavior intensified earlier in the year. On July 24, sales by long-term XRP holders reached an estimated $375 million, marking the highest level recorded in eight months. This development reflects a shift in market posture, with some participants reducing exposure while others continue to increase their positions. Accumulation by Larger Holders Underscores Divided Market Strategy Contrary to the trend among some retail holders, wallet analysis suggests that large XRP accounts have expanded their holdings significantly. Recent findings show that major XRP holders accumulated roughly $7.7 billion worth of tokens between August and the time of the latest analysis. This divergence highlights a clear division between investors reacting to short-term volatility and those adopting a long-term strategy. MichaelXBT interprets this behavior as evidence that the current correction is functioning as a redistribution phase. In his view, the conditions resemble those that preceded XRP’s breakout in late 2024, when extended weakness prompted selling from less confident holders while long-term investors increased their exposure. Although he did not provide a specific forecast in his latest remarks, the analyst stated that XRP may again deliver a strong upward movement once the consolidation period concludes. Earlier this year, he described the next upward phase as potentially parabolic and weeks later asserted that XRP was unlikely to remain below the $4 range for an extended period. While short-term sentiment remains divided, his latest commentary suggests that he views the current correction as a possible setup for another major trend in the future.

This potential legislative breakthrough could finally bring the regulatory clarity that cryptocurrency investors and industry participants have been eagerly awaiting. What Is the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill? The digital asset market structure bill represents a comprehensive framework designed to establish clear rules for cryptocurrency markets. According to journalist Eleanor Terrett’s reporting, bipartisan senators are gearing up for substantive discussions that could shape the future of digital asset regulation in the United States. This legislation aims to address several critical areas including: Market oversight and consumer protection Classification of digital assets Exchange registration requirements Investor safeguards Why December Matters for Crypto Regulation The timing of these discussions is particularly significant. Industry sources indicate that a group of Democratic senators plans to conduct a markup of the bipartisan bill during the week of December 8th. A markup session involves detailed debate and amendment of legislation before it moves to the full chamber for voting. Moreover, Senator John Boozman, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has expressed his desire to conduct a markup of his committee’s draft bill in early December. This coordinated effort suggests serious momentum behind the digital asset market structure bill. What Could This Mean for Crypto Investors? The potential passage of a digital asset market structure bill could bring much-needed clarity to the cryptocurrency space. Regulatory uncertainty has been a major concern for both institutional and retail investors, often creating hesitation in market participation. Key benefits of establishing clear regulations include: Enhanced investor protection through defined rules Increased institutional adoption with regulatory certainty Market stability through standardized practices Innovation encouragement within clear boundaries Challenges in Passing the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill While the potential December discussions are promising, several challenges remain. The complexity of digital assets requires careful consideration across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. Additionally, achieving bipartisan consensus on specific provisions may prove challenging given the technical nature of cryptocurrency markets. However, the growing recognition of digital assets’ importance in the global financial system creates strong incentives for lawmakers to find common ground. The digital asset market structure bill represents a crucial step toward integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial landscape. The Path Forward for Crypto Regulation As December approaches, all eyes will be on the Senate’s progress with the digital asset market structure bill. Successful markup sessions could pave the way for full chamber consideration in 2024, potentially establishing the United States as a leader in balanced digital asset regulation. The outcome of these discussions could significantly impact how cryptocurrencies are traded, stored, and regulated for years to come. Market participants should closely monitor developments around the digital asset market structure bill as they unfold throughout December. Frequently Asked Questions What is the digital asset market structure bill? The digital asset market structure bill is proposed legislation that aims to create comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency markets in the United States, addressing issues of classification, oversight, and consumer protection. When will the Senate discuss this bill? Industry sources indicate substantive discussions may begin in December, with potential markup sessions scheduled for the week of December 8th. Why is this bill important for cryptocurrency? This legislation could provide the regulatory clarity needed to encourage institutional adoption, protect investors, and establish standardized market practices for digital assets. Who is leading these discussions? Both Democratic senators and Republican members including Senator John Boozman, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, are involved in advancing the digital asset market structure bill. What happens after the December discussions? If markup sessions are successful, the bill could proceed to the full Senate for voting, potentially moving toward becoming law in 2024. How will this affect current cryptocurrency holders? Clear regulations could increase market stability and investor confidence, potentially leading to broader adoption and more secure trading environments. Found this information valuable?

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Crash To Continue If This Level Isn’t Reclaimed, Analyst Warns The launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF, along with rising on-chain activity and renewed retail enthusiasm, has combined to push DOGE into a breakout zone that analysts say could define its next major trend. As the broader crypto market remains volatile, Dogecoin is proving once again that its unique blend of cultural appeal and market structure can create outsized momentum. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Grayscale’s GDOG ETF Ignites Fresh Institutional Demand The biggest catalyst of the week is the debut of Grayscale’s GDOG, the first U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF, an unprecedented milestone for any memecoin. Listed on NYSE Arca with a temporary 0% fee for the first $1 billion in assets, GDOG offers regulated exposure to DOGE without the need for wallets or direct custody. Early inflows have already surpassed expectations, signaling significant institutional interest ahead of fierce competition from Bitwise, which is launching its own Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, later in the week. The ETF arrival comes as Dogecoin maintains its position among the top 10 cryptos, boasting billions in daily trading volume and a market capitalization rivaling that of established traditional companies. Analysts note that ETF access could unlock new capital from retirement accounts, advisory firms, and institutions that have been previously restricted from buying the asset directly, potentially reshaping DOGE’s liquidity profile. Dogecoin Price Momentum Builds as On-Chain Activity Surges DOGE’s price climbed over 2% to trade around $0.15, breaking short-term resistance as volumes exceeded $1.5 billion. On-chain data shows more than 1.5 million daily transactions, reflecting heightened network usage driven by low fees and rapid confirmation speeds. Technical indicators also reinforce the bullish turn, as the RSI has rebounded from oversold territory, while support at the $0.13 zone remains intact. Market watchers say a move toward $0.18 is possible if ETF inflows remain strong. The long-monitored $0.17–$0.16 support cluster remains the key downside zone that bulls must defend to maintain control. Memecoin Era Strengthens as DOGE Enters Regulated Finance Dogecoin’s ETF debut is more than a market event. It’s a cultural benchmark that cements the evolution of memecoins from online jokes to regulated financial instruments. With Grayscale securing first-mover advantage and Bitwise close behind, Wall Street has formally opened the door to a new class of assets powered by community identity rather than traditional fundamentals.

With the price hovering around the $87,000 range after a brief dip to $81,000, on-chain data, macro shifts, and ETF flows are painting a picture of both caution and opportunity. Whales Accumulate as Retail Capitulates New on-chain figures from Santiment reveal a sharp divergence between large and small Bitcoin holders. Since November 11, wallets holding at least 100 BTC have surged, adding 91 new large addresses even as prices trended downward. This growing whale accumulation has historically appeared near long-term market bottoms, suggesting that strategic buying occurs during periods of weakness. Conversely, wallets holding 0.1 BTC or less continue to decline, reflecting elevated fear among retail investors. Santiment notes that heavy retail selling often sets the stage for later recoveries, once large entities absorb the supply and market pressure eases. The pattern mirrors earlier cycles in which deeper retail capitulation preceded major trend reversals. Mixed Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Signals Several key indicators are offering conflicting signals on Bitcoin’s next move. CryptoQuant data indicate that Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio is dipping into its “green zone,” suggesting that risk-adjusted returns are becoming more attractive, similar to levels observed before major uptrends in 2019, 2020, and 2022. Capriole Investments’ “Bitcoin Heater” metric has also returned to deep green, suggesting strong potential for upside movement. Yet not all metrics signal immediate recovery. The aSOPR (Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio), a reliable cyclical indicator, has spent nearly two years consolidating without reaching the “red line” levels that marked tops in previous bull runs. Analysts warn that a decisive breakout of this long consolidation pattern is imminent, though the direction remains unknown. Macro Forces and ETF Outflows Fuel Uncertainty Arthur Hayes believes that Bitcoin may retest the low $80,000s but expects the $80K level to hold as firm support, especially as the Federal Reserve ends quantitative tightening on December 1. Markets are also pricing in a 77% chance of an interest rate cut at the December 9–10 meeting, driving renewed optimism across risk assets. However, institutional flows tell a different story. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has recorded a staggering $2.35 billion in withdrawals this month, its largest outflow since launch. The wave of redemptions underscores weakening confidence among big-money players amid price volatility and macro uncertainty. Even so, Bitcoin’s recent 1.3% recovery to $88K, alongside strong rebounds in Ethereum, XRP, and major altcoins, shows that buyers are stepping back in. Analysts warn that volatility will remain elevated, however, if whale accumulation continues and macroeconomic conditions ease, Bitcoin may yet defend the crucial $80K support and attempt another push toward the $90K barrier.

Recent trading activity shows XRP rebounding from levels below $2.00 and moving back toward the upper section of its current range. Over the last 24 hours, the token has fluctuated between $2.06 and $2.20, i ndicating increased participation from market participants looking to support further upside. The current price behavior reflects an improvement in sentiment following a period of volatility earlier in the month. Since the initial decline, XRP has gradually formed higher price points, although it has not yet surpassed critical resistance thresholds. Analysts are watching for additional confirmation before identifying this move as a sustained recovery trend. Technical Overview A broader assessment of XRP’s daily chart shows that the token is attempting to rebuild bullish momentum following a notable correction in mid-November. However, the Ichimoku Cloud continues to signal a challenging environment for upward movement. XRP remains positioned beneath the cloud, which means that the area above the current price still acts as a significant resistance zone. The lower boundary of the cloud is located near $2.24, while the upper edge extends toward approximately $2.38. As long as XRP remains under these levels, the cloud will function as an obstacle preventing a transition into a stronger bullish phase. A decisive break above this region would be needed before the asset can move toward higher targets such as $2.80. On the downside, immediate support is situated around $2.06, aligned with the current position of the Tenkan-sen. A decline toward this level may occur if the ongoing resistance persists. For a stronger bullish signal to develop, the Tenkan-sen must rise above the Kijun-sen, which would indicate a shift toward positive short-term momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) is presently at 47.83. This shows that selling pressure has eased following the recent oversold reading, but buying strength has not yet reached the neutral midpoint of 50. A move above 50 would represent renewed accumulation and increase the likelihood of a breakout attempt. Liquidation Trends Liquidation figures highlight notable changes in trader positioning over multiple timeframes. During the last 4-hour window, total liquidations rose to $989.38K. Although long positions accounted for $547.12K of this amount, short liquidations also increased sharply, reaching $442.26K. The data suggests heightened volatility affecting both sides of the market. Over 12 hours, liquidations expanded to $3.13M, with short positions experiencing a significant portion of the losses. Nearly half a million dollars in short liquidations occurred as XRP’s price began to recover. This indicates that traders anticipating further declines were forced to exit positions as the asset moved higher. The 24-hour statistics present a clearer picture of market pressure on bearish traders. Total liquidations surged to $13.54M, including $8.66M from short positions and $4.88M from long positions. This imbalance shows that market participants betting against XRP have experienced greater losses, suggesting increased strength from buyers even though the asset has not yet overcome the major resistance defined by the Ichimoku Cloud.

Dell booked $12.3 billion worth of AI server orders in its fiscal third quarter that ended Oct. 31, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Dell shipped $5.6 billion of servers and finished the quarter with a backlog of $18.4 billion. The company raised shipment estimates for the year to $25 billion from $20 billion. Rival vendors see AI orders soar amid fierce market competition Rivals such as Super Micro Computer and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have also seen soaring AI-heavy orders, as cloud providers and enterprises rush to build systems that can train more complex models. Market research companies estimate that global spending on AI servers could exceed $200 billion annually by the end of the decade — another indication of the fierce competition among hardware suppliers to secure long-term contracts with hyperscalers. Huge spending on AI data centers and work has fueled demand for machines made by companies including Dell, Super Micro Computer Inc., and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Inc. that use powerful chips to train and run AI models. But winning and filling those orders has led to higher costs for Dell, and the company is trying to make its AI server business more profitable. Operating margins in Dell’s infrastructure unit, which includes server and networking sales, were 12.4% during the period. Analysts, on average, said 11.2 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The costs of memory chips needed for servers and PCs are rising much faster than is typical, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in a conference call after the results were announced. “We’re going to do everything we can to minimize the impact,” he said. “But the fact is, the cost basis is going up across all products. No one is more unique than others.” Strong earnings and strategic leadership position Dell for AI growth Dell’s overall gross margin was 21.1%, compared with the average estimate of 20.4%. The shares rose about 2% in extended trading after closing at $125.92 in New York. The stock had gained 9.3% this year before the announcement of the results. Earnings, excluding some items, will be about $9.92 a share in the fiscal year ending in January. Sales are expected to be approximately $111.7 billion. In August, the company projected earnings of approximately $9.55 billion and sales of around $107 billion. Analysts, on average, projected a profit of $9.55 a share on revenue of $107.9 billion. “AI momentum is accelerating in the second half of the year,” Clarke said in the statement, leading to “an unprecedented $30 billion in orders year to date.” Total sales rose 11% to $27 billion in the third quarter, slightly below the $27.2 billion analysts had expected. Commercial PC revenue grew 5% to $10.6 billion but still fell short of consensus estimates. Earnings came in at $2.59 per share, excluding certain items, topping the projected $2.48. The company has also appointed David Kennedy as its Chief Financial Officer, following his interim service in the role. Kennedy’s permanent appointment as CFO occurs as Dell navigates increased demand and operational risks. He was in charge of financial strategy during the company’s restructuring efforts and will likely be key to steering long-term investments in AI infrastructure while hitting profitability objectives.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing about the dramatic Ethena USDe TVL collapse that saw over $7 billion vanish from the protocol. This stunning development raises crucial questions about stablecoin sustainability in volatile markets. What Caused the Ethena USDe TVL Meltdown? The Ethena USDe TVL catastrophe didn’t happen overnight. Several factors converged to create this perfect storm. First, the annual percentage yield plummeted from double digits to just 5.1%. This massive yield compression made the protocol less attractive to yield farmers. Meanwhile, borrowing costs on established platforms like Aave remained higher at approximately 5.4%. This created a negative carry situation where it became cheaper to borrow elsewhere. The Ethena USDe TVL suffered as investors sought better opportunities. How Did Leveraged Positions Accelerate the Ethena USDe TVL Decline? The yield structure shift triggered massive liquidations across the board. Many investors had employed looping strategies using sUSDe as collateral. When yields dropped below borrowing costs, these positions became unsustainable. Leveraged traders faced margin calls sUSDe collateral values declined rapidly Forced liquidations created selling pressure The Ethena USDe TVL hemorrhage accelerated This domino effect demonstrates how interconnected DeFi protocols can amplify market movements. The Ethena USDe TVL drop serves as a cautionary tale about over-leverage in yield farming strategies. What Does This Mean for Stablecoin Investors? The Ethena USDe TVL situation highlights several important lessons for cryptocurrency participants. Stablecoins promising high yields often carry hidden risks. When market conditions change, these protocols can unravel quickly. Investors should carefully assess: Sustainable yield levels Protocol collateralization Market correlation risks Liquidation mechanisms The current Ethena USDe TVL of $7.6 billion represents a significant cooling from October’s $14.8 billion peak. However, this recalibration might create healthier long-term foundations. Where Does Ethena USDe TVL Go From Here? Recovery paths for Ethena USDe TVL depend on multiple factors. Protocol developers might introduce new mechanisms to stabilize yields. Market conditions could improve, making current yields more competitive. Alternatively, investors might permanently reallocate to other stablecoin options. The Ethena USDe TVL story underscores that in DeFi, nothing stays the same forever. Successful investors adapt to changing conditions rather than clinging to past performance. FAQs About Ethena USDe TVL Drop What is Ethena USDe TVL? Ethena USDe TVL refers to the Total Value Locked in Ethena’s USDe stablecoin protocol, representing the amount of assets deposited by users. Why did Ethena USDe TVL drop so dramatically? The drop resulted from yield compression triggering liquidations of leveraged positions that used sUSDe as collateral. Is Ethena USDe still safe to use? While the protocol continues operating, investors should carefully assess current yields against borrowing costs and market risks. Can Ethena USDe TVL recover? Recovery depends on yield stabilization, market conditions, and protocol improvements that make USDe competitive again. What alternatives exist to Ethena USDe? Investors can consider other stablecoin protocols, though each carries unique risks and reward profiles. How does this affect the broader DeFi market? Significant TVL drops in major protocols can reduce overall DeFi liquidity and increase scrutiny on yield sustainability. Found this analysis helpful?

That’s exactly what’s happening in Goyang City, South Korea, as municipal authorities launch a groundbreaking cryptocurrency sales program that could reshape how cities handle digital asset enforcement. How do cryptocurrency sales work for tax collection? Goyang City has taken a bold step by opening non-profit corporate accounts on South Korea’s four major cryptocurrency exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. Starting in December, the city will begin transferring seized virtual assets from delinquent taxpayers’ accounts directly to its own exchange wallets. This direct approach to cryptocurrency sales eliminates traditional barriers that previously complicated digital asset seizure. The process involves several key steps: Identification of tax delinquents holding cryptocurrency assets Legal seizure authorization through proper channels Transfer of assets to city-controlled exchange accounts Strategic cryptocurrency sales to maximize returns Deposit of proceeds into the municipal budget Why is this cryptocurrency sales approach revolutionary? Traditional asset seizure faced significant challenges with cryptocurrency. Unlike bank accounts or physical property, digital assets require specialized handling and immediate action due to market volatility. Goyang City’s direct cryptocurrency sales method addresses these challenges head-on by establishing official exchange relationships. The city’s November 26th announcement marks a significant advancement in municipal finance technology. By creating non-profit corporate accounts, Goyang ensures proper legal standing for all cryptocurrency sales activities while maintaining transparency in asset management. What benefits do direct cryptocurrency sales provide? This innovative approach offers multiple advantages for both the city and taxpayers. The streamlined cryptocurrency sales process reduces administrative costs and speeds up revenue collection. More importantly, it allows the city to respond quickly to market conditions, potentially maximizing returns from seized digital assets. Key benefits include: Faster revenue generation for public services Reduced administrative complexity in asset liquidation Market-responsive timing for cryptocurrency sales Legal clarity through established exchange partnerships Budget stability through diversified revenue streams What challenges might affect cryptocurrency sales success? While promising, this cryptocurrency sales initiative faces several potential hurdles. Market volatility remains the most significant concern, as sudden price drops could reduce the value of seized assets before liquidation. Additionally, the technical complexity of managing multiple exchange accounts requires specialized expertise that municipalities might lack. Legal considerations around cryptocurrency sales timing and pricing also present challenges. The city must balance rapid liquidation against optimal market conditions while maintaining proper documentation for all transactions. Security measures for storing and transferring digital assets add another layer of complexity to the cryptocurrency sales process. How will cryptocurrency sales impact future tax enforcement? Goyang City’s cryptocurrency sales program could set a precedent for municipalities worldwide. As digital asset ownership becomes more widespread, cities need effective methods to include cryptocurrency in tax enforcement strategies. Successful implementation here might inspire similar programs across South Korea and beyond. The program’s success metrics will likely influence how other municipalities approach cryptocurrency sales for tax collection. Key performance indicators include recovery rates, administrative costs, and legal compliance. These metrics will determine whether this cryptocurrency sales model becomes standard practice or requires significant modification. Conclusion: A new era for municipal cryptocurrency sales Goyang City’s direct cryptocurrency sales initiative represents a significant step forward in digital asset enforcement. By establishing formal relationships with major exchanges and creating a streamlined seizure process, the city positions itself at the forefront of municipal cryptocurrency management. This approach could revolutionize how local governments handle tax collection in the digital age while providing valuable lessons for other cities considering similar cryptocurrency sales programs. Frequently Asked Questions Which cryptocurrency exchanges is Goyang City using? The city has opened accounts on South Korea’s four major exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. When will the cryptocurrency sales begin? The program starts transferring and selling seized assets beginning in December. What happens to the proceeds from cryptocurrency sales? All proceeds go directly into the city’s budget to fund public services and municipal operations. How does the city identify tax delinquents with cryptocurrency? The city uses legal channels and financial investigation methods to identify digital asset holders who owe taxes. Is this the first such program in South Korea? While other cities have seized cryptocurrency, Goyang’s direct sales approach through established exchange accounts appears innovative. What protections exist for taxpayers during cryptocurrency sales? The process follows legal seizure procedures, and taxpayers receive proper notification and can address any disputes through established channels.

The latest figures extend Solana’s streak of 20 consecutive days of positive inflows, marking one of the most resilient ETF runs seen in the digital asset market this year. the unbroken streak of daily inflows to the solana etf (topped off by a record day of inflows) is greatly under appreciated. thank you for your attention to this matter https://t.co/8ItbDL85JO — raj (@rajgokal) November 25, 2025 Solana ETFs Surge While Bitcoin and Ethereum Shed Billions in Monthly Outflows According to data from SoSoValue, the inflows were led by Bitwise’s BSOL, which drew $39.5 million on the day, the third-largest single-day inflow since the products launched in late October. That pushed total net inflows for Solana ETFs to $568.24 million since debut, while combined net assets climbed to $843.81 million, equal to 1.09% of Solana’s market capitalization. Source: SoSoValue The sustained activity stands out sharply against the broader market backdrop, where both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced weeks of heavy redemptions. Source: SoSoValue Bitcoin ETFs recorded a monthly outflow of $3.70 billion between November 3 and November 24, while Ethereum ETFs saw an outflow of $1.64 billion during the same period. Solana remains the only major asset to post persistent inflows throughout November, attracting $369 million over the past three weeks as BTC and ETH funds continued to lose capital. Analysts say recent flows point to a broader shift in how institutions are positioning themselves in the digital asset market. Solana’s ETF has performed far better than early forecasts, which expected slower traction amid the recent downturn. According to market researchers, the consistent inflows signal that Solana is increasingly being viewed as a “blue-chip” asset. They noted that this steady capital base could help provide support even as risk appetite across the crypto sector weakens. Observers also noted the growing number of traditional finance firms choosing Solana for tokenization efforts. Projects such as xStocks, which brings U.S. equities and ETFs on-chain, were cited as examples of rising institutional activity. Even so, analysts warned that ETF strength does not guarantee immediate price appreciation. SOL remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment, and any sustained reaction in the token may take longer to materialize. Solana ETFs Approach $1B AUM After Strong Weekly Inflows Across individual issuers, Bitwise’s BSOL remains by far the dominant product, with $567.10 million in net assets. Grayscale’s GSOL follows at $117.90 million, after taking in $4.66 million in new capital on Monday. Fidelity’s FSOL and VanEck’s VSOL also recorded some of their highest single-day inflows to date, with $9.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively, while 21Shares’ TSOL and Canary’s SOLC continued to report positive but moderate activity. Over the six-day window between November 17 and November 24, Solana ETFs added $177.93 million in new capital, rising from $390.31 million in cumulative inflows to $568.24 million. Meanwhile, the total AUM of Solana ETFs is nearing a major milestone. With combined assets now above $870 million, the products are on track to reach $1 billion in the near term. A new inflow catalyst is also approaching: Franklin Templeton’s Solana ETF , which has not yet launched, is expected to bring additional institutional demand once approved. The flows contrast sharply with weakening market conditions. SOL remains down 30% in the past 30 days, and recent trading has shown declining volume and negative perpetual funding rates. The token is trading around $137, down 1% on the day and 13% in the past two weeks. In January 2025, JP Morgan originally forecasted that Solana ETFs could see between $3-6B in inflows within their first 6-12 months. The bank re-evaluated its position in October, changing its projections to ~$1.5B in the first year. Technical indicators show that SOL is still locked in a broader corrective phase. Analysts tracking the asset’s Elliott Wave structure say the market may be moving through a deeper Wave C decline, with potential downside targets between $80 and $95 if current support levels fail. The token is also trading below its 200-day EMA, a condition often associated with extended consolidation periods.

This dramatic five-point decline from yesterday’s reading signals growing anxiety among crypto traders and investors worldwide. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market emotions, operating on a scale from 0 to 100. When the index hits extreme lows like 15, it indicates widespread panic and uncertainty. This comprehensive tool analyzes multiple market factors to gauge collective investor psychology.

When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaches extreme fear levels, it often presents unique opportunities for savvy investors. Historically, periods of maximum fear have frequently preceded significant market rebounds. However, understanding the underlying causes is crucial for making informed decisions. Current market conditions reflect several concerning factors. Increased volatility has shaken investor confidence, while reduced trading volume suggests many participants are sitting on the sidelines. Social media sentiment has turned predominantly negative, amplifying the fear cycle. How Can Investors Navigate This Extreme Fear Environment?

This decision followed reports indicating that the bank had abruptly closed accounts belonging to Strike CEO Jack Mallers, sparking tension in the crypto industry due to concerns about crypto debanking in the US. The latest incident involves Houston Morgan, who serves as the Head of Marketing and Protocol Relations at ShapeShift, a non-custodial crypto trading platform. Following the bank’s move, Morgan mentioned that Chase decided to close his business bank account on Friday, November 21. He also informed reporters that his personal account is next in line, scheduled to be shut down this week. According to a notable figure in the crypto industry, the bank’s move was conducted without any warning. Notably, Morgan lives in Los Angeles, a city in California in the US. On the other hand, ShapeShift does not hold its clients’ funds and operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Chase shuts down Morgan’s business account In a statement, Morgan mentioned that he received a text from Chase at about 3:40 PM PST on November 21. The text stated that the bank required more details from him and that his business account was at risk of being shut down. Morgan pointed out that such a move was unexpected, as no one had earlier contacted him about any issues with his account, reported a situation where documents were missing, or any unusual activity . Meanwhile, just after receiving the text from the bank, he noticed that he could no longer log into either his business or personal accounts at Chase. After this finding, Morgan stated that he immediately took action and called the bank to inquire about the incident. This took him around thirty minutes as he was transferred between various departments in Chase. These departments included: general support, business banking, and account review. Still, he claimed that no one gave him a straightforward answer. Additionally, no one in these departments requested details about his business or any supporting documents. Morgan expressed that he felt as if these people were passing him around without any attempt to solve his problem. Finally, he got the chance to speak to a representative in the bank, who was known as “Andre.” Andre openly told Morgan that a decision about the bank account had already been made, informing him that Chase was ending business with him to safeguard the institution of the bank, Morgan reported. “He couldn’t give me any more information because of policy. I wasn’t given a chance to fix anything, submit documents, or appeal the decision,” he added. At this point, Morgan mentioned that his business account, connected to ShapeShift’s DAO structure, was frozen. When reporters asked him about the total amount of money currently in the bank account, he estimated that it contained approximately $40,000 but could not confirm the exact figure, as Chase no longer provides him with access to his statements. Concerning the operations of ShapeShift’s DAO, it is worth noting that each workstream functions as its own unit. Morgan maintained a business account specifically created to handle payments and contracts related to his workstream. Therefore, this activity led analysts to conclude that the account was a type of ShapeShift account. Morgan further explained that he could use it frequently to carry out 30–50 transactions monthly. Andre warns Morgan about Chase’s plans on his personal account Morgan publicly stated that Andre had cautioned him that his personal account would be closed the following week during their call. As it had not been frozen yet, he was instructed to transfer his funds, which he did. Morgan said he was not aware of any other ShapeShift-associated accounts being affected yet, but hopes to ask his colleagues about it during a soon-to-be-held internal meeting. In the meantime, Mallers from Strike complained last week that JPMorgan Chase had closed down his accounts and rejected some deposits to Strike, saying the business was participating in fraudulent activities. This situation prompted US Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming to weigh in on the topic of discussion. Lummis remarked that these closures illustrate that “Operation Chokepoint 2.0 unfortunately continues,” and said that actions of this nature “undermine trust in traditional banks and push the digital asset industry overseas.” These events occurred even after a recent executive order from President Donald Trump telling federal regulators not to penalize banks working with crypto firms.

The cryptocurrency fell from $106,000 to $80,600 in just 10 days, prompting renewed speculation over whether BTC has reached a local bottom. The rebound comes even as major whale holders continue to sell their BTC, though mid-sized holders and long-term accumulators are showing increased conviction in the market. Accumulation and Distribution Patterns Onchain analytics reveal significant differences in behavior between various BTC holder cohorts. Wallets holding more than 10,000 BTC, along with institutional investors holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, acted as consistent sellers during the correction, contributing to downward pressure. Retail wallets, defined as holding less than 10 BTC, also sold off over the past 60 days, providing little market support. In contrast, mid-sized holders in the 10–100 BTC and 100–1,000 BTC ranges accumulated BTC, helping absorb sell-side pressure and stabilize prices. Demand from Bitcoin “accumulator addresses” hit a record 365,000 BTC on Nov. 23, up from 254,000 BTC on Nov. 1, indicating growing long-term confidence among certain investors. Futures Market and Short Squeeze Potential The recent BTC crash was largely fueled by futures markets , where cascading long liquidations, forced selling, and margin calls pushed BTC into the $80,000 range. CryptoQuant data shows that traders attempting to long the correction have been squeezed out, with daily funding rates briefly turning negative. Analyst Darkfost warned that if shorts continue to pile up while BTC gradually rises, the market could enter a “disbelief phase,” creating the conditions for a sharp short squeeze. Long liquidation heatmaps from Hyblock Capital indicate $2.6 billion in long liquidations at $80,000, while short liquidations surged over $8.4 billion near $98,000, showing the influence of liquidity bands at $94,000, $98,000, and $110,000. These dynamics suggest that BTC’s rebound may continue toward the $90,000 mark as mid-sized holders and accumulators provide steady support.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-26 00:53:01

YBTC's upside is capped and downside risk is significant; timing entry is critical, and a small, gradual position is recommended due to Bitcoin's volatility. Compared to peers like YBIT, YBTC has a lower expense ratio more resilient performance, and is best used as a supplement for investors already holding Bitcoin. I rate YBTC a buy after Bitcoin's pullback, highlighting its income potential, tax-efficient distributions, and suitability for those seeking high-risk, high-reward exposure. Overview I've accumulated a plethora of these higher-yield option ETFs, but I've avoided many of the crypto-focused choices out there due to timing. However, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has recently pulled back nearly 30% from its all-time highs, and entry into some of these high yield ETFs seems a lot more enticing now. More specifically, I believe that the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ) is an attractive way to harness the volatility of Bitcoin and turn it into a weekly income stream. YBTC now offers a starting dividend yield of approximately 49.2%, with payouts being issued every Friday. Data by YCharts However, there are plenty of risks with a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin that should be considered. For instance, it's entirely possible that we see a continued decline further over the next twelve months. If the price of BTC continues to fall, the underlying NAV and payout amounts will also decrease for YBTC. So timing is very critical when it comes to a fund like YBTC. For this reason, I have only initiated a very small starting position and will gradually build more shares over time. Therefore, I would consider YBTC to be one of the higher risk/reward assets within the Roundhill arsenal. Despite the risk, YBTC has proven its ability to provide favorable returns when BTC is rallying higher. While you would certainly be better off directly owning BTC, I believe that a strategic use of YBTC can help investors benefit from the ongoing volatility in the near term. The fund is still relatively new with an inception dating back to only January of 2024. YBTC has a gross expense ratio of 0.96%, but this may be worth it considering the yield that's paid out to investors. So let's start by taking a look at the underlying strategy that YBTC implements to generate its income. Fund Strategy According to the latest fact sheet , YBTC has total assets under management of $326.3M. The fund's ultimate goal is to provide indirect exposure to the daily price movement of Bitcoin while also amplifying the income levels generated through the use of an option strategy. However, it's important to understand that YBTC technically implements a synthetic option writing strategy against Bitcoin. The term 'synthetic' simply means that YBTC does not directly own any Bitcoin. This can increase the overall risk profile due to the price volatility, but this can also allow YBTC to capture larger option premiums. As we can see from YBTC's holdings below, the fund holds no actual Bitcoin. Instead, YBTC is getting its exposure through call and put options written against the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), which does actually hold Bitcoin. So the fund is essentially selling Bitcoin ETF call options at a strike price that is out of the money. This OTM (out-of-the-money) strategy allows some capital appreciation to be captured during rallies. However, the growth is still capped at whatever the selected strike price is. For instance, the prospectus lays out the following tradeoff: If the value of the Bitcoin ETFs appreciates in value beyond the strike price of one or more of the Bitcoin ETF Call Options that the Fund has sold to generate income, the Fund will lose money on those short call positions, and the losses will, in turn, limit the upside return of the Fund’s synthetic long exposure. Roundhill Investments While the upside growth is capped by the options, the downside risks are not. Simply put, if Bitcoin experiences a large pullback in price, so will YBTC. Therefore, the primary risk is a scenario where Bitcoin pulls back even further. BTC is a highly volatile asset that is known for very large price swings. So despite BTC's price falling back below $90,000, it can easily go much lower. It's so hard to gauge these price movements because sentiment among crypto investors can shift so rapidly. Since the upside movements are capped, this means that YBTC is unlikely to recover all of its share price when BTC finally does bounce and rally upwards. As we can see below, YBTC basically follows the same price movement as Bitcoin, so it's safe to assume that a continued decline would result in larger losses for existing YBTC holders. This is why I want to emphasize that timing on the entry is very important. Therefore, I've opted to implement a dollar cost average approach starting with a very small position size, just in case the share price falls even lower. Data by YCharts Performance Risk & Comparison I also want to emphasize that investors that are bullish on the outlook of Bitcoin are likely better off simply owning the underlying. Since YBTC's growth potential is capped, it's very probable that YBTC will underperform Bitcoin during a rally. Additionally, YBTC's high dividend yield doesn't automatically result in a higher total return over time. Just to demonstrate this weakness, we can refer to the performance chart below. As we can see, YBTC's share price has fallen by 38.77% since inception. When including all distributions paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up above 43% over the same time frame. Meanwhile, BTC's price has increased over 103% over the same time frame. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend a position in YBTC if you aren't already exposed to Bitcoin in some capacity. Data by YCharts Therefore, it makes sense to utilize YBTC as an accompanying position, rather than a standalone fund. For instance, I currently own Bitcoin directly and have no intentions to sell. YBTC makes the most sense when utilized as a strategic way to harness the current volatility and choppiness of the price. Since the options will cap the upside growth, I believe that there are three ways to summarize the movement of YBTC. Bitcoin Rises = YBTC will underperform, but will provide attractive returns. YBTC's share price and payout amounts may rise. Bitcoin Trades Flat/Choppy = YBTC has the potential to outperform since the distributions can amplify returns. Bitcoin Declines = YBTC will suffer a large decline and payouts are at risk of being decreased. While there's a chance that payouts can help offset losses, YBTC will still likely lose value. Additionally, there are several peers out there that now implement a similar option strategy to generate income from Bitcoin. I believe that the most similar peer in terms of operating strategy and risk, is the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Strategy Income ETF ( YBIT ). As we can see below, YBIT is smaller in size since it only has $81.2M in assets under management, while also being less cost-efficient since the expense ratio sits at 4.76%. However, YBIT offers a slightly higher estimated annual distribution rate of 52%. Seeking Alpha These funds are very similar because YBIT also implements a synthetic option writing strategy to generate its income. Additionally, YBIT also issues payouts on a weekly basis. However, a quick performance comparison reveals that YBTC has been able to experience less of a price decline, while maintaining a higher total return when including all distributions. So despite YBIT's higher dividend yield, YBTC seems like the more resilient choice in the space. Data by YCharts Dividend Utility As of the latest declared weekly distribution of $0.2813 per share, the current dividend yield sits around 49.2%. However, the payout amounts are determined by factors like the success of the written options, momentum of Bitcoin, and implied volatility levels. Therefore, the yield is likely to be different by the time you read this article. Since the payout amounts are always shifting week after week, so is the estimated annual yield. Therefore, YBTC is not a great choice for investors seeking income reliability and consistent payout amounts. As we can see from the dividend history below, YBTC previously issued distributions on a monthly basis. The shift to weekly payouts only happened at the start of 2025. This weekly frequency can be appealing to investors seeking income flexibility within their portfolio. For instance, more frequent payouts means that investors have the ability to manually reinvest these distributions in other areas of their portfolio. Or perhaps these frequent payouts can be a supplemental income stream for retirees. Seeking Alpha However, we are talking about a distribution that is over 49%. I believe that if you time your entry correctly, investors have the ability to reach house money status within a two year time span. House money refers to the concept of receiving your initial investment back in the form of distributions. For instance, $10,000 invested is estimated to yield ~$4,920 annually. ~$4,920 X two years = $9,840 So within about a two-year time span, it's entirely possible to reach this house money status. Once this is achieved, an investor's risk profile is drastically reduced since the initially invested capital has been repaid. However, the investor would still own the shares that are consistently paying them income. Of course, this is a simplified view of the yield and this assumes that payouts remain consistent. Lastly, the fund seems to prioritize distributions that are tax-efficient. For instance, the latest section19(a) notice indicates that 100% of the latest payout was made up of return of capital. Unlike net investment income, return of capital distributions are not classified as income and therefore, aren't taxed as such. Instead, a return of capital distribution reduces an investor's cost basis and allows taxes to be deferred until the time of sale. However, it's important to note that the funding method for distributions change frequently, so there may still be tax consequences that investors need to consider. YBTC Section19(a) Notice Takeaway In conclusion, I rate YBTC as a buy at this time following Bitcoin's recent pullback. Although there can be further downside risk, I believe that this serves as a nice entry point for a smaller starting position. YBTC has proven that it can harness the volatility of Bitcoin and turn this into weekly income for shareholders. I believe that YBTC is the more compelling choice over YBIT, but the caveat is that a position only makes sense if you already hold Bitcoin in some capacity. Lastly, the distributions can be tax-efficient depending on their reliance on return of capital.",IBIT|YBIT|YBTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-26 00:54:39

This substantial Multicoin Capital AAVE investment comes despite the firm currently facing millions in unrealized losses, showing remarkable confidence in the DeFi sector’s future. What Does Multicoin Capital’s Latest AAVE Purchase Reveal? According to blockchain analytics firm EmberCN, Multicoin Capital acquired 60,000 AAVE tokens through Galaxy Digital’s OTC desk. This strategic Multicoin Capital AAVE investment represents their continued accumulation of the DeFi giant’s tokens. The firm has now purchased 338,000 AAVE over the past six weeks, demonstrating persistent conviction in their investment thesis. The timing of this Multicoin Capital AAVE investment appears counterintuitive to some observers. However, veteran investors often increase positions during market uncertainty. This approach aligns with traditional investment wisdom about buying when others are fearful. Why Continue Investing Amid Significant Losses? Multicoin Capital currently faces $13.5 million in unrealized losses on their AAVE holdings. This situation raises important questions about their investment strategy. Several factors might explain their continued commitment: Long-term vision for DeFi adoption Confidence in AAVE’s fundamental technology Strategic positioning during market lows Portfolio diversification across crypto assets The Multicoin Capital AAVE investment strategy suggests they see current prices as attractive entry points. Their consistent buying pattern indicates systematic accumulation rather than emotional trading decisions. How Does OTC Trading Benefit Large Investors? Multicoin Capital executed this Multicoin Capital AAVE investment through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter desk. OTC trading offers significant advantages for large-scale transactions: Avoids market impact from large orders Provides price stability during execution Offers privacy from public order books Enables customized settlement terms This approach demonstrates how sophisticated players navigate crypto markets differently from retail traders. The Multicoin Capital AAVE investment through OTC channels reflects institutional-grade execution strategies. What Does This Mean for AAVE’s Future?

Prices slipped below the $2 mark and recently hit about $1.83 before a small rebound. Volatility has been sharp, and many traders are being pushed into quick exits.

Fear is back, and it always hits those who don’t understand what it means to hold XRP. Most won’t survive the engineered volatility ahead. The system shakes out the weak long before real valuation even begins. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 23, 2025 Those swings left behind gaps in liquidity, including a zone around $1.98 to $1.99 that traders are watching closely. Price action has been messy but not one-directional. XRP was trading around $2.22, up about 1.8% in the last 24 hours, and in another snapshot it was reported changing hands close to $2.24 amid a rebound. Over the most recent 72 hours, the token posted a rally of more than 18%, showing how fast sentiment can flip. According to Aljarrah, fear has returned, and “it always hits those who don’t understand what it means to hold XRP.” The analyst pointed out that a good number of people will fall before they could even make it and “survive the engineered volatility ahead.” The system, he said, “shakes out the weak” long before actual market valuation takes its course. History And Psychology At Work Analysts and market observers point to XRP’s stop-and-go history as part of the problem. In 2017, the coin lingered for months before surging roughly 70,000% and then dropping by as much as 95% at certain stretches. In 2024, it traded quietly for much of the year before jumping over 600% near year end. That pattern makes holding the token psychologically hard for many. People sell too soon, often right before big moves. Support levels are being watched closely. Reports list key buffers at $1.95, $1.75, and $1.60. On the upside, some analysts are projecting a rebound to $4 by 2026, with longer-range targets of $13 and $27. Those are forecasts, not promises, and they assume steady market conditions and continued interest.

The sharp downturn has shaken investors who expected continued upside, and many analysts are beginning to argue that the cycle has already peaked. Price action remains fragile, with buyers struggling to regain control and momentum indicators pointing to exhaustion rather than strength. Yet, despite the bearish tone, there are emerging signs that the current phase may be approaching an inflection point. According to top analyst Axel Adler, both the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Index and the Futures Flow Index remain firmly within a bearish regime, signaling that market structure still favors downside risk. However, Adler highlights that Bitcoin is currently trading 11% below its 30-day fair value of $99.2K, suggesting a notable disconnect between price and underlying derivatives positioning. This divergence has historically appeared near corrective exhaustion zones rather than early-stage declines. Additionally, short-term dynamics across both indices indicate the first signs of an attempted reversal, with selling pressure slowly weakening and momentum beginning to stabilize. Bearish Structure Weakens as Bitcoin Attempts to Stabilize The daily Bitcoin bull and bear structure index shows a sustained shift to the bearish side since November 11, reflecting the strongest downside momentum of this cycle. The red BEAR line moved deep into negative territory at -36%, signaling persistent dominance of selling pressure. However, the indicator is now starting to reverse, suggesting that the most aggressive phase of bearish control may be fading. At the same time, Bitcoin is consolidating around $87,000 after briefly plunging to $80,000, marking an early attempt to stabilize and rebuild support following the sharp decline. Fast versions of the index highlight increased volatility, with the metric rising from -43 to -20 — a clear sign that bear pressure is easing. Although this does not yet indicate a trend reversal, it reflects a meaningful reduction in downside intensity. In the futures market, the index remains in a bearish regime as well, with values rising but still failing to break above the key 55 threshold. A move above that level would signal the first structural attempt to transition back into a bullish phase. The fair value level, currently positioned at $99,000, shows Bitcoin trading $11,000 below equilibrium, reinforcing undervaluation. Together, both indices indicate that the market is attempting to exit the bearish regime it has been trapped in for more than a month, though confirmation will require stronger follow-through. Weekly Structure Tests Key Support Amid Attempted Stabilization Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after a sharp decline from its all-time high near $126,000. Price is currently trading around $87,300, reflecting a significant drawdown of more than 30% from the peak. The recent candle structure highlights a temporary rebound after tagging lows near $80,000, suggesting that buyers have stepped in at a critical support zone. The 100-week moving average, sitting close to current levels, is acting as an important dynamic support and has historically served as a threshold separating bullish continuation from deeper cyclical breakdowns. Despite the bounce, the price remains below the 50-week moving average, which is beginning to curl downward, signaling weakening trend strength. Volume increased noticeably during the selloff, reflecting capitulation behavior and aggressive repositioning among market participants.

However, if selling pressure resumes and the price loses the 100-week moving average, the next downside magnet sits near the $75,000–$78,000 range. The weekly structure shows a market in correction but not yet in a confirmed macro reversal, with the upcoming candles likely determining whether the cycle continues or breaks down further.

BMNR's unique model accumulates Ethereum as a treasury asset, avoids debt risk, and recently initiated dividend payments, differentiating it from peers like MSTR. BMNR's performance is highly correlated to ETH price; technical and fundamental analysis suggest medium- to long-term upside driven by deflation, Fed policy, and L2 activity. Despite risks of further volatility, BMNR offers speculative growth potential if Ethereum recovers, but is best suited for investors comfortable with high-risk assets. Investment Thesis Ever since my last thesis , Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) shares have dropped 41%. My “Hold” recommendation was based on wanting to open a buy position at more favorable prices. In spite of all the hype around this asset, in my opinion, it was still overbought. One month ago, I thought that BMNR's price of around $50 was too high and not suitable for long positions. At the moment of this analysis, the price of the asset is around $29, which, in my opinion, is more than enough of a correction to open the previously desired purchases. At the same time, I initially expected a potential corrective decline in BMNR to the price range of $31–39 per share. But due to the more aggressive continuation of the downward trend for Ethereum (ETH-USD) on the daily chart, correction turned out to be deeper. At this point, I see a number of fundamental factors that suggest a potential recovery in the value of the cryptocurrency. As such, now my previous recommendation of “Hold” has been revised to “Buy.” What is Bitmine and what makes it unique? I wouldn't call Bitmine a unique project because it is essentially a copy of MicroStrategy (MSTR). The major difference between them is that each of these organizations has chosen its own underlying asset, on which it acts as a treasury holder. In MSTR's case, it's Bitcoin (BTC-USD), and in BMNR's case, it's Ethereum. Although Bitmine's fundamental business idea copies MicroStrategy's basic principles, it does have a competitive advantage that sets it apart from other assets. It is not just a bet on Ethereum, which is a major altcoin in the cryptocurrency market, but using the proceeds to purchase digital tokens of its own shares rather than corporate bonds, like MSTR does. By doing so, BMNR (at least for now) eliminates the risk of debt and possible insolvency in the future, which could arise for MicroStrategy if it is unable to pay its debts to creditors (because if the value of Bitcoin falls sharply, this could lead to significant financial problems). Bitmine's Ethereum purchase process began on July 8, 2025, when it made its first purchase of 1.15 million digital tokens. At the time, the ETH-USD price was around $2,500 per coin. Chart of ETH purchases for Bitmine reserves The main goal of Bitmine in accumulating Ethereum is to achieve a 5% share of ownership of this digital token out of the total issuance. The total ETH issuance as of November 22, 2025, is 120.69 mln tokens. Thus, 5% of this amount will be 6.0345 mln digital tokens. As per Bitmine's latest press release , they hold about 3.63 mln Ethereum tokens. That is, the goal has been achieved at 3% of the total cryptocurrency circulation in the network. Since I last published, their stake has increased from 2.8%, which is a pretty good result for one month. If we assume that the company will increase its share by 0.2% every 30 calendar days, then overall, the company will achieve an additional 2.4% share over the course of the year. So, considering the current level of 3%, Bitmine has about 10 months left to reach its stated goal of 5%. But I think these estimates for when the goal will be reached are a bit too optimistic. After all, most of the Ethereum buying happened in the last month or so. I doubt it'll keep up like that. However, the value of the cryptocurrency is falling, and therefore its purchase will cost less. But these operations require an additional issue of shares. And as the value of ETH falls, the BMNR exchange rate falls even more sharply. For instance, over the last month, Ethereum has lost 24.29% of its value, whereas BMNR has lost 45.67%. So, a 1% drop in the market cap of the cryptocurrency means a 1.88% loss in the value of Bitmine. In the end, the extra BMNR shares bring in less money, which is distributed for buying ETH. Bitmine's first financial report and dividend payment What makes BMNR more unique compared to MSTR and other cryptocurrency treasury holders? It's that they were the first to announce dividend payments on their shares. Those payments will only be $0.01 per share, less than 0.4% in annual yield. Still, it is the first indication that treasury holders can pay dividends to their shareholders. To me, this decision is more of a marketing move aimed at highlighting Bitmine's uniqueness. But this is just my opinion, and it is not negative, but positive. I don't mind such decisions on the part of the company's management, as this will only add support to the potential growth of BMNR's market value. The company also shared its financial results. The net profit for the 2025 fiscal year was $328.1 mln, which equates to $13.39 per share. Also, Bitmine said that Ethereum staking will start in early 2026. According to my personal opinion, this will give the company a return on digital token staking of about 2-3% per annum. The more detailed financial results are shown below and are taken from the 10-K. Financial results of Bitmine Assessing Bitmine shares through the lens of Ethereum's growth prospects I think the main assessment of BMNR's prospects should be done by looking at Ethereum's price. As Bitmine is the world's largest treasury holder of ETH, the market trends in the cryptocurrency market affect its investment appeal. In order to evaluate BMNR shares, I propose looking at the Ethereum chart. Let's first determine the global trend for ETH using technical analysis of the 1W time frame. Technical analysis of the Ethereum chart on the weekly timeframe On the weekly chart, we can see that a global upward trend channel has formed. The lower boundary was temporarily broken during the collapse of Ethereum prices from March 2025 to May 2025, after which the rapid growth phase began. The bullish momentum was formed at the moment of testing the support level of $1,521. As a consequence, price growth allowed the asset to move towards the upper boundary of the upward trend channel, thus testing the strength of the historical maximum level of $4,868. On the 1D timeframe chart, the Ethereum price shows an acceleration of the downtrend, though it matches the bearish momentum on the weekly chart. The confirmation of the acceleration of the downtrend is that the asset has broken out of the initial downtrend channel by breaking through the lower boundary in the price area of $3,200. At this point, we have formed a new downtrend channel with an initial high of $4,755. If we believe these factors, the price of Ethereum may fall further. The price range ($2,111 - $2,463) is the target. This is formed by a cluster of liquidity in the form of equal lows ((EQL)) in the period May-June 2025. Technical analysis of the Ethereum chart on the daily timeframe Considering this situation based on technical analysis of the Ethereum chart, I suppose that there is still a possibility that the value of the digital token will reach the target range of $2,111–$2,463. Taking the current value of Ethereum at around $2,950, this potential decline could still be between 16.5% and 28.4%. Considering that a 1% decline in ETH over the past month represents a 1.88% loss in BMNR's market value, that could lead to a 31% to 53.4% loss in Bitmine's price. Regardless, I believe that BMNR can be purchased today, since there are a number of factors contributing to the potential recovery of Ethereum's price as early as December 2025. 3 reasons for Ethereum's growth I want to briefly go over the fundamental factors that could cause the value of cryptocurrency to rise over the next month. Firstly, there is the impact of the deflationary mechanism on Ethereum. The point is that today we are seeing increased activity in DeFi, NFT, and L2 settlement networks. On this basis, the commission burning mechanism makes ETH more deflationary, creating a supply shock against a backdrop of increasing institutional demand, thanks in part to Bitmine and its stakeholders, Tom Lee and Cathie Wood (who recently bought 181,774 BMNR shares as head of Ark Invest). Second, I expect that the so-called “Santa Claus rally” may affect the cryptocurrency market for the first time. This is because it has become more correlated with US stock market indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq). The traditional trends might add some pre-New Year optimism and, most importantly, the expectation that the Fed will keep easing its monetary policy. As Ethereum is a high-beta asset, it might show ahead-of-the-curve growth, allowing prices to recover. Additionally, the probability of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points at its meeting on December 10, 2025, is 67.3%, while a week earlier the probability was only 39.8%. Fed Rate Monitor Tool Thirdly, the Layer 2 ecosystem is currently reaching its peak in terms of transaction activity. Ethereum is the settlement layer and the foundation for the functioning of this entire ecosystem. The rise in Total Value Locked in L2 networks can be seen as a fundamentally positive factor, which strengthens trust in smart contracts and the value of ETH itself in the eyes of users and investors. Therefore, the potential growth of cryptocurrency in December 2025 may be caused by deflation observed during high network load. Activity Layer 2 Risks of the investment thesis If the above-mentioned fundamental factors do not cause Ethereum to grow in the short term until the end of 2025, I anticipate a potential continuation of the downward trend. This could cause prices to correct further downwards to a price range of $15.5–20 per share. This would be due to the completion of the downward trend for Ethereum on the daily chart and a price rebound from the $2,111–$2,463 range. Conclusion In summary, the results of my fundamental analysis of Bitmine shares allow me to assess them as an active with potential for price growth in the medium and long term. In spite of the existing risks due to the negative impact of Ethereum's price environment, I think there are at least three fundamental reasons why we can expect the value of this token to increase. It will be primarily caused by deflation observed during high network load. Besides, I'm expecting a positive impact from the Fed's decisions, where interest rates might be cut as early as the December meeting. Moreover, according to my calculations, a 1% recovery in ETH could mean a 1.88% increase in BMNR. In summary, my recommendation has been revised from “Hold” to “Buy.” P.S. Do not forget that investments in assets such as BMNR carry an increased risk of market volatility. That's why buying Bitmine shares is a speculative venture. If such a strategy is not for you, ignoring such assets in favor of safer financial instruments would be the best solution",BMNR|ETH-USD,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-26 01:04:30

This strategic decision marks a pivotal moment for the blockchain project and its community, demonstrating a clear commitment to sustainable tokenomics. What Makes This Pibble Token Burn So Significant? The recent Pibble token burn represents the project’s 10th consecutive burn event, but this one stands out for several crucial reasons. Unlike many token burns that rely on arbitrary decisions, this massive reduction was funded entirely by actual revenue generated from Pibble’s ecosystem services. The company has created a transparent system where real-world usage directly fuels token scarcity. This approach creates a powerful economic model where: Service usage generates revenue Revenue funds token buybacks Buybacks lead to permanent token burns Reduced supply enhances token value How Does the Pibble Token Burn Strategy Work? Pibble has engineered a sophisticated deflationary mechanism that connects platform performance directly to token economics. The revenue streams funding these burns come from two primary sources: P.Pay payment processing and AICREDIT sales. Every transaction within these services contributes to the burn fund, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. The beauty of this Pibble token burn strategy lies in its transparency. Anyone can verify the burn transaction on Etherscan, providing complete visibility into the process. This openness builds trust and demonstrates Pibble’s commitment to its community promises. Why Should Investors Care About Token Burns? Token burns represent one of the most powerful tools in cryptocurrency economics. When executed properly, they create artificial scarcity in digital assets, much like central banks reducing money supply. However, the Pibble token burn approach differs significantly from traditional methods by being revenue-driven rather than arbitrary. The benefits of this strategic Pibble token burn include: Enhanced scarcity through reduced circulating supply Price stability through systematic supply reduction Community confidence through transparent, verifiable actions Sustainable growth through revenue-backed mechanisms What’s Next for Pibble’s Token Economics? Pibble has committed to continuing this revolutionary approach with quarterly, performance-based burns. This regular schedule creates predictable deflationary pressure while maintaining flexibility to scale with platform growth. The company’s long-term vision involves creating a virtuous cycle where increased platform adoption leads to more revenue, which fuels larger burns, ultimately benefiting all token holders. The future looks promising for the Pibble token burn strategy as the platform continues expanding its service offerings. Each new user and transaction contributes to the deflationary mechanism, creating organic growth aligned with token holder interests. Conclusion: A New Standard in Tokenomics The successful completion of this massive Pibble token burn establishes a new benchmark for responsible token management in the cryptocurrency industry. By linking real revenue to supply reduction, Pibble has created a sustainable model that benefits both the platform and its community. This approach demonstrates how blockchain projects can build long-term value through transparent, performance-driven economic policies. Frequently Asked Questions How many PIB tokens remain after this burn? The exact circulating supply changes with each burn event. However, this specific Pibble token burn removed 48 million tokens, significantly reducing the total available supply. Can I verify the burn transaction myself? Yes, Pibble provides complete transparency. You can view the burn transaction on Etherscan using the transaction hash provided in their official announcement. How often does Pibble conduct token burns? Pibble has committed to quarterly burns, but the size of each burn depends on platform revenue performance during that period. What services generate revenue for these burns? Currently, P.Pay payments and AICREDIT sales are the primary revenue sources funding the Pibble token burn program. How does this burn affect token value? By reducing circulating supply while maintaining demand, token burns typically create upward pressure on price through increased scarcity. Is this burn strategy sustainable long-term? Yes, because it’s funded by actual platform revenue rather than arbitrary decisions, the burn scale naturally adjusts with business performance.

Representative Park Sang-hyeok of the ruling Democratic Party has introduced the “Act on the Market and Industry of Digital Assets” in South Korea’s National Assembly. This legislation directly challenges the Financial Services Commission’s long-standing interpretation that virtual assets cannot serve as underlying assets for financial products. The bill includes a special provision explicitly defining digital assets as permissible underlying assets under the Capital Markets Act. This move represents a significant shift in regulatory thinking. For years, South Korean investors have faced limitations in accessing cryptocurrency through traditional financial channels. The proposed spot crypto ETFs would change this landscape dramatically. Why Are Spot Crypto ETFs Such a Big Deal for Investors? Spot crypto ETFs offer several compelling advantages that could revolutionize cryptocurrency investing: Regulated Access – Investors gain exposure through established financial institutions Enhanced Security – Reduced risks associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership Tax Efficiency – Potential for more straightforward tax reporting Mainstream Adoption – Bridges traditional finance with digital assets The introduction of spot crypto ETFs could potentially unlock billions in institutional and retail investment. Moreover, it positions South Korea as a forward-thinking regulator in the global digital asset space. What Challenges Does This Legislation Face? Despite the exciting possibilities, the path to approval faces several hurdles. The Financial Services Commission has maintained its conservative stance for years, citing concerns about market volatility and investor protection. Additionally, the bill must navigate complex parliamentary procedures and potential opposition from traditional financial sectors. However, the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies globally creates favorable conditions for change. The success of similar products in other markets provides valuable precedents that supporters can reference during legislative debates. How Could This Transform South Korea’s Crypto Landscape? The approval of spot crypto ETFs would represent a monumental shift in South Korea’s financial ecosystem. It would legitimize cryptocurrency as a recognized asset class and provide regulated avenues for both retail and institutional investors. This development could also stimulate innovation in related financial products and services. Furthermore, the inclusion of crypto derivatives in the proposal adds another layer of sophistication to the market. Derivatives would enable more advanced investment strategies and risk management tools, making the ecosystem more robust and attractive to professional investors. What’s Next for South Korea’s Crypto Regulation? The proposed legislation marks a crucial turning point in South Korea’s approach to digital assets. As the National Assembly considers the bill, market participants should monitor several key developments: Committee reviews and potential amendments Financial Services Commission’s official response Industry stakeholder consultations Potential implementation timeline The success of this initiative could inspire similar regulatory reforms across Asia, creating a more harmonized approach to spot crypto ETFs and digital asset regulation regionally. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot crypto ETFs? Spot crypto ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure without owning the underlying assets directly. How would this bill change current regulations? The bill would override the FSC’s interpretation that virtual assets cannot be underlying assets, explicitly permitting digital assets in financial products under the Capital Markets Act. When could spot crypto ETFs launch in South Korea? There’s no definite timeline yet. The bill must pass through parliamentary procedures and receive final approval, which could take several months. What other countries have approved spot crypto ETFs? Several countries including the United States, Canada, and Germany have approved various forms of cryptocurrency ETFs, providing precedents for South Korea. How would this affect ordinary investors? Ordinary investors would gain easier, regulated access to cryptocurrency investments through traditional brokerage accounts and financial institutions. What risks remain with spot crypto ETFs? While regulated, these products would still carry cryptocurrency market risks including volatility, though with enhanced investor protections.

This significant transaction represents one of the largest single movements by an early ETH investor in recent months, potentially signaling important market shifts. Why Is This ETH Investor Move So Significant? The recent activity from this particular ETH investor tells us several important stories about the current cryptocurrency landscape. First, the sheer scale of this deposit – 20,000 ETH valued at $58.14 million – demonstrates continued institutional interest in Ethereum. Moreover, this ETH investor hadn’t made any major moves for approximately eight months, making this transaction particularly noteworthy. What makes this ETH investor’s decision so interesting? The timing suggests potential strategic positioning. When an early participant in the Ethereum ecosystem makes such a substantial move, market watchers pay close attention. This ETH investor still maintains a significant position of 3,070 ETH worth $9.07 million, indicating they haven’t completely exited their Ethereum holdings. What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Future? The decision by this experienced ETH investor to utilize FalconX, an institutional-grade platform, speaks volumes about how cryptocurrency markets are maturing. Institutional platforms like FalconX offer: Enhanced security measures for large transactions Better liquidity for substantial positions Professional trading infrastructure Regulatory compliance frameworks This move by a prominent ETH investor could indicate growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects among sophisticated market participants. The choice of an institutional platform rather than a retail exchange suggests this ETH investor values the professional services and security that specialized platforms provide. How Should Retail Investors Interpret This Move? While retail investors shouldn’t blindly follow any single ETH investor’s moves, there are valuable lessons to learn. The careful approach taken by this ETH investor – maintaining a substantial remaining position while moving a large portion to an institutional platform – demonstrates prudent portfolio management. Key takeaways for observant market participants include: Large players continue to see value in Ethereum Institutional platforms are becoming preferred venues for major transactions Seasoned ETH investors often make strategic moves after extended holding periods Diversification and risk management remain crucial The Bigger Picture: Institutional Adoption Accelerates This transaction from an early ETH investor fits into a broader pattern of increasing institutional involvement in cryptocurrency markets. As more sophisticated players enter the space, we’re seeing: Larger transaction sizes becoming common Greater use of specialized institutional platforms More strategic, long-term positioning Enhanced market infrastructure development The actions of this ETH investor reflect how the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve from its early days toward greater maturity and institutional participation. Conclusion: Reading Between the Lines The substantial deposit by this early ETH investor represents more than just a single transaction – it’s a signal about market maturity and institutional confidence. While we can’t know the exact strategy behind this ETH investor’s decision, the move underscores Ethereum’s ongoing relevance in the digital asset space. As the market continues to develop, watching how experienced participants like this ETH investor manage their positions provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Frequently Asked Questions Why would an early ETH investor deposit to FalconX? Early ETH investors often use institutional platforms like FalconX for large transactions due to better security, liquidity, and professional services compared to retail exchanges. Does this mean the investor is selling their Ethereum? While deposits to trading platforms often precede sales, we can’t confirm this was a sale. The investor maintained a significant remaining position of 3,070 ETH. How significant is a $58 million Ethereum transaction? This represents a substantial movement, especially coming from an early participant who hadn’t made major moves in eight months, making it noteworthy for market observers. What does this tell us about institutional crypto adoption? It demonstrates growing institutional involvement and the increasing use of specialized platforms for large cryptocurrency transactions. Should retail investors follow this ETH investor’s move? While educational, retail investors should make decisions based on their own research and risk tolerance rather than following any single investor’s actions. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large transactions can cause short-term price volatility, but single transactions typically don’t determine long-term price trends. Found this analysis of the early ETH investor’s move insightful?

The call was issued on November 25, 2025, by Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham. This council seeks to strengthen the agency’s efforts as it assumes a more significant role in overseeing digital assets. The announcement followed Pham’s recent statement dated Tuesday, November 25, in which she expressed her openness to receiving nominations for the council. The deadline for these nominations is scheduled for December 8. The CFTC encourages public participation in shaping digital assets laws The CFTC has recently confirmed that it is prepared to assume additional responsibility in overseeing cryptocurrency . This is due to bills in both the House and Senate that would grant the federal regulatory agency more authority over digital assets. However, the agency did not disclose when these legislative changes will take place. This situation remains unclear, as progress has slowed and previous deadlines have been missed. Meanwhile, as individuals await the implementation of these new laws, reports from reliable sources indicate that the commission has initiated a “Crypto Sprint” to clarify regulations surrounding cryptocurrency. The CFTC is also planning to launch spot trading products that may include options allowing for leverage. In a statement, Pham emphasized that the CFTC must encourage public participation , backed by experienced industry leaders and forward-thinkers who play a significant role in shaping the future, to get started effectively. “That is why today I am calling upon CEOs to join us in shaping responsible regulations that will lay the foundation for America’s Golden Age of Innovation.” Pham’s announcement also outlined the steps for individuals to follow while sending in nominations, which were required to be emailed to CEOcouncil@cftc.gov. Notably, Pham is the only available commissioner at the CFTC at the moment. She stated that she will resign once a new chair is appointed. The Senate, on the other hand, is progressing with the US President Donald Trump’s selection, Michael Selig, to lead the federal agency and is currently awaiting a full vote from the Senate. The CFTC seeks to embrace leveraged spot crypto trading in the ecosystem Pham earlier confirmed that the CFTC was engaged in talks with regulated exchanges to begin spot crypto trading, including leveraged options, as soon as next month. This was after she shared an X post dated Sunday, November 9, saying “True” in response to reports that leaked leveraged spot crypto trading information. This move takes place, although a federal government shutdown slowed down other crypto policy efforts. Regarding this newly adapted crypto policy effort, reports from sources disclosed that Pham had been discussing with CFTC-regulated designated contract markets (DCMs) exchanges, which include major financial companies such as CME, Cboe Futures Exchange, and ICE Futures, as well as crypto-focused firms like Coinbase Derivatives and prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket US. At this point, the commission was considering launching spot crypto trading products that involve margin, leverage, and financing. Pham told reporters, “As we continue working with Congress to bring clear laws to these markets, we are also using our current powers to quickly implement recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets report.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",News|CFTC,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-26 01:37:59

This development could reshape how digital currencies integrate with traditional banking in South Korea and beyond. For crypto enthusiasts, this marks a pivotal moment where established financial institutions embrace blockchain innovation. What is the KakaoBank stablecoin project all about? KakaoBank has transitioned from merely reviewing a won-denominated stablecoin to actively developing what insiders call Kakao Coin. This shift follows the recent legal clearance of Kakao founder Kim Beom-su, removing previous uncertainties. The KakaoBank stablecoin initiative now moves forward with full force, positioning the bank as a leader in South Korea’s digital currency evolution. Key aspects include: Direct integration with KakaoBank’s existing financial services Backing by South Korean won to ensure stability Potential to revolutionize everyday transactions How does this KakaoBank stablecoin development impact users? The introduction of a KakaoBank stablecoin could bring numerous benefits to consumers and businesses alike. Users might experience faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining the stability of traditional currency. Moreover, this KakaoBank stablecoin could bridge the gap between conventional banking and cryptocurrency, making digital assets more accessible to the general public. However, challenges remain in regulatory compliance and mass adoption. Why is the timing crucial for KakaoBank stablecoin launch? With Kim Beom-su’s recent acquittal, KakaoBank can now execute its stablecoin strategy without legal overhangs. The resolution of these legal risks allows the company to focus entirely on developing a robust KakaoBank stablecoin system.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has surged past the $88,000 mark, currently trading at $88,017.48 on the Binance USDT market. This Bitcoin price surge represents one of the most impressive rallies in recent months, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Surge? Several key factors are contributing to this remarkable Bitcoin price surge. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate as major financial players increase their cryptocurrency exposure. Moreover, growing mainstream acceptance and positive regulatory developments have created a favorable environment for digital assets. The current market sentiment reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Market analysts point to increased trading volume and reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. This combination creates perfect conditions for sustained upward momentum. Additionally, global economic factors including inflation concerns and currency fluctuations are driving more investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Key Benefits of This Market Movement Increased investor confidence in cryptocurrency markets Enhanced liquidity across trading platforms Greater mainstream attention to digital assets Improved infrastructure development across the ecosystem What Challenges Should Investors Consider? While this Bitcoin price surge presents exciting opportunities, investors should remain cautious. Market volatility remains a significant factor, and price corrections can occur rapidly. Therefore, proper risk management strategies are essential for navigating these market conditions successfully. New investors should approach the market with realistic expectations and thorough research. Understanding market cycles and having a clear investment strategy can help mitigate potential risks. Remember that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent volatility, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Actionable Insights for Market Participants For those considering entering the market during this Bitcoin price surge, several strategies can help maximize opportunities while managing risk. Dollar-cost averaging remains one of the most effective approaches for long-term investors. This method involves investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, reducing the impact of short-term price fluctuations. Experienced traders might consider technical analysis tools to identify potential entry and exit points. However, always combine technical indicators with fundamental analysis for comprehensive market understanding. Setting clear profit targets and stop-loss levels can help protect your investment during periods of high volatility. Why This Bitcoin Price Surge Matters Long-Term This significant price movement extends beyond short-term gains. The sustained Bitcoin price surge demonstrates growing maturity in cryptocurrency markets and increasing recognition of Bitcoin’s store of value characteristics. Each new price milestone strengthens Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class within global financial markets. The current market conditions suggest that institutional interest continues to grow, with more traditional financial institutions exploring cryptocurrency offerings. This development could lead to increased market stability and broader adoption over time. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $88,000? Multiple factors contributed including increased institutional investment, positive regulatory developments, and growing mainstream adoption. Market sentiment shifted positively as more investors recognized Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at this price? While timing the market perfectly is challenging, many investors use dollar-cost averaging to enter positions gradually. Consider your investment horizon and risk tolerance before making decisions. How high could Bitcoin price go from here? Predicting exact price targets is difficult, but analysts monitor key resistance levels and market fundamentals. Always conduct your own research and consult financial advisors. What risks should I consider during price surges? High volatility, potential corrections, and regulatory changes represent significant risks. Ensure you only invest what you can afford to lose and maintain a diversified portfolio. Which platforms are best for trading Bitcoin? Reputable exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken offer secure trading environments. Always research platform security, fees, and regulatory compliance before choosing. How can I secure my Bitcoin investments? Use hardware wallets for long-term storage, enable two-factor authentication, and never share private keys. Security should always be your top priority.

Its unmatched network strength, fixed supply, and resilient global infrastructure continue to make it the benchmark against all digital assets. Unmatched Network Security Keeps Bitcoin In The Lead Bitcoin remains the largest and most secure store of value in the crypto ecosystem, with a market capitalization surpassing $1.7 trillion and increasingly unmatched institutional adoption. However, analyst Ted has noted on X that the BTC base layer was never built for decentralized finance (DeFi). Related Reading: Historic Downturn: Bitcoin Nears Worst Weekly Performance In Over A Year Most of BTC’s capital sits idle and is unable to support the complex financial applications. This is where the BTCFi emerges, and it’s rising because it activates this dormant capital without forcing users or liquidity away from BTC’s security. Ted highlighted that Arch Network is a utility layer that enables the development of expressive rush in smart contracts directly to BTC for high performance. It offers real-time state management, true interoperability, and fast parallel execution, while remaining fully aligned with the BTC UTXO model. This ensures that all settlements and final state changes remain anchored directly to BTC for maximum security. The applications on ArchVM generate Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs for each batch of transactions, and BTC nodes verify those proofs on-chain; a design that enables fast trading, money lending, credit markets, and real-world asset (RWA) applications with the L1-level trust. Furthermore, Ted describes the Arch Network as aiming to become a core piece of the infrastructure pillar for the emerging BTCFi ecosystem. Bitcoin Stabilizes As Market Volatility Cools Off The cryptocurrency market is now showing signs of stabilization, positioning Bitcoin for a potential resurgence. According to CryptosRus, last Friday, BTC appeared to have firmly bottomed just above the $82,000 level, a crucial development that analysts are pointing to as a potential renewed market strength. While the selling pressure is fading, these key developments could trigger a near-term bounce for BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Loses Strength, Traders Watch $90K as Last Line of Defense Swissblock outlines a sharp risk-off signal, suggesting that the worst phase of capitulation may be over. The market might still experience a second weaker wave of selling pressure, which would mark the exhaustion of any remaining sellers, and shift the market towards the bulls. Fed rate cuts are surging, as the December cut probability is climbing back to 70%, fueling optimism for liquidity support. Furthermore, liquidity injection is possible, and market analysts are highlighting that the actions from the Fed could expand reserves, which have historically proven to be bullish for the crypto market. With selling pressure easing and policy tailwinds building, BTC’s climb may continue signaling a potential recovery.

According to the group’s November 24 press release , the questionnaire has been sent to both federal and state hopefuls to capture where they stand on a range of policy questions. What The Survey Asks The list of topics is broad but simple. Candidates are being asked whether they support an individual’s right to hold digital assets, how they view banking access for digital currency firms, their stance on mining and related zoning rules, and what rules they would back for consumer protection and access. The survey also asks whether the candidate has ever bought, sold, or used bitcoin or blockchain tools. Reports have disclosed that the group expects to use those answers to build a public picture of each candidate’s views. https://t.co/kO5RWmSkc4 pic.twitter.com/5NDC1NKutX — Stand With Crypto (@standwithcrypto) November 24, 2025 SWC Says It Will Grade Candidates Based on responses, SWC will assign each politician a letter grade from A to F — where A signals strong support for crypto and F shows opposition. The group points to America’s more than 52 million crypto owners as the audience for those grades, and it says its own network includes more than 2.6 million registered advocates across all 50 states. Results are slated to be posted in early 2026, and the group says it will use the findings to guide its outreach and voter mobilization. How Industry Backing Shapes The Effort SWC was launched with backing from Coinbase, a detail covered in multiple reports. That link helps explain how the platform has grown quickly and why its ratings matter to industry groups and voters who follow crypto policy. Reports have pointed out that the tool has been used in recent cycles to highlight pro-crypto candidates and to channel grassroots energy into targeted races. What This Could Mean For Politics The move matters because it brings a large, organized voting bloc into play. With tens of millions of Americans holding crypto and a few million signed up with Stand With Crypto, candidates may feel pressure to state their positions clearly. At the same time, how much sway the group will have in close races is still unclear; the organization says it will focus on critical battleground contests and will tailor its outreach based on survey results.

Per National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, an estimated 60,000 private sector employees lost their jobs as a consequence of the shutdown. The government shutdown marked the longest in U.S. history, second only to the 35-day shutdown during Trump’s first presidency in 2018-2019. Trump, who notably campaigned on making the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world, has seen both scrutiny and praise for his relationship with the crypto sector since returning to the Oval Office. Just last week, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Jack Reed (D-RI) pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for a probe into Trump-linked crypto platform World Liberty Financial’s alleged ties to illicit actors in North Korea and Russia. Per CNBC, the two senators cited a September 2025 report from nonprofit watchdog Accountable.US that claims “the Trump family crypto firm sold tokens to dozens of suspicious buyers who interacted with a large money-laundering platform, an Iranian crypto exchange, and even North Korean hackers. “Ultimately, the question remains—why did the Trump family crypto firm take money from people with open and obvious connections to enemies of the United States, and the network that enables those enemies and other criminals to launder billions of dollars?” the Accountable.US report reads.

BTC is now consolidating and might soon aim for a move above the $90,000 zone. Bitcoin started a recovery wave and climbed toward $89,000. The price is trading above $87,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $88,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it settles above the $90,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Eyes Upside Break Bitcoin price managed to stay above the $83,500 level. BTC formed a base and recently started a recovery wave above the $85,500 resistance zone. There was a move above the $86,000 resistance zone. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $92,872 swing high to the $80,595 low. However, the bears are currently preventing an upside break above the $90,000 zone. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $88,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading above $87,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. If the bulls attempt another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $88,200 level. The first key resistance is near the $89,000 level. The next resistance could be $90,000 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $92,872 swing high to the $80,595 low. A close above the $90,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $91,750 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $92,500 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $93,500 and $94,000. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $90,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $86,700 level. The first major support is near the $86,200 level. The next support is now near the $85,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $83,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $82,000, below which BTC might accelerate lower in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $86,200, followed by $85,000.

Competition in the spot Solana ETF space might lead to better fee structures and more innovative product features for investors. What Challenges Remain for the Spot Solana ETF?

Amundi, managing an astonishing €2.3 trillion in assets, just sold $135 million worth of Strategy stock according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. This dramatic move comes just weeks after the firm made headlines with a $400 million purchase of the same asset. Why Are Major Institutions Selling Strategy Stock? The timing of Amundi’s Strategy stock sale raises crucial questions about institutional confidence. The transaction occurred simultaneously with JPMorgan’s own $134 million Strategy stock divestment. More importantly, both sales coincided with breaking news that Strategy would not be included in the prestigious S&P 500 index. This coordinated institutional action suggests several possibilities: Portfolio rebalancing following the S&P 500 exclusion news Risk management in response to market uncertainty Strategic repositioning for upcoming quarter performance What Does This Mean for Strategy Stock Investors? For individual investors holding Strategy stock, these institutional moves provide valuable insights. Large asset managers like Amundi typically make decisions based on extensive research and risk assessment. Their sudden shift from buyer to seller within weeks indicates changing market dynamics that deserve attention. However, it’s crucial to remember that institutional trading doesn’t always predict retail outcomes. These massive positions require different management strategies than individual portfolios. The $135 million Strategy stock sale represents just a fraction of Amundi’s overall assets, suggesting this might be tactical rather than strategic. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The simultaneous Strategy stock sales by two financial giants signal potential headwinds for cryptocurrency investments. When institutions of this scale make coordinated moves, the market typically pays attention. The S&P 500 exclusion appears to be the triggering event, but underlying factors might include: Regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency assets Market volatility concerns in the current economic climate Institutional profit-taking after recent market movements What’s Next for Strategy Stock and Institutional Investment? Looking forward, the Strategy stock situation presents both challenges and opportunities. While the immediate news appears negative, institutional interest in cryptocurrency assets continues growing. The key question becomes whether this Strategy stock movement represents a temporary adjustment or a longer-term trend. Investors should monitor several indicators: Future institutional filings for Strategy stock positions Market reaction to the S&P 500 exclusion news Broader cryptocurrency market performance in coming weeks The Amundi Strategy stock sale, while significant, represents just one data point in the evolving institutional cryptocurrency story. As Europe’s largest asset manager, their actions carry weight, but the broader narrative of digital asset adoption continues unfolding. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Amundi sell $135 million in Strategy stock? Amundi likely sold due to Strategy’s exclusion from the S&P 500 index and potential portfolio rebalancing needs, though the firm hasn’t provided official commentary. Should I sell my Strategy stock following this news? Individual investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy rather than reacting to single institutional moves. How significant is a $135 million sale for Amundi? While substantial in absolute terms, this represents a small portion of Amundi’s €2.3 trillion assets under management. Will other institutions follow Amundi’s Strategy stock sale? Some institutions might reassess positions, but each firm makes independent decisions based on their investment criteria. What impact will this have on Strategy stock price? Large institutional sales can create temporary price pressure, but long-term value depends on broader market factors and company performance. Is this part of a larger trend in cryptocurrency investing? This appears specific to Strategy stock circumstances rather than indicating a broader institutional exit from cryptocurrency assets.

This bold decision represents one of the most significant institutional cryptocurrency adoptions we’ve seen this year. What does this Zcash-based financial strategy actually mean? Reliance Global Group made a decisive pivot by liquidating all their existing digital assets and converting the entire portfolio into ZEC. This Zcash-based financial strategy demonstrates remarkable confidence in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency. The company previously announced plans to purchase $120 million in cryptocurrency back in September, making this current move part of a larger strategic vision. This Zcash-based financial strategy isn’t just a simple portfolio adjustment. It represents a fundamental shift in how institutions view cryptocurrency investments. The move signals several important developments: Institutional confidence in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies Strategic consolidation rather than diversification Long-term commitment to specific blockchain technologies Pioneering approach to corporate treasury management Why would a public company choose this Zcash-based financial strategy? Public companies face unique challenges when adopting cryptocurrency strategies. Their decisions must satisfy shareholders, comply with regulations, and demonstrate clear business value. This Zcash-based financial strategy addresses several corporate needs simultaneously. The privacy features of Zcash provide transactional confidentiality that traditional cryptocurrencies lack. Moreover, the proven technology behind Zcash offers security assurances that institutional investors require. This Zcash-based financial strategy also positions Reliance as an innovator in the insurance technology space. How does this Zcash-based financial strategy impact the broader market? When a Nasdaq-listed company makes such a definitive move, the entire cryptocurrency market takes notice. This Zcash-based financial strategy could trigger similar actions from other institutional players. We’ve already seen increased interest in privacy coins following this announcement. The market implications extend beyond immediate price movements. This Zcash-based financial strategy validates the concept of corporate cryptocurrency adoption in several ways: Regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency in corporate finance Mainstream credibility for privacy-focused digital assets Strategic precedent for other public companies Market maturation through institutional participation What challenges come with implementing a Zcash-based financial strategy? While revolutionary, this approach isn’t without its hurdles. Companies adopting a Zcash-based financial strategy must navigate complex regulatory requirements and address shareholder concerns. The transparency expectations for public companies sometimes conflict with privacy coin characteristics. However, Reliance appears to have developed solutions for these challenges. Their Zcash-based financial strategy includes robust compliance measures and clear communication with stakeholders. The company’s experience in regulated industries like insurance likely provided valuable insights for this transition. Conclusion: The future of corporate cryptocurrency strategy Reliance Global Group’s decisive move establishes a powerful precedent for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This Zcash-based financial strategy demonstrates how public companies can thoughtfully integrate digital assets into their financial operations. The approach balances innovation with responsibility, showing other corporations a viable path forward. As more institutions observe the success of this Zcash-based financial strategy, we can expect similar adoptions across various industries. The era of corporate cryptocurrency investment has truly begun, and Reliance’s pioneering approach will likely inspire countless followers. Frequently Asked Questions What is Zcash and why did Reliance choose it? Zcash is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that offers selective transparency. Reliance likely chose it for its advanced privacy features and proven technology, which align with corporate security needs. How much ZEC did Reliance purchase? The exact transaction value wasn’t disclosed, but the company previously announced plans to purchase $120 million in cryptocurrency, suggesting a significant investment. Is this strategy legal for a public company? Yes, public companies can invest in cryptocurrency as long as they comply with SEC regulations and disclosure requirements, which Reliance appears to be following. What happens to Reliance’s other cryptocurrencies? The company sold all its existing digital assets to fund the ZEC purchase, making this a complete portfolio transformation. Could other companies follow this strategy? Absolutely. Reliance’s move could inspire other public companies to consider similar cryptocurrency strategies, particularly those valuing transactional privacy. How does this affect ZEC’s market position? This institutional adoption significantly boosts ZEC’s credibility and could increase mainstream acceptance of privacy coins.

Under the Satoshi white paper , he noted, BTC was meant to be “a peer-to-peer payment system” that removed the dependence of payment rails on banks. “By moving to a distributed ledger and a peer-to-peer system, we’d be able to get banks out of the system.” “That’s been a total failure,” he argued. “There are almost no real transactions that are occurring in Bitcoin. We have tons of transaction activity in speculative markets trading Bitcoin, but the actual quantity of retail transactions or peer-to-peer payments that occur over the Bitcoin network are remarkably small.” Green distinguished between emergency government “money printing” and day-to-day bank credit. “There’s money printing that comes from the government, in which they largely are trying to smooth over mistakes that have been made,” he said, describing stimulus as a way to “basically create a do-over by printing money.” More frequent, he added, is the expansion of money when banks lend: when a bank grants a $1,000 loan, “they simply created a new account for you called your checking account that has $1,000 in it… That expansion is totally normal and it has a credit function associated with it.” “Bitcoin destroys the ability to do that because it was intentionally designed to skip the banking system ,” Green contended. Rather than a full credit system, “it is effectively just a monetary system where what you’re really seeing is Bitcoin is effectively the tokens that are paid to the accounting firms that keep the blockchain in order… every Bitcoin that’s out there is basically a payment to Deloitte & Touche.” Why Bitcoin Is Supposedly A ‘Monopoly Game’ Because its supply is capped and banks cannot create new BTC via lending, “no new money can be created. There is no capacity for mistake forgiveness in that type of framework,” he said. That makes the system “very limiting. Interest rates and credit spreads are just too high for a real economy framework.” Despite dramatic price gains, he concluded, Bitcoin “hasn’t emerged as a payment system” or “in any meaningful economic context.” Green’s harshest criticism was distributional. “Because we have a finite quantity of it, ultimately, that means everybody who is born after the Bitcoin has been released finds themselves in deficit,” he said. He compared this to “a serf living off land in the 14th century that didn’t belong to you,” where “there was no other land that would ever become available to you.” That, he argued, “creates a deeply unequal society.” Although he said he “was an early adopter of Bitcoin” and initially thought it was “a really interesting idea” of private money, he now believes “if you run through the simulation, Bitcoin, because there is a finite quantity of tokens, means that it basically plays like a Monopoly game.” In that game, “you can’t add additional players as the game is being played… because they’re just going to lose very quickly. They don’t have any other properties. They don’t have any other money.” “How does every game of Monopoly end?” he asked. “Someone wins. With a single winner.” Mike Green ( @profplum99 ) embraced bitcoin early but now he doesn’t see it as an asset that democratizes wealth. He shared his latest thoughts on $BTC , and why it could end like a winner-take-all Monopoly game. pic.twitter.com/vIezLbNnuD — Phil Rosen (@philrosenn) November 24, 2025 “That’s exactly what we’ve seen within Bitcoin,” Green maintained, citing “increased concentration” and a Gini coefficient “beyond anything we’ve ever seen in the real world.” Instead of democratizing access, he argued, Bitcoin builds “a system that ultimately collapses upon itself and locks people out. Far from democratizing access, it does the exact opposite.” At press time, BTC traded at $87,589.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Michael Green,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-26 03:00:07

XRP Has Enjoyed A Sharp Rally Over The Last 24 Hours The cryptocurrency market as a whole has seen some recovery from the recent crash, but XRP has stood out for its particularly rapid growth. With a jump of 7% over the past day, the coin has managed to return to the $2.19 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $40,000? Signal Behind Past 60% Crashes Is Back The chart below shows how the recent performance of the asset has looked: XRP’s breakaway from the pack has come as Franklin Templeton and Grayscale have launched their exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The products, with tickers XRPZ and GXRP, are now live on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca. While the debut has brought with it fresh institutional attention on the cryptocurrency, a potentially bearish signal has been brewing in the background. XRP Open Interest RSI Has Reached The Sell Zone As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the XRP Open Interest Delta RSI has surged into the overheated territory recently. This indicator basically gauges the speed and magnitude of changes occurring in the asset’s Open Interest, a measure of the total amount of positions currently open on all derivatives exchanges. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in this metric over the past few weeks. From the graph, it’s visible that the XRP Open Interest Delta RSI has surged above 70 recently, indicating that investors have opened derivatives positions aggressively within a short window. The analyst calls it “a classic sign of speculative leverage.” The overall Open Interest is still notably down compared to the high earlier in the month, but the latest rapid uptick could be a signal to keep an eye on. In the chart, Maartunn has highlighted the previous instances of this pattern forming. It would appear that breaks from the indicator into this territory have often coincided with local tops. So far, since the latest sell signal has appeared in the metric, XRP has continued to go up, but it only remains to be seen whether the rally will be sustainable, or if derivatives overheating will prove an obstacle.

What aSOPR Suggests In some other news, the recent XRP drop under $2 triggered a massive loss-taking event, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted in an X post. As displayed in the above chart, this isn’t the first time this year that the XRP Realized Loss has witnessed a spike after the price retraced to $2. “Since early 2025, each time XRP has retested $2, investors have realized $0.5B–$1.2B per week in losses,” noted Glassnode. “This underscores how heavily this level influences spending behavior.” Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",XRP News|xrp|XRP open interest|XRP Open Interest RSI|XRP Rally|XRP Speculation|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-11-26 03:00:22

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Asian markets opened stronger on Wednesday, with traders leaning back into risk assets as Bitcoin held near $87,000 and investors doubled down on the idea that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. Stocks across the region tracked Wall Street’s rebound. MSCI’s gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 1% in early trade, while Japan’s Nikkei jumped around 1.8%. US equity futures added to the upbeat tone with modest gains, building on the prior session’s climb. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $87,662, down 0.2% Ether : $2,954, up 1% XRP : $2.19, down 2.5% Total crypto market cap: $3.10 trillion, up 0.1% Softer US Data Fuels December Rate-Cut Bets The mood improved after a fresh batch of US data pointed to a cooling economy rather than a hard landing. Retail sales grew less than economists had expected and consumer confidence dropped sharply, especially in households’ short-term outlook. That combination helped reinforce the view that the Fed can start loosening policy without losing credibility on inflation. Fed funds futures now imply better than an 80% chance of a quarter-point cut at the meeting on Dec. 10, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, a sharp shift from roughly even odds a week earlier. 1/ Traders are piling into Fed funds futures. Almost 275,000 new positions added in just three sessions. Markets now pricing ~80% odds of a December rate cut. Three days ago it was 30%. A shift this violent usually means one thing: the market smells a pivot. pic.twitter.com/MdM7o1U205 — Agar Capital (@AgarCapital) November 25, 2025 The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note briefly slipped below 4% on Tuesday for the first time this month, then edged back above that line, reflecting renewed demand for duration as growth signals soften. Major Indices Recover As Investors Rotate Out Of Big Tech Wall Street had already started to stabilize. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched a third straight day of gains on Tuesday, clawing back part of this month’s earlier sell-off, even as heavyweight tech names such as Nvidia lagged and capped the Nasdaq’s advance. The blue-chip Dow led the major indices higher, helped by more cyclical names that tend to benefit from easier policy and stronger liquidity. That backdrop filtered directly into crypto. Bitcoin hovered just under $90,000 in Asian hours, steady rather than spectacular, yet comfortably off the lows reached during the recent shakeout. Bitcoin Faces December Lull As Traders Temper Expectations Koinly CEO Robin Singh said Bitcoin has been struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level for far longer than most market participants expected. With the market drifting toward its annual “Christmas hibernation,” the odds of any explosive price action before the New Year are shrinking fast, he said. “However, a decisive and unexpected reclaim above $90,000 in December would do wonders for market sentiment. It would soften the bears, and help keep 2026 clear of any early ‘crypto winter’ anxieties before they begin,” he added. “It is a possibility that the next few weeks are a lull, so whatever fireworks traders were hoping for may have to wait until 2026. Most Decembers we’ve seen in the past usually little movement for Bitcoin happens.” For now, the macro story is doing more of the work than any single crypto catalyst. Oil traders also took their cue from the shifting risk tone. Crude prices steadied in Asian dealings after sliding on Tuesday, when comments from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on a US-backed peace plan fuelled speculation that sanctions on Russian energy exports could eventually ease and bring more supply back to the market.

On November 25, these investment vehicles staged an impressive comeback, recording a total net inflow of $128.56 million. This positive shift comes just one day after experiencing net outflows, demonstrating the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. What Drove the Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The November 25 surge in spot Bitcoin ETFs tells a compelling story about investor confidence. BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with substantial inflows of $82.94 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC attracted an even more impressive $170 million. These massive inflows indicate growing institutional interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels. However, the picture wasn’t uniformly positive across all spot Bitcoin ETFs. Some funds experienced outflows that partially offset the overall gains. Understanding these market movements helps investors make informed decisions about their cryptocurrency strategies. Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs Faced Challenges? While some spot Bitcoin ETFs enjoyed significant inflows, others faced investor withdrawals. According to data from TraderT, Ark Invest’s ARKB recorded outflows of $75.92 million, and VanEck’s HODL saw $36.95 million in outflows. This mixed performance highlights several key factors: Market rotation between different spot Bitcoin ETF providers Investor preference for established financial giants Portfolio rebalancing activities among institutional players Competitive fee structures influencing fund selection Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Gaining Traction? Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a revolutionary way for traditional investors to access cryptocurrency markets. These funds hold actual Bitcoin rather than derivatives, providing direct exposure to price movements. The recent inflow surge suggests several advantages are resonating with investors: First, spot Bitcoin ETFs offer regulatory clarity and security that appeals to cautious investors. Second, they provide liquidity and ease of trading through conventional brokerage accounts. Third, the transparency of these funds builds trust in an often-misunderstood asset class. What Does This Mean for Future Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance? The November 25 rebound in spot Bitcoin ETF flows signals potential market optimism. When investors pour money into these funds, it typically indicates positive sentiment about Bitcoin’s future price direction. Moreover, consistent inflows can create a virtuous cycle by increasing demand for the underlying asset. Looking ahead, monitoring spot Bitcoin ETF flows provides valuable insights into institutional positioning. These funds serve as barometers for professional investor sentiment, making them crucial indicators for market analysts and individual traders alike. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency prices without directly buying or storing digital assets. Why did spot Bitcoin ETFs see net inflows on November 25? The $128.56 million net inflow resulted from strong investor interest in BlackRock and Fidelity products, outweighing outflows from other providers like Ark Invest and VanEck. How do spot Bitcoin ETF flows affect Bitcoin prices? Significant inflows typically increase demand for Bitcoin since fund providers must purchase the underlying asset, potentially supporting or driving up prices. Which spot Bitcoin ETF performed best on November 25? Fidelity’s FBTC attracted the largest inflow at $170 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $82.94 million. Are spot Bitcoin ETFs safe investments? While regulated, spot Bitcoin ETFs carry market risk similar to Bitcoin itself but offer the security of traditional financial infrastructure. Can individual investors buy spot Bitcoin ETFs? Yes, anyone with a brokerage account can purchase spot Bitcoin ETFs just like traditional stocks or ETFs.

This massive wave of liquidations primarily hit Bitcoin and Ethereum traders, sending shockwaves through the perpetual futures market. The scale of these crypto liquidations highlights the intense volatility that continues to characterize digital asset trading. What Triggered These Massive Crypto Liquidations? Market analysts point to several factors driving this liquidation event. Sudden price movements in major cryptocurrencies created a domino effect across leveraged positions. When prices move rapidly against traders’ positions, exchanges automatically close their leveraged trades to prevent further losses. This process, known as forced liquidation, amplifies market movements and creates additional selling pressure. The crypto liquidations breakdown reveals interesting patterns. Bitcoin accounted for $89.67 million in liquidations, with 58.47% being long positions. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw $61.36 million in liquidations, where 51.34% were long positions. Surprisingly, HYPE token experienced $33.52 million in liquidations, but with 97.93% being short positions. How Do Crypto Liquidations Impact Market Stability? Large-scale crypto liquidations create significant market turbulence. When exchanges force-close positions, they trigger additional selling or buying pressure. This cascade effect can: Accelerate price movements in either direction Increase market volatility substantially Create opportunities for contrarian traders Test market liquidity during stress periods These crypto liquidations serve as a stark reminder about risk management. Traders using high leverage face the highest exposure during such events. The recent crypto liquidations demonstrate how quickly market conditions can change. Understanding the Crypto Liquidations Breakdown The distribution of these crypto liquidations tells a compelling story. Bitcoin’s dominance in the liquidation figures reflects its central role in cryptocurrency markets. However, the mixed long-short ratio suggests balanced market sentiment before the move. Ethereum’s similar pattern indicates correlated market behavior. The HYPE token’s unusual 97.93% short liquidation ratio reveals a different dynamic entirely. This suggests most traders were betting against HYPE when it moved unexpectedly in their favor. Key Takeaways From Recent Crypto Liquidations Market participants should consider several crucial points from this event. First, proper position sizing remains essential in volatile markets. Second, diversification across different timeframes and strategies can mitigate liquidation risks. Third, monitoring overall market leverage provides valuable context for potential crypto liquidations. These crypto liquidations also highlight the importance of: Setting appropriate stop-loss orders Monitoring funding rates across exchanges Understanding liquidation price calculations Maintaining adequate margin buffers Navigating Future Crypto Liquidations Successfully Traders can implement several strategies to manage liquidation risks effectively. Using lower leverage reduces the probability of forced closures. Regularly monitoring positions and adjusting stop-loss levels based on market volatility also helps. Additionally, spreading exposure across different cryptocurrencies can prevent concentrated liquidation events. The recent $184 million crypto liquidations episode underscores the inherent risks in leveraged trading. While opportunities exist in volatile markets, understanding liquidation mechanics becomes crucial for long-term success. Market participants should approach leveraged positions with careful risk assessment and robust management strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when traders’ positions get automatically closed by exchanges due to insufficient margin. This happens when price movements go against leveraged positions beyond maintenance margin requirements. How can I avoid crypto liquidations? You can avoid crypto liquidations by using lower leverage, maintaining adequate margin buffers, setting stop-loss orders, and regularly monitoring your positions during volatile periods. Why do Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead liquidation events? Bitcoin and Ethereum typically lead liquidation events because they have the highest trading volumes and open interest in perpetual futures markets, making them more susceptible to large-scale liquidations. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when prices fall rapidly, forcing buyers to sell. Short liquidations occur when prices rise quickly, forcing sellers to buy back their positions. How do liquidations affect cryptocurrency prices? Liquidations can accelerate price movements by creating additional buying or selling pressure as exchanges automatically close positions, often leading to cascading effects in the market. Can liquidations create trading opportunities? Yes, experienced traders sometimes view large liquidation events as potential reversal points, as forced selling or buying can exhaust market moves and create contrarian opportunities.

The cryptocurrency community was recently buzzing with rumors that Donald Trump’s son predicted Ethereum would hit $8,000. However, these claims turned out to be completely false, and Eric Trump himself has stepped forward to set the record straight about this fabricated ETH price prediction. What Really Happened With the ETH Price Prediction? The controversy began when a social media account called ‘cryptogoos’ posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Eric Trump believed ETH would reach $8,000 within just 38 days. This specific ETH price prediction quickly gained traction across crypto forums and social media platforms. However, Eric Trump personally responded to the post, calling it “fake news nonsense” and clarifying that he never made such statements about any ETH price prediction. Why Do Fake Crypto Predictions Spread So Quickly? The cryptocurrency space is particularly vulnerable to misinformation for several reasons: High volatility creates excitement around price predictions Celebrity endorsements carry significant weight in crypto communities Social media algorithms prioritize engaging content regardless of accuracy Financial incentives drive some to spread false information This environment makes fabricated ETH price prediction stories particularly dangerous for investors who might make decisions based on false information. How to Verify Crypto News and ETH Price Predictions Before believing any ETH price prediction or cryptocurrency news, consider these verification steps: Check official sources and verified accounts Look for multiple independent confirmations Be skeptical of claims that seem too good to be true Verify the track record of the source making predictions In this case, Eric Trump’s direct denial on the same platform where the false ETH price prediction originated provided clear evidence that the story was fabricated. The Real Impact of False ETH Price Predictions Fake predictions can have serious consequences beyond just spreading misinformation. When influential figures are falsely associated with specific ETH price prediction claims, it can: Create artificial market movements Damage the credibility of legitimate analysts Cause financial losses for inexperienced investors Undermine trust in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem Eric Trump’s quick response helped minimize the potential damage from this particular false ETH price prediction. What Eric Trump Actually Said About Ethereum While denying the fabricated $8,000 ETH price prediction, Eric Trump did express some positive sentiment toward Ethereum. He mentioned that he would “like to see ETH reach that price” even though he never actually predicted it would happen. This distinction is crucial – having hopeful expectations is different from making a specific ETH price prediction with a timeline. Protecting Yourself From Fake Crypto News The Eric Trump ETH price prediction incident serves as an important reminder to always verify information before acting on it. Here are actionable steps you can take: Follow official accounts of public figures directly Use multiple reputable news sources for confirmation Be cautious of anonymous or unverified accounts Remember that even positive ETH price prediction claims need verification Frequently Asked Questions Did Eric Trump really predict ETH would reach $8,000? No, Eric Trump explicitly denied making any such ETH price prediction and called the claims “fake news nonsense.” Where did the false ETH price prediction originate? The false claim started with a post from the ‘cryptogoos’ account on X (formerly Twitter) and spread from there. How did Eric Trump respond to the fake prediction? He directly replied to the original post, denying the claims and asking the account to stop spreading misinformation. Why do people create fake crypto predictions? False predictions can generate engagement, influence markets, or damage reputations for various reasons. How can I verify cryptocurrency news? Always check official sources, look for multiple confirmations, and be skeptical of extraordinary claims. What should I do if I see suspicious crypto claims? Report misinformation to platforms, warn others, and share verified information from reliable sources.

According to Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategy at Bitwise, the traditional four-year crypto market cycle we’ve all grown accustomed to is being replaced by a faster two-year pattern. This fundamental shift in the crypto market cycle reflects how institutional involvement is reshaping everything we know about digital asset investing. What Exactly Is Changing in the Crypto Market Cycle? The classic four-year cycle, primarily driven by Bitcoin’s halving events, has dominated cryptocurrency behavior since Bitcoin’s inception. However, Park argues that institutional fund managers and ETF flows are creating a new, accelerated tempo. This evolution in the crypto market cycle means investors need to adapt their strategies accordingly. How Are Institutional Players Reshaping Market Patterns? Institutional involvement has introduced several key changes: Quarterly portfolio rebalancing by major funds ETF flow patterns creating predictable liquidity cycles Institutional risk management driving shorter-term cycles Regular reporting periods influencing investment decisions These factors combine to create a more frequent crypto market cycle that responds to traditional financial calendars rather than just Bitcoin’s programmed events. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Halving Events? While Bitcoin halvings still matter, their impact is now distributed across multiple shorter cycles. The halving’s supply shock gets absorbed and traded within the context of institutional portfolio strategies. Therefore, the crypto market cycle now reflects a blend of Bitcoin’s fundamental economics and traditional finance mechanics. How Can Investors Adapt to This New Reality? Successful navigation of the evolving crypto market cycle requires several adjustments: Monitor ETF flow data regularly Track institutional reporting calendars Adjust position sizing for more frequent cycles Combine technical and fundamental analysis Understanding these dynamics within the current crypto market cycle can provide significant advantages for both retail and institutional participants. What Are the Practical Implications of This Shift? The compressed crypto market cycle means opportunities and risks appear more frequently. Volatility patterns may change, and traditional seasonal trends might evolve. Most importantly, the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem must recalibrate its expectations about market timing and investment horizons. The transformation of the crypto market cycle from four years to two represents a maturation of the entire digital asset space. As institutions become permanent fixtures in cryptocurrency markets, their influence on market patterns will only grow stronger. This new crypto market cycle demands that investors stay informed, remain flexible, and continuously update their strategies to succeed in this rapidly evolving landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What evidence supports the 2-year cycle theory? Recent market data shows clearer patterns aligning with institutional reporting periods and ETF flow cycles rather than just Bitcoin halving events. Does this mean Bitcoin halvings no longer matter? Bitcoin halvings remain important, but their impact now interacts with institutional cycles, creating more complex market behavior. How should retail investors adjust their strategies? Retail investors should monitor institutional flow data and consider shorter rebalancing periods while maintaining long-term perspectives. Will this affect cryptocurrency volatility? Volatility patterns may become more predictable around institutional calendar events while maintaining overall market characteristics. Are other cryptocurrencies affected by this cycle shift? Yes, since Bitcoin dominates market sentiment, most major cryptocurrencies will experience similar cycle compression effects. How reliable is this new 2-year cycle pattern? While emerging data supports the pattern, cryptocurrency markets remain relatively young, and cycles may continue evolving. Found this analysis of the changing crypto market cycle insightful?

Howell’s starting point is his own definition of liquidity, which diverges sharply from textbook aggregates like M2. “This is the flow of money through global financial markets,” he said. It is not bank deposits in the real economy, but “money that is in the financial markets… it looks at the repo markets, it considers shadow banking,” and “pretty much begins where conventional M2 definitions end.” On his Global Liquidity Index, weekly global liquidity was under $100 trillion in 2010 and now sits “just under $200 trillion” – a doubling in a decade and a half. Howell Flags Liquidity Peak What matters most to him, however, is not the level but the momentum of that liquidity. Howell has identified a remarkably stable 65-month global liquidity cycle that he interprets as a debt-refinancing rhythm. Capital markets, he argues, are no longer primarily about funding new investment: “Something like 70 to 80% of transactions… are debt refinancing transactions. They’re not about raising new capital.” Related Reading: Crypto Crash Is A Forced Crypto Seller Unwind, Glassnode Co-Founders In that world, “debt needs liquidity for rollovers but actually liquidity needs debt,” because roughly three-quarters of global lending is now collateral-backed. The result, as he puts it bluntly, is that “ironically it’s old debt that finances new liquidity.” To capture the systemic tension, Howell tracks a debt-to-liquidity ratio for advanced economies: the total public and private debt stock divided by the pool of refinancing liquidity. The ratio averages about two times and tends to mean-revert. When it drops well below that level, liquidity is abundant and “you get asset bubbles.” When it rises significantly above, “you start to see a stretched debt-liquidity ratio and you get financing tensions or refinancing tensions and you can see those basically morph into financial crisis.” Right now, he says, “we’re transitioning, unfortunately, out of a period that I’ve labeled the everything bubble,” a phase where liquidity was abundant relative to debt after repeated rounds of QE and emergency support. The COVID era deepened that imbalance by encouraging borrowers to “term out” debt at near-zero rates. “A lot of the debt that then existed was refinanced back into the late 2020s at low interest rates,” he noted. That created a visible “debt maturity wall” later this decade: heavy refinancing needs now coming due into a much tighter funding environment. Shorter-term, Howell is focused on the interaction between Federal Reserve liquidity operations, the rebuilding of the US Treasury General Account and growing stress in repo markets. SOFR, which “you’d actually expect to trade below Fed funds” because it is collateralized, has repeatedly traded above its normal range. “We’ve started to see these repo spreads blow out,” he warned, adding that “it’s not really the extent of these spikes… it’s really the frequency that’s the most important factor.” If trade fails and leveraged positions begin to unwind, “it’s going to turn quite ugly and that could be the start of the end of the cycle.” Related Reading: Crypto Markets Underestimate A Trump-Style Flood Of Rate Cuts: Expert Inside his four liquidity regimes – rebound, calm, speculation and turbulence – Howell places the US firmly in “speculation,” with Europe and parts of Asia in “late calm.” Historically, early and mid-upswings favor equities and credit, peaks favor commodities and real assets, downswings favor cash and then long-duration government bonds. LIVE NOW – The Real Crypto Cycle: What Happens When Global Liquidity Peaks Global liquidity veteran Michael Howell (@crossbordercap) joins to map out the “master variable” driving asset price: A 65-month global liquidity and debt refinancing cycle that underpins booms, busts,… pic.twitter.com/Ryl3fqHoYR — Bankless (@Bankless) November 24, 2025 The Impact On The Crypto Market Crypto, in his work, straddles categories. “Crypto generally behaves a little bit like a tech stock and a little bit like a commodity,” he said. For Bitcoin specifically, “about 40–45% of the drivers… are global liquidity factors,” with most of the rest split between gold-like behavior and pure risk appetite. On the popular notion of a hardwired four-year Bitcoin halving cycle, Howell is unconvinced. “I don’t really see any evidence of that four-year cycle,” he said, arguing that the 65-month global liquidity/debt-refinancing cycle is the more robust driver. With that cycle projected to peak around now, crypto looks “late stage in the crypto cycle. So it could be over but it might not be.” The structural backdrop, in his view, is unambiguous: “The trend towards monetary inflation… is slated to continue for another two or three decades at least.” Against that, he argues, investors “have to have” monetary-inflation hedges: “It’s not Bitcoin or gold. [It’s] Bitcoin and gold.” Tactically, though, he is cautious. “We’ve not turned bearish risk-off yet, but we are not bullish short-term,” he said – and suggested that upcoming weakness in risk assets might be “a good time to pick up some more” of those long-term hedges. At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $2.96 trillion.

Reports have disclosed that this share is roughly equal to 145 EH/s (exahashes per second), putting the country behind the United States and Russia in raw hashrate. The shift comes despite an official crackdown on mining that started in 2021, when many operations moved overseas. According to data from Hashrate Index and other tracking services, the rebound is real and measurable. Some mining activity now appears to be running in Xinjiang and Sichuan, where power costs can be low at certain times. Based on reports, operators are using a mix of legacy farms, small private setups and cloud-like arrangements that mask mining as other forms of compute work. Why Bitcoin Mining Returned To China Cheap electricity is one driver. Another is that factory and data center capacity can be reused without large new investments. Manufacturers that supply mining rigs also report stronger sales back home. Canaan, a maker of mining machines, has seen a pickup in Chinese demand. That suggests money is again flowing into hardware and setup, not just into restarting old machines. At the same time, revenue from mining has been under pressure. Hashprice — the estimated payout per unit of hashrate — fell to record lows this year as Bitcoin prices and fees weakened and mining difficulty rose. That decline puts strain on smaller players and makes efficiency and low-cost power more important than ever. What This Means For The Network A return of significant mining capacity to China raises two kinds of concern. One is over concentration: if too much hashrate clusters in particular regions or systems, the network’s geographic diversity shrinks. The other is enforcement uncertainty. Mining remains banned on paper in many parts of China, yet enforcement appears uneven. As a result, some operations run under the radar while others run in partnerships with local firms that provide energy and space. Publicly available maps track hashrate by country, but exact figures can shift fast. The best current snapshot points to China at 14% and about 145 EH/s of capacity, but those numbers will change as miners add or remove machines. The United States and Russia remain the largest hosts, and that fact does limit immediate systemic risk. What Analysts Are Watching Analysts will watch three things closely: whether Chinese authorities change enforcement, how hardware makers like Canaan perform in coming quarters, and whether hashprice recovers if Bitcoin’s price strengthens. If policy softens in some regions, more visible growth could follow. If enforcement tightens, activity could scatter again, just as it did after the 2021 ban.

This partnership has enabled Bitplanet to build a substantial Bitcoin position at an average purchase price of $91,335 per coin. The decision to increase their Bitcoin investment comes at a time when institutional adoption is accelerating globally. Many corporations now view Bitcoin as both a store of value and a strategic hedge against inflation. Bitplanet’s methodical accumulation strategy suggests they see long-term potential in the digital asset space. What Makes This Bitcoin Investment Different From Others? Bitplanet’s approach stands out for several key reasons: Transparent reporting through official channels Consistent accumulation rather than one-time purchases Strategic partnership with experienced crypto investors Public disclosure of average purchase prices This level of transparency is particularly important for publicly traded companies.

Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Been Growing In Number Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the Supply Distribution of the key Bitcoin investors. The “ Supply Distribution ” is an indicator that tells us, among other things, the number of addresses that belong to a particular cohort. Investors are divided into these groups based on the amount of the asset that they are carrying in their balance. For example, the 1 to 10 coins cohort includes all wallets with at least 1 and at most 10 BTC. The Supply Distribution for this group would determine the total number of addresses on the network that fall inside the range. In the context of the current topic, the range of interest is the 100+ BTC one, equivalent to about $8.6 million at the current exchange rate. It includes two key investor cohorts known as the sharks and whales . The sharks and whales are entities that can carry some degree of influence on the blockchain due to their large holdings (with whales naturally being the more important of the two), so their behavior can often be worth keeping an eye on. Since the all-time high (ATH) in October, Bitcoin has been following a downtrend, and as the chart below shows, the sharks and whales initially reacted by exiting as their Supply Distribution registered a sharp drop. Interestingly, however, as Bitcoin’s decline has accelerated since November 11th, the Supply Distribution of the sharks and whales has witnessed a reversal. Today, there are 91 more investors of this size on the network compared to the low earlier in the month. This represents an increase of 0.47% for the metric, which, while not that high, is a sign that big money holders have been slowly coming back in to buy the crash. Santiment has also revealed that the smallest of investors on the network (holding less than 0.1 BTC or $8,700) have seen their population shrink at the same time as this growth in the sharks and whales. This trend could be a potential indication that the small hands have been capitulating after the bearish momentum, and large entities have been buying coins off them. “Retail capitulation will generally play out well for crypto prices in the long run,” explained the analytics firm. BTC Price Bitcoin displayed a brief recovery above $89,000 on Monday, but the coin has since retraced back to $87,000.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Capitulation|Bitcoin Retail|Bitcoin Sharks & Whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-26 05:00:22

The recent impulse off support is starting to hint at a potential macro shift, raising expectations for a breakout-driven continuation if buyers can maintain control. Building Toward A Truncated Low: Market Structure Turns Complicated Hov recently highlighted a key shift in XRP’s structure, revisiting the outlook from the previous analysis where a potential push lower was expected to complete a truncated low. Since that discussion, XRP has dipped further, printing a new low on the line chart compared to the wick from the liquidity sweep. However, the movement into that low hasn’t been straightforward, carrying a structure that appears more complex than initially projected. Related Reading: XRP Price Continues Lower as Sellers Tighten Grip on Intraday Structure At first glance, the drop appeared to be a simple three-wave corrective pattern. But on closer inspection, Hov noted that a valid expanding diagonal count is also emerging. Despite the unusual structure, the price action off the most recent low is showing signs of strength. XRP is now developing a clearer impulsive move upward, which could be the early stages of the momentum needed to set up the high-probability C/3 wave trade that has been anticipated. This early impulse doesn’t yet confirm a full trend reversal, but it does reflect a notable shift in market aggressiveness. For now, Hov maintains a bullish leaning toward this support zone holding. As long as buyers continue defending this area, the probability of the reversal scenario increases. XRP Breaks Key Retracement Level As RSI Signals Growing Strength According to the latest update from TARA, XRP has successfully tapped the 0.5 retracement level while showing impressive strength on the RSI. That reaction alone hints at growing momentum beneath the surface. A break above this zone would shift the focus toward the next major target at $2.30, aligning with the crucial 0.382 level. Reclaiming that area would serve as a strong signal that XRP may finally be carving out a true bottom. Related Reading: XRP Price Pulls Back Slightly — Market Still Poised for Fresh Advance Despite this promising setup, confirmation of a new trend is still missing. Momentum is building, and price action is becoming increasingly impulsive, exactly the type of behavior typically seen at the early stage of a macro Wave 3. Another key factor lies outside XRP’s chart entirely. BTC has just reached its resistance zone around $88,300 and has not yet gained the strength needed to break through. This moment of hesitation is important because Bitcoin’s next decision will heavily influence XRP’s short-term direction. The market is extremely close to confirming its next major leg, and all eyes remain on how these critical levels react in the coming sessions.

The dashboard in the video shows total cumulative net inflows into XRP spot ETFs at $422.66 million as of Nov 21. Canary Capital’s XRPC fund on NASDAQ reached $306.02 million in cumulative net inflows. Bitwise’s product on the NYSE recorded $116.63 million. Both funds are in their early stages, yet the figures show strong interest from traders. X Finance Bull celebrated the rising interest and demand for XRP-focused products. He also noted that Bitcoin has more than 10 ETF products while XRP had only 2 at the time of his analysis. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Increasing Interest in XRP Bitcoin is still the largest cryptocurrency market. However, the ETF outflows indicate a period where some investors choose to move capital elsewhere. Traders often watch these shifts because ETF flows show how institutions adjust positions as conditions change. X Finance Bull stated that this trend is “not a fluke.” He also wrote that it is a rotation toward assets tied to utility and compliance. The data in the video reinforces that the inflows are concentrated. Daily values show steady levels of interest in a narrow timeframe. What Comes Next for XRP? Other XRP ETFs have launched since X Finance Bull’s analysis. These have also received substantial attention from institutional investors. Such early demand may influence how future issuers gauge the appetite for similar products. New products expand access, widen liquidity, and give institutions more ways to build positions. X Finance Bull claimed that “the flows are coming,” suggesting that the early numbers represent the start of a larger trend. How this develops will depend on trading volume, new filings, and market conditions in the coming months. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

It appears that Solana (SOL), with its impressive network, has lagged behind other assets and has struggled with congestion and its prices to the point where investors seek alternative assets with more pressing catalysts. This kind of quest for “high pot” or growth prospects has ignited interest in presale projects that are well-grounded in fundamentals and have well-defined growth strategies. It is within this context that projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rank highest as far as recommendations for ‘what crypto to buy in the crypto market now’ are concerned. Solana’s Momentum Challenge Many investors are frustrated with Solana lately for failing to take full advantage of market rebounds. Despite its technology showing so much promise, certain factors seem to have impeded its success, including network stability and competition pressures. This has caused experts in the cryptosphere to suggest spreading investments into projects that involve lower overhead resistance and event-driven cycles for growth. The quest for the most ideal crypto to invest in has started to lean towards new cryptos like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in their last stages of presales, where entry points are tailored for optimal gain post-listing. A Presale Nearing Complete Allocation Mutuum Finance offers a very compelling reason for capital redefinition, as its presale has reached notable milestones that stress its ability to rank as one of the top cryptos to buy immediately. The project has managed to secure $19,000,000 and create a holder base of 18,200 investors. Phase 6 is Now Over 95% Sold out, where tokens are priced at $0.035 – which is last-chance buying to secure MUTM before its price increases to $0.040 in the next phase. With the launch price pegged at only $0.06 per token, this means that those who engage in its investment are guaranteed to gain well over 400% at current rates, something that has attracted experts and various investors trying to figure out what to buy for further growth. Stablecoin for Ecosystem Stability One important aspect that enhances Mutuum Finance’s position within the top cryptocurrencies to purchase is its upcoming development to include its own over-collateralized stable coin. This will be directly pegged to the United States dollar on a 1:1 ratio and can only be created by individuals that provide valid collateral within its borrowing marketplace. This enables a closed-loop environment that increases borrowing as well as contributes to protocols that enhance stability within its ecosystem. The token functionality within the dual lending markets facilitated by the stablecoin introduces a basic utility element which is expected to fuel future demand for the MUTM token, making it an advanced alternative for individuals considering the best crypto to invest in for 2025. Investor Confidence and Security In a marketplace where technological viability is so important, Mutuum Finance is working hard to secure its platform integrity with a full audit review by Halborn Security. This audit review for its core contracts related to borrowing and lending functions on its platform is important work that precedes its mainnet launch. This emphasis on security offers a sense of trust that is essential for luring hesitant capital, making MUTM stand out as a secure and well-organized project. For experts on cryptocurrencies advising on which ones to invest in, this attention to risk management minimizes risks exponentially in projects launched with no evaluation on this front. Capitalizing on a Calculated Opportunity The state of the market now offers a strategic play between persevering in holding underperforming large-scale assets or switching to projects with noticeable momentum and identifiable catalysts. Mutuum Finance is representative of the latter, its presale stage almost sold out, serving as its definitive catalyst for its next price movement. The window to accumulate tokens for $0.035 is fast approaching its end, making this part of a crucial phase for investors to take action. For those keeping up with professional recommendations on which cryptocurrency to buy now to recover profits, claiming a spot in MUTM’s Phase 6 would prove to be one decisive act to set up for growth.

Although it appears that the pending launch of 21Shares and Grayscale Doge ETFs can create a plausible reason for Dogecoin to reverse its slide, historical patterns suggest that launch events for alternative cryptocurrency ETFs haven’t always thwarted corrective selling. This volatility and reliance on speculative catalysts are also causing rapid rotation of capital into DeFi projects that possess better fundamentals, utility, and organized growth strategies. It is within this context that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly making its entry into the top cryptocurrencies for 2025 due to its fast-paced presale culmination and well-organized protocol design, thereby making it one of the foremost alternatives for massive profits. Presale Nearing a Crucial Sellout Point The presale event for Mutuum Finance is in sharp contrast to speculation regarding Dogecoin, as it showcases genuine demand via hard data. This project has managed to secure $19,000,000 with support from 18,200 investors, and its sixth presale phase priced at $0.035 is more than 95% subscribed, marking a limited opportunity prior to its approaching 20% surge to $0.040 in phase 7. This continually shrinking window of opportunity, together with its initial launch price of $0.06, translates to probable returns above 400% for existing investors. It is for this reason that most analysts are terming MUTM to be the next crypto to explode. Dynamic Leaderboard Fuels Engagement Apart from its attractive economic model, Mutuum Finance has managed to create a very active community via its innovative leaderboard program that lasts for 24 hours. This program injects healthy competition into its presale event by rewarding each day’s top contributor with a $500 MUTM bonus for transacting at least once within its designated UTC window. The leaderboard restarts every day at 00:00 UTC to promote continuous involvement and create a dynamic environment for interested individuals to engage with. This not only encourages individuals to display unending support to the project but also enhances its reputation for being one of the top cryptos to buy now for investors willing to grow financially and participate in an interactive investment experience. Unwavering Commitment to Security Trust being critically important to its operations in its line of business, Mutuum Finance openly enhances its roots by ensuring very firm security protocols. It is undergoing an audit by Halborn Security, a recognized company which painstakingly analyzes its primary loans and borrows contracts. This kind of preventive approach ensures that everything is in order on this platform prior to utilizing any funds from its users on mainnet, thereby giving investors great assurance. To those who are concerned about holes within other speculative assets, MUTM can therefore prove to be a very safe and reputable crypto investment platform within the rather volatile nature of the crypto environment. Seizing the Moment for Exponential Growth It has rarely been as apparent that meme markets operating out of panic and well-organized presales are worlds apart. As Dogecoin investors look to ETFs for salvation, investors in Mutuum Finance are taking advantage of a genuine opportunity. 95% sell-out in Phase 6 means it is the last chance to buy MUTM at its present price, which will soon become a milestone in history. For those interested in the next big thing in cryptocurrencies that are utilizing utility, security, and communal development, it is essential to act on investing in Mutuum Finance presales prior to the looming price rise.

These financial products have witnessed impressive appetite as they outperform leading Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. For instance, Solana’s exchange-traded funds have seen positive flows since their launch. Now, we’re talking about meme token ETFs. They are crucial as they introduce institutional-grade utility into cryptocurrencies that rely on hype. Grayscale’s GDOG went live early this week, on Monday, and has likely experienced significant demand. Within two days, Bitwise adds to the momentum with an announcement of the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF, set to start trading on November 26, 2025, according to today’s press release. The asset manager emphasized that community demand prompted the move, stating: We weren’t expecting to launch this product, but the DOGE community requested, nay demanded, this. Bitwise @BitwiseInvest · Follow Introducing the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. $BWOW starts trading tomorrow.We weren’t expecting to launch this product, but the $DOGE community requested, nay demanded, this.Dogecoin is:– Seventh-largest crypto asset by market weight (as of 11/25/25)– $22B market cap– $1B traded 4:34 AM · Nov 26, 2025 319 Reply Copy link Read 33 replies That means the BWOW launch isn’t coming after a long-term corporate plan. Instead, growing and persistent demand from the Dogecoin community fueled the ETF’s debut. An internet joke turns financial icon Meanwhile, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted Dogecoin’s unlikely growth in the financial space. The crypto began as a joke, and is now materializing into a legitimate financial product. Indeed, the DOGE team didn’t build a revolutionary instrument with a robust utility narrative. Dogecoin introduced a light-hearted dog to indicate that crypto should be free for all to participate and experiment. The altcoin rose against all odds, maintaining its market value and cultural relevance for nearly 13 years. Now, the DOGE “community that numbers in the millions” is demanding exposure to the meme token in an exchange-traded product model. Horsley said : Bitwise is launching BWOW because many DOGE holders, a community that numbers in the millions, want the benefit that comes from getting exposure to crypto in an ETP format, and we believe they should have it. Dogecoin’s rise into a respected financial product Despite its somewhat controversial origins, DOGE has grown into a noticeable asset. Dogecoin is the 9th largest digital token, boasting a market cap of $22.87 billion (CoinMarketCap data). Moreover, the $1 billion in daily traded volume signals massive trader interest in the original meme coin. BWOW’s trading details The Bitwise Dogecoin ETF starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. Notably, early adopters will enjoy zero fees for a month before the company shifts to a 0.34% management fee. The announcement clarified: The Bitwise Dogecoin ETF will trade on NYSE starting November 26, 2025, under the ticker BWOW. The management fee will be 0.34%, with the fee set at 0% for the first month on the first $500 million in assets. DOGE is trading at $0.1504 after shedding more than 5% of its value over the past week, influenced by broader market weakness.

The Australian dollar is rocketing higher after scorching inflation data, while the New Zealand dollar is surging following the RBNZ’s surprisingly hawkish stance. This perfect storm of central bank policy shifts is creating unprecedented opportunities for forex traders. Why are Asian currencies stabilizing amid Federal Reserve uncertainty? Asian currencies are finding solid footing as markets increasingly price in Federal Reserve rate cuts for 2024. The US dollar index has retreated from recent highs, providing relief to emerging market currencies across the region. Market pricing now suggests a 68% probability of Fed easing by March, with full percentage point of cuts anticipated by year-end. Australian dollar surges on unexpected inflation strength The Aussie dollar is leading the charge higher after Australia’s Consumer Price Index shocked markets with its resilience. Quarterly inflation printed at 1.2%, well above the 0.8% consensus forecast. This robust data has forced traders to reconsider their Reserve Bank of Australia rate cut expectations, with some analysts now predicting additional tightening. Currency Current Level Daily Change Key Driver AUD/USD 0.6580 +0.8% Hot CPI Data NZD/USD 0.6125 +1.2% RBNZ Hawkish Stance USD/JPY 147.80 -0.3% Fed Cut Expectations New Zealand dollar jumps after RBNZ policy surprise The Reserve Bank of New Zealand delivered a hawkish shock that sent the Kiwi dollar soaring. While holding rates steady at 5.5%, the central bank signaled that policy will need to remain restrictive for longer than markets anticipated. The RBNZ’s updated projections show inflation remaining above target through 2024, suggesting rate cuts are unlikely before late 2024. What does Federal Reserve policy mean for Asian currency traders? The evolving Federal Reserve outlook is creating both challenges and opportunities for Asian currency traders. Three key factors are driving market sentiment: Diverging central bank policies between the Fed and Asian central banks Shifting inflation dynamics across different economies Changing risk appetite as global growth concerns persist RBNZ policy shift creates new trading dynamics The Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s firm stance has fundamentally altered the interest rate differential landscape. With the RBNZ committed to fighting inflation while the Fed prepares to ease, the NZD/USD pair could see sustained strength. This policy divergence represents one of the clearest macro trades available in currency markets today. Actionable insights for navigating Asian currency volatility Traders should focus on three strategic approaches in current market conditions. First, monitor central bank communications for policy clues. Second, watch economic data releases for inflation surprises. Third, maintain flexible position sizing to manage elevated volatility. The combination of Federal Reserve uncertainty and regional policy divergence requires careful risk management. FAQs What is driving Australian dollar strength? The Australian dollar is strengthening due to surprisingly strong inflation data that has reduced expectations for near-term Reserve Bank of Australia rate cuts. How has RBNZ policy affected the New Zealand dollar? The Reserve Bank of New Zealand maintained a hawkish stance, signaling rates will stay higher for longer, which has boosted the New Zealand dollar significantly. What are current Federal Reserve rate cut expectations? Markets are pricing in approximately 125 basis points of Federal Reserve rate cuts for 2024, with the first cut expected around March. Which Asian currencies are most sensitive to Fed policy? Currencies like the Korean won, Indonesian rupiah, and Philippine peso typically show high sensitivity to Federal Reserve policy changes due to capital flow dynamics. How does US monetary policy impact emerging Asian markets? US monetary policy directly affects capital flows, risk appetite, and currency valuations across emerging Asian markets through interest rate differentials and dollar strength. The convergence of Federal Reserve easing expectations and hawkish Asian central bank stances has created a powerful rally in regional currencies. With the Australian dollar surging on inflation concerns and the New Zealand dollar jumping after RBNZ firmness, traders are navigating one of the most dynamic currency environments in recent memory. The key to success lies in understanding central bank divergence and positioning for sustained policy differences.

The effort comes as her likely successor, SEC official Michael Selig, awaits a Senate vote. In recent testimony, Selig placed a lot of emphasis on the need for stronger federal oversight of spot digital asset markets and a more diverse, fully staffed CFTC leadership. Pham Pushes New CEO Council Acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham opened nominations for CEOs to serve on a newly proposed “CEO Innovation Council.” The goal of this body will be to help shape future policy discussions, including those related to digital assets and prediction markets, as the agency prepares for an expanded mandate. In a notice that was published Tuesday, Pham invited submissions until Dec. 8. Pham framed the initiative as a continuation of the agency’s previous digital asset efforts, including its “Crypto Sprint” program, a dedicated industry forum, and its ongoing involvement in congressional work around a comprehensive market structure bill. According to her, the new council is intended to help the CFTC “hit the ground running” as it tackles an expanded mission, ensuring markets stay “vibrant and resilient” while still maintaining strong protections for participants. She explained that tapping experts and builders directly from the industry is very essential while the CFTC broadens its oversight of crypto markets and emerging prediction-market products. The timing of the council’s formation is still uncertain, especially given the CFTC’s unusual leadership vacuum. Pham has been serving as the sole commissioner for months, and her tenure may soon end. SEC official Michael Selig has been nominated to become the Senate-confirmed chair of the CFTC, and his appointment is expected to advance to a floor vote once lawmakers return to Washington, DC after the Thanksgiving recess. Selig’s recent testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee offered early clues to his potential regulatory philosophy. He told lawmakers it was “vitally important” to have a “cop on the beat” overseeing spot digital asset commodity markets, which suggests he is ready to form a clear, dedicated federal oversight of crypto trading activity. He also stressed that there is a need for “a diversity of viewpoints” in leadership, especially when considering that the CFTC has operated without additional commissioners and without further White House nominations from President Donald Trump.

What Does This Prediction Market Ruling Mean for Crypto? A federal court in Nevada has removed crucial protection for prediction market platforms, lifting the temporary injunction that Kalshi had previously secured. This decision empowers state regulators to take direct enforcement action against the platform. The ruling fundamentally challenges how prediction markets have operated under federal exemptions, creating immediate uncertainty for the entire sector. Why Nevada’s Prediction Market Crackdown Matters Nevada regulators initially issued a cease-and-desist letter to Kalshi in March, warning of both civil and criminal penalties. The state alleged multiple legal violations, particularly focusing on how these platforms handle sports-related contracts. The court’s latest decision validates Nevada’s position, suggesting that prediction market platforms cannot automatically claim federal protection from state oversight. The legal battle centers on a critical distinction: whether prediction market contracts qualify as swaps under the Commodity Exchange Act. The court determined they do not, meaning platforms like Kalshi lose their exemption from state regulation. This interpretation could affect every prediction market operating in the United States. How This Prediction Market Decision Changes Everything Previously, prediction market platforms registered as Designated Contract Markets (DCMs) enjoyed federal protection from state-level interference. This new ruling dismantles that protection, potentially exposing platforms to: Multiple state enforcement actions Varying regulatory requirements across jurisdictions Increased compliance costs Potential operational restrictions The decision creates immediate challenges for the prediction market industry, which must now navigate a patchwork of state regulations rather than relying on unified federal oversight. What’s Next for Prediction Market Platforms? This ruling represents a significant shift in how authorities view prediction markets. Platforms may need to reconsider their legal strategies and operational models. The case highlights growing regulatory scrutiny of decentralized finance platforms and their compliance with existing financial laws. For investors and users, this development signals increased regulatory attention on prediction markets. While the long-term implications remain uncertain, the immediate effect is clear: prediction markets face heightened legal risks and regulatory challenges. Prediction Market Future: Adaptation or Retreat? The Nevada court decision creates a precedent that other states might follow. Prediction market platforms must now assess whether to adapt their models to meet state requirements or reconsider their operations in certain jurisdictions. This regulatory shift could accelerate industry consolidation or prompt innovation in compliance solutions. Ultimately, this case demonstrates the ongoing tension between innovative financial technologies and established regulatory frameworks. As prediction markets continue evolving, so too will the legal landscape surrounding them. Frequently Asked Questions What is a prediction market? Prediction markets are platforms where users can trade contracts based on the outcomes of future events, from sports results to political elections. Why did Nevada target Kalshi? Nevada regulators alleged Kalshi violated state laws by offering contracts tied to sports events without proper authorization. How does this affect other prediction markets? The ruling sets a precedent that could enable other states to pursue similar enforcement actions against prediction market platforms. Can Kalshi appeal this decision? Yes, Kalshi can appeal the federal court’s decision to a higher court, potentially delaying final resolution of the case. What happens to existing users? Current users should monitor platform communications and be prepared for potential changes in service availability or terms. Are prediction markets legal elsewhere? Regulation varies globally, with some countries embracing prediction markets while others restrict or ban them entirely. Found this analysis helpful?

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors worldwide are asking one crucial question: What does the future hold for Ripple XRP? Our comprehensive XRP price prediction analysis examines the factors that could propel this digital asset to new heights by 2030. With regulatory clarity emerging and institutional adoption growing, understanding the potential trajectory of Ripple XRP becomes essential for every crypto portfolio strategy. What Factors Influence XRP Price Prediction? Several key elements shape our cryptocurrency forecast for XRP. Market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements all play critical roles in determining price movements. The ongoing SEC case resolution has created significant volatility, while partnerships with financial institutions continue to build fundamental value. Technical analysis patterns and trading volume also provide important indicators for our XRP 2025 projections and beyond. Ripple XRP Technical Analysis and Market Position Current market data reveals interesting patterns for this digital asset . XRP maintains its position among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, demonstrating resilience despite market fluctuations. The token’s utility in cross-border payments and banking solutions provides real-world use cases that differentiate it from purely speculative assets. Our analysis considers both short-term technical indicators and long-term fundamental strengths. Year Conservative Prediction Moderate Prediction Bullish Prediction 2025 $1.20 $2.50 $3.80 2027 $2.80 $4.20 $6.50 2030 $5.50 $8.75 $12.00 Can XRP Reach $5 by 2030? The $5 milestone represents a significant psychological barrier for XRP investors. Based on our XRP price prediction models, reaching this target requires specific market conditions: Clear regulatory framework establishment Increased institutional adoption in banking sector Growing cross-border payment volume Positive market sentiment across cryptocurrency space Successful implementation of RippleNet expansions Ripple XRP Challenges and Opportunities Every digital asset faces obstacles, and Ripple XRP is no exception. Regulatory uncertainty remains the primary challenge, while competition from other payment solutions creates market pressure. However, opportunities abound through banking partnerships and the growing demand for efficient international money transfers. Our cryptocurrency forecast accounts for both the risks and potential rewards. Actionable Insights for XRP Investors Successful investment in Ripple XRP requires strategic planning. Consider these approaches: Diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio Monitor regulatory developments closely Set realistic profit targets based on our XRP 2025 projections Use dollar-cost averaging to manage volatility Stay informed about Ripple partnership announcements Frequently Asked Questions What is Ripple’s current market position? Ripple Labs continues to expand its global footprint through partnerships with financial institutions. The company’s focus remains on improving cross-border payment efficiency using XRP as a bridge currency. How does regulatory news affect XRP price? Regulatory announcements, particularly from the Securities and Exchange Commission , create significant price volatility. Positive resolutions typically drive price increases, while uncertainty can cause temporary declines. What makes XRP different from other cryptocurrencies? XRP serves as both a digital payment protocol and cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin’s mining process, XRP uses a consensus mechanism that’s faster and more energy-efficient, making it suitable for financial institution use. Who are the key leaders at Ripple? Brad Garlinghouse serves as CEO, while Chris Larsen is the executive chairman. Both have been instrumental in shaping Ripple’s vision and global expansion strategy. Conclusion: The Future of Ripple XRP Our comprehensive analysis suggests that Ripple XRP possesses strong potential for growth through 2030. While the $5 target appears achievable within our projection timeline, investors should remain cautious and informed. The cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility requires careful risk management and continuous monitoring of market developments. The journey ahead for this promising digital asset promises to be both challenging and potentially rewarding for those who navigate it wisely.

As the cryptocurrency that started it all, Bitcoin continues to capture global attention with its volatile yet potentially rewarding price movements. This comprehensive Bitcoin price prediction analysis examines the factors that could drive BTC’s value in the coming years, helping you make informed investment decisions. What Drives Bitcoin Price Prediction Accuracy? Understanding Bitcoin’s price movements requires analyzing multiple fundamental factors. The BTC forecast depends on adoption rates, regulatory developments, technological upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Historical patterns suggest that Bitcoin tends to follow four-year cycles, often correlated with halving events that reduce mining rewards. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: The Post-Halving Effect Following the 2024 halving, 2025 could see significant price appreciation based on historical patterns. Our BTC forecast for 2025 considers several key factors: Institutional adoption continuing to accelerate Potential ETF approvals in additional markets Macroeconomic conditions influencing risk assets Technological improvements to the Bitcoin network Scenario 2025 Price Range Probability Conservative $80,000 – $120,000 30% Moderate $120,000 – $180,000 50% Bullish $180,000 – $250,000 20% BTC Forecast 2026-2027: The Consolidation Phase After potential 2025 peaks, 2026-2027 might represent a consolidation period. This cryptocurrency analysis suggests these years could see: Price stabilization as markets digest previous gains Increased regulatory clarity shaping long-term trends Growing mainstream acceptance as payment method Development of Layer 2 solutions enhancing utility Cryptocurrency Analysis: Long-Term Bitcoin Investment Potential A strategic Bitcoin investment approach requires understanding both opportunities and risks. The crypto market trends indicate several positive long-term drivers: Scarcity: Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist Global adoption: Increasing recognition as digital gold Institutional interest: Growing corporate and fund allocation Technological evolution: Ongoing network improvements Bitcoin Investment Strategies for 2025-2030 Successful Bitcoin investment requires careful planning. Consider these approaches based on your risk tolerance: Dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk Portfolio allocation based on personal risk profile Secure storage solutions for long-term holdings Regular portfolio rebalancing as conditions change Crypto Market Trends Shaping Bitcoin’s Future Several broader crypto market trends will influence Bitcoin’s trajectory through 2030: Central bank digital currency developments Traditional finance integration with cryptocurrency Environmental concerns and sustainable mining solutions Global economic conditions and inflation hedging demand Frequently Asked Questions What is the most reliable Bitcoin price prediction method? Most analysts combine technical analysis, fundamental factors, and on-chain metrics. No single method guarantees accuracy, but consensus among multiple approaches provides better insights. How does the Bitcoin halving affect price? Bitcoin halvings reduce mining rewards, decreasing new supply. Historically, this scarcity effect has preceded significant price increases, though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. What risks should Bitcoin investors consider? Key risks include regulatory changes, technological vulnerabilities, market volatility, and competition from other cryptocurrencies. Diversification and proper risk management are essential. How do institutional investors view Bitcoin? Institutions like MicroStrategy and Fidelity have shown growing interest, while figures like Cameron Winklevoss and Taylor Winklevoss have been long-term advocates. BlackRock ‘s ETF applications indicate increasing mainstream acceptance. Can Bitcoin reach $1 million by 2030? While some optimistic forecasts like those from Cathie Wood of ARK Invest suggest this possibility, most conservative analyses project more moderate growth. Such high targets would require massive global adoption and favorable regulatory environments. Conclusion: The Future of Bitcoin Looks Promising Our Bitcoin price prediction analysis suggests a generally positive outlook from 2025 through 2030, though with expected volatility along the way. The fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong, driven by its scarcity, growing adoption, and potential as a hedge against traditional financial system risks. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term trajectory appears favorable for patient investors who understand the technology and market dynamics.

The proposal presented before the Congress of Deputies this month suggests that gains from crypto assets, not considered as financial instruments, should be taxed under Personal Income Tax (IRPF) at the general rate. The general IRPF base is currently capped up to 47%, per Wolters Kluwer data . According to CriptoNoticias report , at present, crypto assets come under the savings base rates, taxed up to 30%. Besides, the group said that these gains should be taxed under the Corporate Income Tax at 30%. As the third amendment, the proposal suggests that the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) create a visual risk traffic light system for crypto. This will be displayed on investor platforms in Spain, evaluating official registration, supervision, backing and liquidity. Economist and tax advisor José Antonio Bravo Mateu said that these transposes “clearly go against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.” Further, the proposal includes all crypto within the scope of seizable assets, expanding the previous rule that applies only to assets under the EU MiCA framework. Lawyer Chris Carrascosa points out that this proposal is “unenforceable.” “If this is approved, it’s going to cause absolute chaos in the entire crypto tax regime in Spain,” she stressed.

En este caso las traigo aquí por dos motivos: … — Cris Carrascosa (@CarrascosaCris_) November 25, 2025 Spanish Lawmakers Demand Crypto Traffic Light Risk Warnings As reported by Cryptonews in July , a Spanish coalition of MPs demanded that the country’s financial top regulator mandate crypto to carry “traffic light” risk warnings. This system would help users to “clearly and visually” decide on the type of asset they are buying. The Sumar Parliamentary Group wanted to rename cryptos, including Bitcoin and Ethereum . Economist José Antonio called it “useless attacks against Bitcoin,” stressing that these are “resistant to political attacks.” “The only thing these measures achieve is that their holders residing in Spain think about fleeing when BTC rises so much that they no longer care what the politicians say,” he wrote on X. Crypto Tax Uncertainties in Spain In August, Spanish authorities taxed a crypto trader with €9 million for a transaction that generated no profit. According to the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT), a non-profit transaction is considered a capital gains event. The incident exposed crypto law and taxation flaws in the country. Legal experts and EU watchdogs warned that investors are left without fair protection in Spain. “Spanish tax legislation still lacks clear guidelines on how cryptocurrency holdings or tokenized assets should be taxed,” leading Spanish tax firm Lullius Partners noted at the time . “It remains difficult to determine when and under what conditions cryptocurrency transactions are considered taxable.” The post Spanish Parliamentary Group Proposes New Crypto Tax Bill Increasing Taxes on BTC, ETH appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|crypto tax|Spain,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-26 05:41:08

The partners plan to run LedgerX as an independent exchange through a new joint venture, with Robinhood as the controlling partner. Miami International Holdings will keep a strategic 10% stake. Financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed. LedgerX once sat inside the empire of collapsed crypto exchange FTX. Miami International acquired it out of FTX’s bankruptcy estate in 2023 for $50m and housed it under its umbrella. The new venture will now acquire MIAXdx, the LedgerX entity that carries approvals as a Designated Contract Market, Derivatives Clearing Organization and Swap Execution Facility, giving Robinhood and Susquehanna a ready-made regulatory platform. Robinhood is introducing a new futures and derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, deepening our investment in Prediction Markets and better positioning us to deliver innovative products to our customers. More in our newsroom: https://t.co/Hqv6EMXZiD pic.twitter.com/JXDkp3c2Tr — Robinhood (@RobinhoodApp) November 25, 2025 New Venue Targets Growing Appetite For Prediction Markets Robinhood said the deal will pave the way for a futures and derivatives exchange and clearinghouse built with prediction markets in mind. The exchange will serve Robinhood Derivatives and other futures commission merchants, and is expected to begin operations in 2026, opening a new institutional-grade venue for traders who want to bet on real-world events through crypto-style contracts. “Robinhood is seeing strong customer demand for prediction markets, and we’re excited to build on that momentum,” said JB Mackenzie, vice president and general manager of futures and international at Robinhood. “Our investment in infrastructure will position us to deliver an even better experience and more innovative products for customers.” Internally, prediction markets have already become one of Robinhood’s key growth engines. The company says that in the first year since launch, customers traded about 9b contracts across more than 1m accounts, turning event contracts into its fastest-growing product line by revenue and giving it confidence to invest in a dedicated exchange and clearing stack. Susquehanna Joins As Liquidity Anchor For New Prediction Venue Susquehanna, one of the largest proprietary trading and market-making firms in global derivatives, will join as a day-one liquidity provider. The joint venture plans to add more market makers over time, aiming to keep spreads tight and execution quality competitive for both Robinhood’s retail users and institutional clients that access the venue through other intermediaries. The deal lands as prediction markets move from niche crypto corners into mainstream finance in the US. Interest surged after a federal court threw out a Commodity Futures Trading Commission prohibition on election-betting last year, opening the door for regulated platforms to list contracts tied to politics and other real-world outcomes. Traditional market infrastructure is following the money. Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, agreed in October to invest up to $2b in Polymarket . Kalshi, another heavyweight in the sector, recently drew a valuation of about $11b in a fundraising round, according to a TechCrunch report, signalling strong investor appetite for event-driven trading venues. Tech Giants Bring Visibility To Crowd-Priced Event Markets Large derivatives exchanges are also circling the space. CME Group and Cboe have both outlined plans to enter prediction markets, betting that event contracts can sit alongside more established products such as equity index futures and listed options. Crypto-native institutions are positioning themselves as liquidity backbones for this new market structure. Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is in talks with Polymarket and Kalshi about acting as a market-maker, posting bids and offers that can deepen order books and make it easier for large traders to move in and out of positions tied to everything from elections to macroeconomic releases. Big technology platforms are adding another layer of visibility. Google Finance recently said it will begin showing live data from Polymarket and Kalshi , so users who ask about future events will be able to see how crowd odds are evolving in real time, alongside more traditional market data. For Robinhood and Susquehanna, the LedgerX deal offers a shortcut into this growing ecosystem, combining a crypto-savvy retail base, institutional market making and a fully licensed derivatives venue.

Priced at only $0.035 per token, very fast growth is already visible for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , and estimates see this newcomer for DeFi potentially growing by as much as 3,300% as its development and acceptance continue to gain traction at its present clip. It appears that with its DeFi-based borrowing platform, reward-oriented token, and presale that has already entered deeply into phase 6 and has seen overwhelming demand for its tokens, Mutuum Finance is poised to soon become the next big crypto within cryptocurrency as attention centers on projects bearing growth-oriented utility. Solana Falls into Danger Zone as Sellers Regain Control Solana’s SOL is seeing ever-stronger downward pressure as a consequence of bulls’ failure to hold above support at $126, paving the way for a likely decline to levels around $110-$95. The buying efforts are repeatedly thwarted by selling pressures, causing prices to predominantly exhibit bearish momentum. It is expected that Solana will need to breakthrough support at its 20-day EMA established at $150 to recover its bullish momentum, failing which it will continue to operate within a danger zone. As Solana struggles to find its footing again, traders are increasingly looking for alternative coins that can potentially match its prices, with attention shifting to Mutuum Finance’s DeFi crypto, MUTM. MUTM: Ready for a Solana-Like Breakout Currently at $0.035 per token, MUTM offers a growth opportunity comparable to that seen in Solana in 2021, rallying from $1.50 to $256, resulting in an astonishing return on investment of 17,100%. If MUTM token mimics this growth pattern, its new price could reach $6.00. To give you a perspective, with just $1,000 investment, you can acquire almost 28,571 tokens of MUTM, which can appreciate to $171,428, resulting in a profit of over $170,000. This kind of growth can only be expected in projects that provide dual lending services and are inclusive of DeFi crypto solutions, and that is exactly why MUTM offers tremendous growth potential as it has emerged as the next big crypto to watch in terms of growth and DeFi usage. Sepolia Testnet: Sneak Peek into Mutuum’s Lending One of the most important milestones for Mutuum Finance is the launch of V1 Protocol on Sepolia testnet, which is expected to happen in Q4 2025. This marks the inaugural deployment on a larger scale of its borrowing and lending mechanism for locking ETH or USD as collateral for borrowing. The testnet network also enables the development team to work on improving risk management services, perfecting dynamic interest rate functions, and simplifying procedures for borrowing on MUTM to ensure its safe and efficient deployment on its mainnet network. This stage paves the way for a successful launch on mainnet as the DeFi crypto token with practical usage and bright prospects for growth. The contracts for borrowing and lending on Mutuum Finance are also undergoing an extensive audit by Halborn Security . This audit assessment evaluates finalized codes to ensure correct functionality, secure user assets, and validate overall system integrity. Updates on its progress will also be provided, and finally, when Sepolia Testnet is ready, they will announce its schedule. This will also enhance its credibility and cement its status as the next big crypto within DeFi as a secure and useful cryptocurrency. MUTM Poised to Surge Past Solana with Explosive Initial Growth Mutuum Finance is on its way to becoming one of the most promising DeFi crypto tokens in 2025. Currently priced at $0.035 and well into presale phase 6, MUTM has piqued investors’ attention everywhere and has every potential to skyrocket by a whopping 3,300% or more based on its ability to grow its ecosystem. The launch of its Sepolia testnet, coupled with its comprehensive independent security audit and DeFi platform centered around dual lending, proves that MUTM has actual usage and long-term viability in store for investors. It is only now that niche investors gain the opportunity to get on board on tokens prior to phase 7, where prices are expected to soar as the next big crypto.

54912312,634364,1764136807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54912312.jpeg,Could Jack Dorsey Be The Face Behind Bitcoin? Analysts Uncover New Evidence,https://bitcoinist.com/could-jack-dorsey-be-behind-bitcoin-evidence/,"Amid ongoing speculation regarding the true identity of Bitcoin’s (BTC) creator, new analysis suggests that Jack Dorsey, the entrepreneur known for founding Twitter and currently serving as the CEO of Block, could potentially be Satoshi Nakamoto. Surprising Links Between Jack Dorsey And Bitcoin’s Satoshi During Square’s investor day last week, Dorsey was directly questioned about his possible connection to Satoshi. Jeff Cantwell, an analyst at Seaport Research, posed the pointed inquiry: “Jack, this probably is the most important question you’ll ever get asked from the sell side — are you Satoshi Nakamoto?” In response, Dorsey remarked that the identity of Satoshi has become irrelevant, emphasizing that Bitcoin is now an open protocol managed by a community. He added, “If it was important to Satoshi, there is a simple way they can prove who they are, so we’ll wait for that day.” This response prompted analysts from Baird to investigate potential coincidences linking Dorsey to Satoshi. They discovered several notable parallels. For instance, the first post on the BitcoinTalk forum by Satoshi was made on November 19, which also happens to be Dorsey’s birthday and coincided with the date of Block’s investor day. Block’s CFO, Amrita Ahuja, noted, “He may or may not be Satoshi, but it is his birthday today.” Furthermore, the Baird team identified important early Bitcoin milestones that align with the birthdays of Dorsey’s parents. They pointed out that Dorsey was involved in the “cypherpunk” mailing list as early as 1996 and possesses programming skills in C and Python, languages featured in the initial Bitcoin codebase. Additionally, an early Bitcoin address reportedly includes a sequence, “jD2m,” which some interpret as “Jack Dorsey 2 Mint,” referencing Mint Plaza, where he lived. Mining Patterns And IP Address The analysts also observed a notable change in Satoshi’s mining patterns that allegedly coincided with Dorsey founding Block in February 2009. They highlighted that he visited Iraq with the State Department in April of that same year. Reports indicate that in early 2009, Satoshi inadvertently logged into an Internet Relay Chat using an IP address linked to California during a period when Dorsey resided in the Bay Area. An essential aspect of this speculation centers around Satoshi’s wallet containing approximately 1 million Bitcoin, which have remained untouched since their mining. This fact aligns with Dorsey’s previous assertion that the mystery surrounding Satoshi’s identity could be resolved quite simply. Forbes estimates Dorsey’s wealth at around $4.7 billion, suggesting he has no need to access those long-dormant holdings, currently worth about $87 billion. NewsBTC reported on Monday that Satoshi’s assets are now estimated to be valued at nearly $96 billion, positioning this mysterious figure just below US billionaire Bill Gates, who is estimated to have a net worth of about $104 billion. The quest to unveil Satoshi’s identity has led to a variety of candidates, including the late software engineer Hal Finney, systems engineer Dorian Nakamoto, computer scientist Nick Szabo, and Hashcash inventor Adam Back. In 2016, Australian cryptographer Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi but failed to provide compelling evidence, leaving many skeptical of his assertions. A British High Court ruling last year further undermined Wright’s claims. BTC is currently trading at $86,540, down more than 31% from its all-time high reached back in October and more than 8% year-to-date (YTD).

This announcement comes after persistent community feedback requesting the change, creating significant buzz throughout the cryptocurrency space. Why is the POL token ticker reconsideration happening now? Sandeep Nailwal recently revealed that he’s reviewing community sentiment regarding the POL token ticker. While he initially supported maintaining the current POL designation, continuous user requests have prompted this reevaluation. The migration from MATIC to POL occurred some time ago, yet community members continue to express strong preferences for the original ticker. Nailwal’s current position favors keeping the POL token ticker, but he acknowledges the ongoing feedback deserves serious consideration. This demonstrates Polygon’s commitment to community-driven decision making in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. What factors influence the POL token ticker decision? Several key considerations will shape the final decision about the POL token ticker: Brand recognition – MATIC has established significant market presence Community preference – User sentiment strongly favors the original name Technical implications – Potential impacts on exchanges and wallets Market confusion – Avoiding disruption for current holders The discussion around the POL token ticker highlights how blockchain projects must balance technical progress with community expectations. This situation shows that even established changes can be revisited when user feedback remains consistent. How might the POL token ticker reversal affect investors? Investors and token holders should understand several potential outcomes if the POL token ticker reverts to MATIC. First, market recognition could improve immediately since MATIC remains familiar to many traders. However, temporary confusion might occur during the transition period. Exchange listings and trading pairs would need updates, though the underlying token functionality remains unchanged. The POL token ticker discussion ultimately reflects Polygon’s responsive approach to community input, which many consider positive for long-term project health. What’s next for the POL token ticker debate? Nailwal has suggested opening formal discussions about the POL token ticker, indicating this isn’t merely theoretical consideration. The Polygon team appears genuinely curious about gathering comprehensive user opinions before making any final determination. This transparent approach sets a valuable precedent for other blockchain projects facing similar decisions. The POL token ticker situation demonstrates that successful projects listen to their communities while maintaining strategic direction. Conclusion: Community Voice Shapes Blockchain Evolution The potential reversal of the POL token ticker to MATIC represents more than just a name change. It signifies how community feedback can influence even established decisions in the decentralized space. Polygon’s willingness to reconsider demonstrates authentic commitment to user-driven development. Whether the POL token ticker ultimately changes or remains, this episode reinforces that successful blockchain projects maintain open communication channels with their communities. The final decision will likely balance technical considerations with the clear user preference for the MATIC designation. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Polygon change from MATIC to POL originally? The transition from MATIC to POL was part of Polygon’s broader ecosystem upgrade and rebranding strategy to reflect the project’s expanded vision beyond just the Matic Network. Will my tokens be affected if the ticker changes back? Your actual tokens and their value won’t change – only the displayed ticker symbol would revert from POL to MATIC on exchanges and tracking platforms. How can community members share their opinions? Polygon typically gathers feedback through official social media channels, governance forums, and community discussion platforms where users can voice their preferences. When will the final decision be made? No specific timeline has been announced, but the co-founder’s comments suggest the discussion will proceed with deliberate consideration of all community input. Has any other major cryptocurrency reversed a ticker change? While uncommon, some projects have adjusted tickers based on community feedback, though most stick with their initial post-migration decisions. What happens to existing POL trading pairs? If the change occurs, exchanges would gradually update their trading pairs from POL to MATIC, ensuring minimal disruption to trading activities. Found this analysis helpful?

Key On-Chain Data Signals Potential Rebound Ahead,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/has-the-bitcoin-price-hit-its-bottom-key-on-chain-data-signals-potential-rebound-ahead/,"Following a significant downturn that saw Bitcoin (BTC) plunge to the $80,000 mark on November 21, the leading cryptocurrency has managed to stabilize above this critical threshold for several days. This development has sparked speculation about whether this level represents a short-term bottom and if a new upward trend might follow. Potential Local Bottom For Bitcoin According to analysis from CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Aleman, on-chain data indicates a market landscape characterized by institutional redistribution, structural weakness, and signs of a rebound that may hint at a local bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Less Than 50% Chance Of Hitting $100,000 By December 31, Says AI Model One of the observations made is that large whale investors have been actively distributing their holdings. The cohorts holding more than 10,000 BTC and those with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC appear to be primarily in a selling position. Carmelo stated that this kind of behavior reflects ongoing profit-taking by institutions looking to reduce their risk exposure, which leads to an overall offloading of supply into the market. Retail investors have also been contributing to the distribution trend. Over the past 60 days, wallets holding between 0 to 1 BTC and 1 to 10 BTC have demonstrated net selling rather than accumulation, suggesting a lack of purchasing support from the retail sector. In contrast, mid-sized BTC holders—those in the 100 to 1,000 BTC range—appear to be acquiring steadily, while the 10 to 100 BTC group is showing consistent accumulation. Hidden Bullish Divergence After this 11-day selling spree, signs of stabilization have emerged. Bitcoin has rebounded above $89,000 on late Monday, which may suggest the formation of a local bottom, although this has yet to be conclusively confirmed. However, while momentum is positive, Aleman warned that the possibility of a trend reversal is heavily reliant on ongoing accumulation from crucial investor cohorts, notably mid-sized investors. While there are obvious rebounds and support from particular groups, the continued distribution of the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC cohort prevents definitive confirmation of a trend reversal. Related Reading: Latest Crypto Crash Wipes $1 Billion Off Trump Family’s Wealth Other analysts, including Ash Crypto, have noted bullish indicators that further support this outlook. He highlighted that Bitcoin is experiencing a hidden bullish divergence on the weekly timeframe, suggesting that selling pressure is easing, momentum is stabilizing, and the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) may soon reverse. If this hidden bullish divergence is confirmed, it typically precedes a strong continuation rally, according to the analyst, adding to the argument that BTC may be on the verge of a new upward trajectory. Bitcoin is currently trading at $87,150, 30% below its all-time high of $126,000. This momentum has caused the top cryptocurrency to erase all gains recorded in all time frames, including year-to-date, with a drop of roughly 9% during this period.

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-about-to-go-parabolic-heres-the-signal/,"Amonyx (@amonbuy), a well-known cryptocurrency expert, recently posted a strong message about XRP that immediately caught the attention of many. He wrote “XRP is about to go PARABOLIC!” and shared a detailed monthly chart of the asset. The post did not rely only on hype; it focused on a technical structure that developed over many years. A Breakout Follows Years of Tight Trading The chart displays a long, symmetrical triangle that began after the 2018 peak. XRP moved inside that structure for years. Buyers held steady. Sellers failed to push the price below support levels. The market formed higher lows. The range tightened as time passed. However, XRP’s breakout in late 2024 pushed it above this multi-year triangle . The current monthly candle sits above the upper trend line. That position matters because it confirms strength. While XRP has experienced a breakout, a closer look at the chart suggests that its rise is not over yet. #XRP is about to go PARABOLIC ! It's About To Get WILD. pic.twitter.com/G4PfJdy9hi — Amonyx (@amonbuy) November 24, 2025 Historical Patterns Shape Market Expectations Amonyx included an earlier pattern from the last cycle. XRP also formed a symmetrical triangle. XRP broke out of that pattern in 2017 and climbed sharply. The new triangle looks larger but similar in structure. Many analysts study repeating formations. They believe similar conditions can produce similar outcomes. If XRP repeats this historical performance , the chart points toward a price target above $10. Amonyx did not assign a date to that target. The monthly timeframe suggests a long buildup. The comparison between the two triangles now drives interest, as traders know the market often reacts in stages. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The lower section of the chart shows the monthly RSI. It sits above the midpoint. It is climbing at a steady pace. The indicator held similar positions during earlier rallies. That trend supports the bullish case. The moving averages are also bullish, and that alignment reflects strength in buyer activity. Market Focus Turns Toward Upcoming Closes Market participants want to see consistent engagement and more monthly confirmations. Traders want XRP to hold above the breakout zone. Despite its recent struggles , it still holds key support levels. Major investors are now tracking monthly candles for clear signals. A strong close could build confidence. A weak close could delay progress. All eyes are now on XRP, and the next few months will show which side gains control.

The data showed that bad actors began publicly selling tokens during the chain’s first period of liquidity and onboarding. The illegal activity on the Monad network also began within a day of the MON token’s airdrop on Tuesday. The CTO and co-founder James Hunsaker first spotted and reported the spoofing to its users. Monad’s CTO claims the fake ERC-20 transfers were not from his wallet warning – there are fake ERC-20 transfers pretending to be from my wallet https://t.co/TCZTfDfoTQ example: https://t.co/wA1I8RFTdQ you can see the txs are not sent by me ERC-20 is just a token interface standard, it's easy to write a smart contract that meets that standard… — James (mainnet arc) (@_jhunsaker) November 25, 2025 Hunsaker noted early Wednesday that the movement of funds appeared as normal MON transfers on blockchain explorers. He also discovered that there were transactions from the wallets being impersonated at the time. Hunsaker warned earlier today that fake ERC-20 transfers were pretending to be from his wallet, citing a Monad user who alerted him of the transactions. The firm’s official confirmed that it was not a bug, but rather a spoofing attempt within their smart contract to try to trick people. “ERC-20 is just a token interface standard; it’s easy to write a smart contract that meets that standard, but can have address entries which are not authorized by the owner.” – James Hunsaker , Co-Founder and CTO of Monad. According to Hunsaker, Monad’s blockchain allows bad contracts to imitate legitimate transactions even when no wallet approval occurred. He cautioned Monad users to be cautious of malicious activity on Monad’s blockchain. Hunsaker also revealed one wallet that had made a flurry of transactions on the network, and confirmed that he did not send the transactions. He noted that the spoofing attempts mirrored similar patterns seen in EVM-based chains. Monad’s co-founder admitted that attackers usually deploy contracts and send out events that impersonate real token transactions, even when there were no token transfers and no wallet approvals. Such a set of transfers is displayed as regular activity, which often tends to mislead users who are checking wallet history. On-chain data revealed illegitimate fake swap calls and other maliciously generated artificial signatures, which were used to simulate actual token transfers on the MON blockchain. The launch of the Monad network and the debut of its MON token in the past two days initiated the spoofing attempt as users opened wallets and transferred tokens for the first time. Monad completes the airdrop of MON tokens The network completed its airdrop of MON tokens on Monday, issuing millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency to its recipients alongside the debut of its blockchain. On-chain data revealed that around 76,000 wallets claimed MON tokens over the past month. And received their tokens when the network and its token went live two days ago. Monad revealed that 3.33 billion MON tokens had already been claimed by the network’s users, builders, and community members. On-chain data revealed that the network collectively valued MON around $105.2 million, while the airdrop size represented around 3% of MON’s total supply and 30% of the token’s circulating supply. Monad revealed last week that approximately 85,800 people participated in the offering, which saw $269 million in commitments. The firm offered the tokens at $0.025 per token and sold for a total of $187 million on Monday. CryptoRank data showed that Monad has raised $431 million in total funding, including $244 from several funding rounds, and $187 million through public sales. Trevor Thompson, co-founder and CEO of social platform Ethos Network, argued that Monad’s airdrop may have been disappointing for speculators, but it was food for the project. He also noted that the firm’s ICE was perfect in terms of price discovery, claiming that Monad maximized the amount it raised while giving the public tokens at a fair price. At the time of publication, MON is trading at $0.04810, up nearly 50% in the last 24 hours. The token has also surged more than 66% since its debut on Monday.

According to Wintermute’s latest analysis, this volatility actually signals a healthy crypto market deleveraging process that could set the stage for a significant rebound. Let’s explore what this means for investors and why market structure improvements matter. What Exactly is Crypto Market Deleveraging? Crypto market deleveraging occurs when traders reduce their borrowed positions, leading to lower overall market leverage. Wintermute’s report reveals fascinating data: Bitcoin funding rates turned negative for the first time since October, while futures open interest plummeted from $230 billion to $135 billion. This substantial crypto market deleveraging indicates traders are taking a more cautious approach. Why Does Market Health Matter Now? The current crypto market deleveraging creates several positive developments: Reduced speculative pressure on prices More sustainable market conditions Shift from futures-driven to spot-driven trading Decreased risk of cascading liquidations These factors collectively create a healthier foundation for future growth. The market cooling period allows for more organic price discovery rather than leverage-fueled volatility. How Can Investors Benefit from This Situation? The ongoing crypto market deleveraging presents unique opportunities. With reduced leverage, market movements become more reflective of actual supply and demand dynamics. Wintermute emphasizes that the current structure supports potential rebounds, provided macroeconomic conditions stabilize. This means investors can focus on fundamental analysis rather than worrying about excessive leverage distorting prices. What Signals Should You Watch For? Monitor these key indicators during crypto market deleveraging periods: Bitcoin funding rates normalization Stable or increasing spot volumes Reduced futures open interest volatility Macroeconomic policy developments These metrics will help you gauge when the deleveraging process completes and genuine recovery begins. Is This the Calm Before the Storm or Recovery? The current crypto market deleveraging represents a necessary market correction rather than permanent damage. Wintermute’s analysis suggests this cleansing process removes excess speculation and creates space for organic growth. However, successful rebounds depend on stable macroeconomic environments and continued institutional confidence in digital assets. Conclusion: A Healthier Foundation Emerges The comprehensive crypto market deleveraging we’re witnessing establishes a stronger base for future appreciation. By reducing systemic risk and shifting toward spot-driven markets, the cryptocurrency ecosystem becomes more resilient. While short-term volatility may continue, the underlying market structure improvements position digital assets for more sustainable long-term growth. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto market deleveraging? Crypto market deleveraging typically occurs when traders reduce borrowed positions due to market uncertainty, regulatory changes, or significant price corrections that trigger margin calls. How long does deleveraging usually last? Deleveraging periods vary but typically last several weeks to months, depending on market conditions and the extent of leverage that needs to be unwound. Is deleveraging good for cryptocurrency markets? Yes, deleveraging creates healthier market conditions by reducing systemic risk and making price movements more reflective of actual supply and demand. What’s the difference between deleveraging and a market crash? Deleveraging involves reducing borrowed positions gradually, while a crash involves rapid, panic-driven selling. Deleveraging can prevent crashes by systematically reducing risk. Should I buy during market deleveraging? Many investors see deleveraging periods as buying opportunities, but careful research and risk management remain essential during volatile market phases. How does deleveraging affect Bitcoin prices? Deleveraging often creates short-term price pressure but establishes healthier foundations for long-term price appreciation through reduced speculative activity. Found this analysis helpful?

54912793,https://cryptonews.com/?p=456436,1764137568,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54912793.jpeg,"Texas Buys $5M in Bitcoin ETF Shares, Plans Another $5M in Self-Custodied BTC",https://cryptonews.com/news/texas-buys-5m-in-bitcoin-etf-shares-plans-another-5m-in-self-custodied-btc/,"Texas has taken a significant step toward building a state-backed Bitcoin position, purchasing $5 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF and preparing a second $5 million buy that will be held in the state’s own custody. Key Takeaways: Texas purchased $5M of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF and plans another $5M in directly self-custodied BTC. The state has a $10M allocation for Bitcoin, with self-custody set to replace ETF exposure once systems are ready. The move highlights shifting government sentiment toward Bitcoin, as other states like Wisconsin have also bought IBIT. The Nov. 20 transaction was disclosed this week by Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, who said the initial exposure was routed through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) while the state finalizes its long-term custody framework. Texas Prepares $5M Direct Bitcoin Buy After Initial ETF Allocation Bratcher noted that Texas has earmarked $10 million in total, though only half of the allocation has been deployed so far. The remaining funds are expected to go directly into BTC once the state’s custody systems are ready. “Texas will self-custody Bitcoin,” he wrote, emphasizing that the ETF purchase is only a temporary starting point. The move drew swift reactions from industry figures. Pierre Rochard, CEO of The Bitcoin Bond Company, said Texas’ action shows how quickly sentiment among governments has shifted. “In five years we went from ‘governments will ban bitcoin’ to ‘governments are only buying a small amount of bitcoin.’ Hyperbitcoinization has happened, is happening, and will continue to happen,” he said. Whether this purchase is connected to Texas’ planned strategic Bitcoin reserve remains unclear. CORRECTION: Texas purchased $5M on Nov. 20th. $10M is allocated from general revenue but not all $10M has been allocated. @BitcoinMagazine — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 In June, Governor Gregg Abbott approved legislation allowing the state to hold BTC as part of its long-term financial assets. The framework limits the reserve to assets with a market cap above $500 billion, a threshold that Bitcoin easily exceeds. BlackRock’s ETF, however, does not qualify under the rule, indicating that the ETF purchase is an interim measure rather than part of the official reserve. Texas is not the first state to gain exposure through IBIT. Wisconsin’s investment board acquired nearly $100 million in IBIT shares in May 2024, filings show. Harvard Reveals $443M Bitcoin ETF Bet Harvard’s endowment fund recently disclosed a $443 million IBIT allocation, accounting for roughly 20% of its reported U.S. equity exposure. The move represents one of the most significant institutional endorsements of Bitcoin exposure among elite university endowments, ranking Harvard as the 16th-largest holder of the BlackRock-managed fund . The latest 13F filing shows Harvard increased its stake from 1.9 million shares reported in June, while simultaneously growing its gold ETF holdings by 99% to 661,391 shares worth $235 million. As reported, Al Warda Investments, an investment arm under the Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC), has also increased its exposure to Bitcoin in the third quarter, more than tripling its position in BlackRock’s IBIT. The firm disclosed a 230% jump in holdings to just under 8 million shares, valued at $517.6 million. ADIC, part of Mubadala Investment Co., one of Abu Dhabi’s leading sovereign-wealth groups, rarely makes public bets in listed digital assets, typically leaning toward private market strategies such as buyouts, infrastructure, and real estate.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Nears $19 Million Ahead of V1 Testnet Launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-mutuum-finance-mutm-nears-19-million-ahead-of-v1-testnet-launch/,"The increasing hype within the DeFi space has placed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) firmly on investors’ radars as one of the top cryptos to buy right now, particularly as it hastens towards an important development phase. With its presale crossing the $19 million mark in no time and Phase 6 almost out, investor interest is pouring in far faster than analysts expected. Tapping at $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves for its cutting-edge DeFi approach to crypto, tackling decentralized lending, borrowing, and interest tokens uniquely crafted to reward its earliest supporters. The hype over its imminent V1 testnet launch on Sepolia is only pouring more fuel on this fire, solidifying its position within the DeFi space as a leading DeFi crypto and the best crypto to buy now for early-stage investors. MUTM Presale Phase 6: Final Window for Strategic Investors Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as one of the most heavily anticipated token sales that this year has to offer. Stage 6 of presale, priced at $0.035 per token, is the last stage prior to its price increase to $0.04 in Stage 7. To ensure simplicity in entry, MUTM has introduced support for Credit and Debit Card payments, making entry into this investment opportunity seamless for both new and veteran investors in cryptocurrencies. As its fundamentals continue to look good and its adoption increases, MUTM is poised to emerge as the top DeFi crypto and the best crypto to buy now for investors seeking exposure before the next phase. Sepolia Testnet: Full DeFi Features Testing One of the most important milestones in the near future is to launch the full lending and borrowing protocol for Mutuum Finance on Sepolia testnet, which is expected to happen in Q4 2025. It will initially support ETH, USDT, mtTokens, debt tokens, and automatic liquidation, but other assets will also be added later. This testnet launch also proves that Mutuum Finance is more than just a presale token, but it is also growing to be a full-fledged DeFi platform. It has usage, utility, and scalable tokenomics that classifies MUTM as one of the top cryptocurrencies and a DeFi crypto ready to deliver long-term results. Independent Security Audit: Trust and Reliability The lending and borrowing contracts offered by Mutuum Finance are also undergoing an independent audit by Halborn Security . The final codes are also under evaluation to ensure that every contract functions correctly and safely handles the user’s assets. It will ensure platform integrity and investor safety, and will provide platform updates once completed. After that, announcements for testnet launch schedules will also be made, which is one of the most important steps towards full-scale operability for the MUTM platform. Tokenomics in MUTM include a Buy-and-Distribute mechanism whereby transaction fees on the platform are utilized for buying back MUTM tokens to reward mtToken staking participants. This design directly links increases in value to usage instead of trading volumes. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance has implemented a leaderboard contest for every day, where they reward top contributors with $500 worth of MUTM tokens every day (starting at 00:00 UTC). This not only increases their engagement but also develops their community, hence cementing MUTM as a new breed of DeFi crypto poised for growth. MUTM Emerges as DeFi Crypto to Buy Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly proving to be the best crypto to buy now. It has already raised almost $19 million in its presale, with Phase 6 near sold-out at $0.035 per token. The V1 testnet launch on Sepolia will then provide full DeFi functionality, including full support for lending, borrowing, interest-bearing tokens, and automated liquidation. Furthermore, independent security assurance from Halborn Security removes any doubts about its reliability and authenticity. Last but not least, its novel tokenomics and reward structure are additional factors driving adoption. Therefore, investors looking to gain early access to this new “high-utility” and high-upside DeFi crypto need to act fast to acquire MUTM tokens before prices go up to $0.04 in Phase 7, making it the best crypto to buy now.
