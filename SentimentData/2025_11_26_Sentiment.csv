The transaction serves as a move in state-level financial policy and sets a precedent for how U.S. public institutions may treat digital assets in the years ahead. State officials confirmed that the acquisition, valued at $10 million and completed at an approximate basis of $87,000 per Bitcoin, is the opening step in a reserve plan that has been under development for more than a year. Texas first allocation completed through BlackRock’s IBIT ETF According to Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council, the initial purchase was executed through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). At the same time, the state finalizes the process for direct self-custody. Information shared by Bratcher indicates that $5 million of the allocation was applied at the time of purchase, and the remaining balance aligns with the structure of the state’s broader reserve commitment. TEXAS BOUGHT THE DIP! Texas becomes the FIRST state to purchase Bitcoin with a $10M investment on Nov. 20th at an approximately $87k basis! Congratulations to Comptroller @KHancock4TX and the dedicated investments team at Texas Treasury who have been watching this market… pic.twitter.com/wsMqI9HrPD — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 Bratcher stated that Texas intends to self-custody its Bitcoin once the request-for-proposal process concludes. Until then, ETF exposure acts as the mechanism needed to initiate the reserve without delaying the legislative timeline. How Texas built its strategic Bitcoin Reserve The acquisition is preceded by legislative actions that occurred earlier this year. In June, the Texas governor signed a bill that established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , following lawmakers’ analysis of a proposal version during the last legislative session. The legislation was based on a bill submitted by State Representative Giovanni Capriglione of Texas, who suggested considering Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. The proposal outlined cold-storage requirements, minimum holding periods of years, and access to voluntary contributions made by Texas residents. It also allowed state agencies to receive cryptocurrency payments and convert them into Bitcoin for deposit in the reserve. This move by Texas occurs amid a period during which several institutional investors have grown their investments in regulated Bitcoin vehicles. The Harvard University Foundation recently increased its stake in IBIT to the highest point of investment, at $442.8 million, marking the largest single reported investment the foundation has ever made. Al Warda Investments of Abu Dhabi and Emory University have also increased their investment in Bitcoin ETFs over the past several months. Other governments explore Bitcoin-linked instruments The U.S. jurisdiction is not the only one looking into digital-asset approaches. New Hampshire recently became the first government to issue a Bitcoin-backed municipal bond in the world, which was issued earlier this month. The Business Finance Authority of the state sanctioned a 100 million conduit system, which enables private companies to borrow funds using the over-collateralized form of Bitcoin deposited in trust. In the arrangement, borrowers are required to pledge Bitcoin to the value of approximately 160% of the loan amount. The liquidation is automated to safeguard bondholders if the collateral’s value decreases. Fees, as well as any appreciation in the posted Bitcoin, are used to fund the Bitcoin Economic Development Fund in the state of New Hampshire. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Here’s Why BNB Could Plunge Even Lower",https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-price-prediction-missed-the-1000-exit-heres-why-bnb-could-plunge-even-lower/,"After hitting an all-time high of $1,370, BNB has reversed sharply during the latest market downturn and now the BNB price prediction is in focus. Is this just a healthy pullback, or the start of a deeper trend? On-chain data may hold the answer. According to BSC Scan, daily transactions on the BNB Chain have dropped significantly since peaking at 31.3 million on October 8. With network activity cooling fast, traders are watching closely to see whether BNB can hold its ground or if further downside is ahead. As of yesterday, the blockchain’s daily TXs had dropped by 50%. The reason? Traders were flushed out of the market by a cascade of forced liquidations. Network activity had been steadily growing amid the rising popularity of protocols like Aster, a perpetual futures trading platform that is now contending with Hyperliquid for the lead in this important segment of the market. In addition, Pancake Swap, the largest BNB-native decentralized exchange (DEX) for spot trades, has seen its trading volumes explode this year. As long as transaction volumes remain this low, BNB could struggle to make it back to $1,000 . In fact, the token could actually dip lower if it fails to recapture some key price zones. BNB Price Prediction: 20% Downside Risk as BNB Struggles to Clear $900 The latest price action has formed a falling wedge that could result in a bullish breakout down the road for BNB. However, momentum remains heavily depressed as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has collapsed near the 30 level. The token’s 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) could act as a strong resistance now, currently sitting at $883. Even if the price breaks above this wedge, the long-term trend remains bearish. Meanwhile, failing to recapture the $900 area could result in a move toward $750 first and then to $680, meaning a 20% downside risk. Paired with this on-chain sell signal (lower network activity), recapturing the $1,000 level seems difficult at a point when market sentiment is still heavily depressed. In contrast, top crypto presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) have been resilient to the latest downturn. This mine-to-earn (M2E) continues to attract investors as it makes crypto mining possible without hardware. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Gamifies Mining and Makes It Hardware-Free Mining cryptocurrencies is usually considered an expensive way to earn cryptocurrencies, but Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is here to change that. This mine-to-earn game reimagines crypto mining by letting players build unlimited virtual rigs and grow their digital mining empire with zero hardware or technical hassle. The more rigs launched and upgraded, the more mining power earned, and the higher players climb on the leaderboard. Top performers unlock airdrops of major meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Pepe ($PEPE) , adding real value to every upgrade. Even better, up to 70% of the $PEPENODE tokens used to upgrade rigs are permanently burned, creating powerful deflation and long-term scarcity. As the game’s popularity grows, $PEPENODE is shaping up to be one of the most promising opportunities in the next wave of crypto gaming. To buy $PEPENODE during its presale stage, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card instead. Visit the Official Pepenode Website Here The post BNB Price Prediction: Missed the $1,000 Exit?

These two launches mark a hugely significant milestone for XRP, initiating a phase in which institutional money could pile into the coin’s market, much as we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP had been suffering in recent weeks, along with the wider market, with negative sentiment dragging the coin down by 10% in a fortnight and by 17% in a month. However, the token remains up by 50% in a year, and with more XRP ETFs likely to follow in the coming weeks , the XRP price prediction looks incredibly positive right now. XRP Price Prediction: Trillion-Dollar Wall Street Fund Manager Goes All In – Could XRP Be the Next Institutional Favorite? In fact, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has predicted a surge of XRP ETF launches , providing this forecast last week, when Bitwise launched its own ETF for the coin. The pre-thanksgiving rush (shall we say, 'turkey trot'!?) for XRP ETFs starts now.. congrats @BitwiseInvest on today's launch! https://t.co/EgYVrm0TmM — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) November 20, 2025 Bitwise’s launch prepared the ground for yesterday’s listings, with Franklin Templeton and Grayscale joining what may be a race for institutional money. That three different asset managers have launched XRP ETFs so close together may indicate that they expect strong demand from institutions, and that their competing to capitalize on such demand. Either way, the launch of three ETFs is incredibly positive news for XRP, which is now showing some very strong momentum. Its chart today shows that it’s beginning to bounce after hitting a bottom several days ago. For instance, its relative strength index (yellow) has risen to 50 today, after touching an oversold 30 last week, Source: TradingView Likewise, it seems that its MACD (orange, blue) has also bottomed out, ready for a recovery as the XRP price rises. Of course, the overarching investment climate still remains fairly unsteady, given the fears surrounding the possible overvaluation of AI-related stocks. That said, Nvidia posted better-than-expected earnings last week (and a better-than-expected forecast), something which has helped to stabilize investor mood. And with asset managers now seemingly rushing to launch XRP ETFs, this could be a very profitable period for the altcoin. It could reach $2.50 in early December, while a rate cut from the Fed could even send it above $3.00 by 2026. A Layer-Two Network for Bitcoin? Why Bitcoin Hyper Could Be One of the Big New Alts of 2026 As promising as XRP now looks, it won’t be the only altcoin to rally during the inevitable market-wide recovery. It’s likely that a host of new alts will also do well in the coming months, including several promising presale tokens. One of the most interesting of these is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a layer-two network for Bitcoin that has now raised a very impressive $28.4 million in its ongoing presale. This is an encouraging figure for such a new project, yet it shows how the market’s faith in Bitcoin Hyper is growing. Hyper is getting HYPED! 28M Raised! pic.twitter.com/LxiuHbDpAH — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) November 19, 2025 As an L2, Bitcoin Hyper will enable investors to tap into the enormous value of the BTC hold, without having to sell their coins. Instead, they can bridge their BTC to Bitcoin Hyper’s sidechain, using the equivalent HYPER they receive with the L2’s ecosystem of apps. In other words, Bitcoin Hyper will enable traders to put their BTC holdings to work, wither by staking HYPER or by making use of the L2’s various DeFi apps. It’s worth pointing out that Bitcoin Hyper will make use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and of zero-knowledge rollups, providing superior speed, scalability and privacy. This will make it more efficient than preexisting sidechains for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network (which is primarily a payment rail anyway). This helps to explain why the token has raised so much in its presale, with investors able to join by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . HYPER is currently available at a price of $0.013325, although this will rise later today.

DOGE jumped 2.2% following the launch, as Wall Street’s growing appetite for crypto strengthens the case for a bullish Dogecoin price prediction . Grayscale secured the first-mover advantage, getting its fund listed ahead of competitors. While REX-Osprey recently launched a Dogecoin ETP, this marks the first pure spot DOGE vehicle to go live on U.S. markets.

I'm going with $12m. *33 Act pic.twitter.com/QbdLLxejhr — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 24, 2025 Alongside this new fund, Bitwise is also ready to launch its Dogecoin ETF this week. As the U.S. government shutdown has finally ended, a flood of altcoin-linked vehicles seems ready to hit the trading floor. Trading volumes have stood above average levels as buying interest seems to be increasing. A total of $1.5 billion worth of DOGE has exchanged hands in the past 24 hours. These volumes account for nearly 7% of the token’s circulating market cap. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Huge Rally Could Begin if $0.14 Support Level Holds The daily chart shows that DOGE has bounced off a key support at around $0.14. It now seems headed to retest the upper bound of a falling wedge that has formed as a result of the latest price action. Positive momentum could be picking up its pace, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) just stuck its neck above the 14-day moving average. The $0.18 area seems to be decisive in determining if Dogecoin is about to start its next leg up. If the token rises above this mark, it would break out of this wedge and could be propelled to $0.20 in the near term. This would mean a 33% upside potential. If momentum continues to build, DOGE could push toward $0.28 by year’s end, nearly doubling from current levels. In the longer term, continued adoption and fresh developments could pave the way for Dogecoin to make a run toward $10 . As meme coins begin to rally, early-stage presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are catching serious attention. It captures that early Dogecoin energy while building a tight-knit trader community where members share exclusive alpha, early setups, and high-upside plays, all before the rest of the market catches on. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Unite ‘Degens’ as They Prepare for the Next Big Pump Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is not just another Ethereum meme coin, it’s a trader-first project built for degens who want to ride early trends and capitalize on momentum. This community thrives on sharing trading setups , spotting exclusive opportunities before they go mainstream, and dropping real alpha , all while having fun in a high-energy environment. With competitions like Maxi Gains and Maxi Ripped , traders can earn rewards and climb the leaderboard while showcasing their best calls. To push things further, 25% of the presale funds will be used high potential trades, with any profits fueling bigger marketing campaigns and deeper reach. As meme coins heat up again, early-stage projects like $MAXI could offer the kind of upside legacy tokens can’t match, especially when backed by a tight community that knows how to spot the next move.

Before wider market FUD took over, the privacy coin narrative was gaining traction as the next major touch point for real-world adoption through tokens like Zcash. Vitalik’s recent commentary that “Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene” has revived interest, this time placing Ethereum in the conversation. Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 23, 2025 The argument arises in response to the recent breach of client data at major U.S. banks like JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley, first reported by the New York Times. The privacy narrative has found new relevance in this institution-led market cycle: Institutional use-cases need rails that offer privacy, yet are compliant with selective disclosure. In October, the Ethereum Foundation launched a new privacy-focused cluster and released initial details about Kohaku, a privacy-centric browser wallet and software development kit. This is a step towards an essay written by Vitalik in April, outlining a path for Ethereum to address the kind of structural data exposure seen in both TradFi and public blockchains. Ethereum Price Prediction: Could the Privacy Coin Narrative Boost ETH? As the native blockchain of potential privacy solutions bridging Web 2 to Web3, fresh demand stands to aid Ethereum in filling out the final shoulder of a potential bullish head-and-shoulders pattern. And with supportive momentum indicators and a decisive bounce from a historical demand zone around $2,750, it may have just hit its bottom. ETH / USD 1-day chart, bullish head and shoulders pattern.

The RSI has made a sharp bounce from the 30 oversold threshold after months of steady decline, while the MACD approaches a golden cross, readings that have historically marked local bottoms for the Ethereum price. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 90% move . But as the bull market matures, if Ethereum finds a bigger part to play in the transition from Web2 to Web3, the move could extend 250% to $10,000 .

This legislation will focus on modernizing the existing U.S. fraud laws so that they account for the role artificial intelligence technology has played in recent high-profile incidents where AI-generated audio or video tricked officials or the public. More about the bipartisan bill The bill, proposed by Representatives Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Neal Dunn, R-Fla., two lawmakers who have had enough of the ease and audacity with which criminals now use AI in their deceptive practices, seeks to expand penalties for AI scams and criminalize impersonating federal officials using AI. “As AI technology advances at a rapid pace, our laws must keep up,” Dunn said in a statement announcing the bill. “The AI Fraud Deterrence Act strengthens penalties for crimes related to fraud committed with the help of AI. I am proud to co-lead this legislation to protect the identities of the public and prevent misuse of this innovative technology.” Lieu agrees and last week, told NBC News that the majority of Americans want “sensible guardrails on AI,” as they don’t think a “complete Wild West is helpful.” Under the proposed law , the maximum penalty for defrauding is to be doubled from $1 million to $2 million in cases where AI is deliberately used to facilitate the crime. It would also include AI-mediated deception in the definitions of both mail fraud and wire fraud, which means it could be possible to charge individuals who use AI to conduct either type of fraud. In either case, criminals could get slammed with million-dollar fines and up to two decades behind bars for mail fraud and three for wire fraud. The draft also frowns upon the impersonation of federal officials with AI deepfakes , highlighting cases in which AIs were used in attempts to mimic White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this year. Fraud has been around for as long as humans have, but experts say that thanks to AI, the quality of fraudulent outputs has gone up. In December, the FBI warned that “generative AI reduces the time and effort criminals must expend to deceive their targets,” adding that AI “can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs for fraud.” Maura R. Grossman, a research professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario and a lawyer, also believes AI enables a new era of deception: “AI presents a scale, a scope, and a speed for fraud that is very, very different from frauds in the past.” AI models have become more advanced However, the fact that it facilitates crime is not the biggest problem. Observers are now worried that current institutions, like the judicial courts, are struggling to keep up with the rapid development happening in the AI sector. “AI years are dog years,” Hany Farid, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-founder of GetReal Security, a leading digital-media authentication company, said of the speed of AI progress. In the past, it was not too difficult to tell AI content apart from real content, especially where images were concerned; however today, they have become more advanced, and even the most experienced users now struggle to determine if a media piece is real or generated. The FBI’s warning in December advised individuals to keep an eye out for discrepancies in images and videos to identify AI-generated media: “Look for subtle imperfections in images and videos, such as distorted hands or feet.” However, Farid believes this old advice is wrong and even harmful. “The multiple hands trick, that’s not true anymore,” Farid said. “You can’t look for hands or feet. None of that stuff works.” Lieu and Dunn’s proposed bill lays emphasis on the importance of labeling AI-generated content. It also clarifies that there is a time and place for AI-generated media. For instance, if a content is labeled satirical, the tag clarifies it is not authentic and so is exempted from punishment. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Free-tier users will be limited to playing and sharing music within the platform. “This landmark pact with Suno is a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone,” said Robert Kyncl, Warner Music’s chief executive officer (CEO), in a statement . “With Suno rapidly scaling, both in users and monetization, we’ve seized this opportunity to shape models that expand revenue and deliver new fan experiences.” “Our partnership with Warner Music unlocks a bigger, richer Suno experience for music lovers, and accelerates our mission to change the place of music in the world by making it more valuable to billions of people,” Mikey Shulman, CEO, Suno, said, adding that “this means we’ll be rolling out new, more robust features for creation, opportunities to collaborate and interact with some of the most talented musicians in the world, all while continuing to build the biggest music ecosystem possible.” As part of the deal, Suno has acquired Songkick, Warner Music’s live music and concert-discovery platform, for an undisclosed amount. Suno’s settlement comes roughly one week after it announced it had raised $250 million at a valuation of $2.45 billion. The startup says nearly 100 million people have used its platform to create music over the past two years. Warner Music has now also settled with both Suno and Udio, with the latter also settling with Universal Music . SAP faces allegations of systematic theft On the same day Warner Music announced its settlement with Suno, a fresh case was opened in Dallas federal court as o9 Solutions accused SAP of orchestrating a campaign to steal trade secrets related to supply-chain management software. The lawsuit names three former o9 executives now in senior positions at SAP, alleging they downloaded over 20,000 confidential files before departing to join the German software giant. o9 Solutions, which is backed by KKR and General Atlantic and valued at $3.7 billion as of 2023, said it understood the importance of fair competition and employee mobility but could not allow its trade secrets to be misappropriated. o9 claims that SAP, facing customer losses due to its outdated platform, targeted the startup’s proprietary technology and has since altered its software to closely mirror o9’s offerings. The three defendants are Stephan de Barse, now president of SAP’s global business suite; Sean Zonneveld, now global chief revenue officer for procurement at SAP; and Stijn-Pieter van Houten, now chief product officer for supply chain management planning at SAP. “SAP is committed to the highest standards of business ethics and respects the intellectual property rights of others,” the company said in a statement. “We will review o9’s complaint and will respond, as appropriate, within the legal process.” Don’t just read crypto news.

This means that Bitcoin has risen by 1.6% in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum and Solana have risen by 3% and 5.5%. With the market beginning to stabilize after a difficult couple of weeks, now may be an opportune time to make some buys, before prices mount a sustained recovery. And one way of achieving sizeable gains during a recovery is to diversify into newer coins, with this article covering new ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , our best altcoin coin to buy today. Best Altcoin Coin to Buy As Cryptos Bounce – 25 November PEPENODE is currently holding its presale, which has so far raised in excess of $2.1 million, despite having been running for only a couple of months. The appeal of the token is already very clear, with PEPENODE offering users the chance to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, without having to invest in expensive mining equipment. APY so good even mother nature wants a taste https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/LUszW4YwYp — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 25, 2025 In the past, miners would have to buy and operate increasingly resource-hungry machines in order to mine coins, with only large companies now undertaking Bitcoin mining on a significant scale. However, all PEPENODE requires is that investors use the PEPENODE token itself to buy virtual mining nodes, which they can accumulate in order to grow their virtual rigs. The more nodes they own, the greater their rewards will be, with PEPENODE paying out mining yields in the form of external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe. Given that you will need PEPENODE in order to build a rig, the demand for the new token could also be substantial. What’s also interesting is that, after they’ve earned tokens from mining, users can sell their own virtual mining nodes to other users, and so on. This should help create a virtuous circle of buying, mining, and reselling, helping to support the PEPENODE price for the longer term. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE , with this supply allocated between rewards, development, its treasury, listings, and marketing. PEPENODE Could Go 100x in 2026: Here’s How to Buy Also bullish is the fact that holders of PEPENODE will also be able to stake the token for a passive income, with its staking protocol currently paying out an APY of 589%. While this rate will decline as staking numbers increase, it’s still a very generous rate, and one which could encourage substantial interest in PEPENODE. The token will list once its presale has closed, although investors can join the sale now by going to its official website and connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet). You can buy PEPENODE using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat currency, with the current presale price at $0.0011638. This will rise every three days until the sale ends, so interested buyers should act quickly or miss out on locking in the best possible returns. And because the market may begin recovering more vigorously once it launches, it has every chance of surging in the coming weeks, which is why it’s our best altcoin coin to buy today.

54897778,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90686,1764113414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Who Called 800% XRP Surge Shares New Insight,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-who-called-800-xrp-surge-shares-new-insight/,"XRP has faced sustained downward pressure in recent weeks, even though the broader market experienced intermittent recovery periods. Despite this weakness, a market commentator known as MichaelXBT believes that the asset’s current performance reflects a reallocation of value from short-term holders to investors with a longer outlook. His position draws from previous cycles in which XRP experienced long periods of stagnation before advancing sharply. Extended Price Weakness Despite ETF Launches Over the past seven weeks, XRP has closed in negative territory for six of them, with only the week of October 20 showing an upward movement, recording a 10 percent gain. During this period, the asset declined by more than 23 percent, although it began the current week with an 8 percent advance. This downturn persisted even after the introduction of multiple XRP exchange-traded funds, which have collectively attracted approximately $586 million in inflows since mid-November. I called XRP before it pumped 800% Many are once again losing faith in XRP That’s the purpose of this correction, It’s a transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient. XRP is ready to surprise everyone once again… That’s all I’m going to say. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) November 24, 2025 Even so, XRP is down nearly 17% for the month, indicating that institutional demand generated through the ETF market has not yet produced a noticeable effect on spot pricing. Some analysts attribute this to broader market weakness and uncertainty among retail participants. Analyst Revisits Earlier Successful Forecast MichaelXBT recently commented on the ongoing retracement by referencing his earlier analysis from mid-2024. At that time, XRP traded around $0.58 and showed limited volatility. He identified what he described as a multi-year consolidation pattern, which he believed could precede a substantial upside move. His assessment was followed by an extended rally, in which XRP rose from approximately $0.50 in November 2024 to $3.66 by July 2025, representing a gain of more than 600 percent. Market Confidence Declines as Consolidation Continues According to the analyst, XRP has once again entered a consolidation phase, and many traders appear discouraged by the lack of upward momentum. He stated that declining sentiment is contributing to increased selling activity, particularly among long-term holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Data from Glassnode indicates that profit-taking behavior intensified earlier in the year. On July 24, sales by long-term XRP holders reached an estimated $375 million, marking the highest level recorded in eight months. This development reflects a shift in market posture, with some participants reducing exposure while others continue to increase their positions. Accumulation by Larger Holders Underscores Divided Market Strategy Contrary to the trend among some retail holders, wallet analysis suggests that large XRP accounts have expanded their holdings significantly. Recent findings show that major XRP holders accumulated roughly $7.7 billion worth of tokens between August and the time of the latest analysis. This divergence highlights a clear division between investors reacting to short-term volatility and those adopting a long-term strategy. MichaelXBT interprets this behavior as evidence that the current correction is functioning as a redistribution phase. In his view, the conditions resemble those that preceded XRP’s breakout in late 2024, when extended weakness prompted selling from less confident holders while long-term investors increased their exposure. Although he did not provide a specific forecast in his latest remarks, the analyst stated that XRP may again deliver a strong upward movement once the consolidation period concludes. Earlier this year, he described the next upward phase as potentially parabolic and weeks later asserted that XRP was unlikely to remain below the $4 range for an extended period. While short-term sentiment remains divided, his latest commentary suggests that he views the current correction as a possible setup for another major trend in the future.

This potential legislative breakthrough could finally bring the regulatory clarity that cryptocurrency investors and industry participants have been eagerly awaiting. What Is the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill? The digital asset market structure bill represents a comprehensive framework designed to establish clear rules for cryptocurrency markets. According to journalist Eleanor Terrett’s reporting, bipartisan senators are gearing up for substantive discussions that could shape the future of digital asset regulation in the United States. This legislation aims to address several critical areas including: Market oversight and consumer protection Classification of digital assets Exchange registration requirements Investor safeguards Why December Matters for Crypto Regulation The timing of these discussions is particularly significant. Industry sources indicate that a group of Democratic senators plans to conduct a markup of the bipartisan bill during the week of December 8th. A markup session involves detailed debate and amendment of legislation before it moves to the full chamber for voting. Moreover, Senator John Boozman, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has expressed his desire to conduct a markup of his committee’s draft bill in early December. This coordinated effort suggests serious momentum behind the digital asset market structure bill. What Could This Mean for Crypto Investors? The potential passage of a digital asset market structure bill could bring much-needed clarity to the cryptocurrency space. Regulatory uncertainty has been a major concern for both institutional and retail investors, often creating hesitation in market participation. Key benefits of establishing clear regulations include: Enhanced investor protection through defined rules Increased institutional adoption with regulatory certainty Market stability through standardized practices Innovation encouragement within clear boundaries Challenges in Passing the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill While the potential December discussions are promising, several challenges remain. The complexity of digital assets requires careful consideration across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. Additionally, achieving bipartisan consensus on specific provisions may prove challenging given the technical nature of cryptocurrency markets. However, the growing recognition of digital assets’ importance in the global financial system creates strong incentives for lawmakers to find common ground. The digital asset market structure bill represents a crucial step toward integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial landscape. The Path Forward for Crypto Regulation As December approaches, all eyes will be on the Senate’s progress with the digital asset market structure bill. Successful markup sessions could pave the way for full chamber consideration in 2024, potentially establishing the United States as a leader in balanced digital asset regulation. The outcome of these discussions could significantly impact how cryptocurrencies are traded, stored, and regulated for years to come. Market participants should closely monitor developments around the digital asset market structure bill as they unfold throughout December. Frequently Asked Questions What is the digital asset market structure bill? The digital asset market structure bill is proposed legislation that aims to create comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency markets in the United States, addressing issues of classification, oversight, and consumer protection. When will the Senate discuss this bill? Industry sources indicate substantive discussions may begin in December, with potential markup sessions scheduled for the week of December 8th. Why is this bill important for cryptocurrency? This legislation could provide the regulatory clarity needed to encourage institutional adoption, protect investors, and establish standardized market practices for digital assets. Who is leading these discussions? Both Democratic senators and Republican members including Senator John Boozman, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, are involved in advancing the digital asset market structure bill. What happens after the December discussions? If markup sessions are successful, the bill could proceed to the full Senate for voting, potentially moving toward becoming law in 2024. How will this affect current cryptocurrency holders? Clear regulations could increase market stability and investor confidence, potentially leading to broader adoption and more secure trading environments. Found this information valuable?

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Crash To Continue If This Level Isn’t Reclaimed, Analyst Warns The launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF, along with rising on-chain activity and renewed retail enthusiasm, has combined to push DOGE into a breakout zone that analysts say could define its next major trend. As the broader crypto market remains volatile, Dogecoin is proving once again that its unique blend of cultural appeal and market structure can create outsized momentum. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Grayscale’s GDOG ETF Ignites Fresh Institutional Demand The biggest catalyst of the week is the debut of Grayscale’s GDOG, the first U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF, an unprecedented milestone for any memecoin. Listed on NYSE Arca with a temporary 0% fee for the first $1 billion in assets, GDOG offers regulated exposure to DOGE without the need for wallets or direct custody. Early inflows have already surpassed expectations, signaling significant institutional interest ahead of fierce competition from Bitwise, which is launching its own Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, later in the week. The ETF arrival comes as Dogecoin maintains its position among the top 10 cryptos, boasting billions in daily trading volume and a market capitalization rivaling that of established traditional companies. Analysts note that ETF access could unlock new capital from retirement accounts, advisory firms, and institutions that have been previously restricted from buying the asset directly, potentially reshaping DOGE’s liquidity profile. Dogecoin Price Momentum Builds as On-Chain Activity Surges DOGE’s price climbed over 2% to trade around $0.15, breaking short-term resistance as volumes exceeded $1.5 billion. On-chain data shows more than 1.5 million daily transactions, reflecting heightened network usage driven by low fees and rapid confirmation speeds. Technical indicators also reinforce the bullish turn, as the RSI has rebounded from oversold territory, while support at the $0.13 zone remains intact. Market watchers say a move toward $0.18 is possible if ETF inflows remain strong. The long-monitored $0.17–$0.16 support cluster remains the key downside zone that bulls must defend to maintain control. Memecoin Era Strengthens as DOGE Enters Regulated Finance Dogecoin’s ETF debut is more than a market event. It’s a cultural benchmark that cements the evolution of memecoins from online jokes to regulated financial instruments. With Grayscale securing first-mover advantage and Bitwise close behind, Wall Street has formally opened the door to a new class of assets powered by community identity rather than traditional fundamentals.

With the price hovering around the $87,000 range after a brief dip to $81,000, on-chain data, macro shifts, and ETF flows are painting a picture of both caution and opportunity. Whales Accumulate as Retail Capitulates New on-chain figures from Santiment reveal a sharp divergence between large and small Bitcoin holders. Since November 11, wallets holding at least 100 BTC have surged, adding 91 new large addresses even as prices trended downward. This growing whale accumulation has historically appeared near long-term market bottoms, suggesting that strategic buying occurs during periods of weakness. Conversely, wallets holding 0.1 BTC or less continue to decline, reflecting elevated fear among retail investors. Santiment notes that heavy retail selling often sets the stage for later recoveries, once large entities absorb the supply and market pressure eases. The pattern mirrors earlier cycles in which deeper retail capitulation preceded major trend reversals. Mixed Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Signals Several key indicators are offering conflicting signals on Bitcoin’s next move. CryptoQuant data indicate that Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio is dipping into its “green zone,” suggesting that risk-adjusted returns are becoming more attractive, similar to levels observed before major uptrends in 2019, 2020, and 2022. Capriole Investments’ “Bitcoin Heater” metric has also returned to deep green, suggesting strong potential for upside movement. Yet not all metrics signal immediate recovery. The aSOPR (Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio), a reliable cyclical indicator, has spent nearly two years consolidating without reaching the “red line” levels that marked tops in previous bull runs. Analysts warn that a decisive breakout of this long consolidation pattern is imminent, though the direction remains unknown. Macro Forces and ETF Outflows Fuel Uncertainty Arthur Hayes believes that Bitcoin may retest the low $80,000s but expects the $80K level to hold as firm support, especially as the Federal Reserve ends quantitative tightening on December 1. Markets are also pricing in a 77% chance of an interest rate cut at the December 9–10 meeting, driving renewed optimism across risk assets. However, institutional flows tell a different story. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has recorded a staggering $2.35 billion in withdrawals this month, its largest outflow since launch. The wave of redemptions underscores weakening confidence among big-money players amid price volatility and macro uncertainty. Even so, Bitcoin’s recent 1.3% recovery to $88K, alongside strong rebounds in Ethereum, XRP, and major altcoins, shows that buyers are stepping back in. Analysts warn that volatility will remain elevated, however, if whale accumulation continues and macroeconomic conditions ease, Bitcoin may yet defend the crucial $80K support and attempt another push toward the $90K barrier.

Recent trading activity shows XRP rebounding from levels below $2.00 and moving back toward the upper section of its current range. Over the last 24 hours, the token has fluctuated between $2.06 and $2.20, i ndicating increased participation from market participants looking to support further upside. The current price behavior reflects an improvement in sentiment following a period of volatility earlier in the month. Since the initial decline, XRP has gradually formed higher price points, although it has not yet surpassed critical resistance thresholds. Analysts are watching for additional confirmation before identifying this move as a sustained recovery trend. Technical Overview A broader assessment of XRP’s daily chart shows that the token is attempting to rebuild bullish momentum following a notable correction in mid-November. However, the Ichimoku Cloud continues to signal a challenging environment for upward movement. XRP remains positioned beneath the cloud, which means that the area above the current price still acts as a significant resistance zone. The lower boundary of the cloud is located near $2.24, while the upper edge extends toward approximately $2.38. As long as XRP remains under these levels, the cloud will function as an obstacle preventing a transition into a stronger bullish phase. A decisive break above this region would be needed before the asset can move toward higher targets such as $2.80. On the downside, immediate support is situated around $2.06, aligned with the current position of the Tenkan-sen. A decline toward this level may occur if the ongoing resistance persists. For a stronger bullish signal to develop, the Tenkan-sen must rise above the Kijun-sen, which would indicate a shift toward positive short-term momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) is presently at 47.83. This shows that selling pressure has eased following the recent oversold reading, but buying strength has not yet reached the neutral midpoint of 50. A move above 50 would represent renewed accumulation and increase the likelihood of a breakout attempt. Liquidation Trends Liquidation figures highlight notable changes in trader positioning over multiple timeframes. During the last 4-hour window, total liquidations rose to $989.38K. Although long positions accounted for $547.12K of this amount, short liquidations also increased sharply, reaching $442.26K. The data suggests heightened volatility affecting both sides of the market. Over 12 hours, liquidations expanded to $3.13M, with short positions experiencing a significant portion of the losses. Nearly half a million dollars in short liquidations occurred as XRP’s price began to recover. This indicates that traders anticipating further declines were forced to exit positions as the asset moved higher. The 24-hour statistics present a clearer picture of market pressure on bearish traders. Total liquidations surged to $13.54M, including $8.66M from short positions and $4.88M from long positions. This imbalance shows that market participants betting against XRP have experienced greater losses, suggesting increased strength from buyers even though the asset has not yet overcome the major resistance defined by the Ichimoku Cloud.

Dell booked $12.3 billion worth of AI server orders in its fiscal third quarter that ended Oct. 31, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Dell shipped $5.6 billion of servers and finished the quarter with a backlog of $18.4 billion. The company raised shipment estimates for the year to $25 billion from $20 billion. Rival vendors see AI orders soar amid fierce market competition Rivals such as Super Micro Computer and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have also seen soaring AI-heavy orders, as cloud providers and enterprises rush to build systems that can train more complex models. Market research companies estimate that global spending on AI servers could exceed $200 billion annually by the end of the decade — another indication of the fierce competition among hardware suppliers to secure long-term contracts with hyperscalers. Huge spending on AI data centers and work has fueled demand for machines made by companies including Dell, Super Micro Computer Inc., and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Inc. that use powerful chips to train and run AI models. But winning and filling those orders has led to higher costs for Dell, and the company is trying to make its AI server business more profitable. Operating margins in Dell’s infrastructure unit, which includes server and networking sales, were 12.4% during the period. Analysts, on average, said 11.2 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The costs of memory chips needed for servers and PCs are rising much faster than is typical, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in a conference call after the results were announced. “We’re going to do everything we can to minimize the impact,” he said. “But the fact is, the cost basis is going up across all products. No one is more unique than others.” Strong earnings and strategic leadership position Dell for AI growth Dell’s overall gross margin was 21.1%, compared with the average estimate of 20.4%. The shares rose about 2% in extended trading after closing at $125.92 in New York. The stock had gained 9.3% this year before the announcement of the results. Earnings, excluding some items, will be about $9.92 a share in the fiscal year ending in January. Sales are expected to be approximately $111.7 billion. In August, the company projected earnings of approximately $9.55 billion and sales of around $107 billion. Analysts, on average, projected a profit of $9.55 a share on revenue of $107.9 billion. “AI momentum is accelerating in the second half of the year,” Clarke said in the statement, leading to “an unprecedented $30 billion in orders year to date.” Total sales rose 11% to $27 billion in the third quarter, slightly below the $27.2 billion analysts had expected. Commercial PC revenue grew 5% to $10.6 billion but still fell short of consensus estimates. Earnings came in at $2.59 per share, excluding certain items, topping the projected $2.48. The company has also appointed David Kennedy as its Chief Financial Officer, following his interim service in the role. Kennedy’s permanent appointment as CFO occurs as Dell navigates increased demand and operational risks. He was in charge of financial strategy during the company’s restructuring efforts and will likely be key to steering long-term investments in AI infrastructure while hitting profitability objectives.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing about the dramatic Ethena USDe TVL collapse that saw over $7 billion vanish from the protocol. This stunning development raises crucial questions about stablecoin sustainability in volatile markets. What Caused the Ethena USDe TVL Meltdown? The Ethena USDe TVL catastrophe didn’t happen overnight. Several factors converged to create this perfect storm. First, the annual percentage yield plummeted from double digits to just 5.1%. This massive yield compression made the protocol less attractive to yield farmers. Meanwhile, borrowing costs on established platforms like Aave remained higher at approximately 5.4%. This created a negative carry situation where it became cheaper to borrow elsewhere. The Ethena USDe TVL suffered as investors sought better opportunities. How Did Leveraged Positions Accelerate the Ethena USDe TVL Decline? The yield structure shift triggered massive liquidations across the board. Many investors had employed looping strategies using sUSDe as collateral. When yields dropped below borrowing costs, these positions became unsustainable. Leveraged traders faced margin calls sUSDe collateral values declined rapidly Forced liquidations created selling pressure The Ethena USDe TVL hemorrhage accelerated This domino effect demonstrates how interconnected DeFi protocols can amplify market movements. The Ethena USDe TVL drop serves as a cautionary tale about over-leverage in yield farming strategies. What Does This Mean for Stablecoin Investors? The Ethena USDe TVL situation highlights several important lessons for cryptocurrency participants. Stablecoins promising high yields often carry hidden risks. When market conditions change, these protocols can unravel quickly. Investors should carefully assess: Sustainable yield levels Protocol collateralization Market correlation risks Liquidation mechanisms The current Ethena USDe TVL of $7.6 billion represents a significant cooling from October’s $14.8 billion peak. However, this recalibration might create healthier long-term foundations. Where Does Ethena USDe TVL Go From Here? Recovery paths for Ethena USDe TVL depend on multiple factors. Protocol developers might introduce new mechanisms to stabilize yields. Market conditions could improve, making current yields more competitive. Alternatively, investors might permanently reallocate to other stablecoin options. The Ethena USDe TVL story underscores that in DeFi, nothing stays the same forever. Successful investors adapt to changing conditions rather than clinging to past performance. FAQs About Ethena USDe TVL Drop What is Ethena USDe TVL? Ethena USDe TVL refers to the Total Value Locked in Ethena’s USDe stablecoin protocol, representing the amount of assets deposited by users. Why did Ethena USDe TVL drop so dramatically? The drop resulted from yield compression triggering liquidations of leveraged positions that used sUSDe as collateral. Is Ethena USDe still safe to use? While the protocol continues operating, investors should carefully assess current yields against borrowing costs and market risks. Can Ethena USDe TVL recover? Recovery depends on yield stabilization, market conditions, and protocol improvements that make USDe competitive again. What alternatives exist to Ethena USDe? Investors can consider other stablecoin protocols, though each carries unique risks and reward profiles. How does this affect the broader DeFi market? Significant TVL drops in major protocols can reduce overall DeFi liquidity and increase scrutiny on yield sustainability. Found this analysis helpful?

That’s exactly what’s happening in Goyang City, South Korea, as municipal authorities launch a groundbreaking cryptocurrency sales program that could reshape how cities handle digital asset enforcement. How do cryptocurrency sales work for tax collection? Goyang City has taken a bold step by opening non-profit corporate accounts on South Korea’s four major cryptocurrency exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. Starting in December, the city will begin transferring seized virtual assets from delinquent taxpayers’ accounts directly to its own exchange wallets. This direct approach to cryptocurrency sales eliminates traditional barriers that previously complicated digital asset seizure. The process involves several key steps: Identification of tax delinquents holding cryptocurrency assets Legal seizure authorization through proper channels Transfer of assets to city-controlled exchange accounts Strategic cryptocurrency sales to maximize returns Deposit of proceeds into the municipal budget Why is this cryptocurrency sales approach revolutionary? Traditional asset seizure faced significant challenges with cryptocurrency. Unlike bank accounts or physical property, digital assets require specialized handling and immediate action due to market volatility. Goyang City’s direct cryptocurrency sales method addresses these challenges head-on by establishing official exchange relationships. The city’s November 26th announcement marks a significant advancement in municipal finance technology. By creating non-profit corporate accounts, Goyang ensures proper legal standing for all cryptocurrency sales activities while maintaining transparency in asset management. What benefits do direct cryptocurrency sales provide? This innovative approach offers multiple advantages for both the city and taxpayers. The streamlined cryptocurrency sales process reduces administrative costs and speeds up revenue collection. More importantly, it allows the city to respond quickly to market conditions, potentially maximizing returns from seized digital assets. Key benefits include: Faster revenue generation for public services Reduced administrative complexity in asset liquidation Market-responsive timing for cryptocurrency sales Legal clarity through established exchange partnerships Budget stability through diversified revenue streams What challenges might affect cryptocurrency sales success? While promising, this cryptocurrency sales initiative faces several potential hurdles. Market volatility remains the most significant concern, as sudden price drops could reduce the value of seized assets before liquidation. Additionally, the technical complexity of managing multiple exchange accounts requires specialized expertise that municipalities might lack. Legal considerations around cryptocurrency sales timing and pricing also present challenges. The city must balance rapid liquidation against optimal market conditions while maintaining proper documentation for all transactions. Security measures for storing and transferring digital assets add another layer of complexity to the cryptocurrency sales process. How will cryptocurrency sales impact future tax enforcement? Goyang City’s cryptocurrency sales program could set a precedent for municipalities worldwide. As digital asset ownership becomes more widespread, cities need effective methods to include cryptocurrency in tax enforcement strategies. Successful implementation here might inspire similar programs across South Korea and beyond. The program’s success metrics will likely influence how other municipalities approach cryptocurrency sales for tax collection. Key performance indicators include recovery rates, administrative costs, and legal compliance. These metrics will determine whether this cryptocurrency sales model becomes standard practice or requires significant modification. Conclusion: A new era for municipal cryptocurrency sales Goyang City’s direct cryptocurrency sales initiative represents a significant step forward in digital asset enforcement. By establishing formal relationships with major exchanges and creating a streamlined seizure process, the city positions itself at the forefront of municipal cryptocurrency management. This approach could revolutionize how local governments handle tax collection in the digital age while providing valuable lessons for other cities considering similar cryptocurrency sales programs. Frequently Asked Questions Which cryptocurrency exchanges is Goyang City using? The city has opened accounts on South Korea’s four major exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. When will the cryptocurrency sales begin? The program starts transferring and selling seized assets beginning in December. What happens to the proceeds from cryptocurrency sales? All proceeds go directly into the city’s budget to fund public services and municipal operations. How does the city identify tax delinquents with cryptocurrency? The city uses legal channels and financial investigation methods to identify digital asset holders who owe taxes. Is this the first such program in South Korea? While other cities have seized cryptocurrency, Goyang’s direct sales approach through established exchange accounts appears innovative. What protections exist for taxpayers during cryptocurrency sales? The process follows legal seizure procedures, and taxpayers receive proper notification and can address any disputes through established channels.

The latest figures extend Solana’s streak of 20 consecutive days of positive inflows, marking one of the most resilient ETF runs seen in the digital asset market this year. the unbroken streak of daily inflows to the solana etf (topped off by a record day of inflows) is greatly under appreciated. thank you for your attention to this matter https://t.co/8ItbDL85JO — raj (@rajgokal) November 25, 2025 Solana ETFs Surge While Bitcoin and Ethereum Shed Billions in Monthly Outflows According to data from SoSoValue, the inflows were led by Bitwise’s BSOL, which drew $39.5 million on the day, the third-largest single-day inflow since the products launched in late October. That pushed total net inflows for Solana ETFs to $568.24 million since debut, while combined net assets climbed to $843.81 million, equal to 1.09% of Solana’s market capitalization. Source: SoSoValue The sustained activity stands out sharply against the broader market backdrop, where both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced weeks of heavy redemptions. Source: SoSoValue Bitcoin ETFs recorded a monthly outflow of $3.70 billion between November 3 and November 24, while Ethereum ETFs saw an outflow of $1.64 billion during the same period. Solana remains the only major asset to post persistent inflows throughout November, attracting $369 million over the past three weeks as BTC and ETH funds continued to lose capital. Analysts say recent flows point to a broader shift in how institutions are positioning themselves in the digital asset market. Solana’s ETF has performed far better than early forecasts, which expected slower traction amid the recent downturn. According to market researchers, the consistent inflows signal that Solana is increasingly being viewed as a “blue-chip” asset. They noted that this steady capital base could help provide support even as risk appetite across the crypto sector weakens. Observers also noted the growing number of traditional finance firms choosing Solana for tokenization efforts. Projects such as xStocks, which brings U.S. equities and ETFs on-chain, were cited as examples of rising institutional activity. Even so, analysts warned that ETF strength does not guarantee immediate price appreciation. SOL remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment, and any sustained reaction in the token may take longer to materialize. Solana ETFs Approach $1B AUM After Strong Weekly Inflows Across individual issuers, Bitwise’s BSOL remains by far the dominant product, with $567.10 million in net assets. Grayscale’s GSOL follows at $117.90 million, after taking in $4.66 million in new capital on Monday. Fidelity’s FSOL and VanEck’s VSOL also recorded some of their highest single-day inflows to date, with $9.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively, while 21Shares’ TSOL and Canary’s SOLC continued to report positive but moderate activity. Over the six-day window between November 17 and November 24, Solana ETFs added $177.93 million in new capital, rising from $390.31 million in cumulative inflows to $568.24 million. Meanwhile, the total AUM of Solana ETFs is nearing a major milestone. With combined assets now above $870 million, the products are on track to reach $1 billion in the near term. A new inflow catalyst is also approaching: Franklin Templeton’s Solana ETF , which has not yet launched, is expected to bring additional institutional demand once approved. The flows contrast sharply with weakening market conditions. SOL remains down 30% in the past 30 days, and recent trading has shown declining volume and negative perpetual funding rates. The token is trading around $137, down 1% on the day and 13% in the past two weeks. In January 2025, JP Morgan originally forecasted that Solana ETFs could see between $3-6B in inflows within their first 6-12 months. The bank re-evaluated its position in October, changing its projections to ~$1.5B in the first year. Technical indicators show that SOL is still locked in a broader corrective phase. Analysts tracking the asset’s Elliott Wave structure say the market may be moving through a deeper Wave C decline, with potential downside targets between $80 and $95 if current support levels fail. The token is also trading below its 200-day EMA, a condition often associated with extended consolidation periods.

This dramatic five-point decline from yesterday’s reading signals growing anxiety among crypto traders and investors worldwide. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market emotions, operating on a scale from 0 to 100. When the index hits extreme lows like 15, it indicates widespread panic and uncertainty. This comprehensive tool analyzes multiple market factors to gauge collective investor psychology.

When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaches extreme fear levels, it often presents unique opportunities for savvy investors. Historically, periods of maximum fear have frequently preceded significant market rebounds. However, understanding the underlying causes is crucial for making informed decisions. Current market conditions reflect several concerning factors. Increased volatility has shaken investor confidence, while reduced trading volume suggests many participants are sitting on the sidelines. Social media sentiment has turned predominantly negative, amplifying the fear cycle. How Can Investors Navigate This Extreme Fear Environment?

This decision followed reports indicating that the bank had abruptly closed accounts belonging to Strike CEO Jack Mallers, sparking tension in the crypto industry due to concerns about crypto debanking in the US. The latest incident involves Houston Morgan, who serves as the Head of Marketing and Protocol Relations at ShapeShift, a non-custodial crypto trading platform. Following the bank’s move, Morgan mentioned that Chase decided to close his business bank account on Friday, November 21. He also informed reporters that his personal account is next in line, scheduled to be shut down this week. According to a notable figure in the crypto industry, the bank’s move was conducted without any warning. Notably, Morgan lives in Los Angeles, a city in California in the US. On the other hand, ShapeShift does not hold its clients’ funds and operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Chase shuts down Morgan’s business account In a statement, Morgan mentioned that he received a text from Chase at about 3:40 PM PST on November 21. The text stated that the bank required more details from him and that his business account was at risk of being shut down. Morgan pointed out that such a move was unexpected, as no one had earlier contacted him about any issues with his account, reported a situation where documents were missing, or any unusual activity . Meanwhile, just after receiving the text from the bank, he noticed that he could no longer log into either his business or personal accounts at Chase. After this finding, Morgan stated that he immediately took action and called the bank to inquire about the incident. This took him around thirty minutes as he was transferred between various departments in Chase. These departments included: general support, business banking, and account review. Still, he claimed that no one gave him a straightforward answer. Additionally, no one in these departments requested details about his business or any supporting documents. Morgan expressed that he felt as if these people were passing him around without any attempt to solve his problem. Finally, he got the chance to speak to a representative in the bank, who was known as “Andre.” Andre openly told Morgan that a decision about the bank account had already been made, informing him that Chase was ending business with him to safeguard the institution of the bank, Morgan reported. “He couldn’t give me any more information because of policy. I wasn’t given a chance to fix anything, submit documents, or appeal the decision,” he added. At this point, Morgan mentioned that his business account, connected to ShapeShift’s DAO structure, was frozen. When reporters asked him about the total amount of money currently in the bank account, he estimated that it contained approximately $40,000 but could not confirm the exact figure, as Chase no longer provides him with access to his statements. Concerning the operations of ShapeShift’s DAO, it is worth noting that each workstream functions as its own unit. Morgan maintained a business account specifically created to handle payments and contracts related to his workstream. Therefore, this activity led analysts to conclude that the account was a type of ShapeShift account. Morgan further explained that he could use it frequently to carry out 30–50 transactions monthly. Andre warns Morgan about Chase’s plans on his personal account Morgan publicly stated that Andre had cautioned him that his personal account would be closed the following week during their call. As it had not been frozen yet, he was instructed to transfer his funds, which he did. Morgan said he was not aware of any other ShapeShift-associated accounts being affected yet, but hopes to ask his colleagues about it during a soon-to-be-held internal meeting. In the meantime, Mallers from Strike complained last week that JPMorgan Chase had closed down his accounts and rejected some deposits to Strike, saying the business was participating in fraudulent activities. This situation prompted US Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming to weigh in on the topic of discussion. Lummis remarked that these closures illustrate that “Operation Chokepoint 2.0 unfortunately continues,” and said that actions of this nature “undermine trust in traditional banks and push the digital asset industry overseas.” These events occurred even after a recent executive order from President Donald Trump telling federal regulators not to penalize banks working with crypto firms.

The cryptocurrency fell from $106,000 to $80,600 in just 10 days, prompting renewed speculation over whether BTC has reached a local bottom. The rebound comes even as major whale holders continue to sell their BTC, though mid-sized holders and long-term accumulators are showing increased conviction in the market. Accumulation and Distribution Patterns Onchain analytics reveal significant differences in behavior between various BTC holder cohorts. Wallets holding more than 10,000 BTC, along with institutional investors holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, acted as consistent sellers during the correction, contributing to downward pressure. Retail wallets, defined as holding less than 10 BTC, also sold off over the past 60 days, providing little market support. In contrast, mid-sized holders in the 10–100 BTC and 100–1,000 BTC ranges accumulated BTC, helping absorb sell-side pressure and stabilize prices. Demand from Bitcoin “accumulator addresses” hit a record 365,000 BTC on Nov. 23, up from 254,000 BTC on Nov. 1, indicating growing long-term confidence among certain investors. Futures Market and Short Squeeze Potential The recent BTC crash was largely fueled by futures markets , where cascading long liquidations, forced selling, and margin calls pushed BTC into the $80,000 range. CryptoQuant data shows that traders attempting to long the correction have been squeezed out, with daily funding rates briefly turning negative. Analyst Darkfost warned that if shorts continue to pile up while BTC gradually rises, the market could enter a “disbelief phase,” creating the conditions for a sharp short squeeze. Long liquidation heatmaps from Hyblock Capital indicate $2.6 billion in long liquidations at $80,000, while short liquidations surged over $8.4 billion near $98,000, showing the influence of liquidity bands at $94,000, $98,000, and $110,000. These dynamics suggest that BTC’s rebound may continue toward the $90,000 mark as mid-sized holders and accumulators provide steady support.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-26 00:53:01

YBTC's upside is capped and downside risk is significant; timing entry is critical, and a small, gradual position is recommended due to Bitcoin's volatility. Compared to peers like YBIT, YBTC has a lower expense ratio more resilient performance, and is best used as a supplement for investors already holding Bitcoin. I rate YBTC a buy after Bitcoin's pullback, highlighting its income potential, tax-efficient distributions, and suitability for those seeking high-risk, high-reward exposure. Overview I've accumulated a plethora of these higher-yield option ETFs, but I've avoided many of the crypto-focused choices out there due to timing. However, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has recently pulled back nearly 30% from its all-time highs, and entry into some of these high yield ETFs seems a lot more enticing now. More specifically, I believe that the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ) is an attractive way to harness the volatility of Bitcoin and turn it into a weekly income stream. YBTC now offers a starting dividend yield of approximately 49.2%, with payouts being issued every Friday. Data by YCharts However, there are plenty of risks with a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin that should be considered. For instance, it's entirely possible that we see a continued decline further over the next twelve months. If the price of BTC continues to fall, the underlying NAV and payout amounts will also decrease for YBTC. So timing is very critical when it comes to a fund like YBTC. For this reason, I have only initiated a very small starting position and will gradually build more shares over time. Therefore, I would consider YBTC to be one of the higher risk/reward assets within the Roundhill arsenal. Despite the risk, YBTC has proven its ability to provide favorable returns when BTC is rallying higher. While you would certainly be better off directly owning BTC, I believe that a strategic use of YBTC can help investors benefit from the ongoing volatility in the near term. The fund is still relatively new with an inception dating back to only January of 2024. YBTC has a gross expense ratio of 0.96%, but this may be worth it considering the yield that's paid out to investors. So let's start by taking a look at the underlying strategy that YBTC implements to generate its income. Fund Strategy According to the latest fact sheet , YBTC has total assets under management of $326.3M. The fund's ultimate goal is to provide indirect exposure to the daily price movement of Bitcoin while also amplifying the income levels generated through the use of an option strategy. However, it's important to understand that YBTC technically implements a synthetic option writing strategy against Bitcoin. The term 'synthetic' simply means that YBTC does not directly own any Bitcoin. This can increase the overall risk profile due to the price volatility, but this can also allow YBTC to capture larger option premiums. As we can see from YBTC's holdings below, the fund holds no actual Bitcoin. Instead, YBTC is getting its exposure through call and put options written against the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), which does actually hold Bitcoin. So the fund is essentially selling Bitcoin ETF call options at a strike price that is out of the money. This OTM (out-of-the-money) strategy allows some capital appreciation to be captured during rallies. However, the growth is still capped at whatever the selected strike price is. For instance, the prospectus lays out the following tradeoff: If the value of the Bitcoin ETFs appreciates in value beyond the strike price of one or more of the Bitcoin ETF Call Options that the Fund has sold to generate income, the Fund will lose money on those short call positions, and the losses will, in turn, limit the upside return of the Fund’s synthetic long exposure. Roundhill Investments While the upside growth is capped by the options, the downside risks are not. Simply put, if Bitcoin experiences a large pullback in price, so will YBTC. Therefore, the primary risk is a scenario where Bitcoin pulls back even further. BTC is a highly volatile asset that is known for very large price swings. So despite BTC's price falling back below $90,000, it can easily go much lower. It's so hard to gauge these price movements because sentiment among crypto investors can shift so rapidly. Since the upside movements are capped, this means that YBTC is unlikely to recover all of its share price when BTC finally does bounce and rally upwards. As we can see below, YBTC basically follows the same price movement as Bitcoin, so it's safe to assume that a continued decline would result in larger losses for existing YBTC holders. This is why I want to emphasize that timing on the entry is very important. Therefore, I've opted to implement a dollar cost average approach starting with a very small position size, just in case the share price falls even lower. Data by YCharts Performance Risk & Comparison I also want to emphasize that investors that are bullish on the outlook of Bitcoin are likely better off simply owning the underlying. Since YBTC's growth potential is capped, it's very probable that YBTC will underperform Bitcoin during a rally. Additionally, YBTC's high dividend yield doesn't automatically result in a higher total return over time. Just to demonstrate this weakness, we can refer to the performance chart below. As we can see, YBTC's share price has fallen by 38.77% since inception. When including all distributions paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up above 43% over the same time frame. Meanwhile, BTC's price has increased over 103% over the same time frame. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend a position in YBTC if you aren't already exposed to Bitcoin in some capacity. Data by YCharts Therefore, it makes sense to utilize YBTC as an accompanying position, rather than a standalone fund. For instance, I currently own Bitcoin directly and have no intentions to sell. YBTC makes the most sense when utilized as a strategic way to harness the current volatility and choppiness of the price. Since the options will cap the upside growth, I believe that there are three ways to summarize the movement of YBTC. Bitcoin Rises = YBTC will underperform, but will provide attractive returns. YBTC's share price and payout amounts may rise. Bitcoin Trades Flat/Choppy = YBTC has the potential to outperform since the distributions can amplify returns. Bitcoin Declines = YBTC will suffer a large decline and payouts are at risk of being decreased. While there's a chance that payouts can help offset losses, YBTC will still likely lose value. Additionally, there are several peers out there that now implement a similar option strategy to generate income from Bitcoin. I believe that the most similar peer in terms of operating strategy and risk, is the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Strategy Income ETF ( YBIT ). As we can see below, YBIT is smaller in size since it only has $81.2M in assets under management, while also being less cost-efficient since the expense ratio sits at 4.76%. However, YBIT offers a slightly higher estimated annual distribution rate of 52%. Seeking Alpha These funds are very similar because YBIT also implements a synthetic option writing strategy to generate its income. Additionally, YBIT also issues payouts on a weekly basis. However, a quick performance comparison reveals that YBTC has been able to experience less of a price decline, while maintaining a higher total return when including all distributions. So despite YBIT's higher dividend yield, YBTC seems like the more resilient choice in the space. Data by YCharts Dividend Utility As of the latest declared weekly distribution of $0.2813 per share, the current dividend yield sits around 49.2%. However, the payout amounts are determined by factors like the success of the written options, momentum of Bitcoin, and implied volatility levels. Therefore, the yield is likely to be different by the time you read this article. Since the payout amounts are always shifting week after week, so is the estimated annual yield. Therefore, YBTC is not a great choice for investors seeking income reliability and consistent payout amounts. As we can see from the dividend history below, YBTC previously issued distributions on a monthly basis. The shift to weekly payouts only happened at the start of 2025. This weekly frequency can be appealing to investors seeking income flexibility within their portfolio. For instance, more frequent payouts means that investors have the ability to manually reinvest these distributions in other areas of their portfolio. Or perhaps these frequent payouts can be a supplemental income stream for retirees. Seeking Alpha However, we are talking about a distribution that is over 49%. I believe that if you time your entry correctly, investors have the ability to reach house money status within a two year time span. House money refers to the concept of receiving your initial investment back in the form of distributions. For instance, $10,000 invested is estimated to yield ~$4,920 annually. ~$4,920 X two years = $9,840 So within about a two-year time span, it's entirely possible to reach this house money status. Once this is achieved, an investor's risk profile is drastically reduced since the initially invested capital has been repaid. However, the investor would still own the shares that are consistently paying them income. Of course, this is a simplified view of the yield and this assumes that payouts remain consistent. Lastly, the fund seems to prioritize distributions that are tax-efficient. For instance, the latest section19(a) notice indicates that 100% of the latest payout was made up of return of capital. Unlike net investment income, return of capital distributions are not classified as income and therefore, aren't taxed as such. Instead, a return of capital distribution reduces an investor's cost basis and allows taxes to be deferred until the time of sale. However, it's important to note that the funding method for distributions change frequently, so there may still be tax consequences that investors need to consider. YBTC Section19(a) Notice Takeaway In conclusion, I rate YBTC as a buy at this time following Bitcoin's recent pullback. Although there can be further downside risk, I believe that this serves as a nice entry point for a smaller starting position. YBTC has proven that it can harness the volatility of Bitcoin and turn this into weekly income for shareholders. I believe that YBTC is the more compelling choice over YBIT, but the caveat is that a position only makes sense if you already hold Bitcoin in some capacity. Lastly, the distributions can be tax-efficient depending on their reliance on return of capital.",IBIT|YBIT|YBTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-26 00:54:39

This substantial Multicoin Capital AAVE investment comes despite the firm currently facing millions in unrealized losses, showing remarkable confidence in the DeFi sector’s future. What Does Multicoin Capital’s Latest AAVE Purchase Reveal? According to blockchain analytics firm EmberCN, Multicoin Capital acquired 60,000 AAVE tokens through Galaxy Digital’s OTC desk. This strategic Multicoin Capital AAVE investment represents their continued accumulation of the DeFi giant’s tokens. The firm has now purchased 338,000 AAVE over the past six weeks, demonstrating persistent conviction in their investment thesis. The timing of this Multicoin Capital AAVE investment appears counterintuitive to some observers. However, veteran investors often increase positions during market uncertainty. This approach aligns with traditional investment wisdom about buying when others are fearful. Why Continue Investing Amid Significant Losses? Multicoin Capital currently faces $13.5 million in unrealized losses on their AAVE holdings. This situation raises important questions about their investment strategy. Several factors might explain their continued commitment: Long-term vision for DeFi adoption Confidence in AAVE’s fundamental technology Strategic positioning during market lows Portfolio diversification across crypto assets The Multicoin Capital AAVE investment strategy suggests they see current prices as attractive entry points. Their consistent buying pattern indicates systematic accumulation rather than emotional trading decisions. How Does OTC Trading Benefit Large Investors? Multicoin Capital executed this Multicoin Capital AAVE investment through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter desk. OTC trading offers significant advantages for large-scale transactions: Avoids market impact from large orders Provides price stability during execution Offers privacy from public order books Enables customized settlement terms This approach demonstrates how sophisticated players navigate crypto markets differently from retail traders. The Multicoin Capital AAVE investment through OTC channels reflects institutional-grade execution strategies. What Does This Mean for AAVE’s Future?

Prices slipped below the $2 mark and recently hit about $1.83 before a small rebound. Volatility has been sharp, and many traders are being pushed into quick exits.

Fear is back, and it always hits those who don’t understand what it means to hold XRP. Most won’t survive the engineered volatility ahead. The system shakes out the weak long before real valuation even begins. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 23, 2025 Those swings left behind gaps in liquidity, including a zone around $1.98 to $1.99 that traders are watching closely. Price action has been messy but not one-directional. XRP was trading around $2.22, up about 1.8% in the last 24 hours, and in another snapshot it was reported changing hands close to $2.24 amid a rebound. Over the most recent 72 hours, the token posted a rally of more than 18%, showing how fast sentiment can flip. According to Aljarrah, fear has returned, and “it always hits those who don’t understand what it means to hold XRP.” The analyst pointed out that a good number of people will fall before they could even make it and “survive the engineered volatility ahead.” The system, he said, “shakes out the weak” long before actual market valuation takes its course. History And Psychology At Work Analysts and market observers point to XRP’s stop-and-go history as part of the problem. In 2017, the coin lingered for months before surging roughly 70,000% and then dropping by as much as 95% at certain stretches. In 2024, it traded quietly for much of the year before jumping over 600% near year end. That pattern makes holding the token psychologically hard for many. People sell too soon, often right before big moves. Support levels are being watched closely. Reports list key buffers at $1.95, $1.75, and $1.60. On the upside, some analysts are projecting a rebound to $4 by 2026, with longer-range targets of $13 and $27. Those are forecasts, not promises, and they assume steady market conditions and continued interest.

The sharp downturn has shaken investors who expected continued upside, and many analysts are beginning to argue that the cycle has already peaked. Price action remains fragile, with buyers struggling to regain control and momentum indicators pointing to exhaustion rather than strength. Yet, despite the bearish tone, there are emerging signs that the current phase may be approaching an inflection point. According to top analyst Axel Adler, both the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Index and the Futures Flow Index remain firmly within a bearish regime, signaling that market structure still favors downside risk. However, Adler highlights that Bitcoin is currently trading 11% below its 30-day fair value of $99.2K, suggesting a notable disconnect between price and underlying derivatives positioning. This divergence has historically appeared near corrective exhaustion zones rather than early-stage declines. Additionally, short-term dynamics across both indices indicate the first signs of an attempted reversal, with selling pressure slowly weakening and momentum beginning to stabilize. Bearish Structure Weakens as Bitcoin Attempts to Stabilize The daily Bitcoin bull and bear structure index shows a sustained shift to the bearish side since November 11, reflecting the strongest downside momentum of this cycle. The red BEAR line moved deep into negative territory at -36%, signaling persistent dominance of selling pressure. However, the indicator is now starting to reverse, suggesting that the most aggressive phase of bearish control may be fading. At the same time, Bitcoin is consolidating around $87,000 after briefly plunging to $80,000, marking an early attempt to stabilize and rebuild support following the sharp decline. Fast versions of the index highlight increased volatility, with the metric rising from -43 to -20 — a clear sign that bear pressure is easing. Although this does not yet indicate a trend reversal, it reflects a meaningful reduction in downside intensity. In the futures market, the index remains in a bearish regime as well, with values rising but still failing to break above the key 55 threshold. A move above that level would signal the first structural attempt to transition back into a bullish phase. The fair value level, currently positioned at $99,000, shows Bitcoin trading $11,000 below equilibrium, reinforcing undervaluation. Together, both indices indicate that the market is attempting to exit the bearish regime it has been trapped in for more than a month, though confirmation will require stronger follow-through. Weekly Structure Tests Key Support Amid Attempted Stabilization Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after a sharp decline from its all-time high near $126,000. Price is currently trading around $87,300, reflecting a significant drawdown of more than 30% from the peak. The recent candle structure highlights a temporary rebound after tagging lows near $80,000, suggesting that buyers have stepped in at a critical support zone. The 100-week moving average, sitting close to current levels, is acting as an important dynamic support and has historically served as a threshold separating bullish continuation from deeper cyclical breakdowns. Despite the bounce, the price remains below the 50-week moving average, which is beginning to curl downward, signaling weakening trend strength. Volume increased noticeably during the selloff, reflecting capitulation behavior and aggressive repositioning among market participants.

However, if selling pressure resumes and the price loses the 100-week moving average, the next downside magnet sits near the $75,000–$78,000 range. The weekly structure shows a market in correction but not yet in a confirmed macro reversal, with the upcoming candles likely determining whether the cycle continues or breaks down further.

BMNR's unique model accumulates Ethereum as a treasury asset, avoids debt risk, and recently initiated dividend payments, differentiating it from peers like MSTR. BMNR's performance is highly correlated to ETH price; technical and fundamental analysis suggest medium- to long-term upside driven by deflation, Fed policy, and L2 activity. Despite risks of further volatility, BMNR offers speculative growth potential if Ethereum recovers, but is best suited for investors comfortable with high-risk assets. Investment Thesis Ever since my last thesis , Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) shares have dropped 41%. My “Hold” recommendation was based on wanting to open a buy position at more favorable prices. In spite of all the hype around this asset, in my opinion, it was still overbought. One month ago, I thought that BMNR's price of around $50 was too high and not suitable for long positions. At the moment of this analysis, the price of the asset is around $29, which, in my opinion, is more than enough of a correction to open the previously desired purchases. At the same time, I initially expected a potential corrective decline in BMNR to the price range of $31–39 per share. But due to the more aggressive continuation of the downward trend for Ethereum (ETH-USD) on the daily chart, correction turned out to be deeper. At this point, I see a number of fundamental factors that suggest a potential recovery in the value of the cryptocurrency. As such, now my previous recommendation of “Hold” has been revised to “Buy.” What is Bitmine and what makes it unique? I wouldn't call Bitmine a unique project because it is essentially a copy of MicroStrategy (MSTR). The major difference between them is that each of these organizations has chosen its own underlying asset, on which it acts as a treasury holder. In MSTR's case, it's Bitcoin (BTC-USD), and in BMNR's case, it's Ethereum. Although Bitmine's fundamental business idea copies MicroStrategy's basic principles, it does have a competitive advantage that sets it apart from other assets. It is not just a bet on Ethereum, which is a major altcoin in the cryptocurrency market, but using the proceeds to purchase digital tokens of its own shares rather than corporate bonds, like MSTR does. By doing so, BMNR (at least for now) eliminates the risk of debt and possible insolvency in the future, which could arise for MicroStrategy if it is unable to pay its debts to creditors (because if the value of Bitcoin falls sharply, this could lead to significant financial problems). Bitmine's Ethereum purchase process began on July 8, 2025, when it made its first purchase of 1.15 million digital tokens. At the time, the ETH-USD price was around $2,500 per coin. Chart of ETH purchases for Bitmine reserves The main goal of Bitmine in accumulating Ethereum is to achieve a 5% share of ownership of this digital token out of the total issuance. The total ETH issuance as of November 22, 2025, is 120.69 mln tokens. Thus, 5% of this amount will be 6.0345 mln digital tokens. As per Bitmine's latest press release , they hold about 3.63 mln Ethereum tokens. That is, the goal has been achieved at 3% of the total cryptocurrency circulation in the network. Since I last published, their stake has increased from 2.8%, which is a pretty good result for one month. If we assume that the company will increase its share by 0.2% every 30 calendar days, then overall, the company will achieve an additional 2.4% share over the course of the year. So, considering the current level of 3%, Bitmine has about 10 months left to reach its stated goal of 5%. But I think these estimates for when the goal will be reached are a bit too optimistic. After all, most of the Ethereum buying happened in the last month or so. I doubt it'll keep up like that. However, the value of the cryptocurrency is falling, and therefore its purchase will cost less. But these operations require an additional issue of shares. And as the value of ETH falls, the BMNR exchange rate falls even more sharply. For instance, over the last month, Ethereum has lost 24.29% of its value, whereas BMNR has lost 45.67%. So, a 1% drop in the market cap of the cryptocurrency means a 1.88% loss in the value of Bitmine. In the end, the extra BMNR shares bring in less money, which is distributed for buying ETH. Bitmine's first financial report and dividend payment What makes BMNR more unique compared to MSTR and other cryptocurrency treasury holders? It's that they were the first to announce dividend payments on their shares. Those payments will only be $0.01 per share, less than 0.4% in annual yield. Still, it is the first indication that treasury holders can pay dividends to their shareholders. To me, this decision is more of a marketing move aimed at highlighting Bitmine's uniqueness. But this is just my opinion, and it is not negative, but positive. I don't mind such decisions on the part of the company's management, as this will only add support to the potential growth of BMNR's market value. The company also shared its financial results. The net profit for the 2025 fiscal year was $328.1 mln, which equates to $13.39 per share. Also, Bitmine said that Ethereum staking will start in early 2026. According to my personal opinion, this will give the company a return on digital token staking of about 2-3% per annum. The more detailed financial results are shown below and are taken from the 10-K. Financial results of Bitmine Assessing Bitmine shares through the lens of Ethereum's growth prospects I think the main assessment of BMNR's prospects should be done by looking at Ethereum's price. As Bitmine is the world's largest treasury holder of ETH, the market trends in the cryptocurrency market affect its investment appeal. In order to evaluate BMNR shares, I propose looking at the Ethereum chart. Let's first determine the global trend for ETH using technical analysis of the 1W time frame. Technical analysis of the Ethereum chart on the weekly timeframe On the weekly chart, we can see that a global upward trend channel has formed. The lower boundary was temporarily broken during the collapse of Ethereum prices from March 2025 to May 2025, after which the rapid growth phase began. The bullish momentum was formed at the moment of testing the support level of $1,521. As a consequence, price growth allowed the asset to move towards the upper boundary of the upward trend channel, thus testing the strength of the historical maximum level of $4,868. On the 1D timeframe chart, the Ethereum price shows an acceleration of the downtrend, though it matches the bearish momentum on the weekly chart. The confirmation of the acceleration of the downtrend is that the asset has broken out of the initial downtrend channel by breaking through the lower boundary in the price area of $3,200. At this point, we have formed a new downtrend channel with an initial high of $4,755. If we believe these factors, the price of Ethereum may fall further. The price range ($2,111 - $2,463) is the target. This is formed by a cluster of liquidity in the form of equal lows ((EQL)) in the period May-June 2025. Technical analysis of the Ethereum chart on the daily timeframe Considering this situation based on technical analysis of the Ethereum chart, I suppose that there is still a possibility that the value of the digital token will reach the target range of $2,111–$2,463. Taking the current value of Ethereum at around $2,950, this potential decline could still be between 16.5% and 28.4%. Considering that a 1% decline in ETH over the past month represents a 1.88% loss in BMNR's market value, that could lead to a 31% to 53.4% loss in Bitmine's price. Regardless, I believe that BMNR can be purchased today, since there are a number of factors contributing to the potential recovery of Ethereum's price as early as December 2025. 3 reasons for Ethereum's growth I want to briefly go over the fundamental factors that could cause the value of cryptocurrency to rise over the next month. Firstly, there is the impact of the deflationary mechanism on Ethereum. The point is that today we are seeing increased activity in DeFi, NFT, and L2 settlement networks. On this basis, the commission burning mechanism makes ETH more deflationary, creating a supply shock against a backdrop of increasing institutional demand, thanks in part to Bitmine and its stakeholders, Tom Lee and Cathie Wood (who recently bought 181,774 BMNR shares as head of Ark Invest). Second, I expect that the so-called “Santa Claus rally” may affect the cryptocurrency market for the first time. This is because it has become more correlated with US stock market indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq). The traditional trends might add some pre-New Year optimism and, most importantly, the expectation that the Fed will keep easing its monetary policy. As Ethereum is a high-beta asset, it might show ahead-of-the-curve growth, allowing prices to recover. Additionally, the probability of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points at its meeting on December 10, 2025, is 67.3%, while a week earlier the probability was only 39.8%. Fed Rate Monitor Tool Thirdly, the Layer 2 ecosystem is currently reaching its peak in terms of transaction activity. Ethereum is the settlement layer and the foundation for the functioning of this entire ecosystem. The rise in Total Value Locked in L2 networks can be seen as a fundamentally positive factor, which strengthens trust in smart contracts and the value of ETH itself in the eyes of users and investors. Therefore, the potential growth of cryptocurrency in December 2025 may be caused by deflation observed during high network load. Activity Layer 2 Risks of the investment thesis If the above-mentioned fundamental factors do not cause Ethereum to grow in the short term until the end of 2025, I anticipate a potential continuation of the downward trend. This could cause prices to correct further downwards to a price range of $15.5–20 per share. This would be due to the completion of the downward trend for Ethereum on the daily chart and a price rebound from the $2,111–$2,463 range. Conclusion In summary, the results of my fundamental analysis of Bitmine shares allow me to assess them as an active with potential for price growth in the medium and long term. In spite of the existing risks due to the negative impact of Ethereum's price environment, I think there are at least three fundamental reasons why we can expect the value of this token to increase. It will be primarily caused by deflation observed during high network load. Besides, I'm expecting a positive impact from the Fed's decisions, where interest rates might be cut as early as the December meeting. Moreover, according to my calculations, a 1% recovery in ETH could mean a 1.88% increase in BMNR. In summary, my recommendation has been revised from “Hold” to “Buy.” P.S. Do not forget that investments in assets such as BMNR carry an increased risk of market volatility. That's why buying Bitmine shares is a speculative venture.

This strategic decision marks a pivotal moment for the blockchain project and its community, demonstrating a clear commitment to sustainable tokenomics. What Makes This Pibble Token Burn So Significant? The recent Pibble token burn represents the project’s 10th consecutive burn event, but this one stands out for several crucial reasons. Unlike many token burns that rely on arbitrary decisions, this massive reduction was funded entirely by actual revenue generated from Pibble’s ecosystem services. The company has created a transparent system where real-world usage directly fuels token scarcity. This approach creates a powerful economic model where: Service usage generates revenue Revenue funds token buybacks Buybacks lead to permanent token burns Reduced supply enhances token value How Does the Pibble Token Burn Strategy Work? Pibble has engineered a sophisticated deflationary mechanism that connects platform performance directly to token economics. The revenue streams funding these burns come from two primary sources: P.Pay payment processing and AICREDIT sales. Every transaction within these services contributes to the burn fund, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. The beauty of this Pibble token burn strategy lies in its transparency. Anyone can verify the burn transaction on Etherscan, providing complete visibility into the process. This openness builds trust and demonstrates Pibble’s commitment to its community promises. Why Should Investors Care About Token Burns? Token burns represent one of the most powerful tools in cryptocurrency economics. When executed properly, they create artificial scarcity in digital assets, much like central banks reducing money supply. However, the Pibble token burn approach differs significantly from traditional methods by being revenue-driven rather than arbitrary. The benefits of this strategic Pibble token burn include: Enhanced scarcity through reduced circulating supply Price stability through systematic supply reduction Community confidence through transparent, verifiable actions Sustainable growth through revenue-backed mechanisms What’s Next for Pibble’s Token Economics? Pibble has committed to continuing this revolutionary approach with quarterly, performance-based burns. This regular schedule creates predictable deflationary pressure while maintaining flexibility to scale with platform growth. The company’s long-term vision involves creating a virtuous cycle where increased platform adoption leads to more revenue, which fuels larger burns, ultimately benefiting all token holders. The future looks promising for the Pibble token burn strategy as the platform continues expanding its service offerings. Each new user and transaction contributes to the deflationary mechanism, creating organic growth aligned with token holder interests. Conclusion: A New Standard in Tokenomics The successful completion of this massive Pibble token burn establishes a new benchmark for responsible token management in the cryptocurrency industry. By linking real revenue to supply reduction, Pibble has created a sustainable model that benefits both the platform and its community. This approach demonstrates how blockchain projects can build long-term value through transparent, performance-driven economic policies. Frequently Asked Questions How many PIB tokens remain after this burn? The exact circulating supply changes with each burn event. However, this specific Pibble token burn removed 48 million tokens, significantly reducing the total available supply. Can I verify the burn transaction myself? Yes, Pibble provides complete transparency. You can view the burn transaction on Etherscan using the transaction hash provided in their official announcement. How often does Pibble conduct token burns? Pibble has committed to quarterly burns, but the size of each burn depends on platform revenue performance during that period. What services generate revenue for these burns? Currently, P.Pay payments and AICREDIT sales are the primary revenue sources funding the Pibble token burn program. How does this burn affect token value? By reducing circulating supply while maintaining demand, token burns typically create upward pressure on price through increased scarcity. Is this burn strategy sustainable long-term? Yes, because it’s funded by actual platform revenue rather than arbitrary decisions, the burn scale naturally adjusts with business performance.

This revolutionary possibility is now closer to reality in South Korea, where a groundbreaking proposal could transform how millions access cryptocurrency investments through spot crypto ETFs . What Does the New Spot Crypto ETFs Bill Actually Propose? Representative Park Sang-hyeok of the ruling Democratic Party has introduced the “Act on the Market and Industry of Digital Assets” in South Korea’s National Assembly. This legislation directly challenges the Financial Services Commission’s long-standing interpretation that virtual assets cannot serve as underlying assets for financial products. The bill includes a special provision explicitly defining digital assets as permissible underlying assets under the Capital Markets Act. This move represents a significant shift in regulatory thinking. For years, South Korean investors have faced limitations in accessing cryptocurrency through traditional financial channels. The proposed spot crypto ETFs would change this landscape dramatically. Why Are Spot Crypto ETFs Such a Big Deal for Investors? Spot crypto ETFs offer several compelling advantages that could revolutionize cryptocurrency investing: Regulated Access – Investors gain exposure through established financial institutions Enhanced Security – Reduced risks associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership Tax Efficiency – Potential for more straightforward tax reporting Mainstream Adoption – Bridges traditional finance with digital assets The introduction of spot crypto ETFs could potentially unlock billions in institutional and retail investment. Moreover, it positions South Korea as a forward-thinking regulator in the global digital asset space. What Challenges Does This Legislation Face? Despite the exciting possibilities, the path to approval faces several hurdles. The Financial Services Commission has maintained its conservative stance for years, citing concerns about market volatility and investor protection. Additionally, the bill must navigate complex parliamentary procedures and potential opposition from traditional financial sectors. However, the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies globally creates favorable conditions for change. The success of similar products in other markets provides valuable precedents that supporters can reference during legislative debates. How Could This Transform South Korea’s Crypto Landscape? The approval of spot crypto ETFs would represent a monumental shift in South Korea’s financial ecosystem. It would legitimize cryptocurrency as a recognized asset class and provide regulated avenues for both retail and institutional investors. This development could also stimulate innovation in related financial products and services. Furthermore, the inclusion of crypto derivatives in the proposal adds another layer of sophistication to the market. Derivatives would enable more advanced investment strategies and risk management tools, making the ecosystem more robust and attractive to professional investors. What’s Next for South Korea’s Crypto Regulation? The proposed legislation marks a crucial turning point in South Korea’s approach to digital assets. As the National Assembly considers the bill, market participants should monitor several key developments: Committee reviews and potential amendments Financial Services Commission’s official response Industry stakeholder consultations Potential implementation timeline The success of this initiative could inspire similar regulatory reforms across Asia, creating a more harmonized approach to spot crypto ETFs and digital asset regulation regionally. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot crypto ETFs? Spot crypto ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure without owning the underlying assets directly. How would this bill change current regulations? The bill would override the FSC’s interpretation that virtual assets cannot be underlying assets, explicitly permitting digital assets in financial products under the Capital Markets Act. When could spot crypto ETFs launch in South Korea? There’s no definite timeline yet. The bill must pass through parliamentary procedures and receive final approval, which could take several months. What other countries have approved spot crypto ETFs? Several countries including the United States, Canada, and Germany have approved various forms of cryptocurrency ETFs, providing precedents for South Korea. How would this affect ordinary investors? Ordinary investors would gain easier, regulated access to cryptocurrency investments through traditional brokerage accounts and financial institutions. What risks remain with spot crypto ETFs? While regulated, these products would still carry cryptocurrency market risks including volatility, though with enhanced investor protections.

This significant transaction represents one of the largest single movements by an early ETH investor in recent months, potentially signaling important market shifts. Why Is This ETH Investor Move So Significant? The recent activity from this particular ETH investor tells us several important stories about the current cryptocurrency landscape. First, the sheer scale of this deposit – 20,000 ETH valued at $58.14 million – demonstrates continued institutional interest in Ethereum. Moreover, this ETH investor hadn’t made any major moves for approximately eight months, making this transaction particularly noteworthy. What makes this ETH investor’s decision so interesting? The timing suggests potential strategic positioning. When an early participant in the Ethereum ecosystem makes such a substantial move, market watchers pay close attention. This ETH investor still maintains a significant position of 3,070 ETH worth $9.07 million, indicating they haven’t completely exited their Ethereum holdings. What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Future? The decision by this experienced ETH investor to utilize FalconX, an institutional-grade platform, speaks volumes about how cryptocurrency markets are maturing. Institutional platforms like FalconX offer: Enhanced security measures for large transactions Better liquidity for substantial positions Professional trading infrastructure Regulatory compliance frameworks This move by a prominent ETH investor could indicate growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects among sophisticated market participants. The choice of an institutional platform rather than a retail exchange suggests this ETH investor values the professional services and security that specialized platforms provide. How Should Retail Investors Interpret This Move? While retail investors shouldn’t blindly follow any single ETH investor’s moves, there are valuable lessons to learn. The careful approach taken by this ETH investor – maintaining a substantial remaining position while moving a large portion to an institutional platform – demonstrates prudent portfolio management. Key takeaways for observant market participants include: Large players continue to see value in Ethereum Institutional platforms are becoming preferred venues for major transactions Seasoned ETH investors often make strategic moves after extended holding periods Diversification and risk management remain crucial The Bigger Picture: Institutional Adoption Accelerates This transaction from an early ETH investor fits into a broader pattern of increasing institutional involvement in cryptocurrency markets. As more sophisticated players enter the space, we’re seeing: Larger transaction sizes becoming common Greater use of specialized institutional platforms More strategic, long-term positioning Enhanced market infrastructure development The actions of this ETH investor reflect how the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve from its early days toward greater maturity and institutional participation. Conclusion: Reading Between the Lines The substantial deposit by this early ETH investor represents more than just a single transaction – it’s a signal about market maturity and institutional confidence. While we can’t know the exact strategy behind this ETH investor’s decision, the move underscores Ethereum’s ongoing relevance in the digital asset space. As the market continues to develop, watching how experienced participants like this ETH investor manage their positions provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Frequently Asked Questions Why would an early ETH investor deposit to FalconX? Early ETH investors often use institutional platforms like FalconX for large transactions due to better security, liquidity, and professional services compared to retail exchanges. Does this mean the investor is selling their Ethereum? While deposits to trading platforms often precede sales, we can’t confirm this was a sale. The investor maintained a significant remaining position of 3,070 ETH. How significant is a $58 million Ethereum transaction? This represents a substantial movement, especially coming from an early participant who hadn’t made major moves in eight months, making it noteworthy for market observers. What does this tell us about institutional crypto adoption? It demonstrates growing institutional involvement and the increasing use of specialized platforms for large cryptocurrency transactions. Should retail investors follow this ETH investor’s move? While educational, retail investors should make decisions based on their own research and risk tolerance rather than following any single investor’s actions. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large transactions can cause short-term price volatility, but single transactions typically don’t determine long-term price trends. Found this analysis of the early ETH investor’s move insightful?

The call was issued on November 25, 2025, by Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham. This council seeks to strengthen the agency’s efforts as it assumes a more significant role in overseeing digital assets. The announcement followed Pham’s recent statement dated Tuesday, November 25, in which she expressed her openness to receiving nominations for the council. The deadline for these nominations is scheduled for December 8. The CFTC encourages public participation in shaping digital assets laws The CFTC has recently confirmed that it is prepared to assume additional responsibility in overseeing cryptocurrency . This is due to bills in both the House and Senate that would grant the federal regulatory agency more authority over digital assets. However, the agency did not disclose when these legislative changes will take place. This situation remains unclear, as progress has slowed and previous deadlines have been missed. Meanwhile, as individuals await the implementation of these new laws, reports from reliable sources indicate that the commission has initiated a “Crypto Sprint” to clarify regulations surrounding cryptocurrency. The CFTC is also planning to launch spot trading products that may include options allowing for leverage. In a statement, Pham emphasized that the CFTC must encourage public participation , backed by experienced industry leaders and forward-thinkers who play a significant role in shaping the future, to get started effectively. “That is why today I am calling upon CEOs to join us in shaping responsible regulations that will lay the foundation for America’s Golden Age of Innovation.” Pham’s announcement also outlined the steps for individuals to follow while sending in nominations, which were required to be emailed to CEOcouncil@cftc.gov. Notably, Pham is the only available commissioner at the CFTC at the moment. She stated that she will resign once a new chair is appointed. The Senate, on the other hand, is progressing with the US President Donald Trump’s selection, Michael Selig, to lead the federal agency and is currently awaiting a full vote from the Senate. The CFTC seeks to embrace leveraged spot crypto trading in the ecosystem Pham earlier confirmed that the CFTC was engaged in talks with regulated exchanges to begin spot crypto trading, including leveraged options, as soon as next month. This was after she shared an X post dated Sunday, November 9, saying “True” in response to reports that leaked leveraged spot crypto trading information. This move takes place, although a federal government shutdown slowed down other crypto policy efforts. Regarding this newly adapted crypto policy effort, reports from sources disclosed that Pham had been discussing with CFTC-regulated designated contract markets (DCMs) exchanges, which include major financial companies such as CME, Cboe Futures Exchange, and ICE Futures, as well as crypto-focused firms like Coinbase Derivatives and prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket US. At this point, the commission was considering launching spot crypto trading products that involve margin, leverage, and financing. Pham told reporters, “As we continue working with Congress to bring clear laws to these markets, we are also using our current powers to quickly implement recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets report.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",News|CFTC,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-26 01:37:59

For crypto enthusiasts, this marks a pivotal moment where established financial institutions embrace blockchain innovation. What is the KakaoBank stablecoin project all about? KakaoBank has transitioned from merely reviewing a won-denominated stablecoin to actively developing what insiders call Kakao Coin. This shift follows the recent legal clearance of Kakao founder Kim Beom-su, removing previous uncertainties. The KakaoBank stablecoin initiative now moves forward with full force, positioning the bank as a leader in South Korea’s digital currency evolution.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has surged past the $88,000 mark, currently trading at $88,017.48 on the Binance USDT market. This Bitcoin price surge represents one of the most impressive rallies in recent months, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Surge? Several key factors are contributing to this remarkable Bitcoin price surge. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate as major financial players increase their cryptocurrency exposure. Moreover, growing mainstream acceptance and positive regulatory developments have created a favorable environment for digital assets. The current market sentiment reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Market analysts point to increased trading volume and reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. This combination creates perfect conditions for sustained upward momentum. Additionally, global economic factors including inflation concerns and currency fluctuations are driving more investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Key Benefits of This Market Movement Increased investor confidence in cryptocurrency markets Enhanced liquidity across trading platforms Greater mainstream attention to digital assets Improved infrastructure development across the ecosystem What Challenges Should Investors Consider? While this Bitcoin price surge presents exciting opportunities, investors should remain cautious. Market volatility remains a significant factor, and price corrections can occur rapidly. Therefore, proper risk management strategies are essential for navigating these market conditions successfully. New investors should approach the market with realistic expectations and thorough research. Understanding market cycles and having a clear investment strategy can help mitigate potential risks. Remember that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent volatility, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Actionable Insights for Market Participants For those considering entering the market during this Bitcoin price surge, several strategies can help maximize opportunities while managing risk. Dollar-cost averaging remains one of the most effective approaches for long-term investors. This method involves investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, reducing the impact of short-term price fluctuations. Experienced traders might consider technical analysis tools to identify potential entry and exit points. However, always combine technical indicators with fundamental analysis for comprehensive market understanding. Setting clear profit targets and stop-loss levels can help protect your investment during periods of high volatility. Why This Bitcoin Price Surge Matters Long-Term This significant price movement extends beyond short-term gains. The sustained Bitcoin price surge demonstrates growing maturity in cryptocurrency markets and increasing recognition of Bitcoin’s store of value characteristics. Each new price milestone strengthens Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class within global financial markets. The current market conditions suggest that institutional interest continues to grow, with more traditional financial institutions exploring cryptocurrency offerings. This development could lead to increased market stability and broader adoption over time. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $88,000? Multiple factors contributed including increased institutional investment, positive regulatory developments, and growing mainstream adoption. Market sentiment shifted positively as more investors recognized Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at this price? While timing the market perfectly is challenging, many investors use dollar-cost averaging to enter positions gradually. Consider your investment horizon and risk tolerance before making decisions. How high could Bitcoin price go from here? Predicting exact price targets is difficult, but analysts monitor key resistance levels and market fundamentals. Always conduct your own research and consult financial advisors. What risks should I consider during price surges? High volatility, potential corrections, and regulatory changes represent significant risks. Ensure you only invest what you can afford to lose and maintain a diversified portfolio. Which platforms are best for trading Bitcoin? Reputable exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken offer secure trading environments. Always research platform security, fees, and regulatory compliance before choosing. How can I secure my Bitcoin investments? Use hardware wallets for long-term storage, enable two-factor authentication, and never share private keys. Security should always be your top priority.

Its unmatched network strength, fixed supply, and resilient global infrastructure continue to make it the benchmark against all digital assets. Unmatched Network Security Keeps Bitcoin In The Lead Bitcoin remains the largest and most secure store of value in the crypto ecosystem, with a market capitalization surpassing $1.7 trillion and increasingly unmatched institutional adoption. However, analyst Ted has noted on X that the BTC base layer was never built for decentralized finance (DeFi). Related Reading: Historic Downturn: Bitcoin Nears Worst Weekly Performance In Over A Year Most of BTC’s capital sits idle and is unable to support the complex financial applications. This is where the BTCFi emerges, and it’s rising because it activates this dormant capital without forcing users or liquidity away from BTC’s security. Ted highlighted that Arch Network is a utility layer that enables the development of expressive rush in smart contracts directly to BTC for high performance. It offers real-time state management, true interoperability, and fast parallel execution, while remaining fully aligned with the BTC UTXO model. This ensures that all settlements and final state changes remain anchored directly to BTC for maximum security. The applications on ArchVM generate Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs for each batch of transactions, and BTC nodes verify those proofs on-chain; a design that enables fast trading, money lending, credit markets, and real-world asset (RWA) applications with the L1-level trust. Furthermore, Ted describes the Arch Network as aiming to become a core piece of the infrastructure pillar for the emerging BTCFi ecosystem. Bitcoin Stabilizes As Market Volatility Cools Off The cryptocurrency market is now showing signs of stabilization, positioning Bitcoin for a potential resurgence. According to CryptosRus, last Friday, BTC appeared to have firmly bottomed just above the $82,000 level, a crucial development that analysts are pointing to as a potential renewed market strength. While the selling pressure is fading, these key developments could trigger a near-term bounce for BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Loses Strength, Traders Watch $90K as Last Line of Defense Swissblock outlines a sharp risk-off signal, suggesting that the worst phase of capitulation may be over. The market might still experience a second weaker wave of selling pressure, which would mark the exhaustion of any remaining sellers, and shift the market towards the bulls. Fed rate cuts are surging, as the December cut probability is climbing back to 70%, fueling optimism for liquidity support. Furthermore, liquidity injection is possible, and market analysts are highlighting that the actions from the Fed could expand reserves, which have historically proven to be bullish for the crypto market. With selling pressure easing and policy tailwinds building, BTC’s climb may continue signaling a potential recovery.

According to the group’s November 24 press release , the questionnaire has been sent to both federal and state hopefuls to capture where they stand on a range of policy questions. What The Survey Asks The list of topics is broad but simple. Candidates are being asked whether they support an individual’s right to hold digital assets, how they view banking access for digital currency firms, their stance on mining and related zoning rules, and what rules they would back for consumer protection and access. The survey also asks whether the candidate has ever bought, sold, or used bitcoin or blockchain tools. Reports have disclosed that the group expects to use those answers to build a public picture of each candidate’s views. https://t.co/kO5RWmSkc4 pic.twitter.com/5NDC1NKutX — Stand With Crypto (@standwithcrypto) November 24, 2025 SWC Says It Will Grade Candidates Based on responses, SWC will assign each politician a letter grade from A to F — where A signals strong support for crypto and F shows opposition. The group points to America’s more than 52 million crypto owners as the audience for those grades, and it says its own network includes more than 2.6 million registered advocates across all 50 states. Results are slated to be posted in early 2026, and the group says it will use the findings to guide its outreach and voter mobilization. How Industry Backing Shapes The Effort SWC was launched with backing from Coinbase, a detail covered in multiple reports. That link helps explain how the platform has grown quickly and why its ratings matter to industry groups and voters who follow crypto policy. Reports have pointed out that the tool has been used in recent cycles to highlight pro-crypto candidates and to channel grassroots energy into targeted races. What This Could Mean For Politics The move matters because it brings a large, organized voting bloc into play. With tens of millions of Americans holding crypto and a few million signed up with Stand With Crypto, candidates may feel pressure to state their positions clearly. At the same time, how much sway the group will have in close races is still unclear; the organization says it will focus on critical battleground contests and will tailor its outreach based on survey results.

U.S. Lawmakers Raise Eyebrows At Trump Crypto Ties News of Trump’s approval rating comes nearly two weeks after Trump officially signed a bill that formally ended the government shutdown after a stark 43 days. Per National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, an estimated 60,000 private sector employees lost their jobs as a consequence of the shutdown. The government shutdown marked the longest in U.S. history, second only to the 35-day shutdown during Trump’s first presidency in 2018-2019. Trump, who notably campaigned on making the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world, has seen both scrutiny and praise for his relationship with the crypto sector since returning to the Oval Office. Just last week, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Jack Reed (D-RI) pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for a probe into Trump-linked crypto platform World Liberty Financial’s alleged ties to illicit actors in North Korea and Russia. Per CNBC, the two senators cited a September 2025 report from nonprofit watchdog Accountable.US that claims “the Trump family crypto firm sold tokens to dozens of suspicious buyers who interacted with a large money-laundering platform, an Iranian crypto exchange, and even North Korean hackers. “Ultimately, the question remains—why did the Trump family crypto firm take money from people with open and obvious connections to enemies of the United States, and the network that enables those enemies and other criminals to launder billions of dollars?” the Accountable.US report reads.

Amundi, managing an astonishing €2.3 trillion in assets, just sold $135 million worth of Strategy stock according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. This dramatic move comes just weeks after the firm made headlines with a $400 million purchase of the same asset. Why Are Major Institutions Selling Strategy Stock? The timing of Amundi’s Strategy stock sale raises crucial questions about institutional confidence. The transaction occurred simultaneously with JPMorgan’s own $134 million Strategy stock divestment. More importantly, both sales coincided with breaking news that Strategy would not be included in the prestigious S&P 500 index. This coordinated institutional action suggests several possibilities: Portfolio rebalancing following the S&P 500 exclusion news Risk management in response to market uncertainty Strategic repositioning for upcoming quarter performance What Does This Mean for Strategy Stock Investors? For individual investors holding Strategy stock, these institutional moves provide valuable insights. Large asset managers like Amundi typically make decisions based on extensive research and risk assessment. Their sudden shift from buyer to seller within weeks indicates changing market dynamics that deserve attention. However, it’s crucial to remember that institutional trading doesn’t always predict retail outcomes. These massive positions require different management strategies than individual portfolios. The $135 million Strategy stock sale represents just a fraction of Amundi’s overall assets, suggesting this might be tactical rather than strategic. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The simultaneous Strategy stock sales by two financial giants signal potential headwinds for cryptocurrency investments. When institutions of this scale make coordinated moves, the market typically pays attention. The S&P 500 exclusion appears to be the triggering event, but underlying factors might include: Regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency assets Market volatility concerns in the current economic climate Institutional profit-taking after recent market movements What’s Next for Strategy Stock and Institutional Investment? Looking forward, the Strategy stock situation presents both challenges and opportunities. While the immediate news appears negative, institutional interest in cryptocurrency assets continues growing. The key question becomes whether this Strategy stock movement represents a temporary adjustment or a longer-term trend. Investors should monitor several indicators: Future institutional filings for Strategy stock positions Market reaction to the S&P 500 exclusion news Broader cryptocurrency market performance in coming weeks The Amundi Strategy stock sale, while significant, represents just one data point in the evolving institutional cryptocurrency story. As Europe’s largest asset manager, their actions carry weight, but the broader narrative of digital asset adoption continues unfolding. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Amundi sell $135 million in Strategy stock? Amundi likely sold due to Strategy’s exclusion from the S&P 500 index and potential portfolio rebalancing needs, though the firm hasn’t provided official commentary. Should I sell my Strategy stock following this news? Individual investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy rather than reacting to single institutional moves. How significant is a $135 million sale for Amundi? While substantial in absolute terms, this represents a small portion of Amundi’s €2.3 trillion assets under management. Will other institutions follow Amundi’s Strategy stock sale? Some institutions might reassess positions, but each firm makes independent decisions based on their investment criteria. What impact will this have on Strategy stock price? Large institutional sales can create temporary price pressure, but long-term value depends on broader market factors and company performance. Is this part of a larger trend in cryptocurrency investing? This appears specific to Strategy stock circumstances rather than indicating a broader institutional exit from cryptocurrency assets.

This bold decision represents one of the most significant institutional cryptocurrency adoptions we’ve seen this year. What does this Zcash-based financial strategy actually mean? Reliance Global Group made a decisive pivot by liquidating all their existing digital assets and converting the entire portfolio into ZEC. This Zcash-based financial strategy demonstrates remarkable confidence in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency. The company previously announced plans to purchase $120 million in cryptocurrency back in September, making this current move part of a larger strategic vision. This Zcash-based financial strategy isn’t just a simple portfolio adjustment. It represents a fundamental shift in how institutions view cryptocurrency investments. The move signals several important developments: Institutional confidence in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies Strategic consolidation rather than diversification Long-term commitment to specific blockchain technologies Pioneering approach to corporate treasury management Why would a public company choose this Zcash-based financial strategy? Public companies face unique challenges when adopting cryptocurrency strategies. Their decisions must satisfy shareholders, comply with regulations, and demonstrate clear business value. This Zcash-based financial strategy addresses several corporate needs simultaneously. The privacy features of Zcash provide transactional confidentiality that traditional cryptocurrencies lack. Moreover, the proven technology behind Zcash offers security assurances that institutional investors require. This Zcash-based financial strategy also positions Reliance as an innovator in the insurance technology space. How does this Zcash-based financial strategy impact the broader market? When a Nasdaq-listed company makes such a definitive move, the entire cryptocurrency market takes notice. This Zcash-based financial strategy could trigger similar actions from other institutional players. We’ve already seen increased interest in privacy coins following this announcement. The market implications extend beyond immediate price movements. This Zcash-based financial strategy validates the concept of corporate cryptocurrency adoption in several ways: Regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency in corporate finance Mainstream credibility for privacy-focused digital assets Strategic precedent for other public companies Market maturation through institutional participation What challenges come with implementing a Zcash-based financial strategy? While revolutionary, this approach isn’t without its hurdles. Companies adopting a Zcash-based financial strategy must navigate complex regulatory requirements and address shareholder concerns. The transparency expectations for public companies sometimes conflict with privacy coin characteristics. However, Reliance appears to have developed solutions for these challenges. Their Zcash-based financial strategy includes robust compliance measures and clear communication with stakeholders. The company’s experience in regulated industries like insurance likely provided valuable insights for this transition. Conclusion: The future of corporate cryptocurrency strategy Reliance Global Group’s decisive move establishes a powerful precedent for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This Zcash-based financial strategy demonstrates how public companies can thoughtfully integrate digital assets into their financial operations. The approach balances innovation with responsibility, showing other corporations a viable path forward. As more institutions observe the success of this Zcash-based financial strategy, we can expect similar adoptions across various industries. The era of corporate cryptocurrency investment has truly begun, and Reliance’s pioneering approach will likely inspire countless followers. Frequently Asked Questions What is Zcash and why did Reliance choose it? Zcash is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that offers selective transparency. Reliance likely chose it for its advanced privacy features and proven technology, which align with corporate security needs. How much ZEC did Reliance purchase? The exact transaction value wasn’t disclosed, but the company previously announced plans to purchase $120 million in cryptocurrency, suggesting a significant investment. Is this strategy legal for a public company? Yes, public companies can invest in cryptocurrency as long as they comply with SEC regulations and disclosure requirements, which Reliance appears to be following. What happens to Reliance’s other cryptocurrencies? The company sold all its existing digital assets to fund the ZEC purchase, making this a complete portfolio transformation. Could other companies follow this strategy? Absolutely. Reliance’s move could inspire other public companies to consider similar cryptocurrency strategies, particularly those valuing transactional privacy. How does this affect ZEC’s market position? This institutional adoption significantly boosts ZEC’s credibility and could increase mainstream acceptance of privacy coins.

Under the Satoshi white paper , he noted, BTC was meant to be “a peer-to-peer payment system” that removed the dependence of payment rails on banks. “By moving to a distributed ledger and a peer-to-peer system, we’d be able to get banks out of the system.” “That’s been a total failure,” he argued. “There are almost no real transactions that are occurring in Bitcoin. We have tons of transaction activity in speculative markets trading Bitcoin, but the actual quantity of retail transactions or peer-to-peer payments that occur over the Bitcoin network are remarkably small.” Green distinguished between emergency government “money printing” and day-to-day bank credit. “There’s money printing that comes from the government, in which they largely are trying to smooth over mistakes that have been made,” he said, describing stimulus as a way to “basically create a do-over by printing money.” More frequent, he added, is the expansion of money when banks lend: when a bank grants a $1,000 loan, “they simply created a new account for you called your checking account that has $1,000 in it… That expansion is totally normal and it has a credit function associated with it.” “Bitcoin destroys the ability to do that because it was intentionally designed to skip the banking system ,” Green contended. Rather than a full credit system, “it is effectively just a monetary system where what you’re really seeing is Bitcoin is effectively the tokens that are paid to the accounting firms that keep the blockchain in order… every Bitcoin that’s out there is basically a payment to Deloitte & Touche.” Why Bitcoin Is Supposedly A ‘Monopoly Game’ Because its supply is capped and banks cannot create new BTC via lending, “no new money can be created. There is no capacity for mistake forgiveness in that type of framework,” he said. That makes the system “very limiting. Interest rates and credit spreads are just too high for a real economy framework.” Despite dramatic price gains, he concluded, Bitcoin “hasn’t emerged as a payment system” or “in any meaningful economic context.” Green’s harshest criticism was distributional. “Because we have a finite quantity of it, ultimately, that means everybody who is born after the Bitcoin has been released finds themselves in deficit,” he said. He compared this to “a serf living off land in the 14th century that didn’t belong to you,” where “there was no other land that would ever become available to you.” That, he argued, “creates a deeply unequal society.” Although he said he “was an early adopter of Bitcoin” and initially thought it was “a really interesting idea” of private money, he now believes “if you run through the simulation, Bitcoin, because there is a finite quantity of tokens, means that it basically plays like a Monopoly game.” In that game, “you can’t add additional players as the game is being played… because they’re just going to lose very quickly. They don’t have any other properties. They don’t have any other money.” “How does every game of Monopoly end?” he asked. “Someone wins. With a single winner.” Mike Green ( @profplum99 ) embraced bitcoin early but now he doesn’t see it as an asset that democratizes wealth. He shared his latest thoughts on $BTC , and why it could end like a winner-take-all Monopoly game. pic.twitter.com/vIezLbNnuD — Phil Rosen (@philrosenn) November 24, 2025 “That’s exactly what we’ve seen within Bitcoin,” Green maintained, citing “increased concentration” and a Gini coefficient “beyond anything we’ve ever seen in the real world.” Instead of democratizing access, he argued, Bitcoin builds “a system that ultimately collapses upon itself and locks people out. Far from democratizing access, it does the exact opposite.” At press time, BTC traded at $87,589.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Michael Green,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-26 03:00:07

XRP Has Enjoyed A Sharp Rally Over The Last 24 Hours The cryptocurrency market as a whole has seen some recovery from the recent crash, but XRP has stood out for its particularly rapid growth. With a jump of 7% over the past day, the coin has managed to return to the $2.19 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $40,000? Signal Behind Past 60% Crashes Is Back The chart below shows how the recent performance of the asset has looked: XRP’s breakaway from the pack has come as Franklin Templeton and Grayscale have launched their exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The products, with tickers XRPZ and GXRP, are now live on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca. While the debut has brought with it fresh institutional attention on the cryptocurrency, a potentially bearish signal has been brewing in the background. XRP Open Interest RSI Has Reached The Sell Zone As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the XRP Open Interest Delta RSI has surged into the overheated territory recently. This indicator basically gauges the speed and magnitude of changes occurring in the asset’s Open Interest, a measure of the total amount of positions currently open on all derivatives exchanges. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in this metric over the past few weeks. From the graph, it’s visible that the XRP Open Interest Delta RSI has surged above 70 recently, indicating that investors have opened derivatives positions aggressively within a short window. The analyst calls it “a classic sign of speculative leverage.” The overall Open Interest is still notably down compared to the high earlier in the month, but the latest rapid uptick could be a signal to keep an eye on. In the chart, Maartunn has highlighted the previous instances of this pattern forming. It would appear that breaks from the indicator into this territory have often coincided with local tops. So far, since the latest sell signal has appeared in the metric, XRP has continued to go up, but it only remains to be seen whether the rally will be sustainable, or if derivatives overheating will prove an obstacle.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Asian markets opened stronger on Wednesday, with traders leaning back into risk assets as Bitcoin held near $87,000 and investors doubled down on the idea that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. Stocks across the region tracked Wall Street’s rebound. MSCI’s gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 1% in early trade, while Japan’s Nikkei jumped around 1.8%. US equity futures added to the upbeat tone with modest gains, building on the prior session’s climb. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $87,662, down 0.2% Ether : $2,954, up 1% XRP : $2.19, down 2.5% Total crypto market cap: $3.10 trillion, up 0.1% Softer US Data Fuels December Rate-Cut Bets The mood improved after a fresh batch of US data pointed to a cooling economy rather than a hard landing. Retail sales grew less than economists had expected and consumer confidence dropped sharply, especially in households’ short-term outlook. That combination helped reinforce the view that the Fed can start loosening policy without losing credibility on inflation. Fed funds futures now imply better than an 80% chance of a quarter-point cut at the meeting on Dec. 10, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, a sharp shift from roughly even odds a week earlier. 1/ Traders are piling into Fed funds futures. Almost 275,000 new positions added in just three sessions. Markets now pricing ~80% odds of a December rate cut. Three days ago it was 30%. A shift this violent usually means one thing: the market smells a pivot. pic.twitter.com/MdM7o1U205 — Agar Capital (@AgarCapital) November 25, 2025 The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note briefly slipped below 4% on Tuesday for the first time this month, then edged back above that line, reflecting renewed demand for duration as growth signals soften. Major Indices Recover As Investors Rotate Out Of Big Tech Wall Street had already started to stabilize. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched a third straight day of gains on Tuesday, clawing back part of this month’s earlier sell-off, even as heavyweight tech names such as Nvidia lagged and capped the Nasdaq’s advance. The blue-chip Dow led the major indices higher, helped by more cyclical names that tend to benefit from easier policy and stronger liquidity. That backdrop filtered directly into crypto. Bitcoin hovered just under $90,000 in Asian hours, steady rather than spectacular, yet comfortably off the lows reached during the recent shakeout. Bitcoin Faces December Lull As Traders Temper Expectations Koinly CEO Robin Singh said Bitcoin has been struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level for far longer than most market participants expected. With the market drifting toward its annual “Christmas hibernation,” the odds of any explosive price action before the New Year are shrinking fast, he said. “However, a decisive and unexpected reclaim above $90,000 in December would do wonders for market sentiment. It would soften the bears, and help keep 2026 clear of any early ‘crypto winter’ anxieties before they begin,” he added. “It is a possibility that the next few weeks are a lull, so whatever fireworks traders were hoping for may have to wait until 2026. Most Decembers we’ve seen in the past usually little movement for Bitcoin happens.” For now, the macro story is doing more of the work than any single crypto catalyst. Oil traders also took their cue from the shifting risk tone. Crude prices steadied in Asian dealings after sliding on Tuesday, when comments from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on a US-backed peace plan fuelled speculation that sanctions on Russian energy exports could eventually ease and bring more supply back to the market.

On November 25, these investment vehicles staged an impressive comeback, recording a total net inflow of $128.56 million. This positive shift comes just one day after experiencing net outflows, demonstrating the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. What Drove the Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The November 25 surge in spot Bitcoin ETFs tells a compelling story about investor confidence. BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with substantial inflows of $82.94 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC attracted an even more impressive $170 million. These massive inflows indicate growing institutional interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels. However, the picture wasn’t uniformly positive across all spot Bitcoin ETFs. Some funds experienced outflows that partially offset the overall gains. Understanding these market movements helps investors make informed decisions about their cryptocurrency strategies. Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs Faced Challenges? While some spot Bitcoin ETFs enjoyed significant inflows, others faced investor withdrawals. According to data from TraderT, Ark Invest’s ARKB recorded outflows of $75.92 million, and VanEck’s HODL saw $36.95 million in outflows. This mixed performance highlights several key factors: Market rotation between different spot Bitcoin ETF providers Investor preference for established financial giants Portfolio rebalancing activities among institutional players Competitive fee structures influencing fund selection Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Gaining Traction? Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a revolutionary way for traditional investors to access cryptocurrency markets. These funds hold actual Bitcoin rather than derivatives, providing direct exposure to price movements. The recent inflow surge suggests several advantages are resonating with investors: First, spot Bitcoin ETFs offer regulatory clarity and security that appeals to cautious investors. Second, they provide liquidity and ease of trading through conventional brokerage accounts. Third, the transparency of these funds builds trust in an often-misunderstood asset class. What Does This Mean for Future Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance? The November 25 rebound in spot Bitcoin ETF flows signals potential market optimism. When investors pour money into these funds, it typically indicates positive sentiment about Bitcoin’s future price direction. Moreover, consistent inflows can create a virtuous cycle by increasing demand for the underlying asset. Looking ahead, monitoring spot Bitcoin ETF flows provides valuable insights into institutional positioning. These funds serve as barometers for professional investor sentiment, making them crucial indicators for market analysts and individual traders alike. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency prices without directly buying or storing digital assets. Why did spot Bitcoin ETFs see net inflows on November 25? The $128.56 million net inflow resulted from strong investor interest in BlackRock and Fidelity products, outweighing outflows from other providers like Ark Invest and VanEck. How do spot Bitcoin ETF flows affect Bitcoin prices? Significant inflows typically increase demand for Bitcoin since fund providers must purchase the underlying asset, potentially supporting or driving up prices. Which spot Bitcoin ETF performed best on November 25? Fidelity’s FBTC attracted the largest inflow at $170 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $82.94 million. Are spot Bitcoin ETFs safe investments? While regulated, spot Bitcoin ETFs carry market risk similar to Bitcoin itself but offer the security of traditional financial infrastructure. Can individual investors buy spot Bitcoin ETFs? Yes, anyone with a brokerage account can purchase spot Bitcoin ETFs just like traditional stocks or ETFs.

54906605,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=223144,1764127812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Liquidations Crisis: Bitcoin and Ethereum Trigger $184M Market Shakeup,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-ethereum-crypto-liquidations/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations Crisis: Bitcoin and Ethereum Trigger $184M Market Shakeup The cryptocurrency market experienced a dramatic shakeup as forced crypto liquidations surged to $184 million within just 24 hours. This massive wave of liquidations primarily hit Bitcoin and Ethereum traders, sending shockwaves through the perpetual futures market. The scale of these crypto liquidations highlights the intense volatility that continues to characterize digital asset trading. What Triggered These Massive Crypto Liquidations? Market analysts point to several factors driving this liquidation event. Sudden price movements in major cryptocurrencies created a domino effect across leveraged positions. When prices move rapidly against traders’ positions, exchanges automatically close their leveraged trades to prevent further losses. This process, known as forced liquidation, amplifies market movements and creates additional selling pressure. The crypto liquidations breakdown reveals interesting patterns. Bitcoin accounted for $89.67 million in liquidations, with 58.47% being long positions. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw $61.36 million in liquidations, where 51.34% were long positions. Surprisingly, HYPE token experienced $33.52 million in liquidations, but with 97.93% being short positions. How Do Crypto Liquidations Impact Market Stability? Large-scale crypto liquidations create significant market turbulence. When exchanges force-close positions, they trigger additional selling or buying pressure. This cascade effect can: Accelerate price movements in either direction Increase market volatility substantially Create opportunities for contrarian traders Test market liquidity during stress periods These crypto liquidations serve as a stark reminder about risk management. Traders using high leverage face the highest exposure during such events. The recent crypto liquidations demonstrate how quickly market conditions can change. Understanding the Crypto Liquidations Breakdown The distribution of these crypto liquidations tells a compelling story. Bitcoin’s dominance in the liquidation figures reflects its central role in cryptocurrency markets. However, the mixed long-short ratio suggests balanced market sentiment before the move. Ethereum’s similar pattern indicates correlated market behavior. The HYPE token’s unusual 97.93% short liquidation ratio reveals a different dynamic entirely. This suggests most traders were betting against HYPE when it moved unexpectedly in their favor. Key Takeaways From Recent Crypto Liquidations Market participants should consider several crucial points from this event. First, proper position sizing remains essential in volatile markets. Second, diversification across different timeframes and strategies can mitigate liquidation risks. Third, monitoring overall market leverage provides valuable context for potential crypto liquidations. These crypto liquidations also highlight the importance of: Setting appropriate stop-loss orders Monitoring funding rates across exchanges Understanding liquidation price calculations Maintaining adequate margin buffers Navigating Future Crypto Liquidations Successfully Traders can implement several strategies to manage liquidation risks effectively. Using lower leverage reduces the probability of forced closures. Regularly monitoring positions and adjusting stop-loss levels based on market volatility also helps. Additionally, spreading exposure across different cryptocurrencies can prevent concentrated liquidation events. The recent $184 million crypto liquidations episode underscores the inherent risks in leveraged trading. While opportunities exist in volatile markets, understanding liquidation mechanics becomes crucial for long-term success. Market participants should approach leveraged positions with careful risk assessment and robust management strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when traders’ positions get automatically closed by exchanges due to insufficient margin. This happens when price movements go against leveraged positions beyond maintenance margin requirements. How can I avoid crypto liquidations? You can avoid crypto liquidations by using lower leverage, maintaining adequate margin buffers, setting stop-loss orders, and regularly monitoring your positions during volatile periods. Why do Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead liquidation events? Bitcoin and Ethereum typically lead liquidation events because they have the highest trading volumes and open interest in perpetual futures markets, making them more susceptible to large-scale liquidations. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when prices fall rapidly, forcing buyers to sell. Short liquidations occur when prices rise quickly, forcing sellers to buy back their positions. How do liquidations affect cryptocurrency prices? Liquidations can accelerate price movements by creating additional buying or selling pressure as exchanges automatically close positions, often leading to cascading effects in the market. Can liquidations create trading opportunities? Yes, experienced traders sometimes view large liquidation events as potential reversal points, as forced selling or buying can exhaust market moves and create contrarian opportunities.

The cryptocurrency community was recently buzzing with rumors that Donald Trump’s son predicted Ethereum would hit $8,000. However, these claims turned out to be completely false, and Eric Trump himself has stepped forward to set the record straight about this fabricated ETH price prediction. What Really Happened With the ETH Price Prediction? The controversy began when a social media account called ‘cryptogoos’ posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Eric Trump believed ETH would reach $8,000 within just 38 days. This specific ETH price prediction quickly gained traction across crypto forums and social media platforms. However, Eric Trump personally responded to the post, calling it “fake news nonsense” and clarifying that he never made such statements about any ETH price prediction. Why Do Fake Crypto Predictions Spread So Quickly? The cryptocurrency space is particularly vulnerable to misinformation for several reasons: High volatility creates excitement around price predictions Celebrity endorsements carry significant weight in crypto communities Social media algorithms prioritize engaging content regardless of accuracy Financial incentives drive some to spread false information This environment makes fabricated ETH price prediction stories particularly dangerous for investors who might make decisions based on false information. How to Verify Crypto News and ETH Price Predictions Before believing any ETH price prediction or cryptocurrency news, consider these verification steps: Check official sources and verified accounts Look for multiple independent confirmations Be skeptical of claims that seem too good to be true Verify the track record of the source making predictions In this case, Eric Trump’s direct denial on the same platform where the false ETH price prediction originated provided clear evidence that the story was fabricated. The Real Impact of False ETH Price Predictions Fake predictions can have serious consequences beyond just spreading misinformation. When influential figures are falsely associated with specific ETH price prediction claims, it can: Create artificial market movements Damage the credibility of legitimate analysts Cause financial losses for inexperienced investors Undermine trust in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem Eric Trump’s quick response helped minimize the potential damage from this particular false ETH price prediction. What Eric Trump Actually Said About Ethereum While denying the fabricated $8,000 ETH price prediction, Eric Trump did express some positive sentiment toward Ethereum. He mentioned that he would “like to see ETH reach that price” even though he never actually predicted it would happen. This distinction is crucial – having hopeful expectations is different from making a specific ETH price prediction with a timeline. Protecting Yourself From Fake Crypto News The Eric Trump ETH price prediction incident serves as an important reminder to always verify information before acting on it. Here are actionable steps you can take: Follow official accounts of public figures directly Use multiple reputable news sources for confirmation Be cautious of anonymous or unverified accounts Remember that even positive ETH price prediction claims need verification Frequently Asked Questions Did Eric Trump really predict ETH would reach $8,000? No, Eric Trump explicitly denied making any such ETH price prediction and called the claims “fake news nonsense.” Where did the false ETH price prediction originate? The false claim started with a post from the ‘cryptogoos’ account on X (formerly Twitter) and spread from there. How did Eric Trump respond to the fake prediction? He directly replied to the original post, denying the claims and asking the account to stop spreading misinformation. Why do people create fake crypto predictions? False predictions can generate engagement, influence markets, or damage reputations for various reasons. How can I verify cryptocurrency news? Always check official sources, look for multiple confirmations, and be skeptical of extraordinary claims. What should I do if I see suspicious crypto claims? Report misinformation to platforms, warn others, and share verified information from reliable sources.

According to Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategy at Bitwise, the traditional four-year crypto market cycle we’ve all grown accustomed to is being replaced by a faster two-year pattern. This fundamental shift in the crypto market cycle reflects how institutional involvement is reshaping everything we know about digital asset investing. What Exactly Is Changing in the Crypto Market Cycle? The classic four-year cycle, primarily driven by Bitcoin’s halving events, has dominated cryptocurrency behavior since Bitcoin’s inception. However, Park argues that institutional fund managers and ETF flows are creating a new, accelerated tempo. This evolution in the crypto market cycle means investors need to adapt their strategies accordingly. How Are Institutional Players Reshaping Market Patterns? Institutional involvement has introduced several key changes: Quarterly portfolio rebalancing by major funds ETF flow patterns creating predictable liquidity cycles Institutional risk management driving shorter-term cycles Regular reporting periods influencing investment decisions These factors combine to create a more frequent crypto market cycle that responds to traditional financial calendars rather than just Bitcoin’s programmed events. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Halving Events? While Bitcoin halvings still matter, their impact is now distributed across multiple shorter cycles. The halving’s supply shock gets absorbed and traded within the context of institutional portfolio strategies. Therefore, the crypto market cycle now reflects a blend of Bitcoin’s fundamental economics and traditional finance mechanics. How Can Investors Adapt to This New Reality? Successful navigation of the evolving crypto market cycle requires several adjustments: Monitor ETF flow data regularly Track institutional reporting calendars Adjust position sizing for more frequent cycles Combine technical and fundamental analysis Understanding these dynamics within the current crypto market cycle can provide significant advantages for both retail and institutional participants. What Are the Practical Implications of This Shift? The compressed crypto market cycle means opportunities and risks appear more frequently. Volatility patterns may change, and traditional seasonal trends might evolve. Most importantly, the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem must recalibrate its expectations about market timing and investment horizons. The transformation of the crypto market cycle from four years to two represents a maturation of the entire digital asset space. As institutions become permanent fixtures in cryptocurrency markets, their influence on market patterns will only grow stronger. This new crypto market cycle demands that investors stay informed, remain flexible, and continuously update their strategies to succeed in this rapidly evolving landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What evidence supports the 2-year cycle theory? Recent market data shows clearer patterns aligning with institutional reporting periods and ETF flow cycles rather than just Bitcoin halving events. Does this mean Bitcoin halvings no longer matter? Bitcoin halvings remain important, but their impact now interacts with institutional cycles, creating more complex market behavior. How should retail investors adjust their strategies? Retail investors should monitor institutional flow data and consider shorter rebalancing periods while maintaining long-term perspectives. Will this affect cryptocurrency volatility? Volatility patterns may become more predictable around institutional calendar events while maintaining overall market characteristics. Are other cryptocurrencies affected by this cycle shift? Yes, since Bitcoin dominates market sentiment, most major cryptocurrencies will experience similar cycle compression effects. How reliable is this new 2-year cycle pattern? While emerging data supports the pattern, cryptocurrency markets remain relatively young, and cycles may continue evolving. Found this analysis of the changing crypto market cycle insightful?

Howell’s starting point is his own definition of liquidity, which diverges sharply from textbook aggregates like M2. “This is the flow of money through global financial markets,” he said. It is not bank deposits in the real economy, but “money that is in the financial markets… it looks at the repo markets, it considers shadow banking,” and “pretty much begins where conventional M2 definitions end.” On his Global Liquidity Index, weekly global liquidity was under $100 trillion in 2010 and now sits “just under $200 trillion” – a doubling in a decade and a half. Howell Flags Liquidity Peak What matters most to him, however, is not the level but the momentum of that liquidity. Howell has identified a remarkably stable 65-month global liquidity cycle that he interprets as a debt-refinancing rhythm. Capital markets, he argues, are no longer primarily about funding new investment: “Something like 70 to 80% of transactions… are debt refinancing transactions. They’re not about raising new capital.” Related Reading: Crypto Crash Is A Forced Crypto Seller Unwind, Glassnode Co-Founders In that world, “debt needs liquidity for rollovers but actually liquidity needs debt,” because roughly three-quarters of global lending is now collateral-backed. The result, as he puts it bluntly, is that “ironically it’s old debt that finances new liquidity.” To capture the systemic tension, Howell tracks a debt-to-liquidity ratio for advanced economies: the total public and private debt stock divided by the pool of refinancing liquidity. The ratio averages about two times and tends to mean-revert. When it drops well below that level, liquidity is abundant and “you get asset bubbles.” When it rises significantly above, “you start to see a stretched debt-liquidity ratio and you get financing tensions or refinancing tensions and you can see those basically morph into financial crisis.” Right now, he says, “we’re transitioning, unfortunately, out of a period that I’ve labeled the everything bubble,” a phase where liquidity was abundant relative to debt after repeated rounds of QE and emergency support. The COVID era deepened that imbalance by encouraging borrowers to “term out” debt at near-zero rates. “A lot of the debt that then existed was refinanced back into the late 2020s at low interest rates,” he noted. That created a visible “debt maturity wall” later this decade: heavy refinancing needs now coming due into a much tighter funding environment. Shorter-term, Howell is focused on the interaction between Federal Reserve liquidity operations, the rebuilding of the US Treasury General Account and growing stress in repo markets. SOFR, which “you’d actually expect to trade below Fed funds” because it is collateralized, has repeatedly traded above its normal range. “We’ve started to see these repo spreads blow out,” he warned, adding that “it’s not really the extent of these spikes… it’s really the frequency that’s the most important factor.” If trade fails and leveraged positions begin to unwind, “it’s going to turn quite ugly and that could be the start of the end of the cycle.” Related Reading: Crypto Markets Underestimate A Trump-Style Flood Of Rate Cuts: Expert Inside his four liquidity regimes – rebound, calm, speculation and turbulence – Howell places the US firmly in “speculation,” with Europe and parts of Asia in “late calm.” Historically, early and mid-upswings favor equities and credit, peaks favor commodities and real assets, downswings favor cash and then long-duration government bonds. LIVE NOW – The Real Crypto Cycle: What Happens When Global Liquidity Peaks Global liquidity veteran Michael Howell (@crossbordercap) joins to map out the “master variable” driving asset price: A 65-month global liquidity and debt refinancing cycle that underpins booms, busts,… pic.twitter.com/Ryl3fqHoYR — Bankless (@Bankless) November 24, 2025 The Impact On The Crypto Market Crypto, in his work, straddles categories. “Crypto generally behaves a little bit like a tech stock and a little bit like a commodity,” he said. For Bitcoin specifically, “about 40–45% of the drivers… are global liquidity factors,” with most of the rest split between gold-like behavior and pure risk appetite. On the popular notion of a hardwired four-year Bitcoin halving cycle, Howell is unconvinced. “I don’t really see any evidence of that four-year cycle,” he said, arguing that the 65-month global liquidity/debt-refinancing cycle is the more robust driver. With that cycle projected to peak around now, crypto looks “late stage in the crypto cycle. So it could be over but it might not be.” The structural backdrop, in his view, is unambiguous: “The trend towards monetary inflation… is slated to continue for another two or three decades at least.” Against that, he argues, investors “have to have” monetary-inflation hedges: “It’s not Bitcoin or gold. [It’s] Bitcoin and gold.” Tactically, though, he is cautious. “We’ve not turned bearish risk-off yet, but we are not bullish short-term,” he said – and suggested that upcoming weakness in risk assets might be “a good time to pick up some more” of those long-term hedges. At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $2.96 trillion.

54907662,634201,1764129642,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54907662.jpeg,"China’s Bitcoin Hashrate Jumps To 14%, Securing 3rd Place Globally",https://bitcoinist.com/chinas-bitcoin-hashrate-jumps-to-14-securing-3rd-place-globally/,"China has quietly worked its way back into the top three global Bitcoin miners, holding about 14% of the network’s total computing power. Reports have disclosed that this share is roughly equal to 145 EH/s (exahashes per second), putting the country behind the United States and Russia in raw hashrate. The shift comes despite an official crackdown on mining that started in 2021, when many operations moved overseas. According to data from Hashrate Index and other tracking services, the rebound is real and measurable. Some mining activity now appears to be running in Xinjiang and Sichuan, where power costs can be low at certain times. Based on reports, operators are using a mix of legacy farms, small private setups and cloud-like arrangements that mask mining as other forms of compute work. Why Bitcoin Mining Returned To China Cheap electricity is one driver. Another is that factory and data center capacity can be reused without large new investments. Manufacturers that supply mining rigs also report stronger sales back home. Canaan, a maker of mining machines, has seen a pickup in Chinese demand. That suggests money is again flowing into hardware and setup, not just into restarting old machines. At the same time, revenue from mining has been under pressure. Hashprice — the estimated payout per unit of hashrate — fell to record lows this year as Bitcoin prices and fees weakened and mining difficulty rose. That decline puts strain on smaller players and makes efficiency and low-cost power more important than ever. What This Means For The Network A return of significant mining capacity to China raises two kinds of concern. One is over concentration: if too much hashrate clusters in particular regions or systems, the network’s geographic diversity shrinks. The other is enforcement uncertainty. Mining remains banned on paper in many parts of China, yet enforcement appears uneven. As a result, some operations run under the radar while others run in partnerships with local firms that provide energy and space. Publicly available maps track hashrate by country, but exact figures can shift fast. The best current snapshot points to China at 14% and about 145 EH/s of capacity, but those numbers will change as miners add or remove machines. The United States and Russia remain the largest hosts, and that fact does limit immediate systemic risk. What Analysts Are Watching Analysts will watch three things closely: whether Chinese authorities change enforcement, how hardware makers like Canaan perform in coming quarters, and whether hashprice recovers if Bitcoin’s price strengthens.

For the third consecutive day, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded substantial inflows, totaling $78.5 million on November 25 alone.

This healthy competition ensures that ETH ETFs continue evolving to meet investor needs. What Does the Future Hold for ETH ETFs? Looking ahead, the trajectory for ETH ETFs appears promising. Three consecutive days of substantial inflows suggest this isn’t a temporary phenomenon but rather the beginning of sustained institutional interest. As regulatory clarity improves and more investors understand the benefits of ETH ETFs, we can expect: Increased daily trading volumes More diverse ETH ETF products Potential approval of additional Ethereum-based financial products Greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency investments The current momentum in ETH ETFs represents a significant milestone for cryptocurrency adoption. It demonstrates that digital assets are becoming an integral part of diversified investment portfolios, with Ethereum leading the charge in the smart contract platform space. Frequently Asked Questions What are ETH ETFs?

The company’s latest acquisition of 28.5 BTC demonstrates a strategic commitment to cryptocurrency as a core asset class, bringing their total holdings to an impressive 228.5 BTC. Why Is Bitplanet’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy So Significant? Bitplanet’s consistent Bitcoin investment approach reflects a broader trend of traditional companies embracing digital assets. The company, formerly known as SGA, began its cryptocurrency journey after securing backing from Sora Ventures, a prominent crypto venture capital firm. This partnership has enabled Bitplanet to build a substantial Bitcoin position at an average purchase price of $91,335 per coin. The decision to increase their Bitcoin investment comes at a time when institutional adoption is accelerating globally. Many corporations now view Bitcoin as both a store of value and a strategic hedge against inflation. Bitplanet’s methodical accumulation strategy suggests they see long-term potential in the digital asset space. What Makes This Bitcoin Investment Different From Others? Bitplanet’s approach stands out for several key reasons: Transparent reporting through official channels Consistent accumulation rather than one-time purchases Strategic partnership with experienced crypto investors Public disclosure of average purchase prices This level of transparency is particularly important for publicly traded companies.

This Bitcoin investment appears strategically timed and carefully executed, suggesting sophisticated risk management practices. As more traditional companies observe Bitplanet’s success, we may see increased corporate adoption across various markets. What Challenges Do Corporate Bitcoin Investments Face? While Bitplanet’s Bitcoin investment strategy appears successful, corporate cryptocurrency adoption faces several hurdles: Regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions Volatility management requirements Secure storage solutions for digital assets Accounting and reporting complexities Despite these challenges, Bitplanet’s continued Bitcoin investment suggests they’ve developed effective solutions. Their partnership with Sora Ventures likely provides crucial expertise in navigating the crypto landscape safely and compliantly. Conclusion: The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Investment Bitplanet’s additional 28.5 BTC purchase represents more than just another corporate Bitcoin investment—it signals a fundamental shift in how traditional companies view digital assets.

Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Been Growing In Number Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the Supply Distribution of the key Bitcoin investors. The “ Supply Distribution ” is an indicator that tells us, among other things, the number of addresses that belong to a particular cohort. Investors are divided into these groups based on the amount of the asset that they are carrying in their balance. For example, the 1 to 10 coins cohort includes all wallets with at least 1 and at most 10 BTC. The Supply Distribution for this group would determine the total number of addresses on the network that fall inside the range. In the context of the current topic, the range of interest is the 100+ BTC one, equivalent to about $8.6 million at the current exchange rate. It includes two key investor cohorts known as the sharks and whales . The sharks and whales are entities that can carry some degree of influence on the blockchain due to their large holdings (with whales naturally being the more important of the two), so their behavior can often be worth keeping an eye on. Since the all-time high (ATH) in October, Bitcoin has been following a downtrend, and as the chart below shows, the sharks and whales initially reacted by exiting as their Supply Distribution registered a sharp drop. Interestingly, however, as Bitcoin’s decline has accelerated since November 11th, the Supply Distribution of the sharks and whales has witnessed a reversal. Today, there are 91 more investors of this size on the network compared to the low earlier in the month. This represents an increase of 0.47% for the metric, which, while not that high, is a sign that big money holders have been slowly coming back in to buy the crash. Santiment has also revealed that the smallest of investors on the network (holding less than 0.1 BTC or $8,700) have seen their population shrink at the same time as this growth in the sharks and whales. This trend could be a potential indication that the small hands have been capitulating after the bearish momentum, and large entities have been buying coins off them. “Retail capitulation will generally play out well for crypto prices in the long run,” explained the analytics firm. BTC Price Bitcoin displayed a brief recovery above $89,000 on Monday, but the coin has since retraced back to $87,000.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Capitulation|Bitcoin Retail|Bitcoin Sharks & Whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-26 05:00:22

The recent impulse off support is starting to hint at a potential macro shift, raising expectations for a breakout-driven continuation if buyers can maintain control. Building Toward A Truncated Low: Market Structure Turns Complicated Hov recently highlighted a key shift in XRP’s structure, revisiting the outlook from the previous analysis where a potential push lower was expected to complete a truncated low. Since that discussion, XRP has dipped further, printing a new low on the line chart compared to the wick from the liquidity sweep. However, the movement into that low hasn’t been straightforward, carrying a structure that appears more complex than initially projected. Related Reading: XRP Price Continues Lower as Sellers Tighten Grip on Intraday Structure At first glance, the drop appeared to be a simple three-wave corrective pattern. But on closer inspection, Hov noted that a valid expanding diagonal count is also emerging. Despite the unusual structure, the price action off the most recent low is showing signs of strength. XRP is now developing a clearer impulsive move upward, which could be the early stages of the momentum needed to set up the high-probability C/3 wave trade that has been anticipated. This early impulse doesn’t yet confirm a full trend reversal, but it does reflect a notable shift in market aggressiveness. For now, Hov maintains a bullish leaning toward this support zone holding. As long as buyers continue defending this area, the probability of the reversal scenario increases. XRP Breaks Key Retracement Level As RSI Signals Growing Strength According to the latest update from TARA, XRP has successfully tapped the 0.5 retracement level while showing impressive strength on the RSI. That reaction alone hints at growing momentum beneath the surface. A break above this zone would shift the focus toward the next major target at $2.30, aligning with the crucial 0.382 level. Reclaiming that area would serve as a strong signal that XRP may finally be carving out a true bottom. Related Reading: XRP Price Pulls Back Slightly — Market Still Poised for Fresh Advance Despite this promising setup, confirmation of a new trend is still missing. Momentum is building, and price action is becoming increasingly impulsive, exactly the type of behavior typically seen at the early stage of a macro Wave 3. Another key factor lies outside XRP’s chart entirely. BTC has just reached its resistance zone around $88,300 and has not yet gained the strength needed to break through. This moment of hesitation is important because Bitcoin’s next decision will heavily influence XRP’s short-term direction. The market is extremely close to confirming its next major leg, and all eyes remain on how these critical levels react in the coming sessions.

The dashboard in the video shows total cumulative net inflows into XRP spot ETFs at $422.66 million as of Nov 21. Canary Capital’s XRPC fund on NASDAQ reached $306.02 million in cumulative net inflows. Bitwise’s product on the NYSE recorded $116.63 million. Both funds are in their early stages, yet the figures show strong interest from traders. X Finance Bull celebrated the rising interest and demand for XRP-focused products. He also noted that Bitcoin has more than 10 ETF products while XRP had only 2 at the time of his analysis. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Increasing Interest in XRP Bitcoin is still the largest cryptocurrency market. However, the ETF outflows indicate a period where some investors choose to move capital elsewhere. Traders often watch these shifts because ETF flows show how institutions adjust positions as conditions change. X Finance Bull stated that this trend is “not a fluke.” He also wrote that it is a rotation toward assets tied to utility and compliance. The data in the video reinforces that the inflows are concentrated. Daily values show steady levels of interest in a narrow timeframe. What Comes Next for XRP? Other XRP ETFs have launched since X Finance Bull’s analysis. These have also received substantial attention from institutional investors. Such early demand may influence how future issuers gauge the appetite for similar products. New products expand access, widen liquidity, and give institutions more ways to build positions. X Finance Bull claimed that “the flows are coming,” suggesting that the early numbers represent the start of a larger trend. How this develops will depend on trading volume, new filings, and market conditions in the coming months. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

It appears that Solana (SOL), with its impressive network, has lagged behind other assets and has struggled with congestion and its prices to the point where investors seek alternative assets with more pressing catalysts. This kind of quest for “high pot” or growth prospects has ignited interest in presale projects that are well-grounded in fundamentals and have well-defined growth strategies. It is within this context that projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rank highest as far as recommendations for ‘what crypto to buy in the crypto market now’ are concerned. Solana’s Momentum Challenge Many investors are frustrated with Solana lately for failing to take full advantage of market rebounds. Despite its technology showing so much promise, certain factors seem to have impeded its success, including network stability and competition pressures. This has caused experts in the cryptosphere to suggest spreading investments into projects that involve lower overhead resistance and event-driven cycles for growth. The quest for the most ideal crypto to invest in has started to lean towards new cryptos like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in their last stages of presales, where entry points are tailored for optimal gain post-listing. A Presale Nearing Complete Allocation Mutuum Finance offers a very compelling reason for capital redefinition, as its presale has reached notable milestones that stress its ability to rank as one of the top cryptos to buy immediately. The project has managed to secure $19,000,000 and create a holder base of 18,200 investors. Phase 6 is Now Over 95% Sold out, where tokens are priced at $0.035 – which is last-chance buying to secure MUTM before its price increases to $0.040 in the next phase. With the launch price pegged at only $0.06 per token, this means that those who engage in its investment are guaranteed to gain well over 400% at current rates, something that has attracted experts and various investors trying to figure out what to buy for further growth. Stablecoin for Ecosystem Stability One important aspect that enhances Mutuum Finance’s position within the top cryptocurrencies to purchase is its upcoming development to include its own over-collateralized stable coin. This will be directly pegged to the United States dollar on a 1:1 ratio and can only be created by individuals that provide valid collateral within its borrowing marketplace. This enables a closed-loop environment that increases borrowing as well as contributes to protocols that enhance stability within its ecosystem. The token functionality within the dual lending markets facilitated by the stablecoin introduces a basic utility element which is expected to fuel future demand for the MUTM token, making it an advanced alternative for individuals considering the best crypto to invest in for 2025. Investor Confidence and Security In a marketplace where technological viability is so important, Mutuum Finance is working hard to secure its platform integrity with a full audit review by Halborn Security. This audit review for its core contracts related to borrowing and lending functions on its platform is important work that precedes its mainnet launch. This emphasis on security offers a sense of trust that is essential for luring hesitant capital, making MUTM stand out as a secure and well-organized project. For experts on cryptocurrencies advising on which ones to invest in, this attention to risk management minimizes risks exponentially in projects launched with no evaluation on this front. Capitalizing on a Calculated Opportunity The state of the market now offers a strategic play between persevering in holding underperforming large-scale assets or switching to projects with noticeable momentum and identifiable catalysts. Mutuum Finance is representative of the latter, its presale stage almost sold out, serving as its definitive catalyst for its next price movement.

Although it appears that the pending launch of 21Shares and Grayscale Doge ETFs can create a plausible reason for Dogecoin to reverse its slide, historical patterns suggest that launch events for alternative cryptocurrency ETFs haven’t always thwarted corrective selling. This volatility and reliance on speculative catalysts are also causing rapid rotation of capital into DeFi projects that possess better fundamentals, utility, and organized growth strategies. It is within this context that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly making its entry into the top cryptocurrencies for 2025 due to its fast-paced presale culmination and well-organized protocol design, thereby making it one of the foremost alternatives for massive profits. Presale Nearing a Crucial Sellout Point The presale event for Mutuum Finance is in sharp contrast to speculation regarding Dogecoin, as it showcases genuine demand via hard data. This project has managed to secure $19,000,000 with support from 18,200 investors, and its sixth presale phase priced at $0.035 is more than 95% subscribed, marking a limited opportunity prior to its approaching 20% surge to $0.040 in phase 7. This continually shrinking window of opportunity, together with its initial launch price of $0.06, translates to probable returns above 400% for existing investors. It is for this reason that most analysts are terming MUTM to be the next crypto to explode. Dynamic Leaderboard Fuels Engagement Apart from its attractive economic model, Mutuum Finance has managed to create a very active community via its innovative leaderboard program that lasts for 24 hours. This program injects healthy competition into its presale event by rewarding each day’s top contributor with a $500 MUTM bonus for transacting at least once within its designated UTC window. The leaderboard restarts every day at 00:00 UTC to promote continuous involvement and create a dynamic environment for interested individuals to engage with. This not only encourages individuals to display unending support to the project but also enhances its reputation for being one of the top cryptos to buy now for investors willing to grow financially and participate in an interactive investment experience. Unwavering Commitment to Security Trust being critically important to its operations in its line of business, Mutuum Finance openly enhances its roots by ensuring very firm security protocols. It is undergoing an audit by Halborn Security, a recognized company which painstakingly analyzes its primary loans and borrows contracts. This kind of preventive approach ensures that everything is in order on this platform prior to utilizing any funds from its users on mainnet, thereby giving investors great assurance. To those who are concerned about holes within other speculative assets, MUTM can therefore prove to be a very safe and reputable crypto investment platform within the rather volatile nature of the crypto environment. Seizing the Moment for Exponential Growth It has rarely been as apparent that meme markets operating out of panic and well-organized presales are worlds apart. As Dogecoin investors look to ETFs for salvation, investors in Mutuum Finance are taking advantage of a genuine opportunity. 95% sell-out in Phase 6 means it is the last chance to buy MUTM at its present price, which will soon become a milestone in history. For those interested in the next big thing in cryptocurrencies that are utilizing utility, security, and communal development, it is essential to act on investing in Mutuum Finance presales prior to the looming price rise.

These financial products have witnessed impressive appetite as they outperform leading Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. For instance, Solana’s exchange-traded funds have seen positive flows since their launch. Now, we’re talking about meme token ETFs. They are crucial as they introduce institutional-grade utility into cryptocurrencies that rely on hype. Grayscale’s GDOG went live early this week, on Monday, and has likely experienced significant demand. Within two days, Bitwise adds to the momentum with an announcement of the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF, set to start trading on November 26, 2025, according to today’s press release. The asset manager emphasized that community demand prompted the move, stating: We weren’t expecting to launch this product, but the DOGE community requested, nay demanded, this. Bitwise @BitwiseInvest · Follow Introducing the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. $BWOW starts trading tomorrow.We weren’t expecting to launch this product, but the $DOGE community requested, nay demanded, this.Dogecoin is:– Seventh-largest crypto asset by market weight (as of 11/25/25)– $22B market cap– $1B traded 4:34 AM · Nov 26, 2025 319 Reply Copy link Read 33 replies That means the BWOW launch isn’t coming after a long-term corporate plan. Instead, growing and persistent demand from the Dogecoin community fueled the ETF’s debut. An internet joke turns financial icon Meanwhile, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted Dogecoin’s unlikely growth in the financial space. The crypto began as a joke, and is now materializing into a legitimate financial product. Indeed, the DOGE team didn’t build a revolutionary instrument with a robust utility narrative. Dogecoin introduced a light-hearted dog to indicate that crypto should be free for all to participate and experiment. The altcoin rose against all odds, maintaining its market value and cultural relevance for nearly 13 years. Now, the DOGE “community that numbers in the millions” is demanding exposure to the meme token in an exchange-traded product model. Horsley said : Bitwise is launching BWOW because many DOGE holders, a community that numbers in the millions, want the benefit that comes from getting exposure to crypto in an ETP format, and we believe they should have it. Dogecoin’s rise into a respected financial product Despite its somewhat controversial origins, DOGE has grown into a noticeable asset. Dogecoin is the 9th largest digital token, boasting a market cap of $22.87 billion (CoinMarketCap data). Moreover, the $1 billion in daily traded volume signals massive trader interest in the original meme coin. BWOW’s trading details The Bitwise Dogecoin ETF starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. Notably, early adopters will enjoy zero fees for a month before the company shifts to a 0.34% management fee. The announcement clarified: The Bitwise Dogecoin ETF will trade on NYSE starting November 26, 2025, under the ticker BWOW. The management fee will be 0.34%, with the fee set at 0% for the first month on the first $500 million in assets. DOGE is trading at $0.1504 after shedding more than 5% of its value over the past week, influenced by broader market weakness.

The Australian dollar is rocketing higher after scorching inflation data, while the New Zealand dollar is surging following the RBNZ’s surprisingly hawkish stance. This perfect storm of central bank policy shifts is creating unprecedented opportunities for forex traders. Why are Asian currencies stabilizing amid Federal Reserve uncertainty? Asian currencies are finding solid footing as markets increasingly price in Federal Reserve rate cuts for 2024. The US dollar index has retreated from recent highs, providing relief to emerging market currencies across the region. Market pricing now suggests a 68% probability of Fed easing by March, with full percentage point of cuts anticipated by year-end. Australian dollar surges on unexpected inflation strength The Aussie dollar is leading the charge higher after Australia’s Consumer Price Index shocked markets with its resilience. Quarterly inflation printed at 1.2%, well above the 0.8% consensus forecast. This robust data has forced traders to reconsider their Reserve Bank of Australia rate cut expectations, with some analysts now predicting additional tightening. Currency Current Level Daily Change Key Driver AUD/USD 0.6580 +0.8% Hot CPI Data NZD/USD 0.6125 +1.2% RBNZ Hawkish Stance USD/JPY 147.80 -0.3% Fed Cut Expectations New Zealand dollar jumps after RBNZ policy surprise The Reserve Bank of New Zealand delivered a hawkish shock that sent the Kiwi dollar soaring. While holding rates steady at 5.5%, the central bank signaled that policy will need to remain restrictive for longer than markets anticipated. The RBNZ’s updated projections show inflation remaining above target through 2024, suggesting rate cuts are unlikely before late 2024. What does Federal Reserve policy mean for Asian currency traders? The evolving Federal Reserve outlook is creating both challenges and opportunities for Asian currency traders. Three key factors are driving market sentiment: Diverging central bank policies between the Fed and Asian central banks Shifting inflation dynamics across different economies Changing risk appetite as global growth concerns persist RBNZ policy shift creates new trading dynamics The Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s firm stance has fundamentally altered the interest rate differential landscape. With the RBNZ committed to fighting inflation while the Fed prepares to ease, the NZD/USD pair could see sustained strength. This policy divergence represents one of the clearest macro trades available in currency markets today. Actionable insights for navigating Asian currency volatility Traders should focus on three strategic approaches in current market conditions. First, monitor central bank communications for policy clues. Second, watch economic data releases for inflation surprises. Third, maintain flexible position sizing to manage elevated volatility. The combination of Federal Reserve uncertainty and regional policy divergence requires careful risk management. FAQs What is driving Australian dollar strength? The Australian dollar is strengthening due to surprisingly strong inflation data that has reduced expectations for near-term Reserve Bank of Australia rate cuts. How has RBNZ policy affected the New Zealand dollar? The Reserve Bank of New Zealand maintained a hawkish stance, signaling rates will stay higher for longer, which has boosted the New Zealand dollar significantly. What are current Federal Reserve rate cut expectations? Markets are pricing in approximately 125 basis points of Federal Reserve rate cuts for 2024, with the first cut expected around March. Which Asian currencies are most sensitive to Fed policy? Currencies like the Korean won, Indonesian rupiah, and Philippine peso typically show high sensitivity to Federal Reserve policy changes due to capital flow dynamics. How does US monetary policy impact emerging Asian markets? US monetary policy directly affects capital flows, risk appetite, and currency valuations across emerging Asian markets through interest rate differentials and dollar strength. The convergence of Federal Reserve easing expectations and hawkish Asian central bank stances has created a powerful rally in regional currencies. With the Australian dollar surging on inflation concerns and the New Zealand dollar jumping after RBNZ firmness, traders are navigating one of the most dynamic currency environments in recent memory. The key to success lies in understanding central bank divergence and positioning for sustained policy differences.

The effort comes as her likely successor, SEC official Michael Selig, awaits a Senate vote. In recent testimony, Selig placed a lot of emphasis on the need for stronger federal oversight of spot digital asset markets and a more diverse, fully staffed CFTC leadership. Pham Pushes New CEO Council Acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham opened nominations for CEOs to serve on a newly proposed “CEO Innovation Council.” The goal of this body will be to help shape future policy discussions, including those related to digital assets and prediction markets, as the agency prepares for an expanded mandate. In a notice that was published Tuesday, Pham invited submissions until Dec. 8. Pham framed the initiative as a continuation of the agency’s previous digital asset efforts, including its “Crypto Sprint” program, a dedicated industry forum, and its ongoing involvement in congressional work around a comprehensive market structure bill. According to her, the new council is intended to help the CFTC “hit the ground running” as it tackles an expanded mission, ensuring markets stay “vibrant and resilient” while still maintaining strong protections for participants. She explained that tapping experts and builders directly from the industry is very essential while the CFTC broadens its oversight of crypto markets and emerging prediction-market products. The timing of the council’s formation is still uncertain, especially given the CFTC’s unusual leadership vacuum. Pham has been serving as the sole commissioner for months, and her tenure may soon end. SEC official Michael Selig has been nominated to become the Senate-confirmed chair of the CFTC, and his appointment is expected to advance to a floor vote once lawmakers return to Washington, DC after the Thanksgiving recess. Selig’s recent testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee offered early clues to his potential regulatory philosophy. He told lawmakers it was “vitally important” to have a “cop on the beat” overseeing spot digital asset commodity markets, which suggests he is ready to form a clear, dedicated federal oversight of crypto trading activity. He also stressed that there is a need for “a diversity of viewpoints” in leadership, especially when considering that the CFTC has operated without additional commissioners and without further White House nominations from President Donald Trump.

What Does This Prediction Market Ruling Mean for Crypto? A federal court in Nevada has removed crucial protection for prediction market platforms, lifting the temporary injunction that Kalshi had previously secured. This decision empowers state regulators to take direct enforcement action against the platform. The ruling fundamentally challenges how prediction markets have operated under federal exemptions, creating immediate uncertainty for the entire sector. Why Nevada’s Prediction Market Crackdown Matters Nevada regulators initially issued a cease-and-desist letter to Kalshi in March, warning of both civil and criminal penalties. The state alleged multiple legal violations, particularly focusing on how these platforms handle sports-related contracts. The court’s latest decision validates Nevada’s position, suggesting that prediction market platforms cannot automatically claim federal protection from state oversight. The legal battle centers on a critical distinction: whether prediction market contracts qualify as swaps under the Commodity Exchange Act. The court determined they do not, meaning platforms like Kalshi lose their exemption from state regulation. This interpretation could affect every prediction market operating in the United States. How This Prediction Market Decision Changes Everything Previously, prediction market platforms registered as Designated Contract Markets (DCMs) enjoyed federal protection from state-level interference. This new ruling dismantles that protection, potentially exposing platforms to: Multiple state enforcement actions Varying regulatory requirements across jurisdictions Increased compliance costs Potential operational restrictions The decision creates immediate challenges for the prediction market industry, which must now navigate a patchwork of state regulations rather than relying on unified federal oversight. What’s Next for Prediction Market Platforms? This ruling represents a significant shift in how authorities view prediction markets. Platforms may need to reconsider their legal strategies and operational models. The case highlights growing regulatory scrutiny of decentralized finance platforms and their compliance with existing financial laws. For investors and users, this development signals increased regulatory attention on prediction markets. While the long-term implications remain uncertain, the immediate effect is clear: prediction markets face heightened legal risks and regulatory challenges. Prediction Market Future: Adaptation or Retreat? The Nevada court decision creates a precedent that other states might follow. Prediction market platforms must now assess whether to adapt their models to meet state requirements or reconsider their operations in certain jurisdictions. This regulatory shift could accelerate industry consolidation or prompt innovation in compliance solutions. Ultimately, this case demonstrates the ongoing tension between innovative financial technologies and established regulatory frameworks. As prediction markets continue evolving, so too will the legal landscape surrounding them. Frequently Asked Questions What is a prediction market? Prediction markets are platforms where users can trade contracts based on the outcomes of future events, from sports results to political elections. Why did Nevada target Kalshi? Nevada regulators alleged Kalshi violated state laws by offering contracts tied to sports events without proper authorization. How does this affect other prediction markets? The ruling sets a precedent that could enable other states to pursue similar enforcement actions against prediction market platforms. Can Kalshi appeal this decision? Yes, Kalshi can appeal the federal court’s decision to a higher court, potentially delaying final resolution of the case. What happens to existing users?

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors worldwide are asking one crucial question: What does the future hold for Ripple XRP? Our comprehensive XRP price prediction analysis examines the factors that could propel this digital asset to new heights by 2030. With regulatory clarity emerging and institutional adoption growing, understanding the potential trajectory of Ripple XRP becomes essential for every crypto portfolio strategy. What Factors Influence XRP Price Prediction? Several key elements shape our cryptocurrency forecast for XRP. Market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements all play critical roles in determining price movements. The ongoing SEC case resolution has created significant volatility, while partnerships with financial institutions continue to build fundamental value. Technical analysis patterns and trading volume also provide important indicators for our XRP 2025 projections and beyond. Ripple XRP Technical Analysis and Market Position Current market data reveals interesting patterns for this digital asset . XRP maintains its position among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, demonstrating resilience despite market fluctuations. The token’s utility in cross-border payments and banking solutions provides real-world use cases that differentiate it from purely speculative assets. Our analysis considers both short-term technical indicators and long-term fundamental strengths. Year Conservative Prediction Moderate Prediction Bullish Prediction 2025 $1.20 $2.50 $3.80 2027 $2.80 $4.20 $6.50 2030 $5.50 $8.75 $12.00 Can XRP Reach $5 by 2030? The $5 milestone represents a significant psychological barrier for XRP investors. Based on our XRP price prediction models, reaching this target requires specific market conditions: Clear regulatory framework establishment Increased institutional adoption in banking sector Growing cross-border payment volume Positive market sentiment across cryptocurrency space Successful implementation of RippleNet expansions Ripple XRP Challenges and Opportunities Every digital asset faces obstacles, and Ripple XRP is no exception. Regulatory uncertainty remains the primary challenge, while competition from other payment solutions creates market pressure. However, opportunities abound through banking partnerships and the growing demand for efficient international money transfers. Our cryptocurrency forecast accounts for both the risks and potential rewards. Actionable Insights for XRP Investors Successful investment in Ripple XRP requires strategic planning. Consider these approaches: Diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio Monitor regulatory developments closely Set realistic profit targets based on our XRP 2025 projections Use dollar-cost averaging to manage volatility Stay informed about Ripple partnership announcements Frequently Asked Questions What is Ripple’s current market position? Ripple Labs continues to expand its global footprint through partnerships with financial institutions. The company’s focus remains on improving cross-border payment efficiency using XRP as a bridge currency. How does regulatory news affect XRP price? Regulatory announcements, particularly from the Securities and Exchange Commission , create significant price volatility. Positive resolutions typically drive price increases, while uncertainty can cause temporary declines. What makes XRP different from other cryptocurrencies? XRP serves as both a digital payment protocol and cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin’s mining process, XRP uses a consensus mechanism that’s faster and more energy-efficient, making it suitable for financial institution use. Who are the key leaders at Ripple? Brad Garlinghouse serves as CEO, while Chris Larsen is the executive chairman. Both have been instrumental in shaping Ripple’s vision and global expansion strategy. Conclusion: The Future of Ripple XRP Our comprehensive analysis suggests that Ripple XRP possesses strong potential for growth through 2030. While the $5 target appears achievable within our projection timeline, investors should remain cautious and informed. The cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility requires careful risk management and continuous monitoring of market developments. The journey ahead for this promising digital asset promises to be both challenging and potentially rewarding for those who navigate it wisely.

As the cryptocurrency that started it all, Bitcoin continues to capture global attention with its volatile yet potentially rewarding price movements. This comprehensive Bitcoin price prediction analysis examines the factors that could drive BTC’s value in the coming years, helping you make informed investment decisions. What Drives Bitcoin Price Prediction Accuracy? Understanding Bitcoin’s price movements requires analyzing multiple fundamental factors. The BTC forecast depends on adoption rates, regulatory developments, technological upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Historical patterns suggest that Bitcoin tends to follow four-year cycles, often correlated with halving events that reduce mining rewards. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: The Post-Halving Effect Following the 2024 halving, 2025 could see significant price appreciation based on historical patterns. Our BTC forecast for 2025 considers several key factors: Institutional adoption continuing to accelerate Potential ETF approvals in additional markets Macroeconomic conditions influencing risk assets Technological improvements to the Bitcoin network Scenario 2025 Price Range Probability Conservative $80,000 – $120,000 30% Moderate $120,000 – $180,000 50% Bullish $180,000 – $250,000 20% BTC Forecast 2026-2027: The Consolidation Phase After potential 2025 peaks, 2026-2027 might represent a consolidation period. This cryptocurrency analysis suggests these years could see: Price stabilization as markets digest previous gains Increased regulatory clarity shaping long-term trends Growing mainstream acceptance as payment method Development of Layer 2 solutions enhancing utility Cryptocurrency Analysis: Long-Term Bitcoin Investment Potential A strategic Bitcoin investment approach requires understanding both opportunities and risks. The crypto market trends indicate several positive long-term drivers: Scarcity: Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist Global adoption: Increasing recognition as digital gold Institutional interest: Growing corporate and fund allocation Technological evolution: Ongoing network improvements Bitcoin Investment Strategies for 2025-2030 Successful Bitcoin investment requires careful planning. Consider these approaches based on your risk tolerance: Dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk Portfolio allocation based on personal risk profile Secure storage solutions for long-term holdings Regular portfolio rebalancing as conditions change Crypto Market Trends Shaping Bitcoin’s Future Several broader crypto market trends will influence Bitcoin’s trajectory through 2030: Central bank digital currency developments Traditional finance integration with cryptocurrency Environmental concerns and sustainable mining solutions Global economic conditions and inflation hedging demand Frequently Asked Questions What is the most reliable Bitcoin price prediction method? Most analysts combine technical analysis, fundamental factors, and on-chain metrics. No single method guarantees accuracy, but consensus among multiple approaches provides better insights. How does the Bitcoin halving affect price? Bitcoin halvings reduce mining rewards, decreasing new supply. Historically, this scarcity effect has preceded significant price increases, though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. What risks should Bitcoin investors consider? Key risks include regulatory changes, technological vulnerabilities, market volatility, and competition from other cryptocurrencies. Diversification and proper risk management are essential. How do institutional investors view Bitcoin? Institutions like MicroStrategy and Fidelity have shown growing interest, while figures like Cameron Winklevoss and Taylor Winklevoss have been long-term advocates. BlackRock ‘s ETF applications indicate increasing mainstream acceptance. Can Bitcoin reach $1 million by 2030? While some optimistic forecasts like those from Cathie Wood of ARK Invest suggest this possibility, most conservative analyses project more moderate growth. Such high targets would require massive global adoption and favorable regulatory environments. Conclusion: The Future of Bitcoin Looks Promising Our Bitcoin price prediction analysis suggests a generally positive outlook from 2025 through 2030, though with expected volatility along the way. The fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong, driven by its scarcity, growing adoption, and potential as a hedge against traditional financial system risks. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term trajectory appears favorable for patient investors who understand the technology and market dynamics.

The proposal presented before the Congress of Deputies this month suggests that gains from crypto assets, not considered as financial instruments, should be taxed under Personal Income Tax (IRPF) at the general rate. The general IRPF base is currently capped up to 47%, per Wolters Kluwer data . According to CriptoNoticias report , at present, crypto assets come under the savings base rates, taxed up to 30%. Besides, the group said that these gains should be taxed under the Corporate Income Tax at 30%. As the third amendment, the proposal suggests that the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) create a visual risk traffic light system for crypto. This will be displayed on investor platforms in Spain, evaluating official registration, supervision, backing and liquidity. Economist and tax advisor José Antonio Bravo Mateu said that these transposes “clearly go against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.” Further, the proposal includes all crypto within the scope of seizable assets, expanding the previous rule that applies only to assets under the EU MiCA framework. Lawyer Chris Carrascosa points out that this proposal is “unenforceable.” “If this is approved, it’s going to cause absolute chaos in the entire crypto tax regime in Spain,” she stressed.

En este caso las traigo aquí por dos motivos: … — Cris Carrascosa (@CarrascosaCris_) November 25, 2025 Spanish Lawmakers Demand Crypto Traffic Light Risk Warnings As reported by Cryptonews in July , a Spanish coalition of MPs demanded that the country’s financial top regulator mandate crypto to carry “traffic light” risk warnings. This system would help users to “clearly and visually” decide on the type of asset they are buying. The Sumar Parliamentary Group wanted to rename cryptos, including Bitcoin and Ethereum . Economist José Antonio called it “useless attacks against Bitcoin,” stressing that these are “resistant to political attacks.” “The only thing these measures achieve is that their holders residing in Spain think about fleeing when BTC rises so much that they no longer care what the politicians say,” he wrote on X. Crypto Tax Uncertainties in Spain In August, Spanish authorities taxed a crypto trader with €9 million for a transaction that generated no profit. According to the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT), a non-profit transaction is considered a capital gains event. The incident exposed crypto law and taxation flaws in the country. Legal experts and EU watchdogs warned that investors are left without fair protection in Spain. “Spanish tax legislation still lacks clear guidelines on how cryptocurrency holdings or tokenized assets should be taxed,” leading Spanish tax firm Lullius Partners noted at the time . “It remains difficult to determine when and under what conditions cryptocurrency transactions are considered taxable.” The post Spanish Parliamentary Group Proposes New Crypto Tax Bill Increasing Taxes on BTC, ETH appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|crypto tax|Spain,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-26 05:41:08

The partners plan to run LedgerX as an independent exchange through a new joint venture, with Robinhood as the controlling partner. Miami International Holdings will keep a strategic 10% stake. Financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed. LedgerX once sat inside the empire of collapsed crypto exchange FTX. Miami International acquired it out of FTX’s bankruptcy estate in 2023 for $50m and housed it under its umbrella. The new venture will now acquire MIAXdx, the LedgerX entity that carries approvals as a Designated Contract Market, Derivatives Clearing Organization and Swap Execution Facility, giving Robinhood and Susquehanna a ready-made regulatory platform. Robinhood is introducing a new futures and derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, deepening our investment in Prediction Markets and better positioning us to deliver innovative products to our customers. More in our newsroom: https://t.co/Hqv6EMXZiD pic.twitter.com/JXDkp3c2Tr — Robinhood (@RobinhoodApp) November 25, 2025 New Venue Targets Growing Appetite For Prediction Markets Robinhood said the deal will pave the way for a futures and derivatives exchange and clearinghouse built with prediction markets in mind. The exchange will serve Robinhood Derivatives and other futures commission merchants, and is expected to begin operations in 2026, opening a new institutional-grade venue for traders who want to bet on real-world events through crypto-style contracts. “Robinhood is seeing strong customer demand for prediction markets, and we’re excited to build on that momentum,” said JB Mackenzie, vice president and general manager of futures and international at Robinhood. “Our investment in infrastructure will position us to deliver an even better experience and more innovative products for customers.” Internally, prediction markets have already become one of Robinhood’s key growth engines. The company says that in the first year since launch, customers traded about 9b contracts across more than 1m accounts, turning event contracts into its fastest-growing product line by revenue and giving it confidence to invest in a dedicated exchange and clearing stack. Susquehanna Joins As Liquidity Anchor For New Prediction Venue Susquehanna, one of the largest proprietary trading and market-making firms in global derivatives, will join as a day-one liquidity provider. The joint venture plans to add more market makers over time, aiming to keep spreads tight and execution quality competitive for both Robinhood’s retail users and institutional clients that access the venue through other intermediaries. The deal lands as prediction markets move from niche crypto corners into mainstream finance in the US. Interest surged after a federal court threw out a Commodity Futures Trading Commission prohibition on election-betting last year, opening the door for regulated platforms to list contracts tied to politics and other real-world outcomes. Traditional market infrastructure is following the money. Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, agreed in October to invest up to $2b in Polymarket . Kalshi, another heavyweight in the sector, recently drew a valuation of about $11b in a fundraising round, according to a TechCrunch report, signalling strong investor appetite for event-driven trading venues. Tech Giants Bring Visibility To Crowd-Priced Event Markets Large derivatives exchanges are also circling the space. CME Group and Cboe have both outlined plans to enter prediction markets, betting that event contracts can sit alongside more established products such as equity index futures and listed options. Crypto-native institutions are positioning themselves as liquidity backbones for this new market structure. Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is in talks with Polymarket and Kalshi about acting as a market-maker, posting bids and offers that can deepen order books and make it easier for large traders to move in and out of positions tied to everything from elections to macroeconomic releases. Big technology platforms are adding another layer of visibility. Google Finance recently said it will begin showing live data from Polymarket and Kalshi , so users who ask about future events will be able to see how crowd odds are evolving in real time, alongside more traditional market data. For Robinhood and Susquehanna, the LedgerX deal offers a shortcut into this growing ecosystem, combining a crypto-savvy retail base, institutional market making and a fully licensed derivatives venue.

Priced at only $0.035 per token, very fast growth is already visible for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , and estimates see this newcomer for DeFi potentially growing by as much as 3,300% as its development and acceptance continue to gain traction at its present clip. It appears that with its DeFi-based borrowing platform, reward-oriented token, and presale that has already entered deeply into phase 6 and has seen overwhelming demand for its tokens, Mutuum Finance is poised to soon become the next big crypto within cryptocurrency as attention centers on projects bearing growth-oriented utility. Solana Falls into Danger Zone as Sellers Regain Control Solana’s SOL is seeing ever-stronger downward pressure as a consequence of bulls’ failure to hold above support at $126, paving the way for a likely decline to levels around $110-$95. The buying efforts are repeatedly thwarted by selling pressures, causing prices to predominantly exhibit bearish momentum. It is expected that Solana will need to breakthrough support at its 20-day EMA established at $150 to recover its bullish momentum, failing which it will continue to operate within a danger zone. As Solana struggles to find its footing again, traders are increasingly looking for alternative coins that can potentially match its prices, with attention shifting to Mutuum Finance’s DeFi crypto, MUTM. MUTM: Ready for a Solana-Like Breakout Currently at $0.035 per token, MUTM offers a growth opportunity comparable to that seen in Solana in 2021, rallying from $1.50 to $256, resulting in an astonishing return on investment of 17,100%. If MUTM token mimics this growth pattern, its new price could reach $6.00. To give you a perspective, with just $1,000 investment, you can acquire almost 28,571 tokens of MUTM, which can appreciate to $171,428, resulting in a profit of over $170,000. This kind of growth can only be expected in projects that provide dual lending services and are inclusive of DeFi crypto solutions, and that is exactly why MUTM offers tremendous growth potential as it has emerged as the next big crypto to watch in terms of growth and DeFi usage. Sepolia Testnet: Sneak Peek into Mutuum’s Lending One of the most important milestones for Mutuum Finance is the launch of V1 Protocol on Sepolia testnet, which is expected to happen in Q4 2025. This marks the inaugural deployment on a larger scale of its borrowing and lending mechanism for locking ETH or USD as collateral for borrowing. The testnet network also enables the development team to work on improving risk management services, perfecting dynamic interest rate functions, and simplifying procedures for borrowing on MUTM to ensure its safe and efficient deployment on its mainnet network. This stage paves the way for a successful launch on mainnet as the DeFi crypto token with practical usage and bright prospects for growth. The contracts for borrowing and lending on Mutuum Finance are also undergoing an extensive audit by Halborn Security . This audit assessment evaluates finalized codes to ensure correct functionality, secure user assets, and validate overall system integrity. Updates on its progress will also be provided, and finally, when Sepolia Testnet is ready, they will announce its schedule. This will also enhance its credibility and cement its status as the next big crypto within DeFi as a secure and useful cryptocurrency. MUTM Poised to Surge Past Solana with Explosive Initial Growth Mutuum Finance is on its way to becoming one of the most promising DeFi crypto tokens in 2025. Currently priced at $0.035 and well into presale phase 6, MUTM has piqued investors’ attention everywhere and has every potential to skyrocket by a whopping 3,300% or more based on its ability to grow its ecosystem. The launch of its Sepolia testnet, coupled with its comprehensive independent security audit and DeFi platform centered around dual lending, proves that MUTM has actual usage and long-term viability in store for investors. It is only now that niche investors gain the opportunity to get on board on tokens prior to phase 7, where prices are expected to soar as the next big crypto.

54912312,634364,1764136807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54912312.jpeg,Could Jack Dorsey Be The Face Behind Bitcoin? Analysts Uncover New Evidence,https://bitcoinist.com/could-jack-dorsey-be-behind-bitcoin-evidence/,"Amid ongoing speculation regarding the true identity of Bitcoin’s (BTC) creator, new analysis suggests that Jack Dorsey, the entrepreneur known for founding Twitter and currently serving as the CEO of Block, could potentially be Satoshi Nakamoto. Surprising Links Between Jack Dorsey And Bitcoin’s Satoshi During Square’s investor day last week, Dorsey was directly questioned about his possible connection to Satoshi. Jeff Cantwell, an analyst at Seaport Research, posed the pointed inquiry: “Jack, this probably is the most important question you’ll ever get asked from the sell side — are you Satoshi Nakamoto?” In response, Dorsey remarked that the identity of Satoshi has become irrelevant, emphasizing that Bitcoin is now an open protocol managed by a community. He added, “If it was important to Satoshi, there is a simple way they can prove who they are, so we’ll wait for that day.” This response prompted analysts from Baird to investigate potential coincidences linking Dorsey to Satoshi. They discovered several notable parallels. For instance, the first post on the BitcoinTalk forum by Satoshi was made on November 19, which also happens to be Dorsey’s birthday and coincided with the date of Block’s investor day. Block’s CFO, Amrita Ahuja, noted, “He may or may not be Satoshi, but it is his birthday today.” Furthermore, the Baird team identified important early Bitcoin milestones that align with the birthdays of Dorsey’s parents. They pointed out that Dorsey was involved in the “cypherpunk” mailing list as early as 1996 and possesses programming skills in C and Python, languages featured in the initial Bitcoin codebase. Additionally, an early Bitcoin address reportedly includes a sequence, “jD2m,” which some interpret as “Jack Dorsey 2 Mint,” referencing Mint Plaza, where he lived. Mining Patterns And IP Address The analysts also observed a notable change in Satoshi’s mining patterns that allegedly coincided with Dorsey founding Block in February 2009. They highlighted that he visited Iraq with the State Department in April of that same year. Reports indicate that in early 2009, Satoshi inadvertently logged into an Internet Relay Chat using an IP address linked to California during a period when Dorsey resided in the Bay Area. An essential aspect of this speculation centers around Satoshi’s wallet containing approximately 1 million Bitcoin, which have remained untouched since their mining. This fact aligns with Dorsey’s previous assertion that the mystery surrounding Satoshi’s identity could be resolved quite simply. Forbes estimates Dorsey’s wealth at around $4.7 billion, suggesting he has no need to access those long-dormant holdings, currently worth about $87 billion. NewsBTC reported on Monday that Satoshi’s assets are now estimated to be valued at nearly $96 billion, positioning this mysterious figure just below US billionaire Bill Gates, who is estimated to have a net worth of about $104 billion. The quest to unveil Satoshi’s identity has led to a variety of candidates, including the late software engineer Hal Finney, systems engineer Dorian Nakamoto, computer scientist Nick Szabo, and Hashcash inventor Adam Back. In 2016, Australian cryptographer Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi but failed to provide compelling evidence, leaving many skeptical of his assertions. A British High Court ruling last year further undermined Wright’s claims. BTC is currently trading at $86,540, down more than 31% from its all-time high reached back in October and more than 8% year-to-date (YTD).

This announcement comes after persistent community feedback requesting the change, creating significant buzz throughout the cryptocurrency space. Why is the POL token ticker reconsideration happening now? Sandeep Nailwal recently revealed that he’s reviewing community sentiment regarding the POL token ticker. While he initially supported maintaining the current POL designation, continuous user requests have prompted this reevaluation. The migration from MATIC to POL occurred some time ago, yet community members continue to express strong preferences for the original ticker. Nailwal’s current position favors keeping the POL token ticker, but he acknowledges the ongoing feedback deserves serious consideration. This demonstrates Polygon’s commitment to community-driven decision making in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. What factors influence the POL token ticker decision? Several key considerations will shape the final decision about the POL token ticker: Brand recognition – MATIC has established significant market presence Community preference – User sentiment strongly favors the original name Technical implications – Potential impacts on exchanges and wallets Market confusion – Avoiding disruption for current holders The discussion around the POL token ticker highlights how blockchain projects must balance technical progress with community expectations. This situation shows that even established changes can be revisited when user feedback remains consistent. How might the POL token ticker reversal affect investors? Investors and token holders should understand several potential outcomes if the POL token ticker reverts to MATIC. First, market recognition could improve immediately since MATIC remains familiar to many traders. However, temporary confusion might occur during the transition period. Exchange listings and trading pairs would need updates, though the underlying token functionality remains unchanged. The POL token ticker discussion ultimately reflects Polygon’s responsive approach to community input, which many consider positive for long-term project health. What’s next for the POL token ticker debate? Nailwal has suggested opening formal discussions about the POL token ticker, indicating this isn’t merely theoretical consideration. The Polygon team appears genuinely curious about gathering comprehensive user opinions before making any final determination. This transparent approach sets a valuable precedent for other blockchain projects facing similar decisions. The POL token ticker situation demonstrates that successful projects listen to their communities while maintaining strategic direction. Conclusion: Community Voice Shapes Blockchain Evolution The potential reversal of the POL token ticker to MATIC represents more than just a name change. It signifies how community feedback can influence even established decisions in the decentralized space. Polygon’s willingness to reconsider demonstrates authentic commitment to user-driven development. Whether the POL token ticker ultimately changes or remains, this episode reinforces that successful blockchain projects maintain open communication channels with their communities. The final decision will likely balance technical considerations with the clear user preference for the MATIC designation. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Polygon change from MATIC to POL originally? The transition from MATIC to POL was part of Polygon’s broader ecosystem upgrade and rebranding strategy to reflect the project’s expanded vision beyond just the Matic Network. Will my tokens be affected if the ticker changes back? Your actual tokens and their value won’t change – only the displayed ticker symbol would revert from POL to MATIC on exchanges and tracking platforms. How can community members share their opinions? Polygon typically gathers feedback through official social media channels, governance forums, and community discussion platforms where users can voice their preferences. When will the final decision be made? No specific timeline has been announced, but the co-founder’s comments suggest the discussion will proceed with deliberate consideration of all community input. Has any other major cryptocurrency reversed a ticker change? While uncommon, some projects have adjusted tickers based on community feedback, though most stick with their initial post-migration decisions. What happens to existing POL trading pairs? If the change occurs, exchanges would gradually update their trading pairs from POL to MATIC, ensuring minimal disruption to trading activities. Found this analysis helpful?

Key On-Chain Data Signals Potential Rebound Ahead,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/has-the-bitcoin-price-hit-its-bottom-key-on-chain-data-signals-potential-rebound-ahead/,"Following a significant downturn that saw Bitcoin (BTC) plunge to the $80,000 mark on November 21, the leading cryptocurrency has managed to stabilize above this critical threshold for several days. This development has sparked speculation about whether this level represents a short-term bottom and if a new upward trend might follow. Potential Local Bottom For Bitcoin According to analysis from CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Aleman, on-chain data indicates a market landscape characterized by institutional redistribution, structural weakness, and signs of a rebound that may hint at a local bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Less Than 50% Chance Of Hitting $100,000 By December 31, Says AI Model One of the observations made is that large whale investors have been actively distributing their holdings. The cohorts holding more than 10,000 BTC and those with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC appear to be primarily in a selling position. Carmelo stated that this kind of behavior reflects ongoing profit-taking by institutions looking to reduce their risk exposure, which leads to an overall offloading of supply into the market. Retail investors have also been contributing to the distribution trend. Over the past 60 days, wallets holding between 0 to 1 BTC and 1 to 10 BTC have demonstrated net selling rather than accumulation, suggesting a lack of purchasing support from the retail sector. In contrast, mid-sized BTC holders—those in the 100 to 1,000 BTC range—appear to be acquiring steadily, while the 10 to 100 BTC group is showing consistent accumulation. Hidden Bullish Divergence After this 11-day selling spree, signs of stabilization have emerged. Bitcoin has rebounded above $89,000 on late Monday, which may suggest the formation of a local bottom, although this has yet to be conclusively confirmed. However, while momentum is positive, Aleman warned that the possibility of a trend reversal is heavily reliant on ongoing accumulation from crucial investor cohorts, notably mid-sized investors. While there are obvious rebounds and support from particular groups, the continued distribution of the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC cohort prevents definitive confirmation of a trend reversal. Related Reading: Latest Crypto Crash Wipes $1 Billion Off Trump Family’s Wealth Other analysts, including Ash Crypto, have noted bullish indicators that further support this outlook. He highlighted that Bitcoin is experiencing a hidden bullish divergence on the weekly timeframe, suggesting that selling pressure is easing, momentum is stabilizing, and the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) may soon reverse. If this hidden bullish divergence is confirmed, it typically precedes a strong continuation rally, according to the analyst, adding to the argument that BTC may be on the verge of a new upward trajectory. Bitcoin is currently trading at $87,150, 30% below its all-time high of $126,000. This momentum has caused the top cryptocurrency to erase all gains recorded in all time frames, including year-to-date, with a drop of roughly 9% during this period.

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-about-to-go-parabolic-heres-the-signal/,"Amonyx (@amonbuy), a well-known cryptocurrency expert, recently posted a strong message about XRP that immediately caught the attention of many. He wrote “XRP is about to go PARABOLIC!” and shared a detailed monthly chart of the asset. The post did not rely only on hype; it focused on a technical structure that developed over many years. A Breakout Follows Years of Tight Trading The chart displays a long, symmetrical triangle that began after the 2018 peak. XRP moved inside that structure for years. Buyers held steady. Sellers failed to push the price below support levels. The market formed higher lows. The range tightened as time passed. However, XRP’s breakout in late 2024 pushed it above this multi-year triangle . The current monthly candle sits above the upper trend line. That position matters because it confirms strength. While XRP has experienced a breakout, a closer look at the chart suggests that its rise is not over yet. #XRP is about to go PARABOLIC ! It's About To Get WILD. pic.twitter.com/G4PfJdy9hi — Amonyx (@amonbuy) November 24, 2025 Historical Patterns Shape Market Expectations Amonyx included an earlier pattern from the last cycle. XRP also formed a symmetrical triangle. XRP broke out of that pattern in 2017 and climbed sharply. The new triangle looks larger but similar in structure. Many analysts study repeating formations. They believe similar conditions can produce similar outcomes. If XRP repeats this historical performance , the chart points toward a price target above $10. Amonyx did not assign a date to that target. The monthly timeframe suggests a long buildup. The comparison between the two triangles now drives interest, as traders know the market often reacts in stages. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The lower section of the chart shows the monthly RSI. It sits above the midpoint. It is climbing at a steady pace. The indicator held similar positions during earlier rallies. That trend supports the bullish case. The moving averages are also bullish, and that alignment reflects strength in buyer activity. Market Focus Turns Toward Upcoming Closes Market participants want to see consistent engagement and more monthly confirmations. Traders want XRP to hold above the breakout zone. Despite its recent struggles , it still holds key support levels. Major investors are now tracking monthly candles for clear signals. A strong close could build confidence. A weak close could delay progress. All eyes are now on XRP, and the next few months will show which side gains control.

The data showed that bad actors began publicly selling tokens during the chain’s first period of liquidity and onboarding. The illegal activity on the Monad network also began within a day of the MON token’s airdrop on Tuesday. The CTO and co-founder James Hunsaker first spotted and reported the spoofing to its users. Monad’s CTO claims the fake ERC-20 transfers were not from his wallet warning – there are fake ERC-20 transfers pretending to be from my wallet https://t.co/TCZTfDfoTQ example: https://t.co/wA1I8RFTdQ you can see the txs are not sent by me ERC-20 is just a token interface standard, it's easy to write a smart contract that meets that standard… — James (mainnet arc) (@_jhunsaker) November 25, 2025 Hunsaker noted early Wednesday that the movement of funds appeared as normal MON transfers on blockchain explorers. He also discovered that there were transactions from the wallets being impersonated at the time. Hunsaker warned earlier today that fake ERC-20 transfers were pretending to be from his wallet, citing a Monad user who alerted him of the transactions. The firm’s official confirmed that it was not a bug, but rather a spoofing attempt within their smart contract to try to trick people. “ERC-20 is just a token interface standard; it’s easy to write a smart contract that meets that standard, but can have address entries which are not authorized by the owner.” – James Hunsaker , Co-Founder and CTO of Monad. According to Hunsaker, Monad’s blockchain allows bad contracts to imitate legitimate transactions even when no wallet approval occurred. He cautioned Monad users to be cautious of malicious activity on Monad’s blockchain. Hunsaker also revealed one wallet that had made a flurry of transactions on the network, and confirmed that he did not send the transactions. He noted that the spoofing attempts mirrored similar patterns seen in EVM-based chains. Monad’s co-founder admitted that attackers usually deploy contracts and send out events that impersonate real token transactions, even when there were no token transfers and no wallet approvals. Such a set of transfers is displayed as regular activity, which often tends to mislead users who are checking wallet history. On-chain data revealed illegitimate fake swap calls and other maliciously generated artificial signatures, which were used to simulate actual token transfers on the MON blockchain. The launch of the Monad network and the debut of its MON token in the past two days initiated the spoofing attempt as users opened wallets and transferred tokens for the first time. Monad completes the airdrop of MON tokens The network completed its airdrop of MON tokens on Monday, issuing millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency to its recipients alongside the debut of its blockchain. On-chain data revealed that around 76,000 wallets claimed MON tokens over the past month. And received their tokens when the network and its token went live two days ago. Monad revealed that 3.33 billion MON tokens had already been claimed by the network’s users, builders, and community members. On-chain data revealed that the network collectively valued MON around $105.2 million, while the airdrop size represented around 3% of MON’s total supply and 30% of the token’s circulating supply. Monad revealed last week that approximately 85,800 people participated in the offering, which saw $269 million in commitments. The firm offered the tokens at $0.025 per token and sold for a total of $187 million on Monday. CryptoRank data showed that Monad has raised $431 million in total funding, including $244 from several funding rounds, and $187 million through public sales. Trevor Thompson, co-founder and CEO of social platform Ethos Network, argued that Monad’s airdrop may have been disappointing for speculators, but it was food for the project. He also noted that the firm’s ICE was perfect in terms of price discovery, claiming that Monad maximized the amount it raised while giving the public tokens at a fair price. At the time of publication, MON is trading at $0.04810, up nearly 50% in the last 24 hours. The token has also surged more than 66% since its debut on Monday.

According to Wintermute’s latest analysis, this volatility actually signals a healthy crypto market deleveraging process that could set the stage for a significant rebound. Let’s explore what this means for investors and why market structure improvements matter. What Exactly is Crypto Market Deleveraging? Crypto market deleveraging occurs when traders reduce their borrowed positions, leading to lower overall market leverage. Wintermute’s report reveals fascinating data: Bitcoin funding rates turned negative for the first time since October, while futures open interest plummeted from $230 billion to $135 billion. This substantial crypto market deleveraging indicates traders are taking a more cautious approach. Why Does Market Health Matter Now? The current crypto market deleveraging creates several positive developments: Reduced speculative pressure on prices More sustainable market conditions Shift from futures-driven to spot-driven trading Decreased risk of cascading liquidations These factors collectively create a healthier foundation for future growth. The market cooling period allows for more organic price discovery rather than leverage-fueled volatility. How Can Investors Benefit from This Situation? The ongoing crypto market deleveraging presents unique opportunities. With reduced leverage, market movements become more reflective of actual supply and demand dynamics. Wintermute emphasizes that the current structure supports potential rebounds, provided macroeconomic conditions stabilize. This means investors can focus on fundamental analysis rather than worrying about excessive leverage distorting prices. What Signals Should You Watch For? Monitor these key indicators during crypto market deleveraging periods: Bitcoin funding rates normalization Stable or increasing spot volumes Reduced futures open interest volatility Macroeconomic policy developments These metrics will help you gauge when the deleveraging process completes and genuine recovery begins. Is This the Calm Before the Storm or Recovery? The current crypto market deleveraging represents a necessary market correction rather than permanent damage. Wintermute’s analysis suggests this cleansing process removes excess speculation and creates space for organic growth. However, successful rebounds depend on stable macroeconomic environments and continued institutional confidence in digital assets. Conclusion: A Healthier Foundation Emerges The comprehensive crypto market deleveraging we’re witnessing establishes a stronger base for future appreciation. By reducing systemic risk and shifting toward spot-driven markets, the cryptocurrency ecosystem becomes more resilient. While short-term volatility may continue, the underlying market structure improvements position digital assets for more sustainable long-term growth. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto market deleveraging? Crypto market deleveraging typically occurs when traders reduce borrowed positions due to market uncertainty, regulatory changes, or significant price corrections that trigger margin calls. How long does deleveraging usually last? Deleveraging periods vary but typically last several weeks to months, depending on market conditions and the extent of leverage that needs to be unwound. Is deleveraging good for cryptocurrency markets? Yes, deleveraging creates healthier market conditions by reducing systemic risk and making price movements more reflective of actual supply and demand. What’s the difference between deleveraging and a market crash? Deleveraging involves reducing borrowed positions gradually, while a crash involves rapid, panic-driven selling. Deleveraging can prevent crashes by systematically reducing risk. Should I buy during market deleveraging? Many investors see deleveraging periods as buying opportunities, but careful research and risk management remain essential during volatile market phases. How does deleveraging affect Bitcoin prices? Deleveraging often creates short-term price pressure but establishes healthier foundations for long-term price appreciation through reduced speculative activity. Found this analysis helpful?

54912793,https://cryptonews.com/?p=456436,1764137568,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54912793.jpeg,"Texas Buys $5M in Bitcoin ETF Shares, Plans Another $5M in Self-Custodied BTC",https://cryptonews.com/news/texas-buys-5m-in-bitcoin-etf-shares-plans-another-5m-in-self-custodied-btc/,"Texas has taken a significant step toward building a state-backed Bitcoin position, purchasing $5 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF and preparing a second $5 million buy that will be held in the state’s own custody. Key Takeaways: Texas purchased $5M of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF and plans another $5M in directly self-custodied BTC. The state has a $10M allocation for Bitcoin, with self-custody set to replace ETF exposure once systems are ready. The move highlights shifting government sentiment toward Bitcoin, as other states like Wisconsin have also bought IBIT. The Nov. 20 transaction was disclosed this week by Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, who said the initial exposure was routed through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) while the state finalizes its long-term custody framework. Texas Prepares $5M Direct Bitcoin Buy After Initial ETF Allocation Bratcher noted that Texas has earmarked $10 million in total, though only half of the allocation has been deployed so far. The remaining funds are expected to go directly into BTC once the state’s custody systems are ready. “Texas will self-custody Bitcoin,” he wrote, emphasizing that the ETF purchase is only a temporary starting point. The move drew swift reactions from industry figures. Pierre Rochard, CEO of The Bitcoin Bond Company, said Texas’ action shows how quickly sentiment among governments has shifted. “In five years we went from ‘governments will ban bitcoin’ to ‘governments are only buying a small amount of bitcoin.’ Hyperbitcoinization has happened, is happening, and will continue to happen,” he said. Whether this purchase is connected to Texas’ planned strategic Bitcoin reserve remains unclear. CORRECTION: Texas purchased $5M on Nov. 20th. $10M is allocated from general revenue but not all $10M has been allocated. @BitcoinMagazine — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 In June, Governor Gregg Abbott approved legislation allowing the state to hold BTC as part of its long-term financial assets. The framework limits the reserve to assets with a market cap above $500 billion, a threshold that Bitcoin easily exceeds. BlackRock’s ETF, however, does not qualify under the rule, indicating that the ETF purchase is an interim measure rather than part of the official reserve. Texas is not the first state to gain exposure through IBIT. Wisconsin’s investment board acquired nearly $100 million in IBIT shares in May 2024, filings show. Harvard Reveals $443M Bitcoin ETF Bet Harvard’s endowment fund recently disclosed a $443 million IBIT allocation, accounting for roughly 20% of its reported U.S. equity exposure. The move represents one of the most significant institutional endorsements of Bitcoin exposure among elite university endowments, ranking Harvard as the 16th-largest holder of the BlackRock-managed fund . The latest 13F filing shows Harvard increased its stake from 1.9 million shares reported in June, while simultaneously growing its gold ETF holdings by 99% to 661,391 shares worth $235 million. As reported, Al Warda Investments, an investment arm under the Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC), has also increased its exposure to Bitcoin in the third quarter, more than tripling its position in BlackRock’s IBIT. The firm disclosed a 230% jump in holdings to just under 8 million shares, valued at $517.6 million. ADIC, part of Mubadala Investment Co., one of Abu Dhabi’s leading sovereign-wealth groups, rarely makes public bets in listed digital assets, typically leaning toward private market strategies such as buyouts, infrastructure, and real estate.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Nears $19 Million Ahead of V1 Testnet Launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-mutuum-finance-mutm-nears-19-million-ahead-of-v1-testnet-launch/,"The increasing hype within the DeFi space has placed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) firmly on investors’ radars as one of the top cryptos to buy right now, particularly as it hastens towards an important development phase. With its presale crossing the $19 million mark in no time and Phase 6 almost out, investor interest is pouring in far faster than analysts expected. Tapping at $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves for its cutting-edge DeFi approach to crypto, tackling decentralized lending, borrowing, and interest tokens uniquely crafted to reward its earliest supporters. The hype over its imminent V1 testnet launch on Sepolia is only pouring more fuel on this fire, solidifying its position within the DeFi space as a leading DeFi crypto and the best crypto to buy now for early-stage investors. MUTM Presale Phase 6: Final Window for Strategic Investors Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as one of the most heavily anticipated token sales that this year has to offer. Stage 6 of presale, priced at $0.035 per token, is the last stage prior to its price increase to $0.04 in Stage 7. To ensure simplicity in entry, MUTM has introduced support for Credit and Debit Card payments, making entry into this investment opportunity seamless for both new and veteran investors in cryptocurrencies. As its fundamentals continue to look good and its adoption increases, MUTM is poised to emerge as the top DeFi crypto and the best crypto to buy now for investors seeking exposure before the next phase. Sepolia Testnet: Full DeFi Features Testing One of the most important milestones in the near future is to launch the full lending and borrowing protocol for Mutuum Finance on Sepolia testnet, which is expected to happen in Q4 2025. It will initially support ETH, USDT, mtTokens, debt tokens, and automatic liquidation, but other assets will also be added later. This testnet launch also proves that Mutuum Finance is more than just a presale token, but it is also growing to be a full-fledged DeFi platform. It has usage, utility, and scalable tokenomics that classifies MUTM as one of the top cryptocurrencies and a DeFi crypto ready to deliver long-term results. Independent Security Audit: Trust and Reliability The lending and borrowing contracts offered by Mutuum Finance are also undergoing an independent audit by Halborn Security . The final codes are also under evaluation to ensure that every contract functions correctly and safely handles the user’s assets. It will ensure platform integrity and investor safety, and will provide platform updates once completed. After that, announcements for testnet launch schedules will also be made, which is one of the most important steps towards full-scale operability for the MUTM platform. Tokenomics in MUTM include a Buy-and-Distribute mechanism whereby transaction fees on the platform are utilized for buying back MUTM tokens to reward mtToken staking participants. This design directly links increases in value to usage instead of trading volumes. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance has implemented a leaderboard contest for every day, where they reward top contributors with $500 worth of MUTM tokens every day (starting at 00:00 UTC). This not only increases their engagement but also develops their community, hence cementing MUTM as a new breed of DeFi crypto poised for growth. MUTM Emerges as DeFi Crypto to Buy Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly proving to be the best crypto to buy now. It has already raised almost $19 million in its presale, with Phase 6 near sold-out at $0.035 per token. The V1 testnet launch on Sepolia will then provide full DeFi functionality, including full support for lending, borrowing, interest-bearing tokens, and automated liquidation. Furthermore, independent security assurance from Halborn Security removes any doubts about its reliability and authenticity. Last but not least, its novel tokenomics and reward structure are additional factors driving adoption. Therefore, investors looking to gain early access to this new “high-utility” and high-upside DeFi crypto need to act fast to acquire MUTM tokens before prices go up to $0.04 in Phase 7, making it the best crypto to buy now.

Algorand 1-day chart analysis ALGOUSD chart by TradingView This week, ALGO trades at its lowest range this year as it tests support at $0.14. The drop corresponds with the broader market and Bitcoin, which fell below $88K, triggering millions in liquidations and fueling the decline. Its relative strength index (37.80) shows a bearish market headed for oversold territory. The coin failed to hold above the moving averages, triggering stop losses. Algorand 4-hour chart analysis ALGOUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights ALGO’s run this week. The $0.14 level remains critical to whether it will be oversold.

Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will not break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains improbable for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion.

Algorand historic price sentiment ALGO price chart by CoinGecko Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million, while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January and $0.35 in February. It crossed into October, trading at $0.22. The coin later nose dived, and by November, it had dropped to $0.16.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-26 07:02:45

The latest ETF flow data shows that IBIT shed $149.1 million on November 24, followed by an additional $83 million inflow on November 25, leaving the fund with a net weekly outflow of more than $66 million across the two days tracked. Total Bitcoin spot ETF net inflow. Source: Coinglass The pattern marks a notable shift for IBIT, which has been the dominant inflow leader among U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The fund now appears to be undergoing a period of position trimming, with several large holders rotating capital or taking profits as Bitcoin recovered toward the $88,000 level. The divergence between price action and flows is notable. Bitcoin has bounced off its pullback lows near $80,000 and is attempting to reclaim the $90,000 zone, yet short-term investor behavior inside IBIT suggests caution. Analysts often treat BlackRock’s flows as a sentiment barometer for institutional appetite; negative prints from the largest issuer tend to signal a more defensive stance even during market strength. Bitcoin ETF mixed flows Meanwhile, other ETFs offered a mixed picture during the same period. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded substantial inflows of $170.8 million, offsetting outflows from ARK’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB. This indicates that while investors are still allocating to Bitcoin, they are becoming more selective about where they deploy capital. The ongoing outflows from IBIT may reflect broader rotation within the institutional market rather than a loss of conviction in Bitcoin itself. Large allocators frequently rebalance at key price levels, especially after rapid price appreciation. If IBIT continues to see redemptions while Bitcoin climbs, it could signal the early stages of a distribution phase, or a pause before large institutions reload at lower levels. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $87,608, having recorded a modest plunge of about 0.3% in the last 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, BTC is down 3.6%.

According to Matrixport’s latest analysis, this Bitcoin gold decoupling isn’t just temporary – it’s likely to intensify in the coming months. Let’s explore why these two popular assets are drifting apart and what this means for investors. Why Is Bitcoin Gold Decoupling Happening Now? Matrixport’s recent report reveals that the Bitcoin gold decoupling stems from fundamentally different market drivers. While both assets are often discussed as alternative investments, they respond to completely different economic signals. Gold maintains strong ties to traditional fiscal policies, whereas Bitcoin dances to the tune of capital flows and liquidity conditions. What’s Driving Gold’s Price Movement? Gold’s behavior remains closely tied to conventional economic factors. The precious metal shows higher correlation with: U.S. fiscal deficit trends Treasury bond issuance pace Government spending patterns This connection means gold often reacts to macroeconomic policies rather than pure investment demand. Even with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the limited scope of monetary easing keeps gold’s traditional role intact. How Does Bitcoin React Differently? Bitcoin’s price dynamics operate on a different wavelength. The cryptocurrency depends heavily on: New capital entering the market Investor sentiment shifts Liquidity conditions Currently, Matrixport notes there are no clear signals of significant additional liquidity heading toward Bitcoin markets. This creates the perfect environment for continued Bitcoin gold decoupling as the assets respond to separate catalysts. Will Monetary Policy Affect This Trend? While markets anticipate Federal Reserve rate cuts in December, Matrixport suggests this won’t necessarily reunite Bitcoin and gold prices. The limited expected monetary easing means both assets might continue their separate journeys. The Bitcoin gold decoupling could actually deepen as investors recognize their distinct value propositions and risk profiles. What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? The ongoing Bitcoin gold decoupling presents both challenges and opportunities. Investors should consider: Diversification across uncorrelated assets Separate analysis frameworks for each asset class Different risk management strategies Understanding that Bitcoin and gold serve different purposes in a portfolio becomes crucial when their price movements diverge. Future Outlook: Where Do We Go From Here? Matrixport concludes that the Bitcoin gold decoupling will likely persist until clear signs of coordinated market movements emerge. Without substantial new liquidity or changing fiscal conditions, both assets may continue operating in their respective lanes. This separation actually highlights Bitcoin’s maturation as an independent asset class rather than just ‘digital gold.’ The separation between Bitcoin and gold prices represents more than just a temporary market anomaly. It signals Bitcoin’s evolution into a distinct asset class with unique drivers. As Matrixport’s analysis shows, understanding this Bitcoin gold decoupling helps investors make smarter allocation decisions and recognize that digital and traditional safe havens don’t always move together. Frequently Asked Questions What causes Bitcoin and gold prices to decouple? Bitcoin and gold decouple because they respond to different economic factors. Gold correlates with fiscal deficits and bond markets, while Bitcoin depends on capital flows and liquidity conditions. How long might this decoupling last? Matrixport suggests the decoupling could continue for some time, especially without significant changes in monetary policy or new liquidity entering cryptocurrency markets. Should I invest in both Bitcoin and gold? Yes, having both can provide diversification benefits, especially when their prices don’t move in sync. They serve different purposes in a balanced portfolio. Does this mean Bitcoin isn’t ‘digital gold’? Not necessarily. Bitcoin still shares some store-of-value characteristics with gold, but it’s developing its own unique price drivers and market behavior. Will Federal Reserve policy changes affect this trend? Limited monetary easing might not significantly impact the decoupling. Both assets could continue responding to their primary drivers rather than coordinated policy moves. What should investors watch for signs of re-coupling? Monitor new liquidity entering cryptocurrency markets, major shifts in fiscal policy, and changes in how institutional investors treat both assets. Found this analysis helpful?

Key Takeaways: Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs saw strong demand on November 25, pulling in $129 million and $78 million in net inflows. Grayscale’s new Dogecoin ETF debuted with $1.4 million in volume. Meanwhile, spot XRP ETFs attracted nearly $130 million on their first day. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the day with $170.80 million in inflows, followed by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) at $83.01 million, according to data from SoSoValue . Other products, including Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), saw notable outflows, reflecting mixed sentiment among smaller issuers. Cumulative inflows across all spot Bitcoin ETFs have now reached $57.61 billion. Trading activity remained steady, with over $4.69 billion in daily volume. Ether ETFs Attract $78M in Inflows Ether spot ETFs recorded $78.58 million in net inflows on November 25, marking the third consecutive day of positive momentum. The BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led with $46.09 million in inflows, followed by the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) at $47.54 million, reflecting strong institutional appetite. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) added $8.29 million, while the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) saw a significant $23.33 million outflow, continuing its recent trend of redemptions. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s new spot Dogecoin ETF (GDOG) debuted with $1.4 million in trading volume, falling well below analyst expectations of $12 million, though still considered average for a typical launch. A second spot Dogecoin ETF from Bitwise (BWOW) is set to begin trading next, expanding investor access to DOGE exposure. The new products follow a broader wave of crypto ETF launches after the SEC eased listing rules. $GDOG (first Doge ETF) saw $1.4m volume on Day One.. solid for an avg launch but low for a 'first-ever spot' product. Not too surprising tho, we actually made a rhyme a while ago predicting this: 'The further away you get from BTC, the less asset there will be.' pic.twitter.com/ermlOcID1J — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 25, 2025 Unlike the earlier DOJE fund, which cannot directly hold Dogecoin and saw a stronger $17 million debut, both Grayscale and Bitwise’s ETFs are filed under rules that allow them to directly hold the token. Meanwhile, newly launched spot XRP ETFs saw far larger inflows, pulling in nearly $130 million on their first day. ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate that the rapid pace of DOGE and XRP product launches is only the beginning , with over 100 new crypto ETFs expected in the next six months. Bitcoin Breaks Its November Trend as Analysts See Whale Demand Returning Bitcoin is set to end November in the red, breaking its long-standing pattern as the strongest month of the year. Historically averaging gains of more than 40%, Bitcoin now trades over 20% below its monthly open, raising doubts about whether seasonal trends still matter after October also failed to deliver its usual positive performance. Bitfinex analysts attribute the recent decline to overheated buying between $106,000 and $118,000, noting that many of those buyers are now capitulating at a loss. Short-term holders are under pressure as Bitcoin trades below their average cost basis of $86,787, something that has happened only three times since early 2024. As reported, Bitcoin may remain stuck between $60,000 and $80,000 through the end of December if the Federal Reserve leaves interest rates unchanged at next month’s FOMC meeting, according to analysis from XWIN Research Japan.

The demand is skyrocketing and only some 5% of the allocation remains below the $0.04, creating a frenzied rush to be allocated a spot by the investors. This is why many people now consider this project as one of the most successful crypto opportunities in 2026 as its progress has not yet stopped. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending platform that focuses on generating clean yields and borrowing funds in a safe manner that collateralizes debt. The protocol relies on Peer to Contract lending wherein the users post assets into a common liquidity pool. They are awarded mtTokens which increase in value as borrowers interest repay. The peer to peer borrowing enables the users to borrow funds under collateral within certain Loan to Value ratios. In case the collateral declines to safety levels, liquidations are enacted by the system. Collateral is provided at a discount to the liquidators who settle part of the debt. This maintains the stability of the borrow positions and safeguards the liquidity of a protocol. Pre-sale Growth Is Demanding Massive Mutuum Finance started its presale at $0.01 and is currently at around $0.035 which is a 250% boost as it runs through all the evaluation stages. The project has collected nearly $18.95M and had over 18,200 holders. Approximately, 805M tokens were already purchased. Addressing the total supply of 4B, approximately 45.5% of the supply is assigned to the pre-sale where early buyers will be supplied with significant volume of MUTM. Phase 6 is now over 95% saturated with just a few tokens remaining below $0.04. After the last tokens are sold, the next presale price will come into action. This is the root cause of the fast movement of investors. It is very low in the quantities that remain at this point. Presale velocity has been high as well due to increased publicity of the Mutuum Finance in crypto news venues. MUTM is top on the list of traders who seek the most suitable crypto to purchase today or to buy cheap crypto with high potentiality. This is further compounded by the 24 hour leaderboard. The leader of the day is given $500 in MUTM, which finds huge acquisition among buyers and speeds up the distribution rate. The demand curve keeps increasing at a startling rate since there are no purchase limits, and payment is made through cards. V1 Launch and Security Boost Analyst Confidence The official X account of the Mutuum Finance team confirmed that V1 protocol was to be launched on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. It was also mentioned in the post that Halborn Security is studying the lending and borrowing agreements and that the code is ready and under compliance analysis. New crypto presales are rare and have hardly any such transparency and it has become a key source of investor confidence. Security has been a priority issue. Rated by CertiK audit (90 out of 100 tokens scan) the project passed. There is also a live bug bounty of $50K to detect possible vulnerabilities. This places MUTM at the forefront of most early stage tokens that are released without a lot of verification or review. Long Term Value Mutuum Finance will launch a USD pegged on chain asset overcollateralized on chain based stablecoin. Interest on borrowage is paid into the treasury where it serves as long term revenue and makes the ecosystem more stable. Analysts indicate that the presence of stablecoins is essential to scale DeFi protocols as they reach a user segment demanding consistency when it comes to borrowing. The team also seeks to be deployed in the future in Layer 2 networks. Reduced fees and quicker transactions can increase the lending growth and bring more action into the system. This is more significant to investors who are seeking which crypto to buy for long term adopters. A combination of these factors are the reason why analysts are predicting that in good market conditions MUTM could rise up to three or five times its listing price. Final Thoughts The last hours of the most significant presale are upon Mutuum Finance and the pressure is mounting rapidly. Millions of dollars raised since Phase 1, a 250% increase since Phase 1, over 18,200 holders, and nearly a sell-out of Phase 6 made MUTM one of the hottest cryptocurrencies to be in this month. The remaining 5% of the allocation is below $0.04. When these tokens are sold the price will subsequently rise and the final early entry window will be shut. Waiting investors can also miss the best prices before the next runaway.

The central bank's second Financial Stability Report for 2025 highlights concerns about regulatory gaps as cryptocurrency adoption accelerates nationwide. South Africa's three largest cryptocurrency exchanges now serve a combined 7.8 million users as of July 2025. These platforms held approximately $1.5 billion in custody by the end of 2024. The rapid growth in user numbers and trading volumes has prompted regulatory authorities to assess potential risks to the financial system. Number of registered customers. Source: South African Reserve Bank Stablecoins Dominate Trading Activity Trading patterns on South African exchanges have undergone substantial transformation since 2022. USD-pegged stablecoins have replaced Bitcoin as the dominant trading pair on local platforms. The shift reflects investor preference for assets with lower price volatility. Bitcoin , XRP, Ether, and Solana previously served as primary trading vehicles for South African crypto investors. Stablecoins now account for the majority of trading volume on domestic exchanges. The central bank attributes this change to the relative price stability of stablecoins compared to traditional cryptocurrencies. Breakdown of crypto asset holdings. Source: South African Reserve Bank Trading volume data indicates a marked increase in stablecoin transactions since 2022. The bank characterizes this development as a structural shift in market behavior. Stablecoins provide traders with a means to transition between positions without needing to convert to fiat currency. Regulatory Framework Remains Incomplete The Financial Stability Board assessed South Africa's crypto regulations in October 2024. The international watchdog found no comprehensive framework for global stablecoins. Existing cryptocurrency regulations were deemed only partially adequate. The South African Reserve Bank expressed concern that risks may accumulate without proper oversight. The digital nature of crypto assets enables users to bypass Exchange Control Regulations. These rules govern capital flows into and out of the country. Borderless transactions present unique challenges for traditional financial oversight. The bank warned that threats to financial stability could develop undetected without appropriate regulatory structures. Establishing a comprehensive framework remains a priority for monetary authorities. The central bank's concerns echo previous warnings about the risks associated with digital currency. Deputy Governor Francois Groepe stated in 2017 that issuing digital currencies posed excessive risks. The institution has maintained a cautious stance on crypto innovation. South African policymakers have adopted a more accommodating position than the central bank. The Financial Sector Conduct Authority designated cryptocurrency as a financial product in 2022. This classification brought crypto businesses under formal regulatory oversight. The authority subsequently issued licenses allowing crypto companies to operate legally.

30450,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=123123,1764141969,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/30450.jpeg,Aave price prediction 2025-2031: Is AAVE a good investment?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/aave-price-prediction/,"Key takeaways: AAVE price prediction for 2025 could reach a maximum value of $340.30. By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $640.49. In 2031, AAVE will range between $864.66 to $1,040.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $178.58 Market cap $2.70B Trading volume (24-h) $247.92M Circulating supply 15.157M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $174.78 24-hour high $180.78 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.99% (Very High) 50-day SMA $215.38 14-Day RSI 44.47 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 15 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $247.96 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE must close above $184 to confirm bullish continuation. The intraday trend remains intact but is visibly slowing near $178. Aave 1-day price chart As of November 26, AAVE’s daily candle shows hesitation just under the mid-Bollinger band at approximately $184, suggesting that the rally from around $160 is losing steam as it approaches this dynamic resistance. The upper wick near $181–$182 reflects supply emerging at the same zone that capped the price two days earlier. The MACD remains below zero but is curling upward, showing momentum improving yet still fragile, while RSI shows neutral-to-bearish strength that has not yet shifted into a confirmed bullish range. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView If price cannot close decisively above $184 today, AAVE risks sliding back toward the lower Bollinger support around $146–$150, which is where buyers previously defended. A clean daily close above $184 would open room toward $200, but failure to do so keeps the rally corrective rather than impulsive. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, AAVE trades slightly above the Alligator’s teeth and lips (green and red lines), showing that short-term structure remains intact but is no longer expanding aggressively. The recent candles reflect tightening ranges between $176 and $179, indicating a pause. The price hovering above the Alligator jaw at approximately $172 suggests the trend is still alive, although its slope is flattening. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The PVT remains elevated but not climbing, hinting that buying pressure has stalled even if it hasn’t reversed. The Balance of Power at 0.56 leans bullish but shows no dominance; buyers have influence, yet they are not driving the market. A pullback toward $174–$176 is possible before any renewed push upwards. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $225.16 SELL SMA 5 $198.99 SELL SMA 10 $191.67 SELL SMA 21 $192.75 SELL SMA 50 $215.38 SELL SMA 100 $256.95 SELL SMA 200 $247.96 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $194.65 SELL EMA 5 $212.39 SELL EMA 10 $242.73 SELL EMA 21 $270.78 SELL EMA 50 $284.25 SELL EMA 100 $276.85 SELL EMA 200 $257.14 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is showing recovery potential, but it needs a breakout above $184 to decisively flip sentiment. Without that, expect choppy consolidation between $170 and $184 until stronger volume returns. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken, and KuCoin also support AAVE. Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years. It’s not just surviving, it’s evolving, with features like the GHO stablecoin and multichain support keeping it ahead of the curve. If DeFi continues to grow and mature, Aave isn’t just likely to stick around; it’ll probably be one of the key players shaping the future.

Solana (SOL) leads market attention in regards to matters of scalability and ecosystem development to date, followed by Ripple (XRP), which despite several challenges affecting its market structure recently now has a large proportion of its holders in loss. However, it is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , yet another DeFi crypto reaching great heights presently in its $0.035 presale and surging past 95% completion in its Phase 6 presale that holds great promise and attention presently. Mutuum Finance is now being recognized among the top cryptocurrencies to watch in 2025. Solana Displays Hints of A Classic Bullish Reversal Pattern Solana (SOL) starts to show encouraging indications of a bullish turn-around in trend after it manages to test strong support points effectively around $125. The major technical elements start to favor it now as EMA curves go bullish and MACD makes way for a bullish cross indicating upcoming continuation in a positive trend. The Bollinger Bands depict increasing possibilities to go up, and SAR points start to favor a buy trend as momentum begins to build. As SOL regains momentum in such a critical market situation, it looks like some traders have started to diversify their portfolios from major winners to new frontiers such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi crypto with substantial early momentum. XRP Remains at Key Support Level as Market Looks to Next Big Move XRP has been following a constant trend downward, plummeting about 14% to the $1.91–$1.85 range and even further down to the $1.87–$1.82 level, which marks the last major level of support prior to possibly plummeting to $1.51. In the 4-hourly graph of XRP/USD, it would appear as if both market buyers and market sellers have reached market exhaustion. Movement in all financial systems will be impacted by these changes in market dynamics; in particular, XRP will be following this trend to possibly plummet, while investors look toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a top cryptocurrency gaining traction with its early-stage adoption and real-world utility. MUTM Presale Phase 6: Seizing Early Momentum Mutuum Finance is quickly making its presence felt in the DeFi crypto space as it approaches completion of Phase 6 of its presale. The MUTM tokens are currently selling for $0.035, which will be the last chance for buyers to purchase these tokens before Phase 7 raises their price by 20% to $0.04. Over 18,230 members have joined to raise over $19 million so far, making MUTM one of the most awaited crypto launches of 2025 and a leading top cryptocurrency to buy for early exposure. Independent Security Audit, Ensure Contract Reliability The lending and borrowing smart contracts of Mutuum Finance are presently being audited independently by Halborn Security . The audit process will allow Mutuum Finance to have their finalized code reviewed thoroughly to ensure functionality and improve security to protect asset values for users. The timelines for testnet launch will be announced once the audit process is complete. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly breaking out to be among the best top cryptocurrencies to invest in prior to the market rebound. Phase 6 sales have reached over 95% of $0.035; it has already brought in over $19 million from 18,230+ investors. MUTM boasts features such as an independent Halborn audit completion, upcoming Sepolia Testnet V1, and a full DeFi crypto ecosystem. The time to invest in this promising DeFi altcoin and have early access to it even before Phase 7 increases the cost to $0.04 certainly makes it very opportune.

The affected pairs include: BMT/FDUSD GMT/BTC ME/BTC TOWNS/FDUSD This Binance delist spot trading pairs action follows the exchange’s regular market monitoring process. The decision typically comes when trading pairs no longer meet strict quality standards or show insufficient trading activity. Why Does Binance Delist Spot Trading Pairs?

What Should Affected Traders Do Immediately? If you hold any of these trading pairs, time is of the essence. Here are crucial steps to take before the November 28 deadline: Review your portfolio for any holdings in these pairs Close open orders involving these trading pairs Consider alternative pairs for continued trading Monitor official announcements for additional updates Remember that after delisting, these specific trading pairs will no longer be available for spot trading on Binance.

Frequently Asked Questions What happens to my funds in delisted pairs? Your assets remain safe in your wallet. Only the trading pair is removed, not the underlying tokens. You can still hold, deposit, or withdraw the individual tokens. Can these pairs be relisted in the future? While possible, relisting is uncommon. Projects would need to demonstrate significant improvements and meet Binance’s listing criteria again. Will delisting affect token prices?

How often does Binance delist trading pairs? Binance conducts regular reviews, typically every few months. The frequency depends on market conditions and trading activity across various pairs. Should I sell my holdings before delisting? This depends on your investment strategy. Consider factors like alternative exchange availability, project fundamentals, and your risk tolerance before deciding. Where can I find official updates about delistings?

Husky Inu (HINU) Completes Move To $0.00022944 Husky Inu (HINU) has completed the latest price rise of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00022856 to $0.00022944.

The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) approved the expansion plan at Foxconn’s Racine County facility to satisfy increasing demand for AI servers. Foxconn stated that the expansion will mainly focus on AI servers, which the company emphasizes will help reinforce domestic U.S. supply chains. Jerry Hsiao, Foxconn’s chief product manager, said his company will continue to respond to its customers as long as demand for more data infrastructure remains high. Hsiao also boasted that his company aims to create 1,374 new jobs by 2030. He pointed out that the Wisconsin project accounts for nearly 25% of Foxconn’s U.S. workforce, asserting that the new AI investment will likely more than double the company’s presence in the state over the next four to five years. WEDC also stated that the company’s expansion by 2030 will increase its Mount Pleasant manufacturing footprint, including the creation of new employment for office and factory workers. WEDC offers up to $16M in tax credits WEDC’s Board of Directors approved up to $16 million in tax credits to support Foxconn’s expansion. The agency stated that under the latest revision to Foxconn’s contract with the state of Wisconsin, the company could earn state tax credits of up to $96 million through 2029. WEDC’s Deputy Secretary Sam Rikkers said the agency is committed to ensuring Foxconn’s growth and success in Wisconsin. He also emphasized that the new approval mirrors the company’s ranking as one of the global manufacturers that has chosen Wisconsin as its base of operations. Meanwhile, WEDC stated that the company had invested over $700 million in Mount Pleasant operations and created over 1,200 jobs by the end of 2024. However, that was a tiny fraction of the 13,000 workers the company had previously promised to hire, the agency noted. As a result, Foxconn’s deal with the state was slashed from a $4 billion contract to an $80 million contract when it became apparent that the company would never achieve its initial plans. The company stated at the time that it intended to invest $10 billion in the Wisconsin site to manufacture large, flat display screens. However, Microsoft is currently developing much of the site that Foxconn initially bought as a data center. DeGroot says village welcomes Foxconn’s 21st-century expansion President of Mount Pleasant Village Dave DeGroot stated in a press release that the village is excited to work with the company, as it plans to create additional employment opportunities and expand its 21st-century manufacturing operations. However, he could not comment on the details of the company’s plan. Meanwhile, WEDC revealed that Foxconn plans to create a total of 2,600 jobs and add up to $1.2 billion in capital investment in the next three years (by the end of 2029). On the other hand, the company claimed that it has incurred over $2 billion in taxes, payroll, and capital expenditures (CapEx) in Wisconsin since it began operations in the state. However, a Wisconsin resident raised concerns about Foxconn’s seemingly fake promises over the past few years. Apparently, the company uses the illusion of an investment to curry favor with politicians, with President Donald Trump being targeted more than any other. The resident complained that the company has never in its history in the state even come close to delivering on any of its promises made with arms slung around a politician or two. The resident also pointed fingers at GOP officials for covering this illusion at different levels of government. They accused anyone from Mount Pleasant to the National Assembly and the White House of trying to scuttle the project for selfish ends. President Trump himself has been at the forefront of supporting Foxconn ’s U.S. investments. He previously claimed that the company had built one of the most incredible plants he had ever seen and that it would keep its promises and more. Trump touted that Foxconn will enter the U.S. with money like no other company has come with before.

The Puell Multiple compares BTC miners’ daily revenue to their annual average. When it falls below 1, miners are receiving less than normal, indicating financial pressure and potential capitulation. The indicator measures miner profitability and historically signals potential market tops and bottoms. “These moments often mark periods of opportunity, where the market prices Bitcoin below its fair value,” he said. Markets at an Opportune Moment The market is signaling that it is entering an opportune moment, the analyst said before concluding: “Price zones where risk decreases and upside potential increases. It is precisely in these moments of pessimism that a new uptrend begins to form.” Puell Multiple Below the Discount Zone “Historically, all major correction reversals have started in precisely these discount regions. It is not a guarantee of immediate bottoming, but statistically it has signaled major bottoms” – By @gaah_im pic.twitter.com/NTIZCocSfK — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 25, 2025 The Bitcoin miner hash price has also slumped 43% over the past four months or so as miner profitability dwindles. The metric, currently $0.036 per terahash per second per day, quantifies how much a miner can expect to earn for a given amount of hashrate, according to Hashrate Index. It is now at a historical low. Another metric called the Sharpe ratio has also fallen into opportune risk/reward territory. The indicator is at “a level historically associated with moments of maximum uncertainty and the early stages of risk repricing,” reported CryptoQuant earlier this week. The Sharpe ratio measures return versus risk, so when it is near zero, BTC has delivered poor returns, which creates a better investment setup. Bitcoin Recovery Stalls The Bitcoin recovery has stalled with the asset trading sideways over the past 24 hours. BTC tapped $88,000 twice over the past 12 hours but failed to overcome resistance there and fell back. It is currently trading at $87,600 and starting to consolidate at this range. “Despite a decent rebound to start the week, crypto markets still show significant short and mid-term losses among average wallet investments,” commented Santiment.

Klarna To Launch Stablecoin On Tempo Blockchain As announced in a press release , Klarna has launched its stablecoin on Tempo’s testnet. The stablecoin, called KlarnaUSD, is backed one-to-one by the US Dollar, and will be available to the public in 2026. Klarna is a global digital bank and payments provider headquartered in Sweden, with the US hosting its largest userbase. The stablecoin debut represents the first venture of the fintech company into digital assets. KlarnaUSD is built using Bridge’s Open Issuance, a platform that allows businesses to launch and manage their own stablecoins. It runs on Tempo , a blockchain created by payments processor Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm that advertises itself as being designed for payments. Stripe also owns Bridge after its acquisition earlier in the year. “The partnership deepens an already extensive relationship between Klarna and Stripe, which spans payments infrastructure across Klarna’s 26 markets globally,” noted the announcement. Since the blockchain allows for quick and cheap payments, Klarna believes that stablecoins could be a way to cut down on cross-border transaction fee costs, which are estimated to cost merchants and consumers $120 billion annually. Stablecoins have been gaining more adoption across the globe, with positive regulation coming from various governments this year. Management consulting firm McKinsey has estimated that transactions related to these fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies now touch $27 trillion a year, and could eclipse legacy payment networks before the decade is over. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna co-founder and CEO, said: With 114 million customers and $112 billion in annual GMV, Klarna has the scale to change payments globally: with Klarna’s scale and Tempo’s infrastructure, we can challenge old networks and make payments faster and cheaper for everyone Currently, Klarna is prototyping the stablecoin on Tempo’s testnet, but it will not be open publicly until the mainnet launch next year. The move appears to only be a beginning in the cryptocurrency sector for the buy-now-pay-later firm, as the press release has teased the reveal of its next partner in the coming weeks. In some other news, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has spotted a curious transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. The move in question induced a spike of 80,472 on the long-term holder SOPR , an indicator that tracks the profit-loss ratio of transfers involving coins from dormant hands (155+ days of holding time). At the time the transaction occurred, BTC was trading around $84,000. Considering the profit-loss ratio of the move was 80,472, the coins must have had a cost basis close to $1. Maartunn dug into blockchain data and found that the transfer came from a wallet that originally held 13 BTC mined back in 2013, and has been selling roughly 1 BTC every year since 2018. BTC Price Bitcoin recovered above $89,000 on Monday, but the coin has since seen a setback as it’s now back at $86,200.",Stablecoin|Klarna|Klarna Stablecoin|KlarnaUSD|Stablecoins|Stables,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-26 08:00:41

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Crash To Continue If This Level Isn’t Reclaimed, Analyst Warns GXRP, XRPZ See Record Debut This week, the second batch of spot XRP ETFs went live, debuting with a record-breaking performance. Notably, Grayscale and Franklin Templeton launched their XRP-based investment products, recording over $60 million in net inflows each during their first day. On Monday, Franklin Templeton debuted the new XRPZ ETF on NYSE Arca, highlighting that “its established utility in facilitating cross-currency settlement has made XRP a central component of the growing digital payments ecosystem.” Moreover, Grayscale followed the same path as with its other existing crypto-based private trusts, converting its XRP fund into the publicly traded GXRP ETF. In a significant achievement, both funds broke Canary Capital’s XRPC record as the biggest ETF debut of 2025. As reported by NewsBTC, Canary Capital launched the first single-token XRP spot ETF on November 13, smashing the initial expectations of multiple experts. After clearing the last regulatory hurdles, XRPC debuted on Nasdaq with a total volume of $58 million. Ahead of its launch, senior ETF analysts predicted that the fund could surpass Bitwise’s BSOL, which previously held this achievement. After the first 30 minutes, XRPC surprised market observers with $26 million in volume, suggesting strong initial demand. Meanwhile, BSOL recorded an impressive volume of $10 million in the first 30 minutes of trading, surging to $33 million by the half-day mark. The investment product closed its debut with $57 million in volume, beating all 900 other launches of the year. According to SoSoValue data, Franklin’s XRPZ and Grayscale’s GXRP saw an impressive $62.6 million and $67.4 million on their launch day, surpassing Canary’s XRPC record and becoming the best debuts of any ETFs in 2025 so far. XRP ETFs Steal The Spotlight Besides the remarkable launch of Grayscale and Franklin Templeton’s investment funds, the XRP ETF category’s performance surpassed that of other leading ETFs on Monday, including those based on the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Canary Capital’s XRPC and Bitwise’s XRP ETF brought in $16.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively, amounting to a total of $164 million in net inflows for the whole category on November 24. This performance was followed by ETH ETFs, which recorded $96.6 million in inflows, led by BlackRock’s ETHA. Solana-based funds came third with $58 million in positive net flows, extending their 20-day streak with a total of $568 million in inflows, according to Farside Invest data.

The investment products continued their choppy November performance, starting the week with $151 million in outflows, led by BlackRock’s IBIT.

It showed the company’s name, its products, and its plans for the digital asset market. People who track XRP reacted fast because the display appeared during a period of growing interest in Ripple’s work with institutions. Crypto expert Amonyx (@amonbuy) shared the image online. He wrote, “Times Square just turned into Ripple Square” and said the “XRP era is officially starting.” His message resonated with many users who follow Ripple and expect more robust activity around XRP.

Speak up if you’re ready. pic.twitter.com/v0Lxc8iVPw — Amonyx (@amonbuy) November 25, 2025 Ripple Sends a Clear Message Ripple often publishes advertisements for its XRP-powered services . In this case, the company utilized a prominent public location to present its services. The billboard highlighted payments, custody, and a stablecoin product. These services support institutions that want fast settlement, clear rules, and reliable systems. This approach meets Ripple’s long-term plan. The company has built tools for firms that need to move value across borders with less friction. It has made significant advancements in custody services and cross-border payments. RLUSD, its stablecoin, has also gained prominence in the crypto space since its launch in late 2024. Public displays like this help Ripple show confidence in its products. They also help position XRP as a valuable asset inside an ecosystem built for real transactions. XRP is a core part of Ripple’s strategy , and Amonyx’s post hammered that point. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Utility Continues to Shape Market Interest XRP holds a key place in Ripple’s system. It can move value across networks at high speed and low cost. Many investors see this as a reason the asset attracts attention from users who follow institutional adoption. Ripple continues to grow its products for banks, payment firms, and other financial companies. Ripple’s XRP-powered services can meet the needs of institutions that want to hold, move, and manage digital values. When firms use tools that link to XRP, demand for the asset can rise. Ripple promotes XRP’s role in global payment and settlement. This provides a clear path for long-term growth . The Times Square billboard supports that direction. It signals a company ready to speak to a wider audience. That matters because the market responds to clear actions from firms that build real financial tools. This level of visibility shows that Ripple is not stepping back but moving forward with its plans. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This strategic move promises to reshape the token’s economic landscape and deliver real value to holders. If you’re invested in SUN tokens or considering DeFi opportunities, this development demands your attention. What Exactly is the SUN Buyback Program? The newly launched SUN buyback program represents a bold commitment to token value appreciation. Sun platform will systematically repurchase its native tokens from the open market using 100% of the fees generated through its innovative Trade to Earn feature. This creates a sustainable mechanism where platform usage directly fuels token demand. Here’s how the program works in practice: All trading fees from the Trade to Earn program fund the buybacks Purchases occur regularly from open markets Acquired tokens face permanent removal from circulation The process repeats every quarter for consistent impact Why Does This SUN Buyback Program Matter for Investors? Token buyback programs create powerful economic effects that benefit long-term holders. When a platform removes tokens from circulation, the remaining tokens become scarcer. Basic economics teaches us that scarcity, combined with steady or growing demand, typically leads to price appreciation. The SUN buyback program stands out because it’s funded entirely by organic platform activity. This means the more people use Sun’s Trade to Earn feature, the more buying pressure gets applied to SUN tokens. It creates a beautiful cycle where platform growth directly translates to token value enhancement. How Will Quarterly Token Burns Impact SUN’s Future? The quarterly burning of repurchased tokens introduces predictable deflationary pressure into SUN’s tokenomics. Each burn event permanently reduces the total token supply, making existing tokens more valuable proportionally. This systematic approach provides several key advantages: Predictable value appreciation through regular supply reduction Increased investor confidence from transparent execution Sustainable growth model tied to actual platform usage Reduced selling pressure as tokens exit circulation permanently What Makes Sun’s Approach to DeFi Different? Sun positions itself as an all-in-one DeFi platform on the TRON network, but this SUN buyback program demonstrates its commitment to going beyond basic functionality. While many DeFi projects focus solely on feature development, Sun recognizes that sustainable token value is crucial for long-term ecosystem health. The platform’s integration of revenue-generating features with value-returning mechanisms shows sophisticated economic planning. This SUN buyback program isn’t just a temporary measure—it’s built into the platform’s fundamental economic model, ensuring continuous value delivery to token holders. Conclusion: A New Era for SUN Token Holders The launch of the SUN buyback program marks a significant milestone in the platform’s evolution. By tying token value directly to platform usage through a transparent, quarterly burn mechanism, Sun creates a compelling case for both current holders and potential investors. This innovative approach to tokenomics demonstrates how DeFi platforms can build sustainable economic models that benefit all participants. The program’s success will depend on continued platform adoption and trading activity, but the foundation is solid. For those watching the DeFi space, this SUN buyback program represents exactly the type of thoughtful economic design that separates fleeting projects from lasting ecosystems. Frequently Asked Questions How often will the SUN buyback program execute token burns? The platform will conduct token burns quarterly, providing regular, predictable supply reduction. What funds the SUN buyback program exactly? 100% of the fees generated from Sun’s Trade to Earn feature finance the buyback program. Will the SUN buyback program affect token trading? Yes, the program creates consistent buying pressure and reduces circulating supply, potentially impacting price and liquidity. How does this benefit long-term SUN holders? Reduced token supply through burns increases scarcity, which typically supports price appreciation for remaining tokens. Is the SUN buyback program sustainable long-term? The program’s funding comes from organic platform activity, making it sustainable as long as Trade to Earn usage continues. Can the buyback program be modified or stopped? While the current plan is for continuous operation, platform governance could potentially adjust parameters based on community input. Found this analysis of the SUN buyback program helpful?

Within those files, researchers found usernames, passwords, repository authentication keys, Active Directory credentials, database connection strings, FTP credentials, cloud environment access keys, LDAP configuration details, helpdesk API keys, and even recordings of SSH sessions. “We’ve been rifling through platforms that developers use to quickly format their input – like JSONFormatter and CodeBeautify. And yes, you are correct – it went exactly as badly as you might expect,” watchTowr’s blog post published on Tuesday. Online utilities such as JSONFormatter and CodeBeautify are meant to beautify or validate data formats, where devs paste snippets of code or configuration files into them to troubleshoot formatting issues. But according to researchers, many employees are unknowingly pasting entire files that contain live secrets from production systems. JSON and CodeBeautify leak data from government, banks, and healthcare According to the security firm, the leaked data flaw has yet to affect three platforms, including GitHub repositories, Postman workspaces, and DockerHub containers. However, it found five years of historical content from JSONFormatter and one year of historical content from CodeBeautify, totaling more than 5 gigabytes of enriched and annotated JSON material. “The popularity is so great that the sole developer behind these tools is fairly inspired – with a typical visit to any tool homepage triggering 500+ web requests pretty quickly to generate what we assume is some sweet, sweet affiliate marketing revenue,” the cybersecurity group explained. watchTowr Labs said organizations from industries like national infrastructure, government agencies, major financial institutions, insurance companies, technology providers, retail firms, aerospace organizations, telecoms, hospitals, universities, travel businesses, and even cybersecurity vendors have all had their private information exposed. “These tools are extremely popular, appearing near the top of search results for terms like ‘JSON beautify’ and ‘best place to paste secrets’ (probably, unproven), used by organizations and administrators in both enterprise environments and for personal projects,” Security researcher Jake Knott wrote in the blog post. watchTowr Labs listed several categories of sensitive data found within the exposed files like Active Directory credentials, code repository authentication keys, database access details, LDAP configuration information, cloud environment keys, FTP login credentials, CI/CD pipeline keys, private keys, and full API requests and responses with sensitive parameters. Investigators also mentioned Jenkins secrets, encrypted configuration files belonging to a cybersecurity firm, Know Your Customer information from banks, and AWS credentials belonging to a major financial exchange that were connected to Splunk systems. watchTowr: Malicious actors are scraping the leaks According to watchTowr Labs’ damage analysis, many of the leaked keys have been collected and tested by unknown parties. In an experiment, researchers uploaded fake AWS access keys to one of the formatting platforms, and in just under two days, malicious actors attempted to abuse the credentials. “Mostly because someone is already exploiting it, and this is all really, really stupid,” Knott continued, “we don’t need more AI-driven agentic agent platforms; we need fewer critical organizations pasting credentials into random websites.” JSONFormatter and CodeBeautify temporarily disabled their save functionality in September, when the security flaw was brought to their attention. JSONFormatter it was “working on to make it better,” while CodeBeautify said it was implementing new “enhanced NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content prevention measures.” Security issue in HashiCorp’s Vault Terraform Provider Away from the leaked credentials, the San Francisco-based IBM company HashiCorp found a vulnerability that could allow attackers to bypass authentication in its Vault Terraform Provider. The firm provides developers, businesses, and security organizations with cloud-computing infrastructure and protection services. Per the software company’s findings shared on Tuesday, the Vault Terraform flaw affects versions v4.2.0 through v5.4.0 from an insecure default configuration in the LDAP authentication method. The issue arises because the “deny_null_bind” parameter is set to false instead of true when the provider configures Vault’s LDAP authentication backend. The parameter determines if the Vault rejects a wrong password or unauthenticated binds. If the connected LDAP server allows anonymous binds, attackers can authenticate and access accounts without any valid credentials. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Kakao is reportedly establishing blockchain infrastructure for its own stablecoin and has opened new recruitment for blockchain service backend developers. The position demands a deep understanding of smart contracts and token standards. Per a local media report , the recruit will be responsible for designing new blockchain-based service structures, managing keys, and building transaction processing systems. “This recruitment is to supplement human resources for research on blockchain and stablecoin technologies and to examine their applicability to financial services,” a Kakao Bank official said. The company CFO Kwon Tae-hoon said at KakaoBank’s first-half 2025 earnings call in August that the firm is entering the growing stablecoin market. Further, Kakao Group, the parent IT firm, announced a stablecoin task force and holding weekly discussions to consolidate strategy. South Korea's KakaoBank is “reviewing” various methods, including the issuance of a won-backed stablecoin and digital asset custody. #KakaoBank #Stablecoin #SouthKoreaStablecoin https://t.co/QyrOomK2RE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 7, 2025 KakaoBank Lays Foundation for Token Offering The bank is also planning for its security token offering (STO) , leveraging blockchain, the report added. KakaoBank has signed partnerships with Korea Investment & Securities and Lucent Block to develop blockchain-based STO financial products and systems. This comes days after South Korea advanced token securities issuance with legislative amendments to the Electronic Securities Act and the Capital Markets Act. The changes lay the groundwork for the STO circulation market to open in H1 2026. Further, the country’s financial industry estimates that its security token offerings (STO) market could be worth $287 billion by 2030. The stablecoin race in South Korea started after President Lee pledged to launch a KRW-pegged coin for use in business and international trade. Kakao Joins Stablecoin Race With Naver The bank’s announcement arrives shortly after South Korean tech giant Naver reported launching a wallet service for local stablecoin in Busan city. Naver said it has partnered with venture capital firm Hashed and the Busan Digital Asset Exchange (BDAN). Besides, Naver Financial has moved toward a merger with Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange. Like KakaoPay, Naver has its own payment platform, used by 30 million people monthly. Both Kakao and Naver are expected to use their millions of user base to gain stablecoin traction.

Key Takeaways: Monad faced spoofed ERC-20 transfers just two days after launch, creating fake activity on explorers. Attackers exploited the ERC-20 standard by emitting misleading events that mimic real wallet activity. The spoofed transfers aim to mislead users during the network’s early, high-traffic onboarding period. The issue emerged just as early recipients gained access to their airdropped and publicly sold tokens, marking the chain’s first meaningful window of liquidity and user onboarding. The first warnings came from Monad CTO and co-founder James Hunsaker, who revealed that several suspicious transactions were appearing on blockchain explorers. Fake ERC-20 Transfers Surface as Attackers Mimic Wallet Activity on Monad These transfers looked identical to standard ERC-20 movements, yet no funds were actually moved and no signatures were issued from the wallets being impersonated. “Warning – there are fake ERC-20 transfers pretending to be from my wallet,” Hunsaker wrote on X , crediting a community member who spotted the activity. According to Hunsaker, the problem stems from how ERC-20 token contracts are structured rather than from a flaw in Monad’s blockchain. ERC-20 is merely an interface standard, which means anyone can deploy a contract that fulfills the minimum function requirements while inserting arbitrary or misleading address data. With that structure, malicious actors can emit events that resemble legitimate transfers, creating the illusion of activity without triggering any real wallet approvals. The spoofing technique is familiar across EVM-based ecosystems. Attackers deploy their own contracts and emit events that explorers interpret as valid token transfers, even though no tokens have moved. In one example shared by Hunsaker, the fraudulent contract generated fake swap calls and simulated trading patterns around the MON ecosystem, making the activity appear authentic to a casual observer checking transaction history. it's not a bug, but yes it is spoofing within their smart contract to try to trick people — James (mainnet arc) (@_jhunsaker) November 25, 2025 These fake transfers likely aim to exploit the chaotic early hours of a new network, when users are opening wallets, claiming tokens, and monitoring liquidity. By creating the appearance of active trading and movement, attackers hope to mislead users into interacting with contracts or tokens that appear trustworthy. MON Surges 43% as 76,000 Wallets Claim Tokens Following Monad’s Launch The activity comes at a busy moment for Monad . More than 76,000 wallets claimed MON in the weeks leading up to launch, but tokens only became accessible once the network went live on Monday. MON rose 19% on its first day and is now up 43%, with a market cap near $500 million, according to CoinGecko. Monad positions itself as a high-performance, EVM-compatible chain capable of parallel transaction processing, a model aimed at capturing users frustrated with Ethereum’s congestion and competing directly with platforms like Solana.

The explosive gains emerged minutes after Upbit announced the PLUME/KRW pair.

PLUME exhibits a bullish momentum after overcoming the consolidation zone at $0.0417, which now serves as a crucial support barrier. Stability above this region could encourage further buying actions. Meanwhile, bulls should prepare for the nearest resistance between $0.0463 and $0.0481. The area has seen notable seller momentum, suggesting potential downward pressure here. Meanwhile, breaching $0.0481 could support extended gains, targeting $0.057. That would mean a roughly 24% increase from PLUME’s current price. However, the reality is that tokens hardly post continued gains with exchange listing as the primary catalyst. The hype is often short-lived, with substantial declines following, especially amid broad-based selling pressure.

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently pointed to a disturbing trend of crypto market manipulation by large institutions. His revelations shed light on why retail investors often bear the brunt of market volatility while big players profit massively. What Exactly is Crypto Market Manipulation? Charles Hoskinson describes a sophisticated form of crypto market manipulation where institutions artificially inflate prices before executing massive sell-offs. This pump-and-dump strategy involves: Accumulating large positions in cryptocurrencies Artificially driving up prices through coordinated buying Switching to short positions at peak prices Executing large-scale sell-offs that crash the market How Do Institutions Profit From Market Manipulation? The mechanics of this crypto market manipulation are both simple and devastating. Firms like Citadel allegedly drive up prices, then switch to short positions, reaping tens of billions in profits. Meanwhile, retail investors and market makers suffer substantial losses. This systematic exploitation has become standard practice in the industry. Why is Recovery So Slow After Market Crashes? Hoskinson argues that repeated crypto market manipulation has created lasting damage to investor confidence. The cycle of artificial pumps followed by dramatic dumps leaves markets struggling to recover. Retail investors, having learned nothing from the 2021 bull market, continue to suffer while institutions greedily profit from each cycle. Can Regulation Stop Crypto Market Manipulation? There is hope on the horizon. Hoskinson suggests that the CLARITY Act, a crypto market structure bill potentially passing in the U.S. next year, could restore stability and trust. This legislation aims to: Create clearer regulatory frameworks Establish better market oversight Protect retail investors from manipulation Encourage broader crypto adoption What Does the Future Hold for Crypto Markets? Despite current challenges, Hoskinson remains optimistic about gradual market recovery. He projects that proper regulation could spur massive adoption and potentially push Bitcoin to $250,000 by the end of 2026. The key lies in addressing the systemic crypto market manipulation that currently plagues the industry. Frequently Asked Questions What is pump-and-dump in cryptocurrency? Pump-and-dump is a form of crypto market manipulation where large buyers artificially inflate prices before selling their holdings at peak values, causing prices to crash. How does crypto market manipulation affect retail investors? Retail investors typically buy during artificial price pumps and suffer losses when institutions execute their dump strategy, often losing significant portions of their investments. Can regulation prevent crypto market manipulation? While no regulation can completely eliminate manipulation, proper oversight and transparency requirements can significantly reduce its frequency and impact. What is the CLARITY Act? The CLARITY Act is proposed U.S. legislation that would establish clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency markets and help combat manipulation practices. How can investors protect themselves from market manipulation? Investors should research thoroughly, avoid FOMO buying during rapid price increases, diversify investments, and understand market fundamentals rather than chasing short-term trends. Is all crypto market volatility caused by manipulation? Not all volatility results from manipulation—genuine market forces, news events, and technological developments also drive price movements—but manipulation exacerbates natural volatility.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $11.16, with a possible maximum trading value of $11.91 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $17.86 and $19.35, with an average price of $18.60. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions.

Technical indicators give bearish signals, and the price charts also project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, bringing the price to $2.19 during the day. The RSI decreased to 47.28 at the same time, but is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.72 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the start of the next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $19.35 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that the Canary XRP ETF will launch in November. Asset manager, Canary, has submitted an updated S-1 registration statement to the SEC for its XRP spot ETF, which, according to the news, is set to start trading on November 13, 2025.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October, XRP was trending near the $2.90 mark, and in November, it has fallen to the $2.40 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-26 08:45:55
54920688,https://invezz.com/?p=2981608,1764147472,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,South Korea’s KakaoBank begins hiring as it moves forward with stablecoin development,https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/26/south-koreas-kakaobank-begins-hiring-as-it-moves-forward-with-stablecoin-development/,"South Korea’s KakaoBank is advancing its plans to develop a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, even as regulators in the country remain divided over how to structure a national stablecoin framework. According to local media and a hiring notice that can be found on its official website, KakaoBank has recently started hiring blockchain backend developers to help build out the infrastructure needed to develop its planned stablecoin, “Kakao Coin.” KakaoBank is a mobile-first digital bank that is backed by Kakao Corporation , and it offers a full range of financial services through its app-based platform, including savings accounts, loans, and payment features. KakaoBank’s past experience to support stablecoin rollout The bank has been exploring the potential of blockchain-based financial products for quite some time now, and earlier this year, KakaoBank’s chief financial officer, Kwon Tae-hoon, confirmed that the bank had started evaluating stablecoin issuance and digital asset custody as part of its broader digital finance strategy. At the time, Kwon said the bank was “reviewing various methods such as issuance and custody” and that it planned to “actively participate” in the digital asset space. KakaoBank was an active participant in South Korea’s central bank digital currency pilot, which was led by the Bank of Korea, and according to Kwon, it had successfully executed wallet creation, remittance trials, and asset exchange functionalities during the test phase. “For the past three years, we have been issuing real-name verified accounts for virtual asset exchanges and have been operating risk-related measures such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)-based monitoring,” Kwon said, adding that the bank’s prior experience would offer a competitive advantage in rolling out its stablecoin-oriented products. The bank had been laying the groundwork for a stablecoin launch since as early as June, when it was reported that it had filed several trademarks related to potential stablecoin products, including brand names like BKRW and KRWB with the Korean Intellectual Property Office. Fast forward to November, the digital bank is now looking to hire key roles, including backend developers with a solid understanding of smart contracts, token standards, and full node operations, signaling that it has moved from planning to actual technical development. While no other official details regarding the scope or timeline of the stablecoin launch are available at the moment, KakaoBank is not alone in its pursuit of Korean won-pegged stablecoins in South Korea. South Korea’s stablecoin appetite Since the election of pro-crypto President Lee Jae-myung earlier this year, the Korean won-stablecoin market has become a key area of focus for both government-backed innovation efforts and private sector competition. Kakao is joining other major tech and financial institutions like Naver, which has begun developing its own digital wallet service linked to a local stablecoin initiative in Busan. The project is part of a larger integration plan between Naver Financial and Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. A number of won-pegged stablecoins have already started surfacing in the market, and more appear to be on the way. Even big names in South Korea’s traditional financial sector, such as KB Financial Group, Shinhan, Hana, and Woori, have formed a consortium and partnered with major tech players, including Kakao, Naver, and Samsung, to explore stablecoin issuance and infrastructure. Stablecoin regulations have stalled However, the regulatory landscape for stablecoins remains in a state of limbo, and progress has faced delays as regulators continue to debate the roles that banks and tech companies should play in this emerging ecosystem. As previously reported by Invezz, the Bank of Korea has been pushing for tighter control over stablecoin issuance and has suggested bringing it under the exclusive purview of licensed banks, arguing that these digital assets function much like deposit instruments. But some lawmakers, regulators, and private sector players are concerned that giving banks too much control may stifle innovation and prevent technology firms from building competitive blockchain-based financial services. At the moment, three separate bills aimed at establishing a legal framework for stablecoins are being reviewed in the National Assembly, but so far, they have failed to make meaningful progress toward finalisation.

Within 24 hours of its launch, MON emerged as the best-performing asset among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. MON Token Hits $0.045 All-Time High Last week, Monad’s token sale kicked off on Coinbase’s new token presale platform, gaining robust momentum by raising approximately $50 million. However, just 12 hours into the sale, that initial enthusiasm began to wane. The fundraising effort only accumulated $95 million of the ambitious $187 million target for Circle’s USDC stablecoin. Yet, once the Monad blockchain launched, investor interest reignited, leading to an impressive over 80% rise in the MON token’s value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Less Than 50% Chance Of Hitting $100,000 By December 31, Says AI Model According to CoinGecko data, this price surge elevated the token to a diluted valuation of about $4 billion. By consolidating its gains, MON has managed to stay above the $0.040 mark, reaching a market capitalization nearing $440 million. Notably, the token also hit an all-time high (ATH) of $0.045 earlier on Tuesday, showcasing the heightened demand for MON in the past day. This rally comes despite a broader challenging environment for the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin (BTC) has retraced more than 30% from its ATH of $126,000 set back in October, and Ethereum (ETH) has struggled above the critical $3,000 level. The mainnet launch was accompanied by the listing of the MON token on several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini (GEMI). Monad Trading Performance Surpasses Hyperliquid According to data from DeFillama, excitement around the MON token goes beyond its price. The Monad blockchain has already processed over three million transactions from around 140,000 addresses, with developers deploying more than 18,000 smart contracts. Investors who participated in the token sale had the opportunity to sell their holdings immediately after the launch. However, Coinbase has issued a warning to discourage early selling, stating that those who choose to sell their tokens within the first 30 days may face reduced allocations in future token sales. This aims to prioritize genuine enthusiasts of the project over traders looking for quick profits. Related Reading: Solana Rebounds Strong as Massive ETF Inflows Reinforce $128 Support Zone Furthermore, trading volume for MON on the Solana (SOL) blockchain exceeded $87 million in just 24 hours, surpassing the trading volume on Monad itself. This performance outstripped that of Hyperliquid (HYPE) by 149% and positioned MON ahead of platforms such as KuCoin, Gate, Kraken, and Bitget, making Solana the fifth-largest venue by total trading volume across exchanges.

54919842,634449,1764147607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54919842.jpeg,Hoskinson Claims Cardano Revival Starts Now: Here’s What’s Coming,https://bitcoinist.com/hoskinson-cardano-revival-starts-now/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson used his late-November 25 livestream to argue that, despite the recent hack, FBI drama and social-media firestorms, “overall, Cardano is really healthy.” He insisted that the protocol side of the recent incident is largely behind them, saying, “we recovered… we’re on the other side of it, we’re in cleanup mode,” and claimed Cardano will “finish pretty strong towards the end of the year.” The revival he sketched rests on Midnight, RealFi, a renewed DeFi push and a more aggressive scaling roadmap. Hoskinson Predicts A 2026 Cardano Revival At the core is Midnight’s Glacier Drop. Reading from a “State of the Network” memo prepared by the Midnight Foundation, Hoskinson said the airdrop “was the largest distribution event in the history of cryptocurrencies,” stressing, “this is not puffery, we have the numbers.” The Scavenger Mine phase closed on November 20 “with over 4.5 billion NIGHT claims registered across more than 8 million participating addresses.” He called the architecture “a new standard for token distribution” that combines “a broad community-driven allocation” with mechanisms “to increase fairness and systemic integrity.” The airdrop now shifts into a 450-day redemption phase starting December 8, during which NIGHT unlocks in four equal installments. A “lost and found” mechanism lets users who later recover private keys still claim, which Hoskinson openly framed as an incentive for custodial platforms: “ As Midnight goes up in value, they realize that they can redeem on behalf of their users and do an exchange distribution and take their cut.” He said Kraken, OKX, Bitpanda and NBX will distribute NIGHT to eligible KYC’d users, so “tens of millions potentially could be viable.” December 8 is also the token’s trading debut, which he described as bringing “tier one listings for the first time ever for a Cardano native asset,” ahead of a federated Midnight mainnet in Q1. Hoskinson argued that Midnight is more than a high-profile airdrop; it is the lever that will force Cardano’s stalled DeFi pipeline to move. Looking back at 2024, he said there were KPIs they “hit very strongly,” such as launching the on-chain Treasury, making the first Treasury payout and fully decentralising the Constitutional Committee, but admitted that “we lagged behind in integrations and the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. It just couldn’t get coordinated and done.” With Midnight in production, he claimed that in 2026 “there’s no optionality. It must get done. An exceedingly aggressive organization is basically forcing that to get done whether people like it or not, kicking and screaming.” He underlined the different posture he expects from the new entity: “The Midnight Foundation will be an active participant in DeFi, unlike the Cardano Foundation… that alone is going to bring a lot of TVL.” RealFi is billed as the second engine of that revival. Hoskinson spotlighted RealFi, a lending platform that, he said, has already issued “over 1 million loans in Kenya and Uganda with my money just to test our credit model and our MFI relationships and how we process these types of things.” These are fast 30- to 90-day micro-loans that are now being “translated… into the DeFi world to be launched on Cardano.” He predicted RealFi “is going to be the single biggest driver along with Midnight for TVL and transactions on Cardano in the Cardano ecosystem.” RealFi, he added, represents “the aggregation of 10 years of careful thinking about how to do” banking the unbanked at scale. Scaling And Cross-Chain Efforts On the scaling side, Hoskinson said the Leios team is “building up faster than any other team we’ve had,” declaring, “we got to get Leios out next year, there’s no if, ands, buts about it.” Hydra, he noted, is already in mainnet use “with Delta DeFi, the Glacier Drop, Hydra Doom as well as the vending machine project,” and IOHK has been meeting with core contributors “about how we can unify the Hydra community and ecosystem together… so we can have dapp-by-dapp acceleration.” He said upcoming work on StarStream , Plutus V4 and Aiken, together with Leios “at the base ledger,” is intended to “speed things up tremendously.” Having “learned our lesson,” he said, future base-layer and L2 components will be co-developed “hand and glove” rather than with the long lag that separated Cardano and Hydra. Midnight’s reach is also meant to be cross-chain. Hoskinson reiterated that “the raison d’être of Midnight is it’s a layer two to everybody,” but said bridges will open gradually, roughly every two months, each one enabling “a hybrid dapp” on a new ecosystem and creating “a nice constant news cycle.” Behind the recent meme exchanges with Solana, he claimed, “we’re already talking about Midnight on Solana for privacy for Solana contracts and all types of RWAs,” before adding, “the reality is we’re all friends now.” Hoskinson closed by acknowledging that 2025 “has been an incredibly, incredibly tough year,” citing more than 200 days of travel, four deaths “close to me” and an ongoing struggle with weight and stress, but insisted he is “doing okay.” The point of enduring that, he argued, is precisely the long-term revival he now claims has begun. “We can do anything if we put our mind to it,” he said. “We know our KPIs. We know what to do. And we know how to get it done. And we have wonderful products like Midnight to represent that. Lace to represent that. RealFi to represent that. Cardano to represent that.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.4238.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|SOL|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-26 09:00:07

Krak offers 1% cashback on every purchase and offers access to over 400 currencies across 160 countries. Best Wallet targets 40% wallet market share by 2026, pairing Fireblocks MPC security, presale access, and a planned ‘Best Card’ to challenge exchange-centric debit models. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale has raised over $17.5M so far, and it’s set to end in just two days. Not much time left to get in. Kraken has rolled out its Krak Mastercard debit app across the EU and UK, letting you spend multiple crypto assets in real time anywhere Mastercard is accepted. The card offers a 1% cashback on every spend and allows you to spend 400+ currencies with 110+ merchants across 160 countries. Kraken posted the official news on X , announcing several upcoming features, like the 10% flexible APY marked with a ‘coming soon’ tag. Kraken’s move is big. Instead of shuffling funds between exchanges and banks, you can now tap-to-pay in fiat while Kraken handles instant crypto conversion in the background. That shift matters. For years, crypto usage has been dominated by trading, yield strategies, and speculative NFTs. Everyday payments stayed stuck in the ‘coming soon’ phase, limited by clunky cards, latency issues, and regulatory gray zones. Kraken shows that regulated exchanges are ready to compete directly with banks on payments and user experience. It also raises a bigger question: if exchanges are becoming banks, what happens to wallets? That’s where Best Wallet is trying to position itself. The team has hinted at a ‘Best Card’ product on its roadmap, aiming to pair a non-custodial, Fireblocks-powered mobile wallet with debit-style spending and curated token access. If you want to support the project, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is available in presale today. Crypto Debit Cards Signal the Next Payment Rail Battle Kraken’s launch lands in a crowded but still experimental field. Binance, Crypto.com, and Coinbase have all tested card programs, but most rely on a single-asset funding model or slow top-ups that feel closer to prepaid cards than native digital money. Few deliver true multi-asset, real-time spending tied into a broader Web3 stack. The direction of travel is clear: users want to hold volatile assets like $BTC, $ETH, or stablecoins, then spend seamlessly in fiat without managing FX, gas, or bridge risks. That means whoever owns the ‘default spend’ experience – exchange app, neobank, or wallet – controls a powerful on-ramp to the rest of the ecosystem, from staking to NFTs. Wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Phantom are experimenting with card integrations, yet most still feel like developer tools with payment features bolted on top, not true consumer banking replacements. In that context, Best Wallet is one of several new entrants designing their product around a card from day one, not as an afterthought. The goal is to fuse the simplicity of a neobank app with the composability of DeFi – so your wallet + card becomes your main financial hub, not just a sidecar to a centralized exchange. Read our full Best Wallet review here. Why Best Wallet’s “Best Card” Bet Stands Out Where many wallets focus on a single pain point – like cheaper swaps or NFT galleries – Best Wallet is going after the full stack: custody, discovery, trading, and eventually payments. The project is aiming for 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026, positioning itself as the easiest, safest option with the broadest benefits. Technically, the platform leans on Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP infrastructure for its non-custodial wallet, targeting institutional-grade key management in a mobile-first app. That means private keys are never stored in one place, reducing single points of failure while still letting you manage multi-wallet portfolios and thousands of tokens from a single interface. The team is also building an Upcoming Tokens portal for vetted presales and early-stage launches, plus a Rubic-powered DEX aggregator routing orders over 330 DEXs, and 30 cross-chain bridges. In practice, that could let you discover a new token, buy into its presale, then later spend profits through a future Best Card – without leaving the Best Wallet ecosystem. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale has already raised over $17.5M, with $BEST currently priced at $0.026005. The long-term perspective is tempting to say the least. Based on Best Wallet’s present and upcoming features and the high investor participation during the presale phase, our price prediction for $BEST hints at a potential $0.62 in 2026. This price point could turn to $0.82 by 2030, possibly higher once the service hits the mainstream. In terms of raw profit, we’re talking about a 1-year ROI of 2,284% and a 5-year one of 3,053% or higher. To get ahead of that curve, you can explore the ecosystem now and, if it fits your thesis, read our guide on how to buy $BEST today. The presale is set to end in two days, so the opportunity window is nearly closed. Purchase your $BEST on the official presale page now. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR before investing.

54920421,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=868291,1764147638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54920421.jpeg,Spain party Sumar seeks crypto tax hike in legislative proposal,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/spains-sumar-legislative-taxes-bitcoin-xrp/,"Spain’s Sumar Parliamentary Group has submitted a legislative proposal to Congress that could significantly increase the tax burden on Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and other crypto assets. The Sumar is looking to make three amendments to a bill implementing Spain’s transposition of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The legislations in question include General Tax Law 58/2003, Law 35/2006 on personal income tax (IRPF), and Law 29/1987 that covers inheritance and donation tax. Under the plan, individual gains from digital assets would be changed from the current savings base taxed at rates up to 30% to Spain’s general income tax base, which can go as high as 47%. Corporate tax treatment would also change, establishing a fixed 30% rate on crypto-related profits. Samar group issued amendments, adding ‘risk traffic’ tag to crypto assets According to congressional records submitted to the parliament on November 5, the amendments instructed the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to introduce a standardized “risk traffic light” for cryptos. The visual warning would be mandatory on all crypto investment platforms in Spain and would assess if a project is officially registered, supervised, or backed by reserves, and its liquidity profile. “There is no justification for establishing different treatment between regulated and unregulated crypto-assets in the order of attachment, since both share the same economic nature, are digital representations of value or rights that can be transmitted and stored electronically, and may be attachable in accordance with the general criteria of ownership, availability, and liquidity,” the proposed bill read. Proponents of the law changes believe it will help retail investors understand the risks of digital assets rather than going into the exponential market blindly. But some economists and pro-crypto lobbyists say tax increments are just “bureaucracy” and do little to address concerns in Spain’s crypto regulatory approach. According to tax advisor José Antonio Bravo Mateu, the proposal is a “useless attack against Bitcoin, which is resistant against political attacks”. In a statement written on X last Monday, Mateu surmised that assets held in self-custody wallets cannot be supervised or seized through conventional processes, so the government may not be able to enforce the new framework. “The only thing they achieve with these measures is that their holders residing in Spain think about fleeing when BTC rises so much that they don’t care what politicians say”, he said. Moreover, per Lawyer Chris Carrascosa, the approach is “unenforceable” because cryptoassets not regulated by MiCA , like Tether (USDT), cannot be held by centralized and authorized custodians. Without an entity responsible for custody, assets of that kind cannot be seized by authorities. “This modification is meaningless, impracticable and adds no value. On the contrary, it complicates the lives of CASPs who are the ones who ultimately have to execute seizure orders”, he said. According to his interpretation, approval of the amendments “will mean animal chaos throughout the crypto tax regime in Spain”. Carrascosa asked Spanish lawmakers to reconsider the changes because the country is already struggling with a “complex and suffocating tax system”. Alongside Sumar’s amendments, a separate proposal was forwarded by Treasury inspectors Juan Faus and José María Gentil to tax Bitcoin profits differently from other digital assets. Spain is still building a crypto oversight framework, crackdowns continue The Spanish government made several changes to its crypto oversight laws over the past year, with new regulations now requiring individuals to report all digital asset holdings, transactions, and balances. Crypto service providers are required to report transactions to the Bank of Spain and the CNMV, which aligns with Spain’s policies and the EU’s MiCA framework, aimed at curbing tax evasion and fraud. In early November, Cryptopolitan reported about the arrest of a man by Spanish police, accused of orchestrating a €260 million international investment scam on crypto, gold, and luxury goods. The suspect, known as A.R. and using the alias “CryptoSpain” online, allegedly managed the Madeira Invest Club, which launched its operations in 2023. According to the Ministry of Interior, the scheme lured more than 3,000 victims by promising guaranteed returns on crypto contracts, real estate, luxury vehicles, whisky, and digital art. The operation was ongoing in at least ten countries, including Portugal, the United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, and Hong Kong.

Launch Trezor Suite application (desktop, browser extension, or mobile app depending on your platform) and ensure your firmware is updated to the latest version for optimal security and compatibility. Step 2: Navigate to the Trade Section Within Trezor Suite, access the Trade section from the main navigation menu. Select the “Swap” option to initiate a cryptocurrency exchange. Choose the account containing the cryptocurrency you wish to exchange from the dropdown menu. Step 3: Configure Your Exchange Enter the amount you want to swap and select both the source cryptocurrency (what you’re trading from) and destination cryptocurrency (what you’re trading to). Trezor Suite will automatically query rates from all partner exchanges through Invity, displaying available offers with associated fees, processing times, and KYC policy. Step 4: Compare and Select an Exchange Review the available offers from partner exchanges including GODEX, Changelly, ChangeNOW, and others. Compare exchange rates, total fees, estimated processing times, and privacy policies. Select your preferred offer based on your priorities for price, speed, or anonymity. Step 5: Confirm Transaction Details Verify the destination address where you’ll receive the swapped cryptocurrency. This can be another account on your Trezor or an external wallet address. Review the exchange rate, network fees, and total amount you’ll receive. Most exchanges display all costs upfront with no hidden charges. Step 6: Authorize on Your Trezor When prompted, verify all transaction details on your Trezor device’s trusted display. Confirm the receiving address matches your intended destination and the exchange amount is correct. Use your Trezor’s physical button or touchscreen to authorize the transaction, ensuring your private keys never leave the secure hardware environment. Step 7: Complete the Exchange After authorization, your cryptocurrency will be sent to the exchange partner’s processing address. Track the transaction status through Trezor Suite, which provides real-time updates as the swap progresses. Most exchanges complete within 5-30 minutes depending on blockchain confirmation times and the specific cryptocurrencies involved. Frequently Asked Questions Q: Are Trezor-integrated exchanges safer than regular crypto exchanges? Yes, they eliminate custodial risk by keeping your private keys on the hardware wallet throughout the exchange process, protecting against hacks and platform failures. Q: Do I need KYC verification to use Trezor exchange integrations? It varies by platform. GODEX and most partners offer instant-access swaps, while some may require verification for large transactions or specific regions. Q: What are the typical fees for exchanging crypto through Trezor? Fees include network transaction costs plus exchange service charges, typically ranging from 0.5% to 2% depending on the platform and trading pair selected. Q: Can I cancel a transaction after authorizing it on my Trezor? Once blockchain confirmations begin, cancellation is generally not possible. Always verify all details on your Trezor display before authorizing transactions. Q: Which Trezor models support exchange integrations? All current Trezor models (Model One, Model T, Safe 3, Safe 5, Safe 7) support exchange functionality through Trezor Suite with compatible partner platforms. Conclusion Trezor’s integration with carefully vetted cryptocurrency exchange platforms represents the evolution of secure digital asset trading, combining cold storage security with trading convenience.

54920265,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/memex-is-building-the-first-socialfi-powered-meme-coin-economy,1764148137,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/54920265.jpeg,MemeX Is Building the First SocialFi-powered Meme Coin Economy,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/memex-is-building-the-first-socialfi-powered-meme-coin-economy,"For years, meme coins have fueled some of the most entertaining and unpredictable moments in crypto. They rally communities, dominate social feeds, and turn inside jokes into global conversations. But beneath the surface, one thing has always been missing. The people who create this momentum rarely see value from the markets they inspire. MemeX wants to end that disconnect. Through a SocialFi driven approach, the platform’s new Creator Rewards Program introduces a structure where meme coin creators and traders earn directly from the activity they generate. It is an attempt to build a more balanced, community powered ecosystem, and its first major feature, Trading Rewards, could become the foundation for a completely new type of SocialFi enabled memecoin economy. A SocialFi System Built To Put Users First At the heart of Trading Rewards is a simple and surprisingly efficient cycle. Here is how it works: A trader buys or sells a token on MemeX. MemeX collects a 2.5 percent fee. MemeX uses that fee to buy the trader’s tokens from the open market. The purchased tokens are given to the creator of that meme coin. Nothing is kept as platform profit. Every part of the fee flows back into the ecosystem. This creates a SocialFi aligned loop where users are rewarded for participation, contribution, and community engagement. The system not only supports token markets with steady buy pressure, it also ensures creators earn from the cultural and social impact they produce. Once a trader reaches one hundred M tokens in total volume, MemeX begins daily buybacks on their activity and resets the counter. The cycle is continuous, transparent, and measurable. Why This Matters For Creators And Traders Meme coins are built on excitement, and creators are the spark that ignites it. Yet they typically receive nothing from the trading activity they generate. MemeX is flipping this dynamic. With Trading Rewards, creators gain: • Ongoing token distributions• Rewards tied to real activity• Price support generated by their communities This is SocialFi in practice: users earn from the social influence they create. Traders also gain a meaningful advantage. Every time they trade, MemeX uses the fee to buy their tokens, placing consistent support under the markets they participate in. Active involvement becomes economically meaningful, not just speculative. A Reinvention Of Trading Fees To fund this new system, MemeX has introduced a 2.5 percent fee before and after maximum bonding curve. The entire amount is used for Trading Rewards. According to the team, the rate may evolve as the platform scales, but the principle will not change. The community must remain the primary beneficiary. The platform has already prepared a retroactive reward distribution for early participants. A snapshot on October 20 captured all activity from launch until that date. Every fee collected during that period will be used to buy trader tokens and redistribute them to creators. With millions of pre registered users and a number one ranking on Kaito Mindshare, MemeX is positioning itself not as another memecoin tool, but as a full SocialFi ecosystem where creativity, participation, and community influence have tangible value. Trading Rewards is only the beginning. About MemeX MemeX is the leading meme coin launchpad built on the MemeCore mainnet. It allows anyone to create and trade meme coins instantly with no technical experience. With a community first design and more than 2.5 million pre registrations, MemeX is building the most accessible SocialFi powered ecosystem in the meme coin industry.

Nazarov claimed that the main factors pushing DeFi into the mainstream will be more transparent regulations, institutional involvement, and U.S. policy leadership. He added that DeFi, which is peer-to-peer financial services based on blockchain networks, could achieve 50% global adoption if more precise regulations and laws can demonstrate its dependability. Michael Egorov, the inventor of Curve Finance, had a similar view. He stated that legal and regulatory uncertainty, along with the obligation to adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering regulations, are the primary challenges to DeFi adoption. Nazarov reveals institutional push for DeFi adoption • Institutional adoption accelerating with greater regulatory clarity • Why highly reliable infra matters more than ever • CRE unlocking the next phase of tokenization @SergeyNazarov discusses these trends and much more on @CryptoMichNL ’s New Era Finance Podcast ↓ https://t.co/QuCeklyV4O — Chainlink (@chainlink) November 25, 2025 According to Sergey Nazarov, institutional involvement in Web3 has increased, and the majority of the sessions at the most recent SmartCon had a distinct institutional focus. He claimed that big financial firms are increasingly using blockchain technology since the sector has matured, and adoption is accelerating. Nazarov stated that the world has changed for DeFi, and the transformation is moving more quickly toward institutional adoption. “When we’re thinking about DeFi, it’s something of a buzzword, but really we should be looking to on-chain markets and on-chain applications and thinking about the features of these applications as well as where there’s an actual intermediary involved.” Michael Selig , Chief Counsel for the crypto task force at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to Nazarov, DeFi global acceptance will reach around 70% when institutional users have a clear and effective means to invest their capital and clients’ money in DeFi. Nazarov forecast that full worldwide adoption wouldn’t happen until DeFi expanded to the point where its capital base could be essential compared to the funds allotted in traditional banking. Nazarov claimed that clarity of DeFi will swiftly spread from the U.S. He further argued that many governments adopt U.S. practices because they want to be compatible with the U.S. financial system. Institutional adoption drives growth in DeFi lending DeFi lending protocols have gained significant traction recently due to the increasing institutional adoption of tokenized assets and stablecoins. According to the Binance report, DeFi lending procedures have grown by more than 72% year-to-date, from $53 billion at the start of 2025 to over $127 billion in cumulative total value locked (TVL). Factually, DeFi lending protocols are automated frameworks that eliminate the need for financial brokers like banks by facilitating lending and borrowing for investors through smart contracts. The report revealed that Aave Labs’ Horizon continues to dominate the market, with around 54% of the TVL, or approximately $68 billion. Aave Labs’ Horizon is an institutional lending market that allows clients to utilize tokenized RWAs as collateral for stablecoins. According to the report, products such as Horizon “aim to unlock new liquidity and convert RWAs into productive assets within the decentralized finance ecosystem.” Institutions now focus on tokenized financial instruments, such as U.S. Treasury bonds and private credit. According to data from RWA.xyz, tokenized private credit accounts for $18.7 billion of the $35.9 billion total RWAs on-chain, with U.S. Treasurys coming in second at $9.1 billion. The report also revealed that Maple and Euler have both grown quickly to reach almost $3 billion. According to the report, as tokenized assets and stablecoins become more popular, DeFi lending platforms are well-positioned to benefit from the expanding institutional adoption of these core blockchain-based financial technologies. In August, DeFi platforms initiated token buybacks totaling $166 million. According to the Binance report, Hyperliquid and Pump.fun are primarily responsible for the major buybacks, driven by record income on both platforms. Pump.fun has spent more than US$58 million to repurchase its token since launching its token buyback program, which has reduced its circulating supply by over 4%.

Bitcoin drifts under $86,000, XRP can’t break its ceiling, and traders are tired of red charts and stale headlines. But while even the top altcoins to buy snooze through another bearish week, something rare is happening. Digitap ($TAP) has just lit up the scene with its “96 Hours of Madness” event — a four-day storm of nonstop hourly drops, giveaways, token bundles, and bonuses worth over $1 million. Every sixty minutes, a new deal appears. Each one lasts just an hour before it vanishes forever. While XRP’s ETF launch struggles to spark movement, Digitap crypto presale is where the action is! With $2.17 million raised, the round is already 90% complete, and bonuses are climbing by the hour; it’s easily one of the best cryptos to buy now. Grayscale’s XRP ETF Arrives, but Price Reaction Disappoints The headlines should have been bullish. Grayscale’s new XRP ETF (GXRP) hit NYSE Arca this week, joining other funds from Canary Capital and REX Shares. The idea was to open XRP to institutions, unlock new demand, and finally break the price out of its two-year rut. It didn’t happen. XRP sits near $2.16, barely up 2% on the week. On the charts, price still coils inside a descending triangle, pinned between resistance at $2.19–$2.50 and support around $1.90. The Supertrend indicator stays red, the 20-, 50-, and 100-day EMAs are stacked overhead, and Coinglass data shows nearly $23 million in net outflows in 24 hours. ETF approval changed the story but not the trend. Analysts now call XRP “dead money” until 2026 — safe, but stagnant. Digitap ($TAP) Emerges as the Best Crypto Presale to Buy in 2025 Digitap’s fintech platform already does what most tokens only promise. It lets users spend crypto anywhere Visa is accepted, with direct support for Apple Pay and Google Pay. Users can open an account and have both fiat and crypto balances sit side by side. Transfers cost under 1%, and international payments settle instantly. For businesses and freelancers, Digitap offers invoicing, payroll, and multi-currency settlements — a real bridge between blockchain and global finance. With a staking and rewards system that gives cashback on every purchase, loyalty tiers with higher limits, and a buyback-and-burn model that tightens supply, and investors have a product already running while most crypto presales are still writing roadmaps. That working utility is why Digitap’s presale has already pulled in over $2.17 million, selling more than 132 million $TAP tokens. The current price sits at $0.0326, rising to $0.0334 in the next stage, with the confirmed launch at $0.14, which is about 330% potential upside, making it one of the best crypto to buy this November. 96 Hours of Madness — Digitap’s Event Everyone’s Talking About Starting Friday, Digitap launched the most electric presale campaign crypto has seen this year: 96 Hours of Madness. It’s part promotion, part game, and all energy. Every hour brings something new — a flash discount, a token bonus, a product giveaway. Some hours unlock free metal cards or banking credits; others drop massive bundle rewards for the first few buyers. The offers refresh every sixty minutes, and once they’re gone, they’re gone. Here’s how it works: Visitors go to presale.digitap.app and check the live widget. They claim the active deal before the timer runs out.

It leaves market players wondering if it’ll be about to slowly recover or if just around the corner it’ll be headed yet again to break out. In all this market hullabaloo, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) opportunistically makes its move. The presale has garnered it incredible attention in the market, and it’s already over 95% complete in Phase 6 to raise nearly $19 million in the process, indicating it doesn’t just have market players clamoring for it simply for nothing. They’re opting for real utility. Dogecoin Struggles as Market Slide Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to show its usual fluctuations as it constantly pushes towards reaching its resistance but then holds back and falls towards its support level. Since it lost its hold on staying above $0.188, it hasn’t recovered yet and instead has maintained its downtrend; it looks like if it falls further along this trend, it may go to the $0.13 level of support. The continued falls towards its target level and inability to sustain its momentum make it difficult for traders to invest in Dogecoin (DOGE), leading to increased interests in new platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which have shown good early momentum. MUTM Presale Phase 6, Final Window for Early Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows promise to be one of the forefront DeFi cryptos in 2025; it has already garnered over $19 million from 18,230 contributors. At present in Phase 6 priced at $0.035, MUTM boasts an incredible 250% growth from its Phase 1 level of $0.01. Given that over 95% of Phase 6 tokens have been sold out, it’s one of the last chances to purchase tokens at such a reduced rate. As Phase 7 nears completion, the token cost will go up to $0.04; even exchange listings will be priced at $0.06. Early contributors look to reap rewards of up to 500% ROI, cementing MUTM as one of the best cryptocurrencies for early exposure to startups such as these. Converting Platform Activity into Token Growth The buy-and-distribute mechanism in Mutuum Finance benefits token holders as it helps to translate activity on the platform into value for token holders. The fees generated from lending, borrowing, and staking activities result in MUTM tokens being repurchased and distributed to mtToken stakers. This sets up a self-fulfilling cycle of growth, in which increased use of the platforms spur even greater buybacks, which in turn motivate further engagement through staking rewards. In this way, MUTM positions itself as a crypto asset of great DeFi crypto usability and promising growth. Independent Audit The lending and borrowing smart contracts for Mutuum are presently being audited independently by Halborn Security . The audit thoroughly assesses code quality and security to ensure it functions properly and effectively. Updates will be posted as these processes occur. The testnet launch timeline will be confirmed following completion of its audit. One of the major developments for Mutuum Finance would be their new fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD. The main purpose of this development would be to have it as the foundation for their lending and borrowing service. The inclusion of such a stable asset would go on to make MUTM even more reliable and scalable as it would also provide low-risk investment options to their clients. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be one of the few DeFi crypto in its early stages of development by luring over 18,230 contributors to date and raising close to $19 million from its presale. Currently in Phase 6 with tokens valued at $0.035, MUTM tokens have shown tremendous appreciation of 250% from their value in Phase 1 alone, and early contributors are set for a promising ROI of 500%. The project’s efforts to provide value to its users and ensure security and scalability translate to features such as its Buy-back rewards mechanism, testnet Sepolia launch, and Halborn Security audit.

While Bitcoins sought stability above $87,500, altcoins showcased mixed performances. This article evaluates ENA, which outperformed the broader marketplace with a more than 13% surge in the past 24 hours. The rally has grabbed attention as it coincides with substantial accumulation by Ethena Labs. On-chain data shows the synthetic dollar protocol has withdrawn massive amounts of native ENA from centralized exchanges. This development is vital for the project as it indicates long-term holding plans while reducing circulating supply. According to Onchain Lens, wallets linked to Ethena Labs have accumulated over 150 million ENA coins since yesterday. Its new wallet received 105.35 million tokens, worth roughly $28.7 million, from Coinbase Prime today. Additionally, it received 20 million ENA, valued at around $5.45 million, from Bybit.

In this, the protocol bought 25 million ENA, worth $6.7 million from Bybit. The address now holds over 285 million tokens with approximately $76.46 million. Ethena Labs has accumulated more than 150 million tokens from Bybit and Coinbase Prime over the past day. These accumulations come as the broader market bleeds, with experts advising dip-buying. Meanwhile, investors and traders are interpreting the accumulation as a sign of the team’s unwavering confidence in Ethena’s future. Massive withdrawals from CEXs generally reduce selling pressure as few assets remain available for immediate dumps. At the same time, these transfers bolster price stability. ENA price outlook Ethena Labs’s native token trades in green today, following an over 13% increase on the 24-hour timeframe. ENA is trading at $0.2962, with an over 50% increase in daily trading volume, highlighting trader optimism. Chart by Coinmarketcap ENA is currently testing the key resistance zone at $0.30 – $0.32. Further surges can propel prices to $0.36, which requires massive buying activity to overcome. Notably, the region between $0.34 and $0.36 has absorbed buyer momentum previously limiting continued gains. Failure to close above $0.32 would translate to downward pressure for the token. ENA will likely retrace to the key zone at $0.27 or even $0.24 amid extended dips. Nevertheless, continued accumulations by Ethena Labs and improved broader sentiments will fuel further uptrends.

On Tuesday, Ark Invest picked up 174,293 shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, spreading the buy across four of its exchange-traded funds; ARKK, ARKW, ARKQ, and ARKX. Cryptopolitan pegged Alphabet’s closing price at $323.64, meaning the total value of Cathie’s purchase stood at around $56.4 million. This also comes on the same day the Sundar Pichai-led company’s valuation crept closer to $4 trillion, helped by news that Meta might be switching to Google’s AI chips. Investors also piled in after buzz around Gemini, Google’s in-house AI model. Even with Alphabet surging, broader AI-related ETFs dipped as Nvidia, the usual driver, lost ground. Cathie’s team scattered orders across stocks tied to crypto, fintech, semiconductors, and AI infrastructure; some were buys, some were exits. But Alphabet got the largest ticket by far, and it wasn’t even close. Ark grabs Meta, dumps AMD, and buys into CoreWeave On the same day Cathie loaded up Alphabet, she also scooped 33,837 shares of Meta using her ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW funds. The trade, worth around $21.5 million, was priced off Meta’s $636.22 close. Meta’s stock gained 3.78%, despite U.S. senators calling for a full-blown investigation into how the company might have benefited from fraudulent ads. The Meta-Google chatter didn’t just move stocks. It also set off a reaction in the chip space. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped 4.15%, dragged by reports that Meta might stop using Nvidia GPUs in favor of Google’s tensor processing units. That same day, Ark bailed out of 106,651 AMD shares, dumping around $21.98 million across ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW. It wasn’t the only chip move. Ark also picked up 396,198 shares of CoreWeave, worth roughly $28.2 million at the closing price of $71.29. The buy ran through the ARKK and ARKW funds. CoreWeave’s stock was down 3.14%, hit by fears it’s too dependent on Nvidia’s ecosystem just as Meta looks elsewhere. Ark bets on Circle and Block, adds Bitcoin ETF, trims Palantir and GitLab Cathie moved into crypto too. Ark added 96,200 shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, spending about $2.8 million at $29.01 a share through the ARKF and ARKW funds. That followed a smaller buy on Monday when Ark picked up another $1.08 million worth of ARKB. The move came as Bitcoin crashed 23% in 30 days. It’s now trading at $87,948, way down from the $126,000 high it hit just six weeks ago. Ark’s crypto play extended to Circle, the issuer of USDC. Cathie picked up 108,450 shares of Circle through ARKK, dropping about $7.60 million based on a closing price of $70.11. Baird upgraded Circle to Outperform and Bernstein reiterated that call. For Q3, Circle posted $740 million in revenue, $166 million in adjusted EBITDA, and $214 million in net income, a year-on-year spike of 202%. Ark had already poured $15.06 million into Circle the week before. Cathie also picked up 212,538 shares of Jack Dorsey’s Block through ARKK and ARKF, totaling roughly $13.5 million at $63.69 per share. Block had just held its Investor Day, laying out plans to boost its Cash App, roll out more AI-focused tools, and continue stock buybacks. On the exit side, Ark dropped 354,955 shares of Peter Thiel’s Palantir, clearing about $58.05 million at $163.55, even as Palantir’s stock PLTR surged on hopes of Fed rate cuts and a market-wide tech rally. Palantir had beaten its Q3 earnings and issued a better-than-expected forward guidance for 2026, but then shortly after, Cryptopolitan reported that the company’s co-founder Alex Karp had abruptly sold around $96 million of PLTR shares, and Ark cashed out around the same time. Ark also sold off 397,713 shares of GitLab and 216,331 shares of Exact Sciences Corp., both spread across ARKK and other thematic funds. On the other hand, the fund quietly picked up 15,197 shares of Coinbase through ARKK, even as crypto stocks continued to fall under the weight of low liquidity and macro anxiety.

54921321,634507,1764149859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54921321.jpeg,Last Call to Join the Best Wallet Token Presale,https://bitcoinist.com/best-wallet-token-presale-final-hours-before-2025-breakout/,"Quick Facts: Crypto users increasingly rely on wallets for payments, trading, and DeFi, but most existing options remain clunky, fragmented, and poorly optimized for mobile. Established wallet products often sacrifice either security or usability, leaving a wide gap for integrated, non-custodial, mobile-first experiences that feel like modern fintech apps. Best Wallet aims to capture 40% of the wallet market by 2026 with a Fireblocks MPC-CMP-secured app, DEX aggregation, and presale discovery tools. It $BEST Token presale has already raised over $17.5M, and is expected to pump further before it closes in two days’ time. Stablecoins are quietly becoming crypto’s killer app. This year, they’ve become more important in the world of global finance, and things will only grow from there. From becoming the preferred payment mode for B2B companies to everyday spending, stablecoins are making inroads in areas that used to be dominated by fiat and TradFi. But as the money moves on-chain, the spotlight shifts to a different bottleneck: the wallet experience. Most people still juggle multiple apps, clunky browser extensions, and confusing seed phrases just to do basic transactions. On mobile, it gets worse. Many decentralized wallets feel like desktop products shoehorned into a phone screen, with poor UX and little regard for everyday payments or new user onramps. That’s the gap Best Wallet is trying to bridge. Positioned as a next-gen, mobile-first wallet with integrated DeFi, presales, and improved security, it’s drawing attention as stablecoin usage ramps up and crypto payments head mainstream. Instead of just holding tokens, Best Wallet wants to turn your wallet into a full investing and earning hub. With only two days left in its token presale, demand for $BEST is heating up. It has already raised over $17.5M, signaling a real need for the solution it puts on the table. At this rate, it can easily be one of this year’s best crypto presales . Best Wallet Targets the Next Wave of Crypto Users The Best Wallet app offers a non-custodial, no-KYC wallet, allowing you to manage all your transactions directly on your phone. Instead of forcing you to bounce between CEXs, DEXs, and random presale sites, it aims to centralize your Web3 activity into a single mobile-first interface that feels closer to a fintech super app than a legacy wallet. Security sits at the core of the pitch. Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP technology to remove single points of failure, while still keeping you in full control of your keys. On top of that, a built-in DEX aggregator powered by Rubic taps multiple chains, DEXs, and cross-chain bridges so you can route trades from one screen while getting the best rates and lowest fees. Best Wallet is also a great way to find the best new crypto via its Upcoming Token Launchpad. All presales here are carefully vetted, giving you peace of mind when investing in a new project. However, if you want to unlock more value from the wallet, holding its native $BEST token is the way to go. ‘What is Best Wallet Token?’ has all the details you need to know about the project. Can $BEST Become a Breakout Wallet Token in 2025? Right now, you can get $BEST tokens via the Best Wallet Token presale . Each one costs just $0.026005, which is peanuts given the benefits you’ll enjoy as a token holder. These include low transaction fees within the Best Wallet ecosystem, governance rights, and early access to presales in the Token Launchpad. Alternatively, you can stake your tokens as soon as you buy them. Its dynamic rewards rate is currently at 75%, which can still change as more tokens are locked in the staking pool. Want to learn how to buy $BEST tokens? Check out our Best Wallet Token buying guide . You’ll also love the presale if you’re a long-term investor. That’s because $BEST token’s value has the potential to reach anywhere $0.62 by the end of 2026, according to our Best Wallet Token price prediction . Of course, that will depend on a lot of factors, mainly hitting its goal of capturing 40% of the global crypto wallet market by next year. If that’s the case and the token’s price grows according to our forecast, that’s an increase of 2,284% from its current price. Whales are also betting big on the project. Just a few days ago, one person bought over $30K of $BEST tokens , proving yet again the attention the presale has garnered. As stablecoin payments and day-to-day crypto usage continue to grow, wallets that combine security, simplicity, and built-in earning tools are well-positioned to lead the next cycle. The Best Wallet Token presale is betting that you want more from your crypto wallet than a basic token holder, but a full-stack mobile hub for trading and presales. But time is running out for your chance to grab $BEST tokens before listings, so don’t delay. Join the Best Wallet Token presale today.

The post quickly caught the attention of the XRP army. Ripple has made several moves toward a bank charter, and JackTheRippler believes the company will complete that journey in 2026. These moves also raise questions about what a formal banking role could mean for XRP as the company builds new financial tools. RUMORS: @Ripple will officially become a fully licensed bank in the United States next year! #XRP pic.twitter.com/Y1nwTVXOmN — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) November 25, 2025 Ripple’s Push Toward a Bank Charter Ripple has taken clear steps toward a national bank charter. The company wants approval to run a trust bank in the United States. The Ripple National Trust Bank would support custody services, payment flows, and reserves for RLUSD, the company’s stablecoin. Ripple has already submitted its application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The company also moved to position Standard Custody and Trust Company for a Federal Reserve master account . These actions show a direct plan. Ripple wants more control over its operations and a place in the national financial system. The trust bank model fits Ripple’s goals. It gives the company a clean structure for stablecoin oversight and settlement support. It also creates a regulated base for its financial network. Ripple wants to serve institutions that need clear rules. A bank charter would help the company meet those requirements. It also shows that Ripple plans to operate inside the same system that powers major financial firms. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for XRP Ripple’s progress toward a bank license can create real value for XRP. It gives institutions a clear and regulated way to use Ripple’s payment network. A licensed bank can handle settlement, custody, and liquidity with strict oversight. This level of control helps large firms trust the system. That trust makes it easier for them to use XRP in high-volume transactions. Many institutions need fast settlement that removes the friction in traditional systems. XRP offers speed with transparency. A bank charter strengthens this setup by giving Ripple direct access to the national financial system. That access can raise efficiency and reduce costs for partners. As more firms rely on these services, demand for XRP can rise. This growth in utility can support price gains. This would also make XRP a practical tool rather than a speculative asset , and aid its long-term price growth.

Are you wondering if Stellar XLM has what it takes to reach the coveted $1 mark? As one of the most established cryptocurrencies in the market, Stellar Lumens has captured the attention of investors worldwide. This comprehensive Stellar XLM price prediction analysis examines the factors that could drive XLM’s value through 2025-2030 and whether the $1 milestone is within reach. What is Stellar XLM Cryptocurrency? Stellar XLM operates as an open-source, decentralized protocol for digital currency to fiat money transfers. Founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014, the Stellar network enables cross-border transactions between any pair of currencies. The native cryptocurrency, Lumens (XLM), serves as a bridge currency that facilitates multi-currency transactions. Stellar XLM Price Prediction 2025 Our XLM price prediction for 2025 considers several key factors: Market adoption of Stellar’s cross-border payment solutions Partnership developments with financial institutions Overall cryptocurrency market trends Regulatory developments affecting digital assets Based on current growth patterns and technological advancements, we project XLM could reach between $0.35 and $0.55 by the end of 2025. Stellar Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis The Stellar cryptocurrency has demonstrated consistent development activity and network upgrades. Key technical indicators to watch include: Indicator Current Status Impact on Price Transaction Volume Growing Positive Network Activity Increasing Positive Development Updates Regular Positive Market Competition High Neutral/Negative XLM Coin Market Position and Competition The XLM coin faces significant competition in the cross-border payments space. Ripple (XRP) remains its primary competitor, along with traditional financial systems adopting blockchain technology. However, Stellar’s focus on financial inclusion and partnerships with organizations like IBM give it a unique market position. Stellar Lumens Price Prediction 2026-2030 Looking further ahead, our Stellar Lumens long-term forecast considers: Global adoption of blockchain for remittances Central bank digital currency integrations Enterprise adoption trends Technological scalability improvements By 2030, if Stellar achieves widespread adoption in the remittance market and establishes key banking partnerships, XLM could potentially reach the $1 milestone. Will XLM Reach $1? The Realistic Outlook The question every investor wants answered: Will XLM reach $1? Achieving this price point would require: Substantial increase in daily transaction volume Major banking and financial institution partnerships Favorable regulatory environment worldwide Sustained bull market in cryptocurrency While challenging, the $1 target is mathematically possible given Stellar’s current market cap and circulating supply. Key Factors Influencing Stellar XLM Price Several critical elements will determine the future price of Stellar XLM : Regulatory Clarity: Clear regulations could boost institutional adoption Technology Upgrades: Protocol improvements enhance network efficiency Market Partnerships: Banking and fintech collaborations drive usage Global Economic Factors: Currency volatility increases demand for cross-border solutions FAQs About Stellar XLM Price Prediction What is the current circulating supply of XLM? The current circulating supply is approximately 25 billion XLM coins. Who founded Stellar Lumens? Stellar was founded by Jed McCaleb , who also co-founded Ripple. What companies use Stellar technology? Companies like IBM and various financial institutions have implemented Stellar for cross-border payments. How does Stellar differ from Ripple? While both focus on cross-border payments, Stellar targets individual users and small businesses, while Ripple focuses on banking institutions. Is Stellar a good long-term investment? Like all cryptocurrencies, Stellar carries risk but shows promise due to its real-world use cases and growing adoption. Conclusion: The Future of Stellar XLM The journey ahead for Stellar XLM presents both challenges and opportunities. While reaching $1 requires significant market growth and adoption, the fundamental technology and use cases position XLM as a serious contender in the cryptocurrency space. The coming years will be crucial as Stellar continues to build partnerships and enhance its platform capabilities.

After filling the $88,600 Fair Value Gap (FVG), the asset has pulled back and is now sitting just below that key level. Analysts are watching $85,000 and $88,000, as the next move may decide whether BTC climbs to $93,000 or drops toward $75,000. $85K Support and $88K Resistance in Focus According to Crypto Patel, the cryptocurrency is still following the expected technical path. After filling the $88,600 gap, it failed to push higher and is now trading below it. The $85,000 level is now seen as a major support zone. If that holds, the price could reach the $93,000 Bearish Order Block, which also lines up with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement. Source: Crypto Patel/X If BTC fails to stay above $85,000 or reclaim $88,000, pressure may increase. In that case, it could fall toward the $75,000–$76,000 zone. This area has been mapped as a possible support zone with previous buy-side activity. In addition, chart data from Ali Martinez points to a bearish flag pattern. This setup began with a steep drop, followed by a channel trending upward. The lower edge of that channel has now been broken, and BTC is trading below it. The estimated target, based on the pattern’s size, is near $79,000. Liquidity Zones May Guide Next Move Ted noted that there are clusters of liquidity between $80,000 and $83,000 on the downside, and between $92,000 and $93,000 on the upside. He wrote , “If BTC reclaims the $89,000 level, upside liquidity will be swept first,” but added, “If Bitcoin loses the $85,000 level, the downside liquidity will be taken out before a bounce back.” However, Bitcoin is still above a major trendline that has shaped its price for the past four years. As long as it stays above that line, the long-term trend remains stable. Glassnode shared that BTC is still below the short-term holder cost basis but above deeper realized prices. This keeps Bitcoin in a zone where it has room to move in either direction, depending on whether demand returns or selling increases. As CryptoPotato reported , large holders are still accumulating. Since November 11, the number of wallets holding at least 100 BTC has increased by 91. At the same time, small wallet numbers are falling. Some older wallets have moved coins, suggesting that some long-time holders may be reducing exposure.

On this occasion, its decision to loosen the purse strings and make a sizable donation to government officials, to direct towards people on the ground, was spurred by the intense flooding that’s hit the Southeast Asian country this past week. The blockchain charity has pledged $200,000 (nearly 5.3 billion VND) to the region as part of its longstanding commitment to humanitarian aid in Southeast Asia. The financial handover, conducted on November 21 in Ho Chi Minh City, has enabled officials to get straight to work in assisting those who’ve been worst hit by the latest weatherborne crisis to descend on Vietnam. There are hopes that the financial package will make a real difference, particularly in supporting rebuilding efforts now that hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese have been displaced. Binance Charity Returns to Vietnam While the $200,000 donation provided by Binance Charity is substantial, the methodology behind it offers a glimpse into the organization’s evolving strategy. In 2024, following Typhoon Yagi, the charity executed a direct airdrop of $1M in BNB tokens to users – a high-tech solution leveraging the speed of blockchain. However, this latest move routes funds through a socio-political umbrella organization, suggesting a nuanced understanding of disaster zones. When floods wipe out power grids and internet connectivity, digital wallets can be inaccessible. Through working with a local organization that knows the area inside out, Binance Charity can ensure that aid reaches the “last mile” in the form of food and reconstruction materials particularly. “Our hearts go out to everyone affected by these devastating floods,” said Seker SB, Head of APAC at Binance. “We hope this contribution can offer necessary support to those facing immense hardship and help local communities rebuild stronger. Binance Charity remains committed to supporting communities across the region by delivering immediate relief and strengthening long-term resilience.” Making a Real Difference One thing Binance Charity can’t be accused of is virtue signaling: since its inception, it’s donated to over 12,000 causes, with more than 1,570 BTC raised alone from over 2 million donors. Its latest Vietnam donation is the latest link in a chain of sustainability initiatives that includes deploying industrial reverse osmosis filtration systems across 10 Mekong Delta provinces to combat severe saltwater intrusion. Binance Charity has also supported a partnership with the Earthworm Foundation to plant 10,000 trees in Binh Thuan, with the goal of restoring ecosystems that have the potential to prevent future floods of this scale. Given that Vietnam faces volatile weather patterns, the odds are that Binance Charity will be drawn back to the region in future to help again. In the here and now, by committing $200K to Vietnam, Binance Charity has demonstrated that while the digital technology for fundraising is intangible, the impact is undeniably concrete.

The inflow of retail traders got a boost from crypto and the opportunities of prediction markets. Retail investors have increased their share on the stock market. The trend is most notable following the GameStop short squeeze event. In 2021, one professional trader and former CFA Keith Gill drew in a crowd of retail holders, pushing the GME price to a record and creating a precedent on the market. Since then, retail traders have become more bold, increasing their exposure to the stock market. Retail and meme traders are here to stay, based on a Bloomberg analysis, but they are also gaining experience and picking more reasonable strategies. Yet the streak of financial nihilism from the GameStop debacle also informs market participants. Retail investment expanded in response to growing opportunities in the tech sector. The lessons from direct investment in crypto also shifted to the stock market, as retail attempted at actively managing their portfolios in a shifting environment. Retail investors show post-pandemic behavior changes According to a report for investor behaviors in 2025 by J.P. Morgan Chase, between 2023 and 2025, retail investors returned to activity not seen since the post-pandemic market. Analysts noted in the past months, retail investors became an even more formidable force. In 2025, retail investors emerged as a heavyweight factor on the market, going beyond the meme stock episodes in earlier years. “Retail is more of a force in this space,” said Steven Quirk, chief brokerage officer of Robinhood Markets Inc. “I do not see that changing,” he said. Retail investors account for up to 20.9% of US equity trading volume, based on Bloomberg data, up from 18.5% for the same period last year. Institutions make up 30.2% of the market volume, but the gap is quickly closing. Retail traders use more sophisticated strategies Retail traders have shown a shift to derivative markets. The trend followed the expansion of new products in crypto space, as traders gained more experience of risk. Instead of all-in bets, retail traders are also participating on options markets, as trading conditions remain uncertain. Individual investors made up to 29.3% of options volume in the past quarter. Retail moved in to create options trading records in 2025, while over 50% of the S&P500 options volume was due to retail. Retail investors also resorted to a risky form of trading zero-day options, which are essentially a short-term prediction on the index movement. CBOE noted zero-day options are growing in popularity among retail investors. That behavior coincides with an inflow of users to prediction platforms, offering even easier access and gamified trading. Trader profile pressures are also reshaping the market. The shift to a 24-hour trading means up to 9% of equity market trades take place outside official opening hours, up from just 1% in 2019. Overseas interest and free-time investing, along with the lessons of crypto trading with no closing hours is already affecting the equity market, as traders require the same flexibility. Retail has also flowed into other types of investment, including the high-profile IPO market. They also caused dramatic spikes in stock trading for newcomers like Figma Inc. and Circle Internet Group Inc. The new wave of IPOs also appeal to younger investors, more aware of the companies’ mix of value and to a degree, their meme potential.

The fund recorded just $1.4 million in first-day volume on NYSE Arca. This figure fell significantly below analyst predictions, marking a cautious start for institutional Dogecoin exposure. The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF (GDOG) now holds approximately $1.7 million in assets under management. Its net asset value stands at $17.98 per share. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had projected that opening-day volume could reach $12 million. The actual results came in nearly 90% lower than his estimate. Balchunas described the $1.4 million volume as ”solid for an average launch but low for a 'first-ever spot' product.” His analysis suggests a clear pattern emerging in crypto ETF launches. Institutional interest appears to diminish as products move beyond Bitcoin into smaller market-cap cryptocurrencies. Broader Crypto ETF Landscape Shows Clear Hierarchy Recent launches of other cryptocurrency ETFs paint a striking contrast. XRP-focused funds attracted approximately $59 million in first-day trading volume. Solana ETFs recorded around $56 million during their debut sessions. These figures demonstrate substantially stronger institutional appetite for larger alternative cryptocurrencies. Even the Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, which launched in September under different regulatory parameters, achieved $17 million in opening-day volume. That product operates under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Its performance still exceeded GDOG The disparity highlights growing skepticism among institutional traders. Dogecoin ranks as the tenth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Yet its meme coin origins and volatile price history may deter conservative fund managers from immediate allocation decisions. Spot ETF performance often improves after initial launch periods. Early volume does not necessarily predict long-term success. However, weak debuts can signal underlying concerns about asset fundamentals or timing. Competition Intensifies as Bitwise Prepares Entry The Dogecoin ETF market will soon see additional competition. Bitwise announced its own spot Dogecoin fund (BWOW) will begin trading on Wednesday, November 26. The asset manager cited persistent community demand as justification for the launch. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley explained the rationale behind the company's entry into this market segment. ”Bitwise is launching BWOW because many DOGE holders, a community that numbers in the millions, want the benefit that comes from getting exposure to crypto in an ETP format,” he stated. The company believes retail and institutional investors deserve regulated access to Dogecoin through traditional brokerage accounts. This competitive dynamic could split already-limited institutional interest. Multiple Dogecoin ETFs now compete for the same pool of potential investors. The fragmentation may further dilute individual fund performance and adoption rates.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-26 09:49:33

The expansion initiative seeks to capitalize on the accelerating crypto adoption in the region seen in the past couple of years. Indeed, the Mexico-based exchange’s retail user base grew more than 12% in 2024, reaching nine million customers. Stablecoins have seen the most notable surge in popularity, with Chainalysis data showing that Latin America is leading the world in stablecoin adoption, with traders in Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia recording stablecoin transaction shares of 61%, 59%, and 66% in 2024, respectively. Share of LATAM retail-sized transaction volume.

New trading features on Bitso Further, the Bitso user base is showing growing interest in more advanced trading features. This seems evident in the fact that the exchange’s professional-grade (“Alpha”) and retail (“Classic”) segments generate nearly identical trading volumes despite the former serving fewer clients. The management interprets this as evidence that customers are increasingly “leaning towards sophisticated algorithmic trading.” This shift, propped by increased institutional participation and clearer regulations, is informing the company’s next growth phase. The next flagship product will come in the shape of the aforementioned multi-platform perps aggregator scheduled for Q1 2026. A new phase of Bitso Onchain begins now: Our Aggregated Perps platform arrives in early Q1. The Bitso Onchain token arrives in 2026. Season Zero starts December 1st. Points start NOW! 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/HUNnrLP9ue — Bitso Onchain (@BitsoOnchain) November 24, 2025 Built on Bitso Onchain, the platform will allow leveraged traders to access the most competitive perps and track a unified USD Coin ( USDC ) balance across different venues. To prime the community for the launch, Bitso is rolling out a user-engagement initiative on December 1, 2025, aptly called “Season 0.” “Bitso Onchain is how we bring the full promise of Web3 to everyone — speed, fairness, and transparency built in. We’re building a global self-custody trading platform that works with the simplicity of a CEX, but with the freedom and openness only permissionless crypto can deliver,” CEO and Co-Founder Daniel Vogel told Finbold. Native Bitso token coming in 2026 During Bitso Onchain’s activation with Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) at Devconnect Argentina, the exchange also confirmed that a native Bitso Onchain token is coming in 2026. While precise details are still not known, the asset will reportedly be used to incentivize users and strengthen participation in the ecosystem. The new token and the perps aggregator, together with the rapidly expanding on-chain infrastructure, are expected not only to reinforce Bitso’s position as the leading exchange in Latin America but also to present it as a global contender looking to onboard up to 1 billion new users.

This bold claim comes at a crucial time for cryptocurrency investors seeking stability in volatile markets. How Strong Is Strategy’s Bitcoin Financial Health? Strategy’s impressive Bitcoin financial health stems from their carefully calculated risk management approach. The company currently maintains a 3.6x ratio between their Bitcoin holdings’ value and their outstanding debt. This means for every dollar of debt, they hold $3.60 worth of Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin’s price drops significantly to $25,000, this ratio would still exceed 2.0x, demonstrating remarkable financial resilience. Their current portfolio includes approximately 649,870 BTC against roughly $16 billion in debt. This substantial buffer provides crucial protection against market volatility. Moreover, their strategic approach to Bitcoin financial health considers various market scenarios, ensuring they remain solvent through different economic conditions. What Makes Their Risk Management So Effective? Strategy’s approach to maintaining Bitcoin financial health involves several key elements: Substantial safety margins built into their financial calculations Conservative debt management relative to asset values Long-term perspective on Bitcoin’s value proposition Regular stress testing of their financial models This comprehensive strategy ensures their Bitcoin financial health remains intact even during significant market corrections. Their transparency about these calculations provides valuable insights for other institutional investors considering similar approaches to cryptocurrency exposure. Why Does This Matter for Crypto Investors? The company’s confidence in their Bitcoin financial health comes amid recent challenges. Strategy recently failed to gain inclusion in the S&P 500 index, and concerns have emerged about potential removal from other major indices like MSCI. However, their strong Bitcoin financial health position suggests they can navigate these institutional hurdles without compromising their core strategy. For individual investors, this demonstrates the importance of maintaining adequate buffers in cryptocurrency portfolios. Strategy’s approach to Bitcoin financial health shows that proper risk management can provide stability even in the volatile crypto space. Their example offers valuable lessons about balancing opportunity with protection. What Can We Learn About Sustainable Crypto Investing? Strategy’s commitment to Bitcoin financial health provides a blueprint for sustainable cryptocurrency investment. Their focus on maintaining strong ratios between assets and liabilities, regardless of short-term price movements, represents a mature approach to digital asset management. This methodology could influence how other companies and investors approach Bitcoin allocation in their portfolios. The company’s transparent communication about their Bitcoin financial health thresholds also sets a positive precedent for the industry. By clearly stating their risk parameters and demonstrating how they would withstand significant price drops, they contribute to greater market stability and investor confidence. Conclusion: A Model for Crypto Risk Management Strategy’s demonstrated ability to maintain Bitcoin financial health even under adverse market conditions represents a significant achievement in cryptocurrency portfolio management. Their approach combines strategic vision with practical risk controls, creating a sustainable model for institutional Bitcoin investment.

Frequently Asked Questions What is Strategy’s current Bitcoin-to-debt ratio? Strategy currently maintains a 3.6x ratio between their Bitcoin holdings’ value and their outstanding debt, providing substantial financial cushion. How low could Bitcoin drop before Strategy faces financial pressure? According to their calculations, Strategy would maintain adequate Bitcoin financial health even if BTC fell to $25,000, where their ratio would still exceed 2.0x. Why did Strategy fail to gain S&P 500 inclusion? While not explicitly stated, the rejection likely relates to the specialized nature of their Bitcoin-focused business model and current index criteria requirements. How many Bitcoins does Strategy currently hold? The company holds approximately 649,870 BTC, making them one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. What happens if Bitcoin drops below $25,000? While Strategy hasn’t specified thresholds below $25,000, their current buffer suggests they could withstand further declines while maintaining operational stability.

The primary catalyst of the most recent surge seems to be a rumor of a significant update scheduled for November 28. PI in Green Territory Again According to CoinGecko’s data, the asset’s price briefly surpassed $0.25, whereas it currently trades just south of that level. This represents a 6% increase on a daily scale and a 10% increase on a weekly basis. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Following the price spike, PI’s market capitalization reclaimed the $2 billion milestone and now ranks as the 61st-biggest cryptocurrency, flipping the well-known meme coin Pepe (PEPE). Perhaps the most likely factor fueling the jump is the recent post from the X user Pi Network News. The unofficial account dedicated to spreading news about the project’s ecosystem claimed that many Pioneers may face a “pivotal moment” on November 28 due to a major update expected that day. “A robust enhancement seems to be looming for the Pi ecosystem. Stay informed, stay proactive, and grasp the opportunity,” the rumor reads. The X users commenting on the post were left baffled, and it seems they have no clue what the upgrade will focus on. However, it infused optimism, and some asserted they would buy PI tokens. Just a Short-Lived Rally? It is important to note that the excitement surrounding the upcoming update may soon dissipate, especially if the project’s official account fails to provide concrete details. This could jeopardize the overall rally. Additionally, the looming token unlocks suggest the bears could regain control again. Data shows that almost 180 million PI will be released over the next 30 days, with December 20 standing out as the peak date, when 7.2 million coins will unlock at once. This development will give some investors the chance to offload tokens they have been waiting for some time, and lead to increased sell pressure. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io PI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also signals that a correction could be on the way. The technical analysis tool, which ranges from 0 to 100, measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes and is often used by traders to spot possible reversal points. Ratios above 80 typically indicate the asset is overbought and poised for a pullback. Such is the current case, with PI’s RSI standing above 80.

Squali e balene di Bitcoin tornano ad accumulare In un nuovo post su X , la società di analisi on-chain Santiment ha evidenziato le ultime tendenze nella Supply Distribution delle principali categorie di investitori Bitcoin. The number of wallets holding at least 100 Bitcoin has risen by +0.47% (91 wallets) since November 11th. Meanwhile, small wallets (especially 0.1 $BTC or less) have been shrinking in number. Retail capitulation will generally play out well for crypto prices in the long run. pic.twitter.com/I0C6EV24QV — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 25, 2025 La metrica analizza, tra le altre cose, il numero di indirizzi appartenenti a specifici gruppi, suddivisi in base alla quantità di Bitcoin detenuta. Ad esempio, il cluster “1–10 BTC” comprende tutti i wallet con un saldo compreso in quel range. La Supply Distribution indica quante entità rientrano effettivamente in quella fascia. Nel caso di questa analisi, l’interesse si concentra sugli indirizzi con almeno 100 BTC , pari a circa 8,6 milioni di dollari ai prezzi attuali. Si tratta delle due categorie chiave definite come “sharks” e “whales” , investitori con riserve sufficienti a influenzare il mercato — con le balene naturalmente più pesanti in termini di impatto. Dopo il massimo storico (ATH) toccato a ottobre , Bitcoin ha avviato una fase discendente. Come mostra il grafico di Santiment, squali e balene inizialmente hanno reagito riducendo la loro esposizione, con un netto calo della loro Supply Distribution. Secondo una nuova analisi pubblicata da Santiment, la distribuzione dell’offerta tra i principali detentori di Bitcoin sta cambiando in modo significativo. L’indicatore monitora il numero di indirizzi appartenenti a diverse fasce di possesso, e quella più rilevante in questo momento è quella degli indirizzi con più di 100 BTC , cioè circa 8,6 milioni di dollari ai valori attuali. Questi investitori, suddivisi comunemente nelle categorie di sharks e whales , sono considerati tra i più influenti della rete, e quindi i loro movimenti sono particolarmente rilevanti. Dopo il massimo storico di ottobre, mentre Bitcoin ha iniziato la fase discendente, anche queste grandi entità hanno inizialmente ridotto l’esposizione, registrando un netto calo nella loro Supply Distribution. Tuttavia, da l’11 novembre la dinamica si è invertita: con l’accelerazione del ribasso, squali e balene hanno ripreso a crescere di numero. In rete ci sono oggi 91 nuovi indirizzi con oltre 100 BTC rispetto ai minimi di inizio mese, pari a un aumento dello 0,47% . Una crescita modesta, ma sufficiente a confermare un ritorno di interesse da parte dei grandi detentori, che stanno comprando sulla debolezza . Parallelamente, Santiment evidenzia un trend opposto per i piccoli investitori: gli indirizzi con meno di 0,1 BTC (circa 8.700 dollari) stanno diminuendo. Un segnale tipico di capitolazione del retail dopo una fase di forte pressione ribassista. Secondo la società di analisi, questo tipo di dinamica tende storicamente a favorire i prezzi nel lungo periodo: quando i piccoli investitori mollano e gli investitori di peso tornano ad accumulare, il mercato spesso trova terreno per una futura ripresa.

Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions.

Texas ETF Buy Signals Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as the Next Crypto to Explode November 26, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Texas just bought $5M of BlackRock’s $IBIT spot $BTC ETF, with another $5M earmarked for self-custodied Bitcoin, using state treasury capital while $BTC trades about 10% below recent highs. That puts Bitcoin in the same bucket as long-term reserves alongside bonds and gold, not just a high-beta trade, and gradually derisks holding core exposure for institutions and wealthy allocators. As more states follow Wisconsin’s earlier $100M IBIT move , flows shift from short-term speculators toward slow, rules-based mandates that can run for years. That kind of sticky demand tends to reward ecosystems that plug utility directly into Bitcoin rather than competing with it. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building an SVM-based Bitcoin Layer-2 where payments, DeFi, NFTs, and memes all settle back to $BTC, aiming to tackle slow transactions and high fees on the base chain. With $28.5M already raised at $0.013335 per token, you front-run state-level accumulation while also adding exposure to infrastructure designed to capture that liquidity on-chain.

Kraken’s New Debit App Puts Best Wallet Token ($BEST) In Line as the Next Crypto to Explode November 26, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Kraken’s new Krak Mastercard debit app in the UK and EU lets users spend multiple crypto assets in real time and even route salaries in via IBAN, turning an exchange into a quasi-bank on your phone. That pushes $BTC, $ETH, and stablecoins deeper into everyday payments, not just trading screens, and locks more value inside wallet-based rails instead of old banking stacks. As more regulated players roll out cards, vaults, and yield products, the battle shifts to who owns the main wallet interface that routes all those flows. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is built exactly around that choke point. It’s the native token of Best Wallet , a non-custodial wallet that offers reduced fees, boosted staking rewards, and priority access to curated presales from a single app, positioning it as a neutral router across chains. With $17.52M already raised at $0.026005, you effectively add leveraged exposure to the wallet layer that stands to benefit from every new on-ramp card and payment integration, not just one exchange rollout. Find out how to buy $BEST now.

Priced at $0.035 during its ongoing presale, Mutuum Finance is already attracting significant attention from traders seeking the crypto to buy now with both high growth potential and real utility. Unlike Ripple (XRP), which faces structural fragility with nearly 41.5% of its supply at a loss and a top-heavy market, MUTM is backed by a robust DeFi ecosystem featuring decentralized lending and borrowing, interest-bearing tokens, and strong early adoption metrics. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 95% sold out and more than 18,200 investors on board, Mutuum Finance is generating momentum that many analysts argue could surpass traditional altcoins in the coming cycle. With its V1 Sepolia testnet launch on the horizon, MUTM combines early-stage opportunity, tangible functionality, and community growth, making it one of the most compelling picks for investors looking for a new crypto to gain exposure in 2026. Ripple Slips Amid Macro Pressure, Bottom Still Uncertain Ripple (XRP) has fallen to around $1.90, losing roughly 19% this month as broader market sell-offs in Bitcoin and Ethereum weigh heavily on altcoins. Weak jobs data and rising unemployment are adding pressure to global markets, while expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut have been delayed, creating additional headwinds. Analysts caution that XRP may not have found a bottom yet, with ongoing macro volatility leaving the token vulnerable to further downside. This uncertain environment is prompting some investors to seek alternatives in emerging projects showing early adoption and strong utility, creating an opening for high-potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to attract attention from those looking for a crypto to buy now with real DeFi functionality. MUTM Presale: Final Opportunity for Strategic Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as one of the most promising DeFi projects in the crypto space. The presale has already raised over $19 million from 18,200 token holders, with Phase 6 tokens currently priced at $0.035, a 250% increase from Phase 1’s $0.01. With over 95% of Phase 6 already sold, this is among the last chances to acquire this new crypto at a discounted rate. Phase 7 will see the price increase to $0.04, while the anticipated listing price is $0.06. Early investors have the potential to achieve up to 450% ROI, making MUTM the crypto to buy now for those seeking early-stage exposure with tangible DeFi utility. Buy-Back System: Turning Platform Activity into Token Growth Mutuum Finance’s Buy-and-Distribute mechanism converts platform engagement into real token value. Fees generated from lending, borrowing, and staking are used to repurchase MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: higher platform usage leads to more buybacks, which increases staking rewards, encouraging long-term participation. By linking on-chain activity to tangible rewards, MUTM strengthens its position as a new crypto with high growth potential and practical utility. Mutuum Finance is currently undergoing an independent audit of its lending and borrowing smart contracts. Halborn Security is performing a comprehensive analysis to validate that the contracts operate as intended and provide robust protection for user assets. This audit is a critical step in ensuring platform security and reliability, and updates on its progress will be shared once the evaluation is complete. This process reinforces investor confidence and underscores MUTM’s commitment to transparency and risk management. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the best crypto to buy now. Phase 6 presale is over 95% sold at $0.035, raising $19 million from more than 18,200 investors. With its V1 Sepolia testnet launch, audited smart contracts, and a robust DeFi ecosystem, MUTM offers both utility and high growth potential. Early investors can secure tokens before Phase 7 increases the price to $0.04, making this a critical opportunity to gain early exposure to a new crypto and the crypto to buy now in 2026.

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju just dropped a bombshell revelation about potential wash trading on Bybit’s BTC/USD pair that should make every crypto investor sit up and pay attention. What Exactly is Wash Trading and Why Should You Care? Wash trading involves artificial trading activity where the same trader buys and sells assets to create misleading market signals. This deceptive practice can make trading volumes appear higher than they actually are, potentially luring unsuspecting investors into manipulated markets. The recent findings from CryptoQuant’s CEO highlight exactly why understanding wash trading matters for your investment decisions. The Alarming Bybit BTC/USD Trading Patterns Ki Young Ju’s analysis uncovered suspicious trading activity that raises serious red flags. The data shows trades valued at just $5 occurring approximately 50 times every single second. This high-frequency pattern doesn’t resemble normal market behavior. Instead, it suggests someone might be deliberately distorting key market indicators through systematic wash trading tactics. Consider these concerning details: Trades happening 50 times per second Consistent $5 trade values Focus on Bybit’s BTC/USD inverse futures pair Potential market indicator manipulation How Does This Wash Trading Affect Real Investors? When wash trading occurs, it creates a false sense of market activity that can mislead genuine traders. You might see inflated trading volumes and believe there’s more market interest than actually exists. This manipulation can cause you to make investment decisions based on artificial data rather than real market conditions. The discovery of potential wash trading on a major exchange like Bybit underscores the importance of staying vigilant about market integrity. What Can You Do to Protect Yourself? Staying informed about potential market manipulation like wash trading is your first line of defense. Always verify trading volumes across multiple platforms and look for consistent patterns rather than isolated spikes. Trusted analytics platforms like CryptoQuant provide valuable insights that help you distinguish between genuine market activity and potential wash trading schemes. Remember these protective measures: Cross-reference trading data from multiple sources Monitor for unusual trading patterns Use reliable analytics tools Stay updated on market integrity reports The Bigger Picture: Market Transparency Matters This incident highlights the ongoing need for greater transparency in cryptocurrency markets. While the intent behind these suspicious trades remains unclear, the pattern clearly doesn’t represent normal trading activity. As the crypto industry matures, detecting and preventing wash trading becomes crucial for building investor confidence and maintaining market integrity. The exposure of potential wash trading serves as a powerful reminder that market vigilance benefits everyone. When industry leaders like CryptoQuant’s CEO identify and share these findings, they contribute to healthier markets for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions What is wash trading in cryptocurrency? Wash trading involves artificial trading where the same entity buys and sells assets to create false market activity and mislead other traders about actual trading volumes and price movements. How can I spot potential wash trading? Look for unusual patterns like identical trade sizes repeating frequently, trades between related accounts, or trading activity that doesn’t align with market news or fundamentals. Why is wash trading harmful to markets? Wash trading distorts market data, misleads investors, creates artificial liquidity, and can manipulate prices, ultimately undermining market integrity and investor trust. Are exchanges responsible for preventing wash trading? Yes, reputable exchanges implement monitoring systems and policies to detect and prevent wash trading, though the effectiveness varies across platforms. What should I do if I suspect wash trading? Report your concerns to the exchange’s compliance team, share observations with community watchdogs, and consider using alternative trading platforms with better transparency. How common is wash trading in crypto markets? While exact figures are difficult to determine, industry experts believe wash trading occurs across various exchanges, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and improved regulation.

Bitcoin Hyper Rides the Wave Into a $28.5M Presale",https://bitcoinist.com/metaplanet-btc-collateral-move-highlights-opportunity-in-bitcoin-hyper/,"Quick Facts: Metaplanet’s $130M Bitcoin-backed loan shows corporates increasingly treat $BTC as long-term collateral rather than a trading asset. Metaplanet already owns 30,823 $BTC, worth over $2.7B, and has secured a $500M credit line to buy more. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to marry Bitcoin settlement with SVM execution, targeting DeFi, payments, and gaming with Solana-level performance. The $HYPER presale has raised over $28.5M so far and plans a release window of between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. Metaplanet just became the latest public company to double down on Bitcoin without selling a single sat. The firm executed a $130M Bitcoin-backed loan against its 30,823 $BTC treasury, effectively using $BTC as productive collateral instead of an idle balance sheet asset. The company is following in Michael Saylor’s footsteps, whose company, Strategy, now holds the largest Bitcoin reserve, currently at 649,870 $BTC , valued at over $74.4B. The signal is clear – institutions are treating Bitcoin less like a trade and more like long-term collateral infrastructure. That mindset shift tends to push capital further down the risk curve, into infrastructure plays that can extend Bitcoin’s utility beyond ‘store of value.’ That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes into focus. As aggressive $BTC accumulation ramps up, investors are hunting for Bitcoin-adjacent upside, particularly projects that aim to solve Bitcoin’s oldest issues: slow throughput, high fees, and near-zero native programmability. Bitcoin Hyper’s pitch is simple yet bold – bring Solana-grade performance to a Bitcoin-secured Layer-2. From Static $BTC Treasury To Yield-Generating Bitcoin Rails Metaplanet already owns 30,823 $BTC, worth around $2.7B, and plans to buy more, after the company announced a $500M credit line back in October for this exact purpose. The company’s move underscores a growing reality: $BTC is too valuable to sell, but too static to drive yield or innovation by itself. A base layer that clears ~7 transactions per second (TPS) with unpredictable fees is not where you build high-frequency payments, games, or complex DeFi systems. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as a modular fix to that constraint. The Bitcoin Layer-1 will handle settlement and security, while a real-time SVM-enabled Layer-2 executes transactions with sub-second latency and low fees. In practice, it aims to feel like Solana’s performance environment, but wired directly into Bitcoin’s trust layer. Discover more about this Layer-2 project in our Bitcoin Hyper review . SVM On Bitcoin: What Bitcoin Hyper Is Actually Building Most Bitcoin extensions lean on EVM-style rollups or sidechains. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) takes a different route, integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) as its execution layer. The goal is straightforward: bring the same parallelized smart contract engine that powers Solana’s high TPS environment into a Bitcoin-secured Layer-2. A critical component is the decentralized canonical bridge designed to move $BTC onto the Layer-2. It will lock your $BTC on the Bitcoin Layer-1 and mint a corresponding amount in wrapped $BTC on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2. That means high-speed payments, swaps, lending, and staking with Bitcoin-backed collateral instead of volatile altcoins. Once your $BTC is bridged, Bitcoin Hyper’s SVM-based environment will support a full DeFi stack: automated market makers, lending markets, staking protocols, and yield strategies that execute with low fees and rapid finality. If Metaplanet-style $BTC treasuries want yield without selling coins, these kinds of Layer-2 rails become the logical experimentation ground. Thinking of joining the Bitcoin Hyper presale? Our guide to buying $HYPER explains how. $HYPER Presale Indicative of Strong Investor Confidence On the capital formation side, Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale has attracted meaningful size for an early-stage infrastructure play. With more than $28.5M already raised and a current token price of $0.013335, that places the presale well into eight-figure territory before a full mainnet growth cycle. The project’s utility, combined with the heavy investor participation during the presale, puts $HYPER in a very positive light. Our $HYPER price prediction suggests a possible target of $0.20 by the end of 2026 and $1.50 by 2030. That translates to ROIs of 1,399% and 11,148% for a one-year investment plan and a five-year one respectively. With over $28.5M in the bag, $HYPER is already one of the best crypto presales of 2025, which is incentive enough for those looking for a reliable ROI generator. More importantly, $HYPER targets a Q4 2025/Q1 2026 release window, so there may not be much time left before the presale ends. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-backed loan highlights how far $BTC has come as a financial primitive – from speculation to structured collateral. The open question is which Layer-2s will capture the upside of making that collateral actually usable. If SVM on Bitcoin resonates with developers and treasuries alike, $HYPER could become one of the more closely watched experiments. Buy your $HYPER today and stake it for 41% APY.

54925400,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=868404,1764155148,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54925400.jpeg,South Korea’s Kakao Bank advances Kakao Coin stablecoin initiative to development phase,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/kakao-bank-moves-stablecoin-project/,"South Korea’s Kakao Bank is advancing its stablecoin initiative to the actual system development phase of the Kakao Coin. The initiative follows the previous group-wide review of a KRW stablecoin project and the development stage. Kakao is embarking on its commitment to implement its stablecoin strategy through its core affiliate, Kakao Bank. According to the bank’s website, Kakao Bank has recently begun onboarding developers for its blockchain-based service system. Kakao hires developers to design new blockchain service structures According to a report from local media, the recruitment is part of the bank’s New Business Service Development Team. The bank has tasked the developers with designing new blockchain service backend structures, building transaction processing systems, and managing keys. The position requires an understanding of blockchain service backend systems, including full-node operation, token standards, and smart contracts. The initiative to hire blockchain devs suggests that the bank is planning to build and operate a range of financial services, such as stablecoins and tokenization. Kakao Bank’s stablecoin initiative comes after the firm was cleared of the burden of legal risk after Kakao’s founder, Kim Beom-soo, was cleared in his first trial last month. Cryptopoitan previously reported that Kim had been charged with manipulating SM Entertainment stock prices, but was acquitted in the first trial. Kakao’s financial business expansion was at risk due to Kim’s legal problems, which elevated uncertainty as financial authorities were about to conduct their six-month shareholder eligibility review. Kakao was also expected to reduce its stake in Kakao Bank from its current 27.16% to the 10% limit if a fine or heavier penalty were deemed to make Kim ineligible. The cut was expected to strip Kakao of its status as the largest shareholder of Kakao Bank and ultimately limit its ability to pursue new business initiatives. Founder Kim serves as the head of Kakao’s Future Initiative Center. The formal commitment is responsible for the group’s future growth in sectors such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). The initiative also oversees Kakao’s mid- to long-term strategy, including its stablecoin business. Kakao has focused on the Korean won stablecoin as its key future business, launching the Korean Won Stablecoin Joint Task Force (TF) in late August. The task force includes the group’s major affiliates, including Kakao, Kakao Bank, and Kakao Pay. The three representatives have reportedly been holding weekly meetings, allegedly discussing the establishment of a digital financial system around settlements, tokenization, and blockchain-based payments. Kakao Pay also recently filed for six stablecoin ticker symbols, including KKRW, PKRK, KRWP, KRWKP, KPKRW, and KRWK. Kakao seeks to develop STO financial products Kakao has also advanced its blockchain strategy by signing partnerships with Korea Investment & Securities and Lucent Block. The collaboration aims to develop blockchain-based STO financial products and systems. The token offers a form of digitized securities that use blockchain to verify ownership, status, and dividend rights through smart contracts. The hiring of blockchain developers marks a significant advancement in Kakao Bank’s blockchain strategy, moving it to the development phase. The initiative also aligns with the group’s goal of developing a stablecoin ecosystem that connects its blockchain infrastructure to its financial services. A Kakao Bank official mentioned that the recruitment aims to supplement human resources for research on blockchain and stablecoin technology. He added that the initiative also seeks to examine the applicability of blockchain to financial services. Another South Korean tech giant, Naver Financial, also reportedly launched a wallet service for a Busan-based stablecoin project. The firm is also planning to merge with South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, as part of the initiative. South Korean firms’ stablecoin initiatives come as the country’s recently elected President Lee Jae Myung named the Korean won-stablecoin as one of his key agendas. He promised to advance Korea’s financial services to protect monetary sovereignty against the dominant U.S. dollar stablecoin market. The country’s ruling party also recently introduced stablecoin legislation , the Digital Asset Basic Act, which sets a framework for the regulated issuance of asset-backed digital tokens.

Analyst Suggests Next Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-bounces-off-the-bottom-of-the-channel-analyst-suggests-next-target/,"A clean rebound from a major support zone can shift market sentiment instantly. XRP has delivered such a moment, rising sharply after touching the lower boundary of a long-term descending channel. The move has sparked renewed interest among traders who are now watching the chart for confirmation of a broader recovery. The key question is whether XRP can maintain its current momentum long enough to challenge the next technical barrier. In a recent analysis shared on X, top market analyst Ali pointed out that XRP has bounced directly off the channel’s lower boundary on the 3-day chart. He noted that this reaction sets up a potential move toward the midpoint of the structure near $2.60. His commentary has circulated widely, reinforcing expectations of a possible near-term continuation if buyers hold their ground. $XRP bounced off the bottom of the channel and could be heading toward the midpoint around $2.60. pic.twitter.com/8gzG8yjYuN — Ali (@ali_charts) November 26, 2025 Technical Structure and Current Setup The descending channel governing XRP’s multi-month price action remains intact. Each test of the lower boundary has produced strong reactions , confirming the structure’s reliability. XRP currently trades at $2.17, the lower-mid region of this channel after the latest rebound. The next technical objective is the midpoint, positioned near $2.60. A decisive push above this level would improve market structure and shift momentum in favor of buyers. Failure to approach the midpoint may invite renewed selling. Market Conditions and Liquidity Dynamics Recent market behavior shows rising volatility and abrupt liquidity surges. Trading volume has expanded during the bounce, suggesting increased participation from both retail and institutional players. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader crypto sentiment remains mixed, which adds uncertainty to XRP’s trajectory. Short bursts of buying have supported the current rebound, but sustained momentum will require continuous inflows. Trading Implications and Short-Term Expectations Short-term traders view the channel’s midpoint as the most reasonable initial target. The level represents a natural point of resistance within a downward-sloping structure. A strong close above it would strengthen bullish conviction and open discussion of the channel’s upper boundary. However, a failure to advance toward $2.60 could signal weakness and risk another retest of the lower boundary. Clear invalidation levels remain essential given the sharp price swings common in XRP’s price behavior. Outlook and Final Thoughts XRP’s rebound offers a cleaner technical picture than seen in recent weeks. Ali’s insights highlight the importance of the $2.60 level in determining the next phase of the market. The channel remains the dominant pattern, and the midpoint stands as the key battleground. Traders now watch for volume, structure, and confirmation as XRP attempts to sustain its latest move. This bounce has created a constructive short-term narrative, but momentum must continue for the outlook to shift decisively.

In contrast, several altcoins have produced more impressive gains over the past day, including Pi Network’s native token, which is up by double digits weekly. BTC Stopped at $88K Again It was just over two weeks ago when the primary cryptocurrency was riding high at around $107,000. However, it quickly lost momentum, and the overall trend turned bearish with a price drop to a five-digit price territory by the end of that business week. Although it tried to rebound, it couldn’t challenge the $100,000 mark again, and the correction continued. The culmination took place last Friday when the bears seemed in complete control. In the past of less than 24 hours, they drove BTC south hard to a seven-month low of under $81,000 (on most exchanges). After losing more than $25,000 in days, bitcoin finally bounced off and jumped to around $84,000, where it spent most of the weekend. The recovery attempts continued on Monday and especially Tuesday when it jumped to $89,000. However, it couldn’t keep climbing and has slipped to $87,000 as of press time. Its market cap has dropped to $1.735 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the altcoins stands still at 56.4%. BTCUSD.

Imagine waking up in 2030 to discover your PEPE memecoin investment has skyrocketed beyond expectations. The burning question every crypto enthusiast is asking: Can PEPE really reach the elusive 1 cent mark? Our comprehensive PEPE price prediction analysis dives deep into the technical indicators, market sentiment, and fundamental factors that could propel this memecoin to unprecedented heights or send it crashing back to reality. Understanding PEPE Price Prediction Fundamentals Before we dive into specific numbers, let’s examine what drives PEPE price prediction models. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies with complex utility, PEPE operates primarily on community sentiment and meme culture. However, several key factors influence its price trajectory: Market capitalization requirements for price milestones Trading volume and liquidity patterns Community engagement and social media buzz Overall cryptocurrency market conditions Regulatory developments affecting memecoins PEPE Price Prediction 2025: The Short-Term Outlook Our PEPE price prediction for 2025 considers current market dynamics and historical memecoin performance. Based on technical analysis and market sentiment indicators, we project PEPE could reach between $0.000008 and $0.000012 by the end of 2025. This represents significant growth potential from current levels, driven by: Factor Impact Probability Bull market continuation High 65% Increased adoption Medium 45% Exchange listings Medium 55% Community growth High 70% Pepe Memecoin Long-Term Projections: 2026-2030 The journey of Pepe memecoin from 2026 through 2030 presents both extraordinary opportunities and substantial risks. Our extended analysis suggests that while reaching 1 cent seems mathematically challenging, gradual appreciation remains possible under optimal conditions. The Pepe memecoin ecosystem must evolve beyond pure speculation to achieve sustained growth. Can PEPE Reach 1 Cent? The Mathematical Reality Let’s address the million-dollar question: Can PEPE reach 1 cent? The current market dynamics make this target incredibly ambitious. At 1 cent per token, PEPE would require a market capitalization exceeding that of several major cryptocurrencies combined. However, cryptocurrency markets have repeatedly defied conventional logic, making absolute predictions risky. Cryptocurrency Analysis: PEPE vs Other Memecoins Our cryptocurrency analysis reveals interesting patterns when comparing PEPE to established memecoins. While PEPE lacks the first-mover advantage of Dogecoin or the Ethereum backing of Shiba Inu, it demonstrates stronger community engagement metrics in certain demographics. This cryptocurrency analysis suggests PEPE could capture specific market segments if execution remains consistent. Memecoin Future: Where Does PEPE Fit In? The broader memecoin future appears both promising and precarious. As regulatory scrutiny increases and market maturity develops, memecoins like PEPE must demonstrate value beyond viral moments. The memecoin future likely belongs to projects that can balance entertainment with tangible ecosystem development. Critical Factors That Could Make or Break PEPE 1 Cent Dreams Achieving the PEPE 1 cent milestone requires near-perfect alignment of multiple factors. These include massive adoption increases, favorable regulatory environments, and sustained bull market conditions. The PEPE 1 cent scenario, while mathematically possible, demands unprecedented market conditions that challenge conventional investment wisdom. FAQs: Your PEPE Questions Answered What is the current circulating supply of PEPE? The exact circulating supply fluctuates, but PEPE maintains a substantial token count that impacts price appreciation potential. How does PEPE compare to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu ? While all are memecoins, each has distinct community dynamics and development approaches. Dogecoin benefits from broader recognition, while Shytoshi Kusama leads Shiba Inu’s expanding ecosystem. Should I invest in PEPE for long-term growth? Like all cryptocurrency investments, PEPE carries significant risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose and conduct thorough research. What exchanges support PEPE trading? Major platforms including Binance , Coinbase , and Kraken offer PEPE trading pairs with varying liquidity levels. The Final Verdict: Realistic Expectations for PEPE While the dream of PEPE reaching 1 cent captures imagination, realistic investors should focus on gradual growth potential rather than astronomical price targets. The memecoin landscape remains volatile, and success depends on multiple external factors beyond any single project’s control. Our analysis suggests moderate growth with occasional explosive movements represents the most likely scenario.

Over the weekend, activity around the x402 protocol — an AI-powered autonomous payment system — triggered more than 500,000 transactions, driving a 500% surge in network usage and pushing $SOL from $122 to $139. This sudden rotation has reignited liquidity across the Solana ecosystem and reminded investors of a simple truth: Market narratives change fast — but stable, predictable income does not. While traders chase the next story, long-term holders are turning toward daily passive yield as a more consistent strategy. This is exactly where SolStaking is gaining momentum. Why SolStaking Is Equipped to Deliver Up to $7,700 in Daily Passive Income Unlike speculative trading, SolStaking offers a completely different value proposition: Structured cycles Fixed total returns Automated daily payouts Fully on-chain, verifiable rewards U.S.-registered custodial oversight This combination allows SolStaking to maintain predictable yield even when markets rotate aggressively — as Solana just demonstrated. Core Features That Make SolStaking Stand Out U.S.-registered entity custody Institutional validator infrastructure running 24/7 Rewards fully traceable on-chain Daily automatic settlement RWA-supported stability from clean energy、automation、data-center cashflows This structure creates a yield environment strong enough to support up to $7,700 in daily passive rewards, depending on the user’s plan.

He stated that SHIB was “also breaking out,” pointing to improving sentiment. His comments came during a broader relief rally after Bitcoin briefly touched $89,000 earlier today. The move placed SHIB among the altcoins benefiting from renewed confidence. SHIB Breaks Descending Structure After Extended Weakness Shiba Inu climbed 4% today to $0.000008632 after falling to $0.00000678 last week. For most of November, SHIB moved inside a steady downward structure, forming lower highs and lower lows. Recent price action shows the token pushing above a descending trendline that held for several weeks. Analysts viewed this move as an early sign that buyers were regaining control after a long period of weakness. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap TraderSZ noted that the breakout followed a brief consolidation near the $0.000007 level. SHIB then moved above a diagonal resistance point for the first time in weeks, signaling improved momentum. Breaking a trendline often marks the first phase of a potential shift, especially after sustained selling pressure. SHIB lost the $0.00001 price level in October and has struggled to reclaim it, making today’s progress more notable. Source: X A higher high would confirm a stronger reversal and reinforce SHIB’s recovery attempt. The current breakout provided traders with a structural signal that the downtrend may be weakening. SHIB’s position above resistance now places attention on its next move. SHIB Attempts to Extend Breakout as Analysts Map Key Targets Shiba Inu’s recovery comes as several altcoins, including Dogecoin, attempt to bounce from recent sell-offs. SHIB’s momentum now depends on whether the broader market maintains strength and attracts consistent buying interest. Last week, analyst Kledji Cuni said SHIB was approaching major support at $0.0000067. He described the zone as an area that historically aligned with cycle bottoms and sparked rebounds. Cuni mapped possible upside targets at $0.0000170, $0.0000320, and $0.0000420. These levels represent potential gains of 150% to 500% if SHIB extends its current breakout. Analyst Shib Knight also expressed confidence at current levels. He described the range as a quiet accumulation zone and said he planned to continue DCAing if conditions remained stable. TraderSZ did not give a specific target but emphasized that breaking the long-standing trendline warranted close attention. Analysts agreed that SHIB must hold above its breakout level and establish a higher high to confirm a sustained recovery.",News|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-26 11:15:26

According to the PDPC, World Network was collecting information from Thais in violation of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Pol Col Suraphong Plengkham, secretary-general of the PDPC, said the orders were issued by the committee’s expert panel to prevent data leakage and the illegal use of sensitive personal information. Data protection agencies and authorities found that World’s practice of exchanging crypto tokens for iris scans violated Thai law because they were allegedly transferred or sold to third parties. World in Thailand’s government crosshairs for data protection violations The World Network describes itself as a digital identity project developed by Tools for Humanity (TFH), with Altman listed among its investors. World ID, its core service, uses iris scans to create a digital credential that proves an individual is human. Those who verify their identity through one of the project’s Orb scanners receive World (WLD) tokens as an incentive. According to company records shared by news outlet the Bangkok post, Thailand hosted 102 Orb locations and was among World Network’s largest markets in Asia. On Monday, TFH’s Thailand arm (TIDC) confirmed that it has paused human verification services in compliance with the PDPC orders. However, the company insists the orders were unfair as it has been operating transparently and in line with the regulations of the jurisdiction. A source familiar with TFH told The Bangkok Post that authorities did not consult users before ordering the deletion of their data. Many participants earn income from iris scanning, receiving a total of 52 WLD tokens distributed monthly. According to Coingecko data, one WLD token is currently valued at around $0.63 or 20 Thai baht at the time of this reporting. “By deleting 1.2 million users’ data, they will lose around one billion baht,” the source said. Thai government raided World’s offices prior to the order The PDPC’s orders follow a legal action in late October, which saw Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau (CCIB) raid a Worldcoin exchange service next to a biometric registration site. The SEC claimed the operation constituted an unlicensed digital asset business, and several World employees were arrested as suspects in the investigations. Under Thailand’s Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 (2018), World is a digital asset business operator, but regulators alleged it did not have a license to operate. Violations carry penalties of up to five years in prison and fines of 500,000 baht (approximately $15,318), with additional daily fines of 10,000 baht if operations continue. Opas Cherdpunt, Chief Executive of M Vision Plc, which hosts Orb devices, said he is gathering 500 affected individuals to file a petition with the Central Administrative Court to counter the orders to delete iris data. However, Digital Economy and Society Minister Chaichanok Chidchob believes even though the government supports advanced technology in human identity verification, “all operations must comply with personal data protection laws.” Spain, Kenya, Colombia, Brazil, among countries that banned World Thailand has not explicitly banned the operations of the World Network, but there are currently 8 nations that have completely halted its existence within their borders. Just three weeks ago, Colombia’s competition regulator ordered the “immediate and permanent” closure of World for violating data protection laws after the company opened its largest physical location in Bogotá. The Superintendency of Industry and Commerce (SIC) also mandated the deletion of sensitive personal data, iris templates, and other records stored on the company’s servers. Other countries like Spain, Germany, and Indonesia were among the first to chase the blockchain platform due to a lack of transparency, data collection from minors, and users’ inability to withdraw consent. In January, Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) issued a blanket ban, saying it would impose daily fines of 50,000 Brazilian reais, roughly $8,800 if the operations continued. Kenya had already suspended World in 2023, but its High Court declared operations illegal in May this year, Cryptopolitan reported .

The rollout covers 12 square miles of Yas Island, where riders who order UberX or Uber Comfort may now be matched with a vehicle that has no human in the front seat. The option becomes even more likely when riders choose Uber’s new Autonomous ride type, which stays in the same price area as Comfort. This shift comes almost a year after the companies first launched the route with safety drivers supervising every mile. The expansion does not touch all routes. Highway trips, pickups from Abu Dhabi International Airport, and rides that stretch across the other islands of the UAE capital will still keep a safety operator on duty for now. That supervised territory spans around 30 square miles. The first stage of this partnership began in December 2024, when Uber and WeRide opened the initial supervised service. Both companies now say they plan to widen driverless coverage inside Abu Dhabi and push the partnership into Dubai next. Expand service into more global cities The work between Uber and WeRide goes past the UAE. Back in May, both sides agreed to spread their services into 15 additional cities outside the US and China over the next few years. One of those locations is Riyadh, where rides with safety drivers recently began. Inside the United States, Uber already connects riders to autonomous vehicles through Waymo in Phoenix, Austin, and Atlanta. These cities run on separate deals but feed into the same Uber app. Uber stepped out of the self-driving development race in 2020, when it sold its internal autonomous unit. Since then, it rebuilt the strategy by forming more than 20 partnerships with companies developing driverless systems. The company has also invested hundreds of millions of dollars into developers, including WeRide, to keep its platform running with both human drivers and machine-led vehicles. Uber said these investments will take time to turn into returns because autonomous fleets remain far smaller than the number of human-driven cars already on the road. Right now, the company runs dozens of WeRide robotaxis in Abu Dhabi and plans to grow the fleet. Show growth across China and beyond WeRide, which trades in the US and Hong Kong, reported a 307 million-yuan loss for the third quarter, which equals around $43 million, narrowing from a 1.04 billion-yuan loss a year earlier. The company holds driverless testing permits in eight countries. A review by BloombergNEF says that Baidu’s Apollo Go, WeRide, and Pony AI now lead American competitors in the number of robotaxi programs that have moved from testing into commercial service. Much of this activity is still happening inside China, but deployments also run in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore, with plans for Germany, the UK, and other European countries. The robotaxi industry remains messy. Some companies that raised billions collapsed after single accidents or after losing financial backers. But China continues to push money into sectors it calls strategic, including autonomous driving. The country already built a large EV industry over decades, and that supply-chain strength now supports the driverless push. Professor Weisong Shi of the University of Delaware, who runs the school’s Connected and Autonomous Research Lab, said, “In the US, it’s been more market-driven. In China, most of them are government-driven.” He added that none of the current systems perform well in harsh conditions like heavy snow. China also restarted the issuing of robotaxi testing permits this year after months of halted approvals. Regulators paused the process in the second half of 2024 after taxi-driver protests over job risks. Those complaints have now fallen behind Beijing’s national goal to stay in the global race for autonomous transport.

The pullback marks the largest monthly withdrawal since Bitcoin ETFs launched, and it comes at a time when the broader crypto market is struggling to regain direction. The price slide has been equally severe. Bitcoin has fallen more than 35% since reaching its all-time high of $126,000 in October, dropping to $80,542 on November 21—its lowest point since April. Total crypto market value also dipped below $3 trillion last week, a level not seen since early spring. Ethereum ETFs saw similar pressure, losing $1.6 billion in November alone. These moves echo the sharp declines seen during the 2022 market crisis following the collapse of FTX, with sentiment turning decisively risk-off across major exchanges. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETFs saw a record $3.7bn monthly outflow Bitcoin dropped from $126K to $80.5K in four weeks Crypto market cap fell below $3tn Ethereum ETFs lost $1.6bn in November Market Sentiment Remains Fragile Bitcoin is currently trading near $86,948, down 0.46% in the past 24 hours. Its market cap remains above $1.73 trillion, but confidence is notably weaker amid sharply lower institutional flows. ETF outflows signal a shift in investor behavior: fast-moving funds that poured in earlier this year are now rotating out, suggesting concerns about short-term liquidity, macroeconomic uncertainty, and overextended valuations. Meanwhile, traders remain cautious as BTC struggles to hold support levels that previously fueled rallies. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Is Bitcoin Nearing a Turning Point? Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC is attempting to stabilize above $86,900, but the technical structure still reflects a deep corrective phase. Price remains locked in a descending channel, with every rebound capped by the upper trendline since the rejection at $123,984. The recent bounce from $80,542 aligns with the lower channel boundary and the 0% Fibonacci retracement—an area where buyers historically step in. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum shows early improvement, with the RSI lifting from oversold territory and hinting at mild bullish divergence. Daily candles have shifted to spinning tops and smaller bodies, signaling seller fatigue. A bullish engulfing pattern could form if BTC closes decisively above $88,000, the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. A stronger trend shift requires a break above $90,798 (0.382 Fib). That would lift BTC above the channel’s midline and the 20-EMA, opening upside targets at $93,966 and $97,135. A clean breakout above $97,000 would signal the first meaningful recovery since October. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Trade Setup and Price Projection A long opportunity forms only if BTC closes above $90,800 with strong volume. Targets sit at $93,900–$97,000, with stops below $86,800. If BTC reclaims the 0.618 Fibonacci zone, the next medium-term target stretches toward $102,255, where multi-month resistance awaits. With volatility cooling and momentum gradually improving, Bitcoin may be preparing for a broader trend reversal—just as attention shifts toward upcoming presale opportunities. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.20 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year. The project mixes bold branding with real engagement features, from ROI contests to nonstop community events, giving it more personality and momentum than typical dog coins. Its shredded, leverage-obsessed mascot has already turned Maxi Doge into a recognizable culture coin. Holders can also stake $MAXI for daily smart-contract rewards and unlock access to exclusive competitions and partner events. The staking utility adds a passive-earning layer that keeps users active and invested in the ecosystem. With $MAXI priced at $0.00027 and the next increase approaching, the presale continues to gain speed. If you’re looking for a meme coin built on hype, personality, and real community energy, Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one worth watching.

This New Crypto Coin Could Outshine SHIB in 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-shiba-inu-shib-this-new-crypto-coin-could-outshine-shib-in-2026/,"For those who felt they missed out on the Shiba Inu (SHIB) bubble, there is now a new crypto coin set to provide a potentially similar, and possibly even greater, investment in the coming years. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) crypto coin has quickly developed as one of the leaders in DeFi due to early adoption and its application of use in lending and borrowing in the DeFi space. At present, it costs $0.035 to invest in Mutuum Finance and represents Phase 6 of the project’s presale, which has now reached 95% sell out status with over 18,230 members who have joined to invest in this new crypto coin to date and raising just shy of $19 million. Holding great promise due to its innovative application of issuing tokens to earn interest and scheduled to roll out its V1 Protocol to be live in Sepolia testnet in Q4 of 2025, analysts have pegged Mutuum Finance crypto coin as one of the top crypto to watch. Shiba Inu In Critical Phase Amid Years of Consolidation in Lowering Triangle Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been stuck inside a large descending triangle from its all-time high around $0.00008856 to date, as all rallies have been met by the declining resistance line and all corrections have reached the increasing lower edge. At present, it rests around $0.00000760 to $0.00000800. The long-term test of support begins as it approaches extreme oversold values via this week’s RSI of about 32. Essentially, this kind of pattern represents a spring being wound up, meaning it’s prime time for something big to happen very soon – either seeing it break past support to make way for several year-long lows or bounce towards mid-range and possibly even resistance levels. As SHIB reaches this crossroads phase, it becomes apparent that investor interests would be shifting towards something new and promising that offers both promising early development stages and actual usability in their applications. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the new crypto coin that is capturing investor attention. Gain Early Market Advantage With MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating quite a stir as it approaches the completion of Phase 6 of its presale. The present value of its tokens is $0.035, experiencing a 250% jump from what it was in Phase 1. The presale has seen over 18,230 participants join in and raise over $19 million. As it approaches Phase 7, the value of these tokens will increase to $0.04, soon reaching its expected listing value of $0.06. All these developments make MUTM have enormous promise for its early investors, making it one of the top crypto to invest in for early market participants. Roadmap Rollout Mutuum Finance is progressing into Phase 2 of development. The new phase focuses on product validation and preparedness for launch. The smart contract arrangement will be finalized in this phase. The development of the DAPP UI will also be finalized to ensure readiness to be applied in real life. The V1 Protocol Launch will be the first application test. The developments will further strengthen MUTM’s basic development and functionality to make it a leading new crypto coin. A Safe Platform Mutuum Finance has launched an interactive rewards dashboard for their top 50 token holders. The community engagement initiative allows members to monitor their rankings and rewards the investor who ranked highest every day with bonus tokens. In this way, it allows MUTM to prove its use case by engaging their community, making it a top crypto with real-world utility. The lending and borrowing smart contracts of Mutuum are presently being subjected to a security audit by an independent security firm. The final code of their platform has been audited by Halborn Security to ensure correct functionality and safeguarding of their assets. Updates on these test results will be shared publicly to be followed by announcements about testnet releases. MUTM Poised to Outshine SHIB in 2026 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly proving to be one of the major frontrunners in the upcoming 2026 crypto bull market. Currently in Phase 6 of their presale priced at $0.035, over 18,230 contributors have injected close to $19 million, and it’s seen a 250% hike from Phase 1 to date. The Phase 7 presale will be priced at $0.04 prior to its upcoming $0.06 exchange listing value, promising early birds returns of up to 500% ROI. As MUTM charts out its roadmap towards releasing its V1 Protocol Testnet deployment on Sepolia Testnet and also undergoes an audit by Halborn Security, it leaves little to be desired from its promise to provide security and functionality to its marketplace. Early birds investing in MUTM tokens to reap their returns would be advised to do so prior to the completion of presale, solidifying it as a new crypto coin with huge potential in 2026.

Binance stablecoin reserves just hit an astonishing $51.1 billion, setting a new record that signals strong liquidity during recent volatility. This surge, reported by CryptoQuant, highlights how traders are positioning themselves amid corrections. Why Are Binance Stablecoin Reserves Soaring? Stablecoin inflows into exchanges have skyrocketed, according to CryptoQuant’s data shared on X. This increase in Binance stablecoin reserves comes as the broader cryptocurrency market experiences a correction. Moreover, significant deposits of Bitcoin and Ethereum to platforms like Binance and Coinbase have pushed total exchange inflows to around $40 billion this week. These movements suggest that investors are preparing for potential buying opportunities. What Does This Mean for Crypto Traders? High Binance stablecoin reserves can indicate several key trends: Liquidity buffer: Exchanges hold more stablecoins to facilitate smooth trading and withdrawals. Investor sentiment: Traders might be converting volatile assets into stablecoins to avoid losses during downturns. Market readiness: Large reserves often precede big moves, as users wait to deploy capital when prices stabilize. Therefore, monitoring these reserves helps in predicting market direction and liquidity conditions. How Do Exchange Inflows Impact the Market? Exchange inflows, including the $40 billion reported this week, play a crucial role in market dynamics. When assets flow into exchanges, it often leads to increased selling pressure. However, the rise in Binance stablecoin reserves could counterbalance this by providing buying power. This interplay between inflows and reserves shapes short-term price action and overall stability. What Challenges Arise from High Stablecoin Reserves? While record Binance stablecoin reserves enhance liquidity, they also pose challenges. For instance, over-reliance on stablecoins might expose exchanges to regulatory scrutiny or peg risks. Additionally, if reserves are too high, it could signal caution among traders, potentially slowing market recovery. Balancing these factors is essential for sustainable growth. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts To navigate this environment, consider these steps: Track reserve data: Use analytics platforms like CryptoQuant to monitor Binance stablecoin reserves regularly. Diversify strategies: Combine long-term holds with short-term trades based on liquidity signals. Stay informed: Follow exchange announcements and market reports to anticipate shifts. By staying proactive, you can turn market volatility into opportunities. In summary, the unprecedented Binance stablecoin reserves of $51.1 billion reflect a pivotal moment in crypto markets. This liquidity surge not only supports trading during corrections but also sets the stage for future rallies. As reserves grow, they underscore the importance of stablecoins in maintaining market health and investor confidence. Frequently Asked Questions What are Binance stablecoin reserves? Binance stablecoin reserves refer to the amount of stablecoins, like USDT or USDC, held by the Binance exchange to ensure liquidity and facilitate user transactions. Why did Binance stablecoin reserves reach a record high? They surged due to increased inflows from traders moving assets into stablecoins during market corrections, as reported by CryptoQuant. How do high stablecoin reserves affect cryptocurrency prices? High reserves can provide buying pressure, potentially stabilizing or boosting prices by increasing available liquidity for purchases. What risks are associated with large stablecoin reserves? Risks include regulatory issues, potential de-pegging events, and over-concentration that might impact market dynamics if reserves are suddenly withdrawn. Can individuals benefit from monitoring these reserves? Yes, tracking reserves helps traders gauge market sentiment and liquidity, informing better investment decisions. Where can I find data on Binance stablecoin reserves? Platforms like CryptoQuant and official exchange reports provide up-to-date data on reserve levels. Found this analysis insightful?

Meanwhile, this mix of state buying and a clearly defined “invalidation” level gives traders and policymakers a shared line in the sand for Bitcoin’s next move. Texas Invests $5M in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, Lines Up $5M in Self-Custodied BTC Texas has taken its first formal step toward a state Bitcoin reserve, purchasing $5 million worth of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on Nov. 20 as it prepares to hold Bitcoin directly on its balance sheet. The transaction, revealed this week by Texas Blockchain Council president Lee Bratcher, used part of a $10 million allocation from the state’s general revenue for Bitcoin. Bratcher said the initial $5 million was placed into IBIT as a temporary vehicle while Texas finalizes its process to “self-custody Bitcoin,” with another $5 million earmarked for a direct Bitcoin purchase once a custody framework and vendor contracts are in place. Texas Bitcoin Purchase Symbolic. Source: Lee Bratcher via X Earlier this year, lawmakers and Governor Greg Abbott created the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under Senate Bill 21 , authorizing the state to hold Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. The law set aside $10 million for cryptocurrency investments and requires any asset in the reserve to have maintained at least a $500 billion market capitalization over 24 months, a threshold Bitcoin meets but IBIT does not, underscoring the plan to move from ETF exposure to self-custodied coins. Texas’ move comes as several U.S. states explore or experiment with crypto exposure. Wisconsin’s state investment board previously disclosed a sizable position in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF through pension funds, but Texas is positioning this allocation as the opening step of a dedicated, state-managed Bitcoin reserve rather than a traditional investment holding. Bitcoin Bounces Off Channel as Trader Sets 78K–79K Line in the Sand Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading around 87,000 USDT on the weekly Bybit chart after rebounding from a long-term rising channel. The latest candles show price holding above layered trend support that has guided the advance since 2023, with buyers stepping in as BTC dipped into the mid-80,000 zone.

Source: Profit Blue X In the chart shared by trader Profit Blue, two green arcs mark recent lows near the lower boundary of that channel, outlining a potential double-bottom structure. The pattern appears after a sharp drawdown from the 130,000 area, yet weekly closes remain inside the channel, signaling that the broader uptrend is still in place for now. Profit Blue labels 78,000–79,000 USDT as the “invalidation” zone, stating that a sustained move below that band would undermine the bullish view.

According to PayPal’s official sweepstakes webpage , which went live last week, the promotion has been running since November 17 and will end at 12 PM PST on December 21. It offers weekly prizes and a grand total of 1,008 winners for US residents aged 18 or older. “We’re not saying you’ll win $100K in bitcoin this week…but someone is going to. We’re giving away more than $1M in bitcoin prizes, No purchase necessary,” PayPal wrote on its official X account. PayPal sweepstakes to reward 168 winners weekly According to the promotion’s terms and conditions, participants with a PayPal account can enter by purchasing at least $1 of cryptocurrencies available on the platform, excluding its stablecoin PYUSD . Qualifying currencies include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Each qualifying purchase earns one entry per Weekly Sweepstakes Period, up to 10 entries. Those without accounts must first sign up for a free personal one and submit their details on the PayPal Crypto Sweepstakes page, with the full name and email address matching their account. Finally, they are required to complete a “Qualifying Transaction” by buying crypto through PayPal. Active and existing account holders can enter the competition without making a purchase. Mail-in entries require hand-printing personal details, including full name, mailing address, phone number, email, age, and “PayPal Crypto Sweepstakes” on a 3″ x 5″ card. Handwritten entries must be mailed to the PayPal Crypto Sweepstakes launchpad in Georgia and received by 11:59:59 p.m. PST on December 23, but photocopies are not accepted. The Sweepstakes features five weekly periods, which will see 168 winners selected every week to bring the total to 1,008 and a prize pool of $1.386 million. Prizes are randomly allocated into three tiers, with the first having $100,000 Bitcoin prize for six winners. Tier 2 provides $10,000 in Bitcoin for 30 winners, and Tier 3 consists of 972 winners receiving $500 in Bitcoin each. PayPal also mentioned that provisional winners are contacted via email within 10 working days of selection. Tier 1 winners must provide identity and eligibility verification, while Tier 2 and 3 victors will receive unique codes directing them to submit verification online. Those who fail to respond within five working days may be disqualified, and their prize moves on to another winner. PayPal embraces crypto promotions after years of tug-of-war The announcement has caught most of the crypto community by surprise, with some questioning if PayPal’s X account had been hacked to promote a crypto scam. “Did the PayPal Twitter get hacked? Why does this read like I’m about to lose all my money in a rug pull somehow?” wrote the operator of VPN service Windscribe on X. Jzz… Is this a Crypto Spam Post from @PayPal !?!? 😮 😅 This promo screams ""enter your seed phrase.""!!! — Jorge A | Tech Tinkerer (@iterativeguy) November 26, 2025 Cryptopolitan can confirm the promotion is legitimate, but no user has come forward claiming to have won any prize, although it has been 10 days since the sweepstakes began. “I don’t trust the PayPal mafia, but this is bullish for Bitcoin adoption,” said one Bitcoin supporter. PayPal first began accepting cryptocurrency in October 2020, enabling US users to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. The company expanded its crypto offerings in 2021 with “Checkout with Crypto” for users to purchase goods and services at PayPal merchants using digital currencies. In 2023, PayPal launched PYUSD, a stablecoin it claimed is backed 1:1 by US dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. PYUSD is issued by Paxos Trust Company and redeemable for US dollars, currently holding a market cap of $3.77 billion per Coinmarketcap. Cryptopolitan reported on Tuesday that PYUSD-issuer Paxos acquired New York-based digital asset storage firm Fordefi for over $100 million. Fordefi reportedly has 40 employees and 300 clients, and was valued at $83 million during its last fundraising round. The acquisition comes after Paxos purchased Finland stablecoin issuer Membrane Finance in a deal that began in late 2024 but was finalized in February.

The Cosmos community is actively debating a major ATOM tokenomics overhaul to address pressing issues like high inflation and price drops. This move could reshape the future of the ATOM ecosystem, making it more sustainable and appealing to investors. What is driving the ATOM tokenomics overhaul? The Cosmos network faces challenges with its current tokenomics model, including an inflation rate that many find too high. Therefore, community members are proposing changes to stabilize the economy. For instance, lowering the inflation rate could reduce selling pressure and support long-term growth. Moreover, these adjustments aim to make ATOM a core asset for transactions across the network. How will the new ATOM tokenomics model work? Key proposals in the ATOM tokenomics overhaul include introducing a variable inflation mechanism tied to network fees. This means that as transaction fees accumulate, inflation adjusts dynamically. Additionally, plans involve unifying ATOM for gas fees and reserves, which streamlines operations. Here are the main benefits: Lower inflation to curb price volatility Enhanced staking rewards for loyal participants Greater utility as a primary network asset By implementing these changes, the Cosmos ecosystem could become more resilient and user-friendly. What challenges does the ATOM tokenomics overhaul face? However, revising ATOM tokenomics isn’t without hurdles. Community consensus is crucial, and disagreements may slow progress. Furthermore, technical implementation requires careful planning to avoid disruptions. Despite these obstacles, the potential rewards make this effort worthwhile for stakeholders. Why should you care about ATOM tokenomics changes? If you hold ATOM or are considering investment, understanding this ATOM tokenomics overhaul is vital. It could influence token value and network adoption. For example, better incentives for stakers might encourage more participation, strengthening security. Ultimately, these updates aim to position Cosmos as a leader in the blockchain space. Conclusion: The future of ATOM tokenomics In summary, the Cosmos community’s push for an ATOM tokenomics overhaul represents a proactive step toward sustainability. By addressing inflation and enhancing utility, these changes could unlock new opportunities. Keep an eye on developments, as they might set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions What is ATOM tokenomics? ATOM tokenomics refers to the economic model governing the Cosmos cryptocurrency, including inflation, staking, and utility mechanisms. Why is the Cosmos community discussing changes? They aim to reduce high inflation and recent price declines by making ATOM more efficient and valuable. How will stakers benefit from the overhaul? Long-term stakers may receive greater rewards and incentives, promoting network security. What is a variable inflation mechanism? It adjusts inflation based on cumulative network fees, creating a more responsive economic system. When will these changes take effect? Implementation depends on community voting and technical development, with no fixed timeline yet. Can this overhaul affect ATOM’s price? Yes, positive changes could boost investor confidence and potentially increase the token’s value.

Could this be the most undervalued Layer 1 blockchain at the moment? This article delves into Aptos' current situation and explores whether it's primed for a rebound. Discover which other cryptocurrencies might be poised for growth. Aptos (APT) Shows Promise Despite Current Price Challenges Source: tradingview Aptos is trading between just over two dollars and under three dollars. It recently dropped in value, but there is potential for rebound. If it breaks through to its nearest resistance, it could climb to around three and a half dollars. This represents a possible spike of nearly half its current price. However, if it struggles, it might dip towards support levels closer to two dollars. The coin's strength is currently moderate, indicating potential for upward movement. Despite its recent drops, Aptos could grow up to 30%, reaching its first significant resistance if market conditions improve. Conclusion APT has experienced a sharp decline of 21% over the past week. This notable drop has raised questions about whether APT is currently the most oversold among major Layer 1 coins.

Coinbase Ventures seeks to invest in developer teams involved in trading terminals, next-generation DeFi, asset tokenization, advancing agentic AI, and specialized exchanges. Coinbase Ventures emphasized that the next protocols and companies to break out big will emerge from these categories. The VC added that it is actively looking to invest in ideas under these categories, come next year. Pitchbook claims that Coinbase Ventures has invested in over 618 initiatives since 2018, and its portfolio includes about 422 startups. The VC’s latest investment was on November 18 in a DeFi compliance platform called Oxbow. It had previously invested in ZAR and Zynk (payment infrastructure firms) and Kalshi (prediction market platform) in October. Kinji Steimetz, working in Ventures at Coinbase Ventures, expects perpetual futures contracts to be among the new avenues for RWA (real-world assets) exposure. Coinbase Ventures breaks down the nine categories Coinbase Ventures urged any developers/builders in the following areas to get in touch (including through X DMs). The VC is actively looking to invest in RWA perpetuals, as well as specialized exchanges and trading terminals, AI and robotics, and next-generation DeFi. Under the “Specialized Exchanges and Trading Terminals” category, the VC will focus on alternative prop-AMMs and prediction market trading terminals. It will also focus on the composability of perpetual markets, unsecured credit lending, and on-chain privacy under the “Next-generation DeFi” category. “We are seeing a surge of developer energy focused on privacy-preserving assets (e.g., Zcash) and DeFi applications (e.g., private orderbooks, borrow/lend, etc) and dedicated blockchains for payments touting privacy as a raison d’etre.” – Ethan Oak , investor at Coinbase Ventures Under the robotics and AI category, the VC will focus on robotics & humanoid data collections, proof of humanity, and AI for on-chain security & development. Jonathan King, another investor at Coinbase Ventures, believes the opportunity squarely lies in agentic tooling. King claims that this agentic tooling will make the security/risk management and development of smart contracts as accessible as current web building. The Coinbase Ventures investor also noted that the development of smart contracts is about to hit its moment on GitHub Copilot. He further noted that AI agents might democratize on-chain building, generating smart contract code in hours rather than months. The AI agents will also handle continuous monitoring and security reviews. Steimetz says perpetual futures contracts will create synthetic exposure Steimetz said he expects new avenues for RWA exposure to emerge through perpetual futures contracts, noting that they would create synthetic exposure to off-chain assets. He also stressed the increasing importance of prop-AMMs (proprietary automated market makers). Steimetz believes prop-AMMs represent an innovative exchange design that aims to prevent bots and traders from exploiting liquidity providers. Meanwhile, King projects that prediction market platforms will rise in popularity. He envisions them becoming the dominant interface layer that will consolidate fragmented liquidity, reaching nearly $600 million. He also believes they will be providing a blended view of real-time event odds across multiple sources and venues. On the other hand, Coinbase Ventures stated that it will support builders driving the on-chain economy forward or taking significant risks. The VC also asserted that all the identified ideas represent where the company sees massive potential. These ideas will unlock an explosion of on-chain experiments and apps. The Head of Coinbase Ventures, Hoolie Tejwani, also chimed in. He says that the combination of open-source developer standards, biometrics, and cryptographic signing will be essential in establishing a proof-of-humanity solution. He also added that his company’s proof of humanity solution would support multiple approaches to increasingly complex projects. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

With over $17.5 million raised and dynamic staking rewards, Best Wallet positions itself as a serious contender in the multi-chain wallet race. Maxi Doge blends meme culture with structured trading competitions, a dynamic APY model, and a funded treasury to support long-term community growth. Remittix targets real-world remittances, combining CertiK-audited smart contracts, CEX listings, and broad fiat coverage to streamline cross-border payments. Bitcoin just printed one of its sharpest retracements of the year, shedding around 30% since notching fresh highs in early October. Instead of de‑risking, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet is doubling down, taking a $130M loan to buy even more $BTC and effectively leveraging its existing holdings. That kind of aggressive treasury strategy is bullish for Bitcoin’s long-term narrative but brutal for balance sheets tied too tightly to spot prices. A number of digital asset treasuries are now sitting on sizeable drawdowns and seeing the impact in equity volatility and governance pressure across the sector. For many investors, the message is simple: holding only $BTC on the corporate or personal balance sheet is a concentration risk. In corrections like this, capital often rotates toward high-conviction presales that can outrun Bitcoin on a percentage basis if the next leg higher plays out as expected. That’s where this current cycle looks interesting. Some of the best crypto presales in the market are not just meme-driven liquidity grabs; they’re building actual infrastructure in wallets, trading communities, and cross-border payments. Below are three presales and early-stage tokens that are catching this rotation, led by Best Wallet Presale ($BEST) , which is a direct play on the wallet layer of Web3. 1. Best Wallet Presale ($BEST) — The Next Gen Crypto Wallet If Metaplanet is the poster child for balance-sheet Bitcoin, Best Wallet Presale ($BEST) is a bet on the rails that everyday users actually touch. The project wants to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026 by becoming the easiest, safest, most feature‑dense wallet on mobile. Instead of choosing between custodial convenience and clunky non-custodial UX, Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP infrastructure for institutional-grade key management into a consumer-friendly, mobile-first app. Users can build custom multi-wallet portfolios across multiple chains, with a Rubic-powered DEX aggregator for best execution. Where it really differentiates itself in a risk-on presale cycle is discovery. The Upcoming Tokens portal curates early-stage launches and streamlines the presale participation flow, allowing you to access vetted early token opportunities directly from your wallet. That matters when investors are hunting the ‘next one’ without wanting to chase every Telegram link and sketchy landing page. You can dive deeper into the token’s fundamentals in this recent analysis. On the token side, $BEST holders get reduced transaction fees across the ecosystem and access to higher-yield options via a built-in staking aggregator. There’s an 8% allocation (800M tokens) reserved for staking rewards, with a dynamic APY based on a user’s share of the pool, and immediate staking is already live for presale buyers. Learn how to buy $BEST to start staking today. That mix is clearly resonating. The presale has already raised $17.5M with tokens at $0.026005, positioning Best Wallet among the cycle’s largest wallet-focused raises. For a longer-term view on where the token could trade post-launch, see this Best Wallet price prediction . If you’re comparing wallet plays in this drawdown, it’s worth digging deeper into how Best Wallet’s Fireblocks MPC-CMP stack and presale access machine could reprice the category. Learn more about Best Wallet Token. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) — High-Octane Meme Trading Community If Bitcoin leverage is moving off-chain into corporate treasuries, meme culture is still where retail tests its risk tolerance. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans directly into that with a ‘never skip leg-day, never skip a pump’ brand that wraps 1000x energy into a community-first meme ecosystem. Rather than just vibing on memes, Maxi Doge emphasizes trader identity. The project bills itself as a 240‑lb canine juggernaut representing the leveraged degen mindset, then backs it with holder-only trading competitions, leaderboards, and rewards designed to gamify high-conviction trading behavior without needing actual 1000x perpetuals. The tokenomics are tuned for engagement and runway. A Maxi Fund treasury supports liquidity and partnership deals, while a dynamic APY staking mode (currently sitting at 73%) rewards longer-term conviction in the community. That gives $MAXI more structural depth than the average meme coin that dominated earlier cycles. Money is noticeable here, too. The presale has raised $4.2M with tokens priced at $0.00027, a level that still leaves psychological room for the ‘many zeros’ meme crowd while funding real ecosystem development. To learn more, check out our guide on how to buy $MAXI. If you think culture remains the leading indicator for liquidity, Maxi Doge is an obvious candidate on the meme side of this rotation. For traders who want meme exposure that is explicitly built around trading competitions and treasury-backed expansion, Maxi Doge offers a differentiated angle versus yet another dog with no roadmap. Check out the Maxi Doge presale. 3. Remittix (RTX) — DeFi Rails for Global Crypto Remittances While Metaplanet borrows against BTC to stack more, another big use case for crypto remains unsolved at scale: making cross-border money transfers cheaper and faster without forcing users to care about gas fees or bridges. Remittix ($RTX) is an Ethereum-based DeFi project built specifically for crypto‑to‑fiat remittances. The protocol focuses on crypto-to-bank transfers with real-time FX conversion, allowing users to send from supported cryptocurrencies and have receivers receive fiat in their local bank accounts. Its mobile wallet reportedly supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies across more than 30 countries, positioning Remittix as a specialist remittance rail rather than a general-purpose DeFi wallet. Security and listings are already part of the story. CertiK has audited Remittix smart contracts , and the token has confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, which can help with post-presale liquidity. The team has also lined up a $250K giveaway campaign around its Q3 2025 wallet beta launch, using incentives to bootstrap user adoption. In terms of capital raised, Remittix is one of 2025’s standout presales, reportedly pulling in over $24.5M and ranking as a top pre-launch token by volume. For investors looking beyond price action into real-world payment rails, Remittix offers a complementary thesis to wallet and meme plays: turning volatile crypto into local fiat with minimal friction. Learn more on the official Remittix site. Recap : As Metaplanet levers up on Bitcoin after a 30% drawdown, capital is rotating into high-conviction presales with clear narratives. Best Wallet Token , Maxi Doge , and Remittix each target different parts of the stack, with Best Wallet’s Fireblocks-powered, presale-focused app standing out as the most infrastructure-driven bet.

According to analysts, this development points to a market environment dominated by sellers, raising concerns about the potential for continued price instability and a drawn-out period of adjustment. A Critical Divergence Unravels New data from Arab Chain posted earlier today shows Binance’s CVD hovering near –$94.8 billion, one of its weakest levels since 2023. The indicator tracks the difference between buy and sell volume, and such a steep negative value means that sell orders have consistently outweighed buys over an extended period. Arab Chain analysts pointed out that this imbalance has been in place since early 2024, even as Bitcoin climbed to near-record levels around $125,000 before sliding toward $80,800. They said that the divergence between rising prices and weakening CVD is a signal that much of the rally was built on leveraged derivatives rather than solid spot demand. This view fits neatly with on-chain behavior from long-term holders (LTHs) captured by Axel Adler Jr. He highlighted that LTH supply has dropped from a peak of 15.75 million BTC to 13.6 million BTC, the lowest level since the bull cycle began. Between November 11 and 25, this group offloaded more than 803,000 BTC, averaging over 53,000 BTC sold per day, which is classic distribution at elevated prices. Their 30-day Net Position Change has turned as negative as previous major profit-taking waves in March and October 2024, both of which came before sharp pullbacks. At the same time, Merlijn The Trader noted today that Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-Score has dropped below a key support level that held every major rally of this cycle, warning that the “floor is gone” and recalling a prior 42% slide after a similar breakdown. Price Stagnation At the market, Bitcoin has been flat in the last 24 hours, and is currently trading at around $87,500 per CoinGecko. However, it is down about 4% over the previous seven days and 15% in the past two weeks. The picture is the same across even longer timeframes, with the OG crypto shedding nearly 25% of its value in the past month, and is over 7% lower than where it was around the same time last year. That drawdown puts BTC nearly 25% lower than its October 6 all-time high, when it went past $126,000, and, as observed by Adler, sits against a broader backdrop of sideways trading and heavy liquidations. Additionally, recent CryptoQuant analysis showed that Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio has dropped back toward zero, a zone previously seen in 2019, 2020, and 2022 before new multi-month trends formed. For risk-aware investors, that backdrop offers a more attractive long-term entry window, even as experts warned that whales are still trimming holdings and that further wicks into the $70,000–$80,000 range remain possible.

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sudden Volatility Jump Signals Options Could Be Calling The Shots—Analyst Whales Trim Positions Before Crash According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, large holders played a central role. Wallets holding between 1,000–10,000 BTC pared back their stakes in the weeks leading up to the fall. Those big sellers took profits after the October rally, and in many cases selling was steady rather than panicked. When large players step back like that, market depth can vanish quickly. A quick overview of Bitcoin’s price decline shows prices slid from record highs above $126,000 in October to roughly $81,000 at the lowest point, before a partial bounce to $87k was recorded. Traders and funds were caught off guard by the speed of the move. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $87,086, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Retail Selling Added To Pressure Based on reports, small wallets also leaned toward safety. Holders under 10 BTC and groups up to 1,000 BTC reduced positions, removing another layer of potential buyers. Has Bitcoin Found Its Bottom? Cohorts Tell the Whole Story “BTC may have formed a local bottom, supported by a strong rebound and accumulation from: 100–1k BTC holders. >10k BTC holders. However, the crucial 1k–10k BTC cohort is still distributing, preventing a full… pic.twitter.com/dGU4CBD1Bw — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 25, 2025 Buying interest from casual investors was weaker than expected. Mid-sized holders — those with 10–100 and 100–1,000 BTC — did buy during the correction, and their activity helped slow the slide. Still, their buying power was not enough to match the large outflows. Futures Liquidations Intensified The Drop Reports show that futures market dynamics turned a correction into a crash. Over a 13-day stretch, long positions were forcefully closed out. That cascade removed bids and created a chain reaction of selling that pushed Bitcoin from around $105K down to $81K. Liquidations were heavy, and the selling pressure was compounded as each forced sale fed into the next. A Tentative Rebound Shows Life After the lows were hit, Bitcoin climbed back to about $87,500. This rebound has been taken by some as a sign that a local bottom might be forming. According to CryptoQuant, however, the recovery cannot be considered secure while the 1,000–10,000 BTC group keeps reducing holdings. The market’s health was being tested by who chose to sell and who chose to buy. Bottom Status Hinges On Whale Activity Market watchers say a true reversal needs selling from large wallets to stop. If those whales pause, mid-sized buyers might build a firmer floor and confidence could return. If selling continues, lower levels may be explored once again. The coming sessions will be watched closely by traders who want to see whether large holders change course or keep cashing out.

Bitcoin could face further losses after its recent crash, if CryptoQuant’s data is anything to go by. Large holders have been taking profits, while retail investors have also been selling, leaving fewer buyers to support the market. Analysts say the next move will depend on whether these big holders continue selling or if mid-sized buyers step in to stabilize prices.

This initiative involves seeking nominations for the newly formed CFTC CEO Innovation Council, with a submission deadline set for December 8. During her prepared remarks , Pham emphasized that the council would help the agency effectively prepare for impending regulations as the Senate gears up to consider a new crypto market structure bill. Key Priorities For CFTC’s Crypto Regulation Efforts Under Pham’s guidance, the CFTC has made substantial strides in innovation and market structure. This includes initiatives such as the Crypto CEO Forum, the exploration of prediction markets , perpetual contracts, and the concept of 24/7 trading. Notably, the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint initiative, aiming to implement the recommendations from President Donald Trump’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, is projected to continue until August 2026. Phạm outlined key priorities for the initiative, including enabling listed spot crypto trading on designated contract markets (DCMs), facilitating the use of tokenized collateral within derivatives markets, and proposing necessary technical amendments to CFTC regulations to accommodate blockchain and tokenization. Pham expressed optimism that the CFTC would implement listed spot crypto trading on DCMs by the end of this year, with guidance regarding tokenized collateral expected by early 2026. “The US is leading a new era in market structure, and the CFTC is at the forefront of this renaissance accelerated by innovation and technology,” Pham remarked. She stressed the importance of engaging with industry leaders and visionaries to shape responsible regulations that will lay the groundwork for what she described as America’s “Golden Age of Innovation.” Pham’s Tenure Nears End Last week, Pham discussed the CFTC’s ongoing progress at an industry conference focused on futures and options, where she detailed the agency’s regulatory approach to digital assets . Drawing parallels to past developments in the financial markets, she mentioned that blockchain technology and tokenization are ushering in a “structural modernization” of market infrastructure. In addition, Pham pointed to increased collaboration between the CFTC and the SEC, citing a recent joint roundtable focused on regulatory harmonization. She highlighted congressional efforts such as the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act , both of which aim to create a comprehensive federal framework for digital assets and stablecoins. As the CFTC anticipates future developments, Pham’s tenure as acting chair is approaching its conclusion. Last week, US senators questioned Michael Selig, President Trump’s nominee to lead the agency, regarding his plans for revamping cryptocurrency regulations and addressing election betting. As reported by Reuters, Selig advocated for “clear, simple guidelines” for the crypto sector, emphasizing the opportunity to establish a framework that supports software developers and emerging exchanges, while ensuring investor protections.

54927608,634775,1764158713,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54927608.jpeg,Best Altcoins to Buy as $XRP ETFs Pull in $622M and Eclipse Solana,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-xrp-dominates-etf-inflows/,"Quick Facts: $XRP’s leading ETF status and $622M inflows show institutions are finally rotating serious capital beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This cycle is leading traders to look beyond the top cryptocurrencies and search for the best altcoins to buy, with $PEPENODE, $SUBBD, and $XRP leading the list. PEPENODE’s virtual mining and tiered nodes turn meme coins into mine-to-earn economies, rewarding early adopters without hardware or energy costs. SUBBD combines Web3 payments, staking, and AI creator tools to adapt to the $85B content industry from a crypto-native angle. XRP ($XRP) has just flipped the narrative for altcoins. After years of ‘only Bitcoin and Ethereum matter,’ $XRP ETFs have emerged as the leading altcoin product , pulling in more than $622M in eight trading days and even outpacing Solana’s inflows . That isn’t noise but a rotation signal. As capital finally moves beyond the big two cryptos, institutions are effectively curating a short list of altcoins they trust: scalable infrastructure, clear narratives, and real users. Retail usually chases this flow late. If you saw $XRP hit $2.23 yesterday , then you’ve seen what happens when sentiment turns fast. The smarter play now is asking a different question: if $XRP is the first beneficiary of this shift, which are the best altcoins to buy to catch the next wave of liquidity? That’s where early-stage exposure can still offer asymmetric upside. Below are three very different ways to position for that rotation: PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) virtual miner, SUBBD Token’s ($SUBBD) AI and Web3 creator platform, and $XRP itself, which is quietly becoming the institutional benchmark for altcoin exposure. 1. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin with Virtual Nodes PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) positions itself as the world’s first mine-to-earn meme coin, taking the old-school mining concept and turning it into a virtual, gamified economy on Ethereum. Instead of buying ASICs and worrying about sky-high electricity bills, you’ll be able to acquire and upgrade virtual miner nodes, then earn meme coin rewards like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN for your in-game performance. At the core is a Virtual Mining System with tiered node rewards. As an early adopter, you can secure more powerful nodes that generate higher returns, echoing how early Bitcoin miners enjoyed outsized rewards. But here it’s abstracted into an ERC-20 system without hardware or technical barriers. Gameplay and the full dashboard go live post-TGE. In the meantime, though, you can stake your $PEPENODE for a massive 587% APY. The presale numbers show real traction already: $2.2M already raised, with tokens currently priced at $0.0011638. That’s still micro-cap territory relative to mainstream meme coins, but with clear upside if mine-to-earn becomes a recognizable sub-narrative. Buying early lets you buy and stake during presale for boosted returns, effectively front-running future node inflation. Learn how to join the presale in our guide to buying PEPENODE . If you’ve missed earlier meme cycles or are bored with copy-paste dog coins with no mechanic beyond speculation, $PEPENODE offers a more structured, game-like path to yield. With altcoin capital rotating into narratives with engagement, not just logos, a gamified mining economy could stand out. Join the $PEPENODE presale today. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – AI Creator Economy Tokenizing the $85B Content Market While $XRP captures institutional flows, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is targeting a very different prize: the $85B content creation industry. The project’s pitch is straightforward: most creators are trapped in Web2 rails, sharing revenue with platforms while having limited control over their data, audience, and monetization options. SUBBD merges Web3 and AI to flip that model. On-chain, SUBBD acts as the coordination and payment layer: lower fees, crypto payouts, and token-gated access for exclusive content. On the AI side, creators get an AI personal assistant for automated fan interactions, AI voice cloning, and even full AI influencer creation. That enables a creator to scale their presence across multiple channels without diluting brand control or giving everything to centralized platforms. For more details on the project, check out our SUBBD Token review . The presale metrics are already notable: $1.3M+ raised with tokens at $0.05705, plus a 20% first-year staking yield for early participants. As a creator, you’ll get a clear business vertical (creator tools) with tokenized upside and on-chain yield, rather than a vague AI narrative alone. Holding $SUBBD also means attractive benefits for fans, including access to exclusive content, platform discounts, staking benefits, and more. If the SUBBD team delivers on its promise and the project gains traction from both creators and fans, then the platform could have a bright future ahead of it. The same goes for its $SUBBD token, which our SUBBD Token price prediction sees reaching a potential high of $0.48 by the end of 2026. That’s about a 741% increase from its current price. Don’t delay. Join the $SUBBD presale now. 3. Ripple ($XRP) – Institutional-Grade Rail for Cross-Border Liquidity Ripple’s $XRP remains the institutional altcoin benchmark, and its recent price action proves it. Designed for fast, low-cost cross-border payments on the XRP Ledger, $XRP offers 3- to 5-second transaction finality and negligible fees, making it attractive for banks, fintechs, and liquidity providers that need reliable settlement. This utility is now mirrored in market structure. $XRP has become the leading altcoin ETF, attracting more than $622M in inflows in just eight trading days. The considerable number is primarily thanks to Franklin Templeton and Grayscale’s entry, which added over $62M and $67M respectively in inflows yesterday. That amount of inflows allowed $XRP to surpass Solana’s and signaled that institutions want liquid, battle-tested assets when they step outside $BTC and $ETH. The market reacted positively to the jump in $XRP inflows. In yesterday’s trading, the cryptocurrency’s value hit $2.23 after spending the past several days under $2.20. Its rebound reinforced the coin’s status as a primary vehicle for altcoin exposure rather than a speculative side bet. If you’re a crypto investor, $XRP represents the blue-chip end of the current rotation, allowing you to ride institutional adoption of blockchain payments with relatively lower volatility than micro-caps. Pairing a core $XRP position with selective bets in narratives like mine-to-earn ($PEPENODE) and AI creator platforms ($SUBBD) can therefore be a winning combination in the market’s current cycle. Buy $XRP at its current price of $2.17 on Binance. Recap: As $XRP ETFs lead altcoin inflows and print fresh highs, capital is clearly rotating beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. $PEPENODE , $SUBBD , and $XRP offer three distinct ways to position: gamified mine-to-earn, AI-driven creator rails, and institutional payments infrastructure.

54927673,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90725,1764158748,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Rumor: BlackRock XRP ETF Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/rumor-blackrock-xrp-etf-is-coming/,"The digital asset market is buzzing again, and this time the excitement centers on a potential development involving one of the world’s largest asset managers. Speculation about a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded fund has gripped analysts, traders, and institutions. The rumor arrives at a moment when interest in tokenized finance is accelerating, and when institutional demand for XRP-related products has surged across multiple regions. The possibility of an XRP ETF from the industry’s most influential issuer has therefore sparked renewed debate about how far mainstream integration may go. Amonyx shared the initial claim on X, stating that a BlackRock XRP ETF “is coming.” The post quickly gained traction, especially as investors continue examining every new signal related to institutional adoption. Although the rumor remains unconfirmed, it has prompted a fresh review of BlackRock’s public remarks on digital assets, tokenization, and the future structure of capital markets. These remarks provide important context and help explain why speculation about an XRP product has intensified. BREAKING: BlackRock #XRP ETF is coming. pic.twitter.com/BZMM7LpOnr — Amonyx (@amonbuy) November 26, 2025 Tokenization as BlackRock’s Strategic Focus BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has repeatedly emphasized the transformational role of tokenization. His recent comments went further than usual and highlighted the expected redesign of market infrastructure. “We believe the next step going forward will be that tokenization of financial assets,” he said. He explained that every stock and bond will eventually have “its own CUSIP,” all existing on a unified ledger. He added that every investor would have “our own number” and clear identification within that system. Fink detailed how this model would reduce illicit activities, simplify compliance, and strengthen market integrity. He stressed that the major benefit would be instant settlement because tokenized assets operate as “a line item.” He also said that tokenization ensures real ownership visibility, allowing each investor to vote their shares directly. These comments demonstrate that BlackRock views tokenization as a structural evolution, not a speculative trend. They also explain why rumors of an XRP ETF appear more credible to many analysts. XRP’s design as a fast-settlement asset fits neatly into the framework Fink described. While his remarks never referenced XRP directly, they align with the broader vision that XRP supporters have cited for years. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Environment and Market Expectations Growing optimism also reflects recent shifts in the regulatory climate. U.S. regulators have become more open to tokenized assets and blockchain-based settlement models. That shift has encouraged larger asset managers to expand their digital asset strategies. XRP ETFs launched outside the United States have also strengthened expectations that U.S. issuers may follow the same path. These developments add weight to the market’s belief that a firm like BlackRock could eventually pursue an XRP product. Where the Rumor Stands Today Despite the enthusiasm, BlackRock has not confirmed any XRP ETF plans. No filings have appeared, and the company has remained silent regarding the rumor. For now, the excitement rests entirely on market interpretation, public statements on tokenization, and Amonyx’s viral post. Investors will continue monitoring disclosures, regulatory databases, and institutional custody flows for any confirmed movement. The rumor may remain unverified, but the discussion highlights an important shift. Tokenization is no longer theoretical, and institutional interest in fast-settlement assets is rising. Whether or not BlackRock enters the XRP market soon, the industry’s trajectory points toward deeper integration between traditional finance and blockchain-driven infrastructure.

The real question now is whether institutional interest can prevent a further decline. This article delves into the current market dynamics and explores which cryptocurrencies show potential for growth in this volatile environment. Readers will find valuable insights into possible market movers. Solana Price Hints at Recovery, Eyeing $178 with Modest Recent Gains Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is trading between $119.93 and $142.96, showing signs of a cautious rebound. After a steep monthly decline of over 30%, it seems to have stabilized. The ten-day and hundred-day moving averages at about $138 suggest steadying momentum. Key resistance at $155 could challenge further gains. If momentum strengthens, reaching the second resistance at $178 is possible, representing a notable increase from its current price range. Solana’s Relative Strength Index near 48 signals it’s not overbought or oversold, indicating potential room for growth. With the current setup, SOL's price may be poised to rise significantly, potentially gaining over 20% if it reaches its next major resistance. Conclusion SOL faces a crucial moment as it battles sellers around the $136 mark. Institutional interest might provide the support needed to prevent further decline. If SOL maintains this level and attracts significant investment, it could stabilize and potentially rise. Market trends and investor confidence will play key roles in determining SOL's next move.

54928105,https://coinpaper.com/12670/xrp-supply-shock-73-m-tokens-move-off-exchanges-as-jp-morgan-calls-crypto-a-tradable-macro-asset,1764159254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,XRP Supply Shock? 73M Tokens Move Off Exchanges as JPMorgan Calls Crypto a Tradable Macro Asset,https://coinpaper.com/12670/xrp-supply-shock-73-m-tokens-move-off-exchanges-as-jp-morgan-calls-crypto-a-tradable-macro-asset,"73 Million XRP Leave Exchanges: What It Signals for the Market Market analyst Steph is Crypto reports that 73 million XRP left centralized exchanges in 24 hours, a massive outflow that highlights rising investor confidence, accelerating long-term accumulation, and growing anticipation for XRP’s next market move. Notably, Massive exchange outflows signal a clear trend that investors are shifting XRP into self-custody, a behavior linked to long-term conviction rather than short-term trading. Traders sell on exchanges when they anticipate volatility or downturns, but when they expect growth, scarcity, or major catalysts, they withdraw assets. This move reduces immediate sell pressure and tightens supply, often foreshadowing bullish momentum. Well, the sudden withdrawal of 73 million XRP in a single day fits a well-known accumulation pattern, signaling that whales and institutions may be positioning ahead of major bullish catalysts. With global adoption of Ripple’s payment technology accelerating, regulatory clarity improving, and anticipation building around potential XRP-focused institutional products such as ETFs, the timing of this massive outflow is hard to ignore. On-chain analysts often interpret major outflows as early signs of an impending supply shock, when circulating liquidity drops while demand stays constant or rises. This imbalance frequently drives prices higher, especially in assets with limited available supply. With XRP’s strong base of long-term holders, the asset may be edging into precisely this kind of bullish supply-tightening phase. Even though exchange outflows don’t guarantee price movement, they offer a clear look into market sentiment. Paired with rising adoption narratives and renewed investor confidence across the broader crypto market, XRP’s supply is tightening fast. If this trend continues, volatility could increase, potentially to the upside, as fewer tokens remain available for spot trading. For now, the 73 million XRP withdrawal stands as one of the strongest signals of growing confidence in XRP’s long-term trajectory. JP Morgan Flags Crypto’s Evolution Into a Tradable Macro Asset Class JP Morgan research signals a major shift that cryptocurrencies are evolving from venture-style projects into a tradable macro asset class, highlighting rising institutional involvement and a maturing market that increasingly mirrors traditional finance. The bank notes that crypto’s early years were shaped by large private funding rounds, with projects receiving significant venture capital before tokens hit public markets. Retail investors typically joined late, driving speculative price surges but providing limited liquidity. As a result, early crypto price action was often dictated by hype and funding decisions rather than sustainable market fundamentals. Therefore, JP Morgan highlights a shift in crypto markets that as institutional liquidity enters, digital assets are increasingly trading like macro instruments, akin to commodities or forex, where major players shape liquidity, volatility, and market dynamics. This growing institutional presence is stabilizing markets, reducing reliance on retail speculation, and fostering more scalable, transparent trading conditions. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP remain attractive investment opportunities. Uneven liquidity across exchanges often triggers sharp price swings, creating both risks and strategic advantages for informed investors. Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative, Ethereum’s smart contract dominance, and XRP’s role in global payments position them as key assets in the emerging macro crypto class. Their relative liquidity appeals to institutions, while their volatility highlights the market’s evolving dynamics. What’s the takeaway? Well, JP Morgan’s research highlights a pivotal shift that crypto is moving beyond a retail-driven experiment into institutional finance, evolving toward the traits of established macro assets while keeping its high-growth potential intact. Conclusion The sudden withdrawal of 73 million XRP from exchanges signals more than a headline, it reflects growing investor conviction. If this accumulation trend continues, reduced token availability could spark a supply-driven surge, fueled by both retail and institutional demand. Meanwhile, Crypto is rapidly evolving into a tradable macro asset class, entering a pivotal phase where institutional participation adds liquidity, structure, and credibility. Yet market inefficiencies persist, creating volatility, and opportunity. With Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP drawing increasing institutional attention, the next few years will shape not only their value but the role of crypto as a cornerstone of global financial markets.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-26 12:14:14

What began as a curiosity among tech enthusiasts has now attracted institutional investors, regulators, and traditional banks alike. As digital assets such as Ethereum and XRP gain traction, the UK finds itself at the intersection of innovation and oversight—balancing growth with responsibility. This evolution is not just about price speculation or market trends; it’s about reshaping how financial systems function, how people interact with money, and how the UK positions itself in the global digital economy. Ethereum’s Role in the UK Crypto Ecosystem Ethereum has become one of the most influential digital assets within the UK’s crypto space, and for good reason. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily viewed as a store of value, Ethereum functions as a decentralized platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This versatility has made Ethereum a cornerstone for developers and businesses experimenting with blockchain technology across industries. From financial services to real estate tokenization and digital identity systems, Ethereum’s underlying technology is helping drive the next generation of decentralised solutions. UK-based startups and fintech firms have been particularly active in leveraging Ethereum’s capabilities. London, long considered Europe’s financial heart, has seen a growing number of blockchain incubators and Web3 firms that use Ethereum’s infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and enterprise solutions. To stay informed about Ethereum’s position in the market, traders and investors can monitor live ETH GBP price movements , gaining real-time insights into how this leading cryptocurrency performs within the UK’s evolving financial environment. XRP and the Growing Appeal of Cross-Border Solutions While Ethereum often dominates discussions around innovation, XRP continues to hold a strong presence in the UK’s financial and fintech sectors. Designed for efficient cross-border payments, XRP offers one of the most practical use cases in the digital asset world—reducing costs and improving transaction speed for international transfers. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has established strategic relationships with financial institutions across Europe, including in the UK. These collaborations aim to modernize global payment systems and replace outdated infrastructure that often results in high fees and long processing times. In a market where London serves as a hub for both traditional banking and financial technology, XRP’s focus on interoperability and efficiency resonates strongly. It aligns with the UK’s vision of becoming a leading center for fintech excellence while exploring the benefits of digital currencies and blockchain-powered solutions. Regulation and Responsibility: Building Trust in the Market For crypto to become fully integrated into the UK’s financial system, regulation remains the key ingredient. The FCA’s registration requirements for crypto firms are a critical part of this process. Only companies that meet stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards are permitted to operate legally in the UK. While this may seem restrictive, it has an important upside—it fosters trust. Investors are more likely to participate in a market that is transparent, secure, and compliant with global standards. The Bank of England has also been exploring the concept of a digital pound, sometimes referred to as “Britcoin.” This central bank digital currency could potentially coexist with private cryptocurrencies, offering both stability and accessibility within a regulated framework. Together, these developments signal a future where digital assets are not only recognized but actively supported by key financial institutions. Institutional Adoption and Mainstream Momentum One of the most striking changes in the UK’s crypto landscape is the growing interest from institutional players. Hedge funds, investment firms, and even pension managers are now exploring digital assets as part of their diversification strategies. Ethereum and Bitcoin remain the most popular holdings, but there’s increasing curiosity about alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP and Solana for their distinct utilities. Moreover, several UK fintech companies now offer crypto trading, custody, and asset management services. Platforms providing access to cryptocurrencies in GBP make it easier for investors to engage with digital assets without dealing with complex conversions or offshore exchanges. This combination of accessibility, regulatory clarity, and technological potential is helping propel crypto further into mainstream financial discussions. Education and Innovation: Empowering the Next Generation Beyond institutional involvement, the UK is investing in crypto literacy and innovation at the grassroots level. Universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, and the London School of Economics have introduced blockchain-related courses, fostering a new generation of developers, economists, and entrepreneurs fluent in digital finance. Hackathons, crypto meetups, and research collaborations are also on the rise. These initiatives aim to bridge the gap between academic theory and practical implementation—ensuring that the UK not only regulates crypto but also leads in creating real-world applications that make digital assets more accessible and valuable. The rise of decentralized finance, NFTs, and tokenized assets represents the next phase of this journey, one that the UK’s vibrant startup ecosystem is well-positioned to capitalize on. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and other digital assets are more than speculative instruments; they are catalysts driving a global shift in how value is created and exchanged. The UK’s willingness to embrace innovation while maintaining regulatory vigilance has positioned it as a model for balanced crypto development. As blockchain adoption expands and digital assets integrate further into mainstream finance, the UK is poised to lead the charge—not by following trends, but by setting standards. Whether through innovation, regulation, or education, the country’s crypto landscape is evolving with a sense of purpose and direction that could shape the future of finance for decades to come.

The filing registers the Franklin Solana Trust under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It also signals that the product is nearing its first trading day on NYSE Arca. Consequently, Solana could soon join Bitcoin and Ethereum in the growing lineup of U.S. spot crypto ETFs. This development arrives as Solana trades near a critical supply zone that continues to shape short-term direction. ETF Structure Nears Completion The Form 8-A submission , dated Nov. 25, follows an amended S-1 filed four days earlier. The two documents detail the structure of the Franklin Solana ETF and outline how the product will operate once listed. The trust holds physical SOL in custody and provides direct spot exposure for institutional and retail investors. Besides that, it tracks the CF Benchmarks Solana Index, which aggregates pricing data from several regulated venues. The ETF offers fractional interests in the trust’s net assets, with daily valuation tied to Solana’s market price minus management fees. Moreover, the filing indicates that the shares will trade on NYSE Arca once the final regulatory steps clear. Market analysts often view an 8-A filing as the last procedural move before launch. Hence, trading could begin within days. Solana Trades Near Heavy Overhead Supply Solana traded at $137.09 as of press time, showing a slight 24-hour gain and mild weekly weakness. The market cap stands above $76 billion with volume near $5 billion. Price action continues to react to a heavy resistance zone visible on-chain. Source: X According to Ali Martinez, roughly 13 million SOL sit around $142, forming a major overhead cluster. The heatmap shows persistent selling pressure each time price returns to that band. Hence, the broader trend remains capped until buyers clear the $138–$142 range. A successful breakout could open room toward $150. However, failure to break that wall keeps risks pointed toward $118 and $110. Market Confidence Builds Above Key Higher-Timeframe Zones Analyst JohnnyB notes that Solana reclaimed the weekly order block near $118–$130, which marked a major reversal area. The recovery created a strong base that encouraged renewed confidence among buyers. Momentum strengthened after price moved above $150 and pushed toward higher range targets. He adds that holding above $210 keeps the broader structure bullish. Moreover, the market watches the $260–$300 zone, which aligns with an earlier cycle’s resistance band. A drop under $150 would weaken the trend and challenge the current “believe in something” conviction that has supported recent moves.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-26 12:19:07

The loan, executed on November 21, forms part of a $500 million credit facility established earlier this year. The Japanese firm now holds 30,823 BTC, valued at approximately $2.7 billion at current market prices. This latest financing brings total borrowings under the facility to $230 million, with $270 million remaining available for future draws. BTC Holdings, Source: Metaplanet Flexible Credit Structure Supports Accumulation Strategy The loan operates on a floating interest rate tied to U.S. dollar benchmarks and renews daily. This structure allows Metaplanet to repay borrowed amounts at any time without fixed maturity constraints. The company's Bitcoin holdings secure all borrowings. The firm acknowledges that significant price declines could trigger margin calls requiring additional collateral. However, management maintains that current reserves provide a substantial cushion against volatility. Internal financial policies limit borrowing to levels that preserve adequate collateral coverage. The company reports a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 496.4%, reflecting both appreciation and accumulation efforts. BTC Yield, Source: Metaplanet Metaplanet has set an ambitious target of reaching 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. This goal requires sustained purchasing activity over the next three years, regardless of market conditions. Metaplanet BTC target, Source: Metaplanet The approach mirrors the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor, of the Strategy formerly known as MicroStrategy. Both companies treat Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset and use debt financing to accelerate acquisitions. This model involves borrowing against existing Bitcoin positions to purchase additional coins during price dips. Proponents argue the strategy maximizes returns during bull market cycles when Bitcoin appreciates faster than debt service costs. Critics point to inherent risks. Prolonged price declines can erode collateral value, forcing asset sales. Recovery periods may extend beyond initial projections, straining balance sheets designed for shorter timeframes. Success depends on several factors: conviction in Bitcoin's long-term value proposition, sufficient capital reserves to weather drawdowns, and disciplined risk management during volatile periods. Market Context and Recent Performance Bitcoin traded at $87,036 at the time of Metaplanet's latest loan draw, down 0.34% on the day. The cryptocurrency has declined more than 24% over the past month, testing investor resolve across the market.

The stock performance suggests investors support the company's Bitcoin-centric business model even as the underlying asset faces pressure. Metaplanet shares rose, Source: Google Finance The November loan follows a $100 million draw on October 31 from the same credit facility. Together, these transactions represent a resumption of aggressive accumulation after a brief pause in activity. The timing of both loans coincides with Bitcoin trading below recent highs, aligning with the company's stated philosophy of purchasing during market weakness. Management views current prices as an opportunity rather than a risk. Metaplanet's actions reflect broader trends in corporate adoption of Bitcoin.

All Eyes on the Crucial $2.60 Level,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-breakout-loading-all-eyes-on-the-crucial-2-60-level/,"XRP is trading near $2.15 today, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $4 billion. The asset is up slightly over the past week, despite a minor dip in the last 24 hours. Analysts are now watching whether it can maintain its recent bounce and move toward the $2.60 level, which sits near the midpoint of its broader trading range. Price Rebounds Off Support With Eyes on $2.60 A chart shared by Ali Martinez shows XRP rebounding from the lower end of a horizontal price channel. This support level, located just under $2.00, has acted as a reliable zone in previous moves. According to Ali, “XRP bounced off the bottom of the channel and could be heading toward the midpoint around $2.60.” The setup indicates that Ripple’s token remains in a broad sideways structure. Past moves have often resulted in rallies from this zone toward the midpoint or upper boundary. If the price approaches $2.60, traders may look for signs of either rejection or continuation. Macro Structure Suggests Ongoing Accumulation A separate chart by ChartNerd presents a wider view of XRP’s market structure on the weekly timeframe. The asset remains within a trading range between $1.80 and $3.50. The recent bounce occurred near the Yearly Support Block, a zone that has held multiple times in recent months. $XRP remains within its Trading Range (TR) after a successful bounce on the Yearly Support Block with another wick to the $1.80 vicinity. Suggesting we are still in a macro re-accumulation phase, which is occurring within the ETF era and institutional adoption/interest bonanza. pic.twitter.com/YSNzfUc06K — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 26, 2025 ChartNerd noted the current action “ suggests re-accumulation ” within this range. “$XRP has a strong chance of being in Wyckoff Accumulation if we can continue to hold the line above the recent $1.80 wick.” A close below $1.90, however, could weaken this view. XRP also remains below key weekly EMAs, which ChartNerd marked as a resistance area that bulls would need to reclaim. Meanwhile, Egrag Crypto posted an analysis focused on the monthly RSI for XRP. He pointed out that the RSI has reached the 80 level only twice—once in 2017 and again in 2025. “ We are not yet in a confirmed macro bear market ,” he said, explaining that the RSI is still holding above 50. According to his breakdown, there is a 60% chance that XRP is still in a late-stage bull market phase unless the RSI closes below 50. This reading keeps the possibility open for another upward leg if buying pressure returns. Whales Selling, Interest Drops Despite recent ETF approvals in the US market, data shows that whales have sold over 180 million XRP tokens in recent sessions, as CryptoPotato reported . These movements have led to increased selling pressure and raised concerns among smaller investors. At the same time, XRP open interest on Binance has fallen to its lowest level in a year. This decline signals reduced participation in the derivatives market and may indicate caution among short-term traders. The post XRP Breakout Loading?

At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $149 billion. TLDR: The crypto market capitalisation rose on Wednesday morning (UTC) by 0.6%; 80 of the top 100 coins and 9 of the top 10 coins have gone up today; BTC increased by 0.2% to $87,788, and ETH rose by 1.1% to $2,938; Expectations of the US Fed December interest rates cut remains; Next few weeks could be a lull; BTC has been struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level “for far longer than most market participants expected”; “We can’t rule out the possibility of something out of the ordinary happening this December”; “As long as BTC commands all the oxygen in the room, ETH’s momentum is tied to whatever narrative BTC decides next”; On Tuesday, both US BTC and ETH spot ETFs saw inflows of $128.64 million and $78.58 million, respectively; Texas, USA, bought $5 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF; Crypto market sentiment remains unchanged within the extreme fear zone. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, 9 of the top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices appreciate over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) has risen by 0.2% since this time yesterday, meaning it’s largely unchanged, currently trading at $87,788. This is the smallest rise today. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is up by 1.1%, now changing hands at $2,938. Solana (SOL) is the category’s best performer, having appreciated 2.1%, now trading at $139. It’s followed by Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 1.4% to the price of $0.1521. XRP recorded the only drop in this category: it’s down 1% to the price of $2.2. Looking at the top 100 coins, we find that 80 recorded increases. Among these, Ethena (ENA) posted the only double-digit rise of 14.7%, now trading at $0.2983. Next up is Bittensor (TAO) , appreciating 9.5% to $320. On the other side, Provenance Blockchain (HASH) and Figure Heloc (FIGR_HELOC) fell the most today. The former is down 5.2% to $0.02418, while the latter dropped 2.8% to $1.01. The markets are still moving up, even if mildly, as investors expect that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. Moreover, fresh US data signaled a cooling economy instead of a potential hard landing. 2/ The sentiment flipped after last week’s delayed September jobs report: soft enough to hint at cooling, not weak enough to panic. Then NY Fed’s John Williams stepped in: “room for a near-term cut.” Translation: “We can cut without losing credibility.” That’s when traders went… — Agar Capital (@AgarCapital) November 25, 2025 Next Few Weeks Could Be a Lull, But… Koinly CEO Robin Singh commented that BTC has been struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level “for far longer than most market participants expected.” “With the market drifting toward its annual ‘Christmas hibernation’, the odds of any explosive price action before the New Year are shrinking fast,” he says. However, all is not lost. “A decisive and unexpected reclaim above $90,000 in December would do wonders for market sentiment. It would soften the bears, and help keep 2026 clear of any early “crypto winter” anxieties before they begin,” Singh argues. We are about to enter December, and it’s possible that the next few weeks will be a lull. “Whatever fireworks traders were hoping for may have to wait until 2026,” the CEO says. Decembers typically don’t see a lot of movement: CoinGlass data shows that Bitcoin’s average December return has been under 5% since 2013. Nonetheless, Singh noted that: “Given that November is typically the strongest month for Bitcoin and it went the opposite way this time around, we can’t rule out the possibility of something out of the ordinary happening this December.” Notably, some have argued that perhaps the classic four-year cycle is about to be rewritten. If that ends up being the case, maybe 2026 “could be gearing up for something far bigger than anyone expected. As always in crypto…time will tell.” Many BTC holders assumed that $100,000 would hold as a solid floor this year, and that it would snap right back after the dip. This time, that bounce just hasn’t come yet, Singh notes. “With the Federal Reserve’s December rate-cut decision approaching and growing focus on the direction of US spot Bitcoin ETF flows, we’ll have a clearer sense of how early 2026 may unfold,” he says. On the Ethereum front, the coin is hovering just below the $3,000 mark, and “that $100 gap between $2,900 and $3,000 might as well be referred to as the ‘ETH psychological jump’.” Per Singh, ETH sentiment can flip extremely fast when a ‘3’ returns at the start of the ETH price. “Will ETH push through $3K soon? Possibly. But the real question is whether it can hold it,” the CEO remarks. He concludes that: “Right now, the spotlight is on Bitcoin, and as long as Bitcoin commands all the oxygen in the room, ETH’s momentum is tied to whatever narrative Bitcoin decides next. If BTC starts gaining strength fast, the rest of the market, ETH included, will probably follow suit not long after.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Wednesday morning, BTC stood at $87,788. The previous 24 hours have noted quite a choppy trading day. The lowest price was $86,215, while the highest point it reached was $88,097. The seven-day range is significantly wider: $82,175–$92,570. BTC is down 3.4% in a week, 24.3% in a month, and 30.3% from the all-time high of $126,080. Investors are now looking to see if the price will break through the $88,000 level and maintain it, which would allow it post new gains towards $90,500 and 93,000. Should the tide turn, the coin may fall below $85,000 and, subsequently, $82,000. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $2,938. Similarly to BTC, ETH saw choppy trading day, but its path from the intraday low of $2,862 to the intraday high of $2,973 was more straightforward. Over the past week, the coin dropped 4.7%, moving between $2,680 and $3,095. It’s also down 30.1% in a month and 40.5% from the ATH of $4,946. A firm hold of the $2,980 level could lead the price towards $3,000, followed by $3,150, and higher. If the market turns red, ETH could pull back to the $2,800 and $2,730 levels. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has remained unchanged over the past day, staying within the extreme fear zone. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 15 today , for the second day in a row. The sentiment generally indicates a notable caution among investors who are waiting to see additional signals that would point to the direction the market will take in the near- and mid-terms. ETFs Turn Green The US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are back in green. On 25 November, these recorded $128.64 million in inflows. This added to the total net inflow, which now stands at $57.61 billion. Two of the 12 BTC ETFs recorded inflows, and three saw outflows. Fidelity was at the top with $170.8 million, followed by Grayscale’s $83.01 million. On the other hand, Ark&21Shares let go of $75.92 million, followed by VanEck and Bitwise with $36.95 million and $12.31 million in outflows. Moreover, the US ETH ETFs recorded a third day of inflows with $78.58 million added on Tuesday. The total net inflow increased to $12.81 billion. Three of the nine funds recorded inflows, and one saw outflows. Of these, Fidelity took in the highest amount of $47.54 million, followed by BlackRock’s $46.09 million in inflows. At the same time, Grayscale recorded $23.33 million in outflows. Meanwhile, Texas, USA, bought $5 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. Notably, it is preparing a second $5 million purchase that will be held in the state’s own custody. The 20 November transaction was disclosed this week by Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, who added that Texas has earmarked $10 million in total and will self-custody it. CORRECTION: Texas purchased $5M on Nov. 20th. $10M is allocated from general revenue but not all $10M has been allocated. @BitcoinMagazine — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? The crypto market has posted an increase over the past 24 hours, and the stock market closed higher on Tuesday for the second day this week. By the closing time on 25 November, the S&P 500 was up by 0.91%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.58%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1.43%. A fresh batch of economic data were released on Tuesday, which was delayed during the US government shutdown. Is this rally sustainable? Today’s increase is notably lower than what we’ve seen over the past couple of days. Beneficial data may keep the market in the green, but the existing data that initially brought some positive support is becoming stale and may not hold influence over the marker for much longer unless reinforcement arrives.

54931385,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=858302,1764163817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54931385.jpeg,"Bitcoin Is Now Tied To A 2-Year Cycle, Warns Investment Firm CIO",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-is-now-tied-to-a-2-year-cycle-warns-investment-firm-cio/,"Bitcoin’s famous four-year halving rhythm is giving way to a shorter, ETF-driven performance clock, argues ProCap Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Jeff Park in a new Substack essay. In his view, the dominant force in Bitcoin’s boom-bust dynamics is shifting “from mining economics to fund-manager economics,” with a new “two-year cycle” anchored in ETF flows and institutional return hurdles. Park starts by declaring that the traditional pattern built around halvings belongs to “the old Bitcoin.” Historically, programmed supply cuts compressed miner margins, pushed weaker operators out and reduced structural sell pressure. Combined with a powerful narrative, each halving triggered a reflexive loop of “early positioning, rising prices, media virality, retail FOMO and leveraged mania” that ended in a bust. That mechanism, he argues, is now significantly diluted. With most of Bitcoin’s eventual supply already circulating, each halving shaves off a smaller fraction of the total float. The “diminishing marginal inflation impact” means the issuance shock is too small to reliably drive the next cycle on its own. The ETF-Driven 2-Year Bitcoin Cycle Begins Instead, Park contends that Bitcoin is increasingly governed by how professional allocators behave inside ETF wrappers. He openly labels his framework as resting on “three heavy-handed, contestable assumptions.” Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why First, most institutional investors are de facto evaluated over one- to two-year horizons because of how liquid fund investment committees operate. Second, new net liquidity into Bitcoin will be dominated by ETF channels, making them the main footprint to watch. Third, the selling behavior of legacy “OG whales” remains the largest supply variable, but is treated as exogenous to his ETF-centric analysis. Within this lens, two concepts matter most: common-holder risk and calendar-year P&L. Park notes that when “everyone owns the same thing,” flows can amplify both rallies and drawdowns. But he focuses on something easier to observe: the way annual performance crystallizes on December 31. For hedge funds in particular, “when volatility increases towards the end of the year” and there isn’t enough P&L “baked in,” managers become more willing to sell their riskiest positions. The choice, he writes, is often “the difference between getting another shot to play in 2026, or getting fired.” Park leans on Ahoniemi and Jylhä’s 2011 paper Flows, Price Pressure, and Hedge Fund Returns, highlighting its finding that a large share of hedge-fund “alpha” is flow-driven and that return–reversal cycles stretch “almost two years.” This, he says, offers a blueprint for how liquidity and performance feedbacks could structure Bitcoin’s ETF era. He then sketches how a CIO might sell Bitcoin internally: as an asset expected to deliver something like a 25–30 percent compound annual return. On that basis, a position must generate roughly 50 percent over two years to justify its risk and fee drag. Park references Michael Saylor’s “30% CAGR for the next 20 years” as a rough institutional hurdle. From there he builds a three-cohort thought experiment. Investors who bought via ETFs from inception through year-end 2024 are up around 100 percent in a single year, effectively having “pulled forward 2.6 years of performance.” A second cohort that entered on 1 January 2025 is roughly 7 percent underwater, now needing “80%+ over the next year, or 50% over the next two years” to hit the same hurdle. A third group, holding from inception through the end of 2025, is up about 85 percent over two years—only slightly ahead of its 30 percent CAGR target. For that group, Park says, the live question becomes: “Do I sell and lock it now, or do I let it run longer?” Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes A Triple Bearish Divergence: CMT Sounds The Alarm ETF flow data sharpen the picture. Park highlights that Bitcoin now trades near “an increasingly important price, $84k,” which he characterizes as roughly the aggregate cost basis of ETF flows to date. While 2024 inflows carry substantial embedded gains, “almost none of the ETF flows in 2025 are in the green,” with March as a partial exception. October 2024, the largest inflow month, saw Bitcoin around $70,000; November 2024 closed near $96,000. On a 30 percent hurdle, Park estimates one-year targets of roughly $91,000 and $125,000 dollars for those vintages. June 2025 inflows near $107,000 imply a $140,000 target by June 2026. He argues that Bitcoin ETF AUM is now at an “inflection point,” where a 10 percent price drop would drag total AUM back to roughly its level at the start of the year. That would leave the ETF complex with little to show, in dollar P&L, for 2025 despite taking on meaningful risk and inflows. The key takeaway, Park writes, is that investors must track not only the average ETF cost basis, but also “the moving average of that P&L by vintage.” Those rolling profit profiles will, in his view, become the main “liquidity pressures and circuit breakers” for Bitcoin, eclipsing the old four-year halving template. His second conclusion cuts against retail intuition: “If Bitcoin price doesn’t move, but time moves forward, this is ultimately bad for Bitcoin in the institutional era.” In a fee-and-benchmark world, flat is not neutral; it is underperformance versus the 30 percent ROI that justified the allocation. That alone can trigger selling. “In summary,” Park concludes, “the 4-year cycle is definitely over.” Bitcoin will still be driven by marginal demand, marginal supply and profit-taking. But “the buyers have changed,” and with halving-driven supply shocks less decisive, it is the more “predictable” incentives of ETF managers—expressed over roughly two-year windows—that may now define Bitcoin’s market cycle. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $87,559.

54932298,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=868516,1764163835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54932298.jpeg,Trump close to deal for Taiwan to invest in U.S. chip plants and train American workers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us%e2%80%91taiwan-trade-deal/,"Donald Trump’s administration is deep in negotiations on a new trade deal that would tie Taiwanese chip power directly to U.S. soil, with billions in investment and tech workers flown in to help build, run, and transfer skills to American workers. The plan is designed to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign semiconductors and instead convert Taiwan’s exports into domestic factories, tech hubs, and trained labor. This development was reported by Reuters, citing five people allegedly familiar with the talks. At the center of the deal is TSMC , the world’s largest contract chipmaker. The company is expected to send both capital and technical workers to support its U.S. expansion and train American teams in semiconductor manufacturing and advanced technologies. The White House is betting this setup will bridge the existing skills gap in U.S. chip fabrication. The deal is also being used as a bargaining chip by Taipei, which is pushing to reduce its current 20% tariff rate on U.S. exports. Right now, chips are excluded from the tariff, since the U.S. can’t yet make enough of them on its own. Taiwan sends capital, engineers to close skill gaps in U.S. While South Korea and Japan have already pledged $350 billion and $550 billion in U.S. investments respectively, Taiwan’s commitment is expected to be smaller. But instead of going big on dollar signs, Taiwan’s government is bringing its entire playbook: technical workers, factory experience, and a fully-developed science park blueprint. Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, told reporters, “Until announced by President Trump, reporting about potential trade deals is speculation.” No one at the U.S. Trade Representative’s office has responded to press inquiries about the deal. Trump himself hasn’t announced the agreement yet, but he’s already said publicly that he believes skilled workers from other countries are needed to teach Americans how to build and operate advanced factories. TSMC CEO C.C.Wei said building its factory in Arizona has taken “at least twice as long” as it would have in Taiwan. He blamed the delays on the lack of skilled workers and gaps in the local supply chain. Because of that, TSMC had to bring half of its construction crew from Texas to Arizona, pushing up relocation and housing costs. Wei’s concerns are one reason Taiwan agreed to include workforce training in the deal. In a separate statement, Taiwan’s Office of Trade Negotiations said its team is still working with U.S. officials on cooperation across the supply chain using what it called the “Taiwan model.” That model includes full-stack chip production infrastructure clustered inside dedicated science parks. The country’s Premier Cho Jung-tai confirmed Wednesday that the governments are already “exchanging documents” to nail down specific terms. Cho said, “It is very difficult for other countries to do this kind of work, because only we have this concept, practice, and track record of service parks, which allows us to undertake this kind of initiative in the United States.” Trump pressures Taiwan as chip tariffs hover at 100% Trump turned up the heat in August, saying he would impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors unless companies agree to build inside the U.S. TSMC, which has already committed $165 billion toward Arizona factories , received a temporary exemption. Reuters reported this month that the U.S. might not follow through on the new tariff immediately, but the threat worked. Taipei came to the table. Leading the charge from Taiwan’s side is Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun, who said she is hopeful that both sides will “reach a consensus” on expanded investment. But even as Taiwan answers Trump’s call for more U.S. manufacturing, it made one thing clear: the most advanced R&D and chip designs will stay in Taiwan. At the APEC summit in South Korea, Lin Hsin-i, Taiwan’s representative, said he discussed semiconductors and supply chains with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Lin said Scott was interested in Taiwan’s experience with building full chip ecosystems. Young Liu, chairman of Foxconn, also Nvidia’s biggest server maker, said the company was open to building science parks with the U.S. and other countries. Liu added he hoped this kind of cooperation would help move the trade negotiations forward. Taiwan tries to grow U.S. chip hubs without giving away top tech TSMC’s push into Arizona is already underway. It’s expanding its footprint as demand spikes for chips used in artificial intelligence systems. At the same time, Taiwanese wafer maker GlobalWafers also announced new investment plans in the U.S. That said, Taiwan isn’t giving up its edge. The country insists that its most advanced nodes and semiconductor breakthroughs will remain on home soil. Still, not everyone’s happy. On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping called Trump and said Taiwan’s “return to China” remains a major concern for Beijing. The White House publicly refused to comment on that part of the call yesterday. But even without formal diplomatic ties, Washington remains Taiwan’s most important international backer. It’s the island’s biggest customer, biggest political partner, and its only real security guarantor. In chip manufacturing, that support is about to get a lot more physical. Factories, parks, training programs; Taiwan’s chip muscle is being flown into the U.S., one engineer and blueprint at a time.

The launch marks the country’s first P2P system operating within a licensed framework and is designed to provide a transparent and secure environment for buying and selling digital assets. P2P trading remains a widely used method for accessing liquidity, and the updated model adapts this approach to Kazakhstan’s regulatory landscape. The system preserves the familiar structure of P2P trading while adding controls intended to enhance reliability and improve clarity in fiat transfers. A Regulated Model Designed for Local Requirements The platform operates in partnership with financial institutions licensed under the AIFC framework. These institutions serve as Makers, while verified users act as Takers. All fiat transactions are processed through corporate bank accounts belonging to licensed institutions rather than personal bank accounts, supporting compliance and reducing the risk of fraud. During the initial rollout phase, users conduct fiat transfers through their verified Halyk Bank cards. Each transaction is subject to identity and data checks, including verification of name, IIN and bank details, with supervision carried out by both Bybit Kazakhstan and the participating institution. Transaction Flow The trading process follows a familiar structure. When users choose to buy cryptocurrency such as USDT, they select an offer and transfer KZT from a Halyk Bank account to the Maker’s corporate account. Once payment is confirmed, the Maker releases the digital assets to the user’s Bybit Kazakhstan wallet. When users sell cryptocurrency, they initiate an order and receive KZT from the Maker to their verified card. After the transfer is confirmed, the corresponding digital assets are released to the Maker. The model mirrors traditional P2P steps with the distinction that counterparties are licensed financial institutions rather than individual traders. Key Features of the System The regulated P2P model introduces several structural elements: Fiat transfers conducted exclusively through corporate accounts of licensed financial institutions Compliance with AML and KYC standards, including verification of identity and bank details Supervision of each transaction by Bybit Kazakhstan and the Maker institution Full traceability and reporting Support provided jointly by Bybit Kazakhstan and the licensed financial institution Participation and Operating Parameters Bybit Kazakhstan functions as a licensed platform regulated by AFSA. Financial institutions serving as Makers hold AFSA licenses and manage fiat settlement. Users act as Takers and must complete KYC verification. The platform applies a maximum transaction amount of 2.5 million KZT and a daily limit of 5 million KZT. Bybit Kazakhstan charges no commission for P2P transactions. Launch Campaign In connection with the platform’s introduction, Bybit Kazakhstan has organized a limited-time campaign running from Nov. 17 to Dec. 13, 2025. During this period, eligible new users may access various rewards tied to their first P2P deposits, including guaranteed crypto incentives and entries into prize draws. The campaign details and terms are available through Bybit Kazakhstan’s official channels. A Milestone for Kazakhstan’s Crypto Market Bybit Kazakhstan’s launch of the first fully regulated P2P platform in the country represents a significant step for the local digital asset sector. The system offers a compliant method for users to buy and sell assets, combining the flexibility of P2P trading with a security framework supported by licensed financial institutions.

The bank said financial stability risks across the euro area are now elevated, with asset prices stretched, sudden selloffs possible, and weak government finances in parts of Europe ready to test investor confidence. The report said market mood can turn fast if growth weakens or if news around AI adoption disappoints. It added that concern over high public debt in several advanced economies could strain global bond markets, push capital across borders at speed, and hit currencies without warning. The ECB said these risks now sit next to record market valuations, rising debt piles, and unresolved trade pressure already flagged by central bankers and regulators across the world. ECB tracks AI stock surge and rising market concentration The ECB said the AI-driven stock rally has pulled sharp attention from officials worried about how fast prices could drop if sentiment turns. It said investors have started to question how large spending on the technology will truly become. That doubt has already weighed on stocks, with the S&P 500 now heading for its first monthly decline since April. The ECB said persistently high valuations and growing market concentration raise the chance of sudden price breaks.Luis de Guindos, the ECB vice president, said the current setup is not the same as the tech crash of the late 1990s. “This is not identical to the dot-com bubble,” Luis said at a press briefing. He said firms today have “very clear business plans” and high revenues. “You can have doubts about the valuations, but to say that there is a bubble, that wouldn’t depict the real perspective that we have on that,” he said. The report also said that liquidity gaps in open-ended funds, heavy leverage in some hedge funds, and limited clarity inside private markets could add force to any future market stress. On government debt, the ECB said any repricing of sovereign risk would now be harder to absorb than in the past due to a slow shift in the investor base toward price‑sensitive buyers. The ECB said recent risk focus has also turned toward France, where fiscal trends are weakening. The euro zone’s second‑largest economy is struggling to control its budget deficit and debt load, the report said. The bank also addressed trade policy. It said that while some agreements are in place, worries around the future and the longer‑term economic and financial impact of tariffs continue to shape financial stability across the euro area. Luis said measures of trade uncertainty have fallen since April. “Measures of trade policy‑uncertainty have eased notably from their April highs,” he said. “But uncertainty continues to linger, with potential for renewed spikes.” Crypto and stock markets rank among top short-term risk threats The ECB made clear that crypto and stock markets now sit near the top of short‑term financial stability risks. Alvaro Santos Pereira, a member of the ECB Governing Council and the governor of the Bank of Portugal, said a sharp drop in financial markets and crypto would rank among the most serious near‑term threats. He said central banks must keep room to act if another shock hits. “Price stability is a priority,” Alvaro said. “Should there be another shock or crisis, central banks must have the buffer to act decidedly to reduce interest rates and help the economy,” he said, adding that “monetary policy is appropriate for the moment.” His comments came after a rough week for markets. The S&P 500 is nearing its steepest fall since April. Treasury yields dropped. Crypto slid with other risk assets. Markets found some balance on Friday after a Federal Reserve official said another rate cut remains possible. Speaking at the CNN Portugal International Summit in Alcobaça, Alvaro said the overvaluation of US equities and crypto now poses a major near‑term threat alongside trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty. “The question is whether there could eventually be a correction in those financial markets,” he said, pointing to charts tracking the rise of US stocks and cryptocurrencies. “We must keep this short‑term risk in mind.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|ECB|EUR|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-26 13:40:25
54931895,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=858507,1764164472,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54931895.jpeg,"Kevin Hasset Takes Pole Position for Future Fed Chair, Best Wallet to Benefit?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/kevin-hasset-takes-pole-position-for-future-fed-chair-best-wallet-to-benefit/,"What to Know: A Hassett-led Fed under a Trump administration could mean earlier rate cuts and a more tolerant crypto stance, boosting risk-asset demand globally. Wallets sit at the front line of any new adoption wave, but many incumbents remain either highly centralized or overly complex for retail users. Best Wallet targets these gaps with MPC-secured, mobile-first UX plus tokenized perks, aiming for 40% global crypto wallet market share by end-2026. If US policy genuinely softens, infrastructure tokens tied to wallets, on-ramps and aggregators may see renewed interest alongside large-cap Layer-1 assets. Kevin Hassett stepping into pole position as President Donald Trump’s preferred candidate for the next Fed Chair is more than a personnel story; it’s a regime shift signal. That’s because Kevin Hassett isn’t a neutral party. He’s strongly pro-crypto, a stakeholder in Coinbase, and has gone on record as wanting to cut rates now. Analysts are excited, and markets are already gaming out a tilt toward earlier rate cuts, looser dollar liquidity, and a friendlier stance toward digital assets and financial innovation. For crypto, that combination typically acts as rocket fuel. Lower real yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ether, while a less hostile regulatory tone lowers headline risk for exchanges, stablecoins and token issuers. If you’re already positioned in crypto, you’re effectively front‑running a potential pivot in US monetary and regulatory policy. But cheaper liquidity alone doesn’t onboard the next 100M users. What actually determines whether new capital sticks is infrastructure: wallets, ramps and applications that feel safe, intuitive and rewarding for everyday users, not just DeFi natives. That’s where the next competitive cycle is likely to play out if a Hassett-led Fed normalizes the macro backdrop. In that context, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is positioned as a bet on the wallet layer rather than just another speculative token. The Best Wallet app aims to pair institutional‑grade security with mobile‑first UX and presale access, pitching itself as a gateway product for the next wave of mainstream adoption if regulatory clouds clear. As the macro narrative evolves, you’re likely to see more attention on which wallet ecosystems can actually capture and retain this inflow. That shift from trading coins to owning rails puts projects like Best Wallet in a very different category than short‑cycle meme coins or one‑off DeFi farms. How A Hassett Fed Could Reshape Crypto Wallet Demand If Hassett does take the chair, markets would likely price in a faster path to policy easing and a softer line on digital assets. That combination historically correlates with higher trading volumes, exchange sign‑ups, and first‑time wallet downloads as retail traders re‑enter the market looking for beta. Most of those newcomers won’t start on hardcore DeFi. They’ll land in retail‑friendly wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet, which act as default gateways. Yet these incumbents either lean heavily centralized, with KYC and recovery tied to a single provider, or remain clunky for mobile‑first users who expect a Web2‑grade experience. This is the opening innovative wallet ecosystems like Best Wallet are chasing. The Best Wallet Token presale enters this crowded field trying to solve for security, UX and upside participation in one stack, rather than forcing you to choose. Why Best Wallet Token Is Leaning into the Next Cycle Where many wallets simply custody assets and route swaps, Best Wallet Token is trying to build an integrated environment for what a more permissive US policy regime might unleash. The project’s core claim is ambitious: capture up to 40% of global crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026 by offering the easiest, safest and most feature‑rich mobile experience. On the security side, Best Wallet plans to be the first fully integrated Fireblocks MPC‑CMP wallet in the retail segment, bringing institutional‑grade multi‑party computation to everyday users. In practice, that means key material is split across multiple parties and devices, removing the single private‑key failure point that has plagued traditional non‑custodial wallets for a decade. Beyond security, the wallet leans into discovery and execution. A built‑in Upcoming Tokens portal is designed to simplify presale participation by curating and vetting early‑stage opportunities, while a Best DEX aggregator – powered by Rubic – routes trades across 200+ DEXs and 20 cross‑chain bridges. That’s aimed squarely at the cross‑chain fragmentation you probably feel every time you move between ecosystems. The $BEST token underpins this ecosystem with real utility: reduced fees inside the Best Wallet stack, boosted yields via a staking aggregator, governance rights, and preferential access to curated presales. The presale has already raised $17.5M, with tokens currently priced at $0.026005 and staking at 75%, suggesting growing demand for exposure to the wallet layer of the stack. To join in, discover how to buy $BEST. On‑chain data shows significant whale transactions (as verified on-chain), including one of $70.2K. This hints at the fact that some smart money is positioning early around the thesis that wallets, not just Layer-1s and Layer-2s, could be prime beneficiaries of a friendlier US policy environment. If you share that view, this cycle may be less about chasing every new token and more about choosing the right rails. That cycle could benefit $BEST incredibly – our $BEST price prediction sees the token potentially reaching $0.05106175 by the end of 2026. Research, then decide whether $BEST fits your risk profile. But hurry – the Best Wallet Token presale closes in less than two days. 🚀 Join the $BEST presale while you still can.

The documentation highlighted by crypto researcher SMQKE shared an example of a completed settlement test that connects SWIFT, R3’s Corda, and XRP in a single operational workflow. It offers readers a clearer view of how banks could use these systems together without altering the foundations of their current messaging processes. Official SWIFT documentation outlines a completed settlement test that integrated XRP within an R3 Corda Settler workflow while operating through the SWIFT GPI environment. XRP SWIFT GPI Documented. https://t.co/QCrfdgR0rD pic.twitter.com/OgJUptJ6Vz — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 24, 2025 Details of the Settlement Framework The material shows a straightforward sequence. Two companies complete a trade, a settlement request is initiated, and Corda Settler manages the process. Within the Corda environment, three settlement paths are outlined: settlement on Corda itself, settlement through SWIFT GPI , or settlement using a cryptocurrency such as XRP. The images attached to the post display this workflow, including Corda Settler’s connection to the SWIFT GPI Link. It reflects an interoperability model that institutions can navigate between traditional rails and digital assets as needed. XRP’s Function in the Tested Model SMQKE noted that the documentation confirms a completed settlement test where XRP was integrated into this workflow. In the model presented, XRP serves strictly as the final settlement option. It does not replace SWIFT GPI. It operates within a structure where messaging remains on SWIFT, the business process runs through Corda, and the settlement can be finalized using XRP. This aligns with earlier explanations from industry participants that emphasized the separation of messaging, workflow, and settlement layers. XRP Community Insight An investor responding to the post summarized the structure by pointing out that financial institutions have long requested a model where each layer performs its own function. Their comment emphasized that SWIFT GPI remains responsible for messaging, Corda provides the workflow, and XRP handles the settlement that traditional systems are not designed to perform directly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 They stated that the significance of this documentation lies in the fact that it appears within SWIFT’s own materials, confirming the interoperability approach rather than suggesting replacement of any established system. The documentation amplified by SMQKE outlines a tested settlement configuration that incorporates XRP alongside SWIFT GPI and Corda . It provides a concrete example of how a digital asset can function within a familiar banking framework without disrupting the components that institutions already rely on. For observers following developments in institutional use of digital assets, this material offers a clear reference point for how these technologies can be combined to support settlement efficiency .

54932808,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=868513,1764164752,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54932808.jpeg,OpenAI targets 220 million paid ChatGPT users by 2030,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openai-aims-for-220m-chatgpt/,"OpenAI expects to have 220 million paying ChatGPT users by 2030, a significant increase from its current paid base of approximately 35 million, according to reports from The Information. The projection is based on an estimated 2.6 billion weekly active users, meaning roughly 8.5% would convert to paid subscriptions over the next five years. OpenAI’s revenue from subscriptions, along with new features like shopping assistance and ad-supported offerings, could reach $ 20 billion annually by 2025, according to industry sources . Meanwhile, it is worth noting that around 35 million users, who account for about 5% of ChatGPT’s active weekly users , have decided to subscribe to the “Plus” or “Pro” plans as of July this year. The subscription costs for these plans are $20 and $200 per month, respectively. However, reports from reliable sources indicate that, although the tech giant’s anticipated annual revenue run rate is expected to reach around $20 billion by the end of this year, the company faces a significant challenge: it is encountering increasing losses in its operations. OpenAI believes ChatGPT subscription members will surge significantly by 2030 The Information released a report highlighting that OpenAI generated approximately $4.3 billion in revenue during the first half of 2025. This figure reflected a 16% increase from its total revenue recorded last year. Nonetheless, despite this increase in revenue, the independent, subscription-based digital media company also disclosed that OpenAI incurred $2.5 billion in losses, primarily due to high research and development costs related to AI and the operation of ChatGPT. Even with this challenge, the tech company still holds onto the belief that about 20% of its revenue will stem from new products, such as features related to shopping and advertising. Interestingly, the tech giant announced the introduction of a personal shopping assistant for ChatGPT this week. According to OpenAI, this shopping assistant could generate revenue through ads or sales commissions. Meanwhile, Fidji Simo, the CEO of Applications at OpenAI, had earlier outlined her intentions to expand ChatGPT’s user base to billions. She made this statement while speaking remotely at the VivaTech summit in Paris. Simo argued that although ChatGPT serves hundreds of millions, AI should be advantageous to everyone, encouraging the company to aim for billions. On the other hand, OpenAI has observed that businesses in Europe are increasingly seeking its AI services, despite growing concerns about using American tech providers on the continent. Following this finding, the San Francisco-based company announced this week that business subscriptions for ChatGPT have increased substantially, six times compared to last year, in certain areas such as Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Notably, according to Nicolai Skabo, OpenAI’s enterprise lead for these regions, much of this growth is coming from Europe. This situation demonstrates that AI is becoming increasingly adopted globally, sparking stiff competition in the tech industry. To cope with this competition, major tech companies worldwide have reportedly turned to debt markets to secure funds worth approximately $100 billion through recent bond sales, all in an effort to enhance their AI infrastructure. This move marks a significant shift in how Silicon Valley firms conduct their operations, as they have typically relied on cash for their investments. Tech firms face increased pressure to make significant investments in AI Tech giants such as Amazon , Microsoft, Google, Oracle , and Meta have made public their intentions to increase their investment by nearly double from last year, spending approximately $400 billion on data centers. At this time, Deutsche Bank publicly displayed its prediction that global investments in AI could reach $4 trillion by 2030. This prediction suggests that investors are eager to capitalize on a technology that has gained significant industry recognition just three years after the launch of ChatGPT. To illustrate its commitment to exploring the technology, Amazon released a statement on November 17, stating that it seeks to raise a total of $15 billion through its first US dollar bond sale in three years. In the wake of this announcement, sources noted that the six-part offering drew in $80 billion in interest. Alphabet, on the other hand, filed to acquire approximately $17.5 billion in debt in the US, in addition to €6.5 billion (approximately $7.49 billion) in Europe, for general corporate purposes, including paying off existing debts, on November 3. While Meta Platforms requested permission for its largest bond offering of up to $30 billion to fund an expensive expansion of its AI infrastructure on October 30, sources discovered that the parent company of Facebook was facing intense financial pressures due to these AI investments.

WLFI currently trades around $0.160, reflecting a modest 0.3% gain over the past 24 hours and building on a 13.84% increase over the last week. $10M buyback drives short-term momentum The recent surge in WLFI price comes amid a significant on-chain buyback program, with World Liberty Financial executing nearly $10 million in purchases over a six-hour window. The buyback included a concentrated $7.79 million transaction, acquiring over 46 million WLFI tokens at an average price of $0.167. Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow WLFI( @worldlibertyfi ) is buying back $WLFI on-chain.Over the past 5 hours, they have spent 7.79M $USD1 to buy 46.56M $WLFI at $0.1674 avg. intel.arkm.com/explorer/entit… 8:32 am · 26 Nov 2025 449 Reply Copy link Read 46 replies This strategic accumulation has tightened the circulating supply and fueled bullish sentiment, as the token climbed more than 10% during the buyback period. The buyback is viewed by many as a strong sign of project confidence, particularly given the Trump-backed status of the platform, which emphasises regulatory compliance and US-focused crypto infrastructure. Whale accumulation supports mid-range stability In addition to the buyback, significant whale activity has bolstered the market. On-chain data indicates that a single wallet acquired 165.79 million WLFI, valued at $25 million USD1, over three days. Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow Someone created a new wallet “0xEFA1” and spent 25M $USD1 to buy 165.79M $WLFI at $0.1508 over the past 3 days. intel.arkm.com/explorer/addre… 6:53 pm · 24 Nov 2025 364 Reply Copy link Read 50 replies This large accumulation maintained WLFI above critical mid-range support at $0.145–$0.150, stabilising price action during minor pullbacks. Such structured buying patterns suggest long-term positioning rather than short-term speculative trading. With momentum indicators turning green and EMAs flipping upward, traders are eyeing a potential breakout toward the $0.17–$0.20 range, provided the accumulation and buyback programs continue to inject liquidity into the market. Symmetrical triangle breakout signals technical strength WLFI’s recent price action also reflects a classic technical pattern. Over October and early November, the token formed a symmetrical triangle, characterised by converging highs and lows. This pattern created a period of compressed volatility, culminating in a breakout just above $0.16. World Liberty Financial price analysis | Source: TradingView Trading volume surged alongside the breakout, while momentum indicators such as the MACD and RSI confirmed bullish pressure. WLFI futures open interest has also climbed in tandem, suggesting renewed engagement from derivative traders and signalling potential for trend continuation. The breakout from the triangle highlights both strong buying interest and an improving technical structure, reinforcing confidence in the emerging uptrend. World Liberty Financial price outlook Overall, World Liberty Financial price dynamics indicate a cautiously optimistic trajectory. The combination of whale accumulation, a $10M buyback, and a breakout from a symmetrical triangle has created a foundation for sustained gains in WLFI. However, for the bullish momentum to be sustained, the World Liberty Financial price must stay above the $0.16 breakout zone, which acts as a key support zone. A drop below $0.16 could push WLFI to $0.156, which, if breached, could trigger a short-term retracement toward lower accumulation zones. But should the token continue to hold above $0.16, traders should have their eyes on the resistances at $0.1635, $0.1744, and $0.1823, levels that align with Fibonacci extensions and recent swing highs.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $13,085 and $15,732 with an average expected price of $13,552. In 2031, ETH could trade between $40,970 and $47,246 with an average price of $42,373. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up?

According to the 1-day chart on November 26, ETH’s price remains below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, which shows that sellers are still in control. The recent bounce from about $2,600 shows that buyers are protecting a key support area, but the momentum is weak and the candles don’t show strong follow-through. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The RSI is close to being oversold, which means that the downside may be slowing down but is not completely over. A short-term recovery is more likely if ETH can get back to the $3,130 area. If it doesn’t stay above $2,600, though, it could go down to $2,500 next. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum attempts a short-term rebound between $2,780 and $2,990 The 4-hour chart for Ethereum shows a small attempt to recover after a long downtrend, but the momentum is still weak. ETH is trading just below $2,950, between the mid-Bollinger Band and the lower band. This shows that volatility is low but stable. The MACD has turned bullish, which means that short-term momentum is getting better. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The Balance of Power, on the other hand, is still negative, which means that sellers are still in charge. For the price to keep going up, ETH needs to get back above $3,050 and then $3,150. Failure to break these levels could trigger another pullback toward $2,885 or even $2,780. Overall, ETH is starting to show signs of relief, but the trend is still weak without more volume ETH technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 3,420.45 SELL SMA 5 3,184.43 SELL SMA 10 3,147.65 SELL SMA 21 3,242.03 SELL SMA 50 3,591.09 SELL SMA 100 3,983.54 SELL SMA 200 3,393.13 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 3,305.52 SELL EMA 5 3,534.16 SELL EMA 10 3,847.21 SELL EMA 21 4,074.24 SELL EMA 50 3,966.35 SELL EMA 100 3,570.98 SELL EMA 200 3,179.68 SELL What to expect from ETH price analysis next? Ethereum is trying to stabilize after a long period of falling prices, but the charts show mixed signals. ETH is trading below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages on both the 1-day and 4-hour timeframes, which keeps the bearish trend going. But the recent bounce from the $2,700–$2,750 support range shows that sellers are losing momentum. RSI is rising out of oversold territory, which could mean a short-term recovery. If ETH stays above $2,750, it could move up to $2,950–$3,050. But if support isn’t kept up, the price could drop back down to $2,600. Overall, ETH is in a careful, early-reversal stage. Why is Ethereum down today? Ethereum is down today because charts and market data show that momentum has clearly broken down over a number of timeframes. ETH lost the important $2,974 Fibonacci support level on the 1-day chart. This caused automated sell-offs and sped up the drop. The 4-hour chart shows that the highs keep getting lower and the buying pressure keeps getting weaker, which confirms that the market is bearish in the short term. On top of that, ETH ETFs saw $196.6 million in outflows on November 25, which put more pressure on the price to go down. Price is also being held back by uncertainty in the broader economy as traders wait for signals from the Fed about interest rates. ETH’s strong 0.82 correlation with the Nasdaq is making people feel more risk-averse. Overall, technical weakness and market outflows are driving today’s drop. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum blockchain is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $4,619 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $32,938 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with a potential high of $11,710. Will ETH reach $25,000? Based on price predictions, Ethereum is unlikely to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029. By 2029, the ETH’s potential high is expected to be $22,667. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, the Ethereum platform will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $47,246 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $47,246 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum Ethereum Foundation confirms December 3 launch date for Fusaka Mainnet Upgrade According to an article by Cryptopolitan, the Ethereum Foundation confirmed that the Fusaka mainnet upgrade will launch on December 3 , following successful testnet deployments on Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi.

This figure significantly outperforms economist forecasts of 226,000, signaling stronger labor market conditions than anticipated. For cryptocurrency investors, these US initial jobless claims numbers carry crucial implications about economic health and potential Federal Reserve policy shifts. Why Do US Initial Jobless Claims Matter to Crypto Investors? Understanding the connection between employment data and cryptocurrency markets is essential for informed investing. When US initial jobless claims fall below expectations, it typically indicates economic strength. However, this creates a complex dynamic for digital assets. Strong employment data might suggest reduced need for economic stimulus, potentially leading to tighter monetary policies that could affect cryptocurrency valuations. Breaking Down the Latest US Initial Jobless Claims Data The recent US initial jobless claims report reveals several key insights about the economy’s direction. The 216,000 figure represents a substantial improvement over forecasts and previous readings. This development suggests: Labor market resilience despite economic uncertainties Potential consumer spending strength supporting economic activity Possible implications for Federal Reserve interest rate decisions How Could Falling US Initial Jobless Claims Impact Crypto Markets? The relationship between employment data and cryptocurrency performance isn’t always straightforward. Lower US initial jobless claims typically signal economic strength, which could reduce the appeal of cryptocurrencies as alternative investments. However, strong economic data might also indicate sustained consumer purchasing power, potentially supporting adoption of digital assets for transactions and investments. What Should Crypto Investors Watch Next? Following this US initial jobless claims report, cryptocurrency market participants should monitor several key indicators. The Federal Reserve’s reaction to employment data will be crucial, as policy decisions directly influence market liquidity and risk appetite. Additionally, watch for: Upcoming inflation data releases Federal Reserve meeting minutes Broader market risk sentiment indicators Actionable Insights from the Latest US Initial Jobless Claims The unexpected drop in US initial jobless claims provides valuable information for cryptocurrency strategy development. Consider diversifying your portfolio to account for potential shifts in monetary policy. Monitor traditional financial markets for correlation patterns with cryptocurrency movements. Most importantly, maintain a long-term perspective while adjusting short-term tactics based on economic indicators like US initial jobless claims. The latest US initial jobless claims data paints a picture of economic resilience that cryptocurrency investors cannot ignore. While strong employment numbers might suggest reduced need for accommodative monetary policies, they also indicate underlying economic strength that could support digital asset adoption. The key takeaway remains clear: monitoring fundamental economic indicators like US initial jobless claims provides crucial context for cryptocurrency market analysis and investment decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions What are US initial jobless claims? US initial jobless claims represent the number of individuals filing for unemployment benefits for the first time during a specific week, serving as a key indicator of labor market health. Why do cryptocurrency investors care about employment data? Employment data influences Federal Reserve policy decisions, which affect market liquidity, interest rates, and risk appetite – all crucial factors for cryptocurrency valuations. How often is US initial jobless claims data released? The data is published weekly by the Department of Labor, typically on Thursday mornings, providing frequent updates on labor market conditions. Does strong employment data help or hurt cryptocurrency prices? It depends on market context. Strong data might reduce expectations for economic stimulus (potentially negative) but also indicates economic strength (potentially positive for adoption). What other economic indicators should crypto investors monitor? Important indicators include inflation data (CPI), GDP growth, Federal Reserve meeting outcomes, and consumer sentiment surveys. How reliable is US initial jobless claims data for predicting crypto trends? While useful for understanding economic context, employment data should be considered alongside other indicators rather than used alone for crypto market predictions.

The leading altcoin appears to be in a highly “sensitive phase,” driven largely by aggressive buying from major investor groups. In fact, a new analysis found that wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have reached a combined balance exceeding 21 million ETH. This is an all-time high for this category and a level not witnessed since the network’s inception. Ethereum Supply Plunging on Exchanges The latest accumulation has unfolded steadily in recent months and overlaps with the asset’s gradual move toward the $2,956 level. The trend does not stop there. Holders with more than 100,000 ETH have also expanded their positions, bringing their total balance to roughly 4.3 million ETH. According to CryptoQuant, the increase reflects rising conviction among institutional-scale investors and other high-liquidity participants. At the same time, data from Binance shows a continued drawdown of its exchange-held ETH, as reserves have been found to be falling from September onward to approximately 3.764 million ETH in November. The decline indicates a broad migration of ETH into staking contracts or offline storage, which reinforces the accumulation wave identified across whale groups. The analysis emphasizes that Ethereum’s current market behavior remains closely linked to these shifts among large holders. Previous cycles have shown that periods of heavy whale accumulation typically coincide with the creation of solid price bases, which have historically come ahead of major upward movements. With exchange supply tightening and deep-pocketed investors increasing their holdings, the data points to an important structural phase in Ethereum’s long-term outlook. OG Whale Bets Big on Ethereum Adding to the heightened whale activity, Arkham has also spotlighted a Hyperliquid “OG Whale,” who previously made close to $200 million by shorting the market ahead of the October 10 crash. The intelligence firm reported that this trader has now turned strongly bullish on ETH and has injected an additional $10 million into an existing long position, which brings their total ETH longs to $44.5 million. Within the first hour of the move, the position was already showing gains of more than $300,000. The OG Whale has become a notable figure over the past month for a streak of precisely timed shorts, and this pivot toward large-scale ETH longs indicates they may now be positioning for an upward price move.

The persistent accumulation comes as the asset’s price trades near a decisive technical level, where analysts say a breakout could trigger a sharp recovery. Institutions added another $53.1 million on Nov. 25, lifting total inflows to $621 million since launch. This steady demand arrives even as SOL trades lower this week, creating a scenario where strong capital inflows collide with short-term price weakness. Consequently, traders are now watching whether inflows can overpower current resistance and ignite a trend reversal. Institutional Purchases Strengthen Despite Price Pullback Institutional accumulation continued through Monday, with Bitwise contributing $31 million. Fidelity followed with $4.8 million, while VanEck added $1.3 million. Grayscale closed the day with $16 million in new inflows. Moreover, the running total has reached $621 million, underscoring rising demand from large investors. This trend is notable because SOL declined 0.28% in the last 24 hours and 2.66% over the week, trading at $136.05 as of press time. Hence, inflows appear disconnected from short-term market weakness, which often signals deeper confidence in long-term performance. SOL Structure Points Toward a 25% Rally Analyst Captain Faibik noted that Solana is pushing against a major multi-week descending trendline. Price now trades near $138 to $140, which forms a crucial breakout zone. He added that a move above this level could open a path toward $170 to $175. Additionally, higher lows continue forming under resistance, suggesting bullish momentum is building. Support sits at $132, with a stronger cushion near $125 if the breakout attempt fails. Market participants are watching this compression structure because it often resolves with a decisive upside move when higher lows persist. Hence, a breakout could validate the projected 25% recovery target. Bears Face a Critical Line at $142 Another analyst, Gordon, pointed to the $142 to $144 area as the key level to flip. Price has failed to clear this zone several times this month. Moreover, the structure mirrors Faibik’s view, with higher lows squeezing price toward the trendline. He stated that clearing this region would shift momentum toward $150 to $152. Source: X Besides, the supports at $136 and $132 remain important during consolidation. According to his view, the setup favors bulls because compression near resistance often precedes strong breakouts. Consequently, a move above $142 could accelerate momentum and pressure short sellers.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-26 13:55:22
54932631,634852,1764165508,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54932631.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy: Arthur Hayes Expects Bitcoin Recovery, Alternatives Pop",https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-hayes-expects-bitcoin-bull-2026/,"Quick Facts: Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin can’t go under $80K in 2025’s Q4, but that it won’t go much higher either; he expects the bull in 2026. He suggests the real opportunity now lies in Bitcoin Layer 2s, DeFi rails, and on‑chain leverage exchanges rather than spot $BTC itself. Strong presale traction for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) suggests growing appetite for infrastructure projects as traders rotate beyond spot $BTC exposure. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid dominates decentralized perps volume with sub‑second on‑chain execution and HIP‑3 fee cuts, positioning it well if derivatives trading surges. Arthur Hayes thinks Bitcoin has likely carved out strong support around the $80k region, hinting that the next leg of the bull market may be forming. In Hayes’ view, the lowest we’ll see $BTC this year is ‘low $80K’s’. But, while Bitcoin may not fall any further, it will likely not go any higher either, at least until 2026. If he’s right, this is the stage where liquidity returns, volatility compresses, and patient capital starts positioning for the next outsized moves. When $BTC stabilizes after a major run, the easy trade is gone. At that point, you’re usually not early buying Bitcoin itself – you’re early rotating into the infrastructure and high‑beta plays that benefit most if the cycle resumes. That means Bitcoin Layer 2s, core DeFi rails, and exchanges built for on‑chain leverage. This backdrop is pushing more traders to look beyond spot $BTC toward projects that can scale usage, unlock new yield, or supercharge liquidity. In particular, fast execution environments plugged into Bitcoin, smarter wallet layers, and deep derivatives venues are emerging as prime hunting grounds for upside. Below are three names to watch right now: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a high‑throughput Bitcoin Layer 2, Best Wallet Token ($BEST), a next‑gen access layer, and Hyperliquid ($HYPE), the dominant on‑chain perps engine riding this volatility wave. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – First Bitcoin L2 with SVM Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) pitches itself as the first Bitcoin Layer 2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine . It aims to deliver execution that’s even faster than Solana while still settling back to Bitcoin. The architecture is modular: Bitcoin L1 handles settlement and security, while a real‑time SVM Layer 2 handles execution. In practice, that means sub‑second confirmation for wrapped $BTC payments, DeFi trades, and NFT mints at a fraction of typical Bitcoin fees. For users, the immediate draw is simple: high‑speed payments in wrapped $BTC with low fees. It also means DeFi primitives like swaps, lending, and staking protocols that finally feel responsive in the Bitcoin universe. Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper uses a single trusted sequencer that periodically anchors state to Bitcoin, plus a decentralized canonical bridge for $BTC transfers. The $HYPER presale has already raised over $28.5M, with $HYPER valued at $0.013335, and staking rewards set at 41%. If you’re betting on Bitcoin regaining momentum, this is one of the more aggressive ways to get leveraged exposure to Bitcoin‑secured throughput. Based on Bitcoin Hyper’s utility proposition and the presale’s performance, a realistic price prediction for $HYPER puts the coin at $0.20 in 2026. 2030 could see $HYPER at $1.50 once the ecosystem takes off and sees mainstream adoption. For profit hunters, these numbers translate to an ROI of 1,399% and 11,145% respectively, if you buy at today’s price. These numbers recommend $HYPER as one of the best crypto to buy today. The $HYPER presale window will close between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. If you want in, read our guide on how to buy $HYPER . Buy $HYPER on the presale page today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Aggressive Play on Wallet Market Share If Bitcoin resumes its uptrend and new users flood back in, the battle for wallet dominance becomes critical. Best Wallet is targeting an ambitious 40% share of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026 by focusing on simplicity, security, and integrated on‑chain tooling. The core stack centers on a fully integrated Fireblocks MPC‑CMP wallet, giving users institutional‑grade key management with retail‑friendly UX. On top of that, Best Wallet lets you build custom multi‑wallet portfolios, so you can segment trading capital, long‑term holdings, and experimental positions while managing everything through a single interface. The roadmap features a lineup of developmental milestones, from the Fiat Onramp to the Best Card and the Rubic-powered DEX aggregator, tapping 330 DEXs and 30 bridges. The Best Wallet Token presale has raised over $17.5M so far, with $BEST priced at $0.026005. The project offers a dynamic staking model currently at a 75% APY. Long-term, Best Wallet shows great potential. Our price prediction for $BEST puts the token at a potential high of $0.62 in 2026 and $0.82 by 2030, considering the project’s utility and scope. These numbers suggest an ROI of 2,284% and 3,053% respectively, potentially higher if the wallet sees mainstream adoption. The presale is set to end in just two days, so there’s not much time left. Read our guide on how to buy $BEST if you want in today. Buy $BEST before the presale ends. 3. Hyperliquid (HYPE) – Dominant On‑Chain Perps Engine While Bitcoin chops around key levels, derivatives volumes often tell you where traders are actually positioning. Hyperliquid (HYPE) has quietly become the dominant decentralized perpetuals exchange, built on its own high‑performance Layer‑1 blockchain optimized for low‑latency, high‑throughput trading. Hyperliquid uses an on‑chain order book with around 0.2‑second median trade latency, powered by its HyperCore + HyperEVM architecture. This allows it to feel more like a centralized exchange, while maintaining full on-chain settlement, a combination that has historically been difficult for DeFi to achieve at scale. According to a RedStone report, Hyperliquid processes up to $30B in daily volume and commands over 80% of the DeFi perps market share, underscoring just how far ahead it is of rival protocols. The chain has begun evolving into a broader DeFi ecosystem, with new projects building on its liquidity and order‑book rails. The recent HIP‑3 ‘growth mode’ upgrade introduced permissionless market creation with taker fees slashed by more than 90%, encouraging new markets and deeper liquidity in long‑tail assets. For traders who see a renewed Bitcoin uptrend as fuel for derivatives activity, Hyperliquid is one of the clearest ways to get exposure to the on‑chain leverage layer. $HYPE is selling at $33.28 and it’s on a 1.48% growth arc at the time of writing. Recap : If Arthur Hayes is right about Bitcoin stabilizing near $80K, infrastructure plays like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , access layers like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and liquidity engines like Hyperliquid ($HYPE) could see outsized benefits as capital rotates beyond $BTC.

54932665,https://finbold.com/?p=258223,1764165562,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,When will all the XRP Ripple holds be released?,https://finbold.com/when-will-all-the-xrp-ripple-holds-be-released/,"Since 2017, Ripple has managed its substantial XRP holdings through a carefully structured escrow system designed to regulate supply and maintain market stability. At the inception of this plan, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP, over half of the total 100 billion tokens, into time-locked escrows. The goal was to ensure transparency, prevent sudden market flooding, and build investor confidence by providing a predictable release schedule. The escrow was initially scheduled to release 1 billion XRP per month over 55 months, but Ripple often re‑locks a portion of each monthly unlock, effectively extending the overall release timeline. Data from 2025 shows that for many months, only around 300 million XRP from the 1 billion unlocked are used or distributed, while the remaining 700 million are re‑locked. This pattern has been consistent in recent years, with monthly variations reflecting operational needs, ecosystem funding, and strategic decisions regarding liquidity. Timeline for releasing all Ripple-held XRP As of late 2025, approximately 35 billion XRP remain in escrow. If Ripple maintains the current pace of releasing roughly 300 million XRP per month, the remaining escrowed XRP could be fully unlocked around 2035. XRP rich list. Source: XRP Scan However, even then, full escrow depletion does not necessarily mean all tokens will immediately enter the market. Many of the released XRP may remain in Ripple-controlled wallets, be used for partnerships or operational purposes, or be subject to new escrow agreements. At the same time, it’s worth noting that the escrow system and staggered release schedule have significant implications for XRP’s price. By controlling supply inflows, Ripple reduces the risk of sudden price drops due to oversupply, fostering a more stable trading environment. Conversely, larger or unexpected releases could temporarily increase market supply and affect short-term price dynamics. Investors and market watchers closely monitor these unlock patterns, as they provide critical insight into potential XRP liquidity and market behavior. Notably, over the recent months, the scheduled monthly unlocks have had little impact on XRP’s price, which continues to trade in line with broader market sentiment and fundamentals such as exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). XRP price analysis At the moment, the token is attempting a recovery after dipping below the $2 level, in line with the broader sector. By press time, XRP was trading at $2.16, having dropped over 3% in the last 24 hours. XRP seven-day price chart.

Strategy Bitcoin Holdings Still In Profit According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET and company disclosures, Strategy bought its Bitcoin at an average cost of $74,430 per coin. With Bitcoin trading around $86,000, that basket is still up roughly 16% on paper. The firm stepped up its buys on Nov. 17, adding 8,178 BTC for $836 million. Michael Saylor, Strategy chairman, said “I won’t back down.” That move pushed its total to 649,870 BTC, a stash currently worth nearly $56 billion. Short-term swings have hit the stock hard, but the crypto holding itself is not the same as the equity price. I Won’t ₿ack Down — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 23, 2025 In markets, appearance matters. Shares that once traded near $300 in October slid to about $170 at the time of recent reporting. Over the last year the stock is down close to 60% , and it has fallen by more than 40% year-to-date. Those drops have worried some, yet the balance sheet tied to Bitcoin tells a different numeric story. Investors Use Strategy As A Hedge Based on reports and market commentary, the stock’s weakness is partly technical. In a recent interview, BitMine chairman Tom Lee pointed out that Strategy’s options market is very liquid, making the stock an easy tool for large players to hedge Bitcoin exposure. Traders can buy puts or short the equity instead of wrestling with less liquid crypto derivatives. That choice can press the share price independently of whether the company’s Bitcoin position is healthy. Analysts warned that a deep drop in BTC could force the firm to sell coins and that such a move would put extra pressure on both the stock and Bitcoin itself. He said the risk is there, even if it looks distant today. In plain terms: one day of panic could create a chain reaction. For now, it remains hypothetical rather than immediate. Stock Returns Outpace Tech Peers Five-year returns show a stark contrast. Strategy’s shares have climbed more than 500% over that window, compared with Apple’s 130% and Microsoft’s 120%. Over two years the firm’s stock rose about 226%, while Apple gained 43% and Microsoft gained 25% in the same period. These numbers underline why long-term investors have supported the firm’s strategy despite recent turbulence.

54932798,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=32593,1764165606,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,US Bancorp Pushes Into Digital Assets and Tokenization With New Specialized Division,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/us-bancorp-pushes-into-digital-assets-and-tokenization-with-new-specialized-division/,"One of the largest financial institutions in the United States has moved to accelerate its entry into the digital asset economy, unveiling a dedicated unit designed to support the future of banking, payments, and tokenized finance. US Bancorp, the parent company of US Bank, confirmed the launch of the Digital Assets and Money Movement organization, positioning the new group at the center of the bank’s strategy for stablecoins, tokenization, and emerging digital currency infrastructure. The division will oversee development across several fast-expanding categories, including tokenized deposits, digital currency custody, and new blockchain-based payment solutions. Dominic Venturo, US Bank’s chief digital officer, said the shift reflects growing demand from clients who increasingly want to understand “how digital assets can help them safely move money, store deposits and use tokenized assets, among other potential use cases.” US Bank is currently the fifth-largest American lender and is recognized as a systemically important financial institution, giving it significant influence as large banks adapt to blockchain-enabled finance. The bank has gradually expanded its digital asset capabilities over recent years. It previously launched a custody offering for institutional investors, responding to interest from asset managers seeking secure storage for digital currencies. It also invested in Securrency, a tokenization technology firm backed by State Street and WisdomTree, highlighting its ambitions to play a role in next-generation asset infrastructure. Aside from banks, many other private sector companies, such as casinos, have embraced blockchain technology. However, some casinos, such as 666 Casino , are sticking with a more traditional approach to online gambling. US Bank now joins other major financial institutions such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, and BNY Mellon, all of which have increased investment in blockchain-based services as corporate and investor interest continues to grow. However, while institutions ramp up digital asset initiatives, industry organizations and crypto-focused legislators have raised concerns that large banks may be limiting customers’ ability to interact with digital asset platforms. Several groups, including the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council for Innovation, recently submitted a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau urging the agency to preserve open banking rules and prevent banks from restricting access to crypto platforms. They argued that open banking “is the foundation of innovation, competition, and choice in today’s digital financial system,” adding that recent actions by major institutions risk reversing years of progress. Open banking, covered under CFPB Rule 1033, allows consumers to share financial data with third-party services, enabling connections between bank accounts, digital wallets, and stablecoin payment rails. The groups warned that limiting these connections would diminish competition and hinder the development of digital asset payment ecosystems. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis also pressed the CFPB to finalize the rule, saying open banking is essential to integrating digital assets into everyday financial activity. “Open banking is also critical to integrating digital assets into our economy by promoting competition and allowing consumers to provide their data to digital asset exchanges and stablecoin issuers to facilitate faster and cheaper payments,” she wrote.",Crypto News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-26 14:00:06

According to K33 Research, Bitcoin’s current 36% drop from all-time highs represents a psychological oversold condition that creates a potential Bitcoin buying opportunity for long-term investors. Let’s explore why this moment might be your chance to enter the market strategically. What Makes This a Bitcoin Buying Opportunity? K33 Research’s analysis reveals that Bitcoin has underperformed the Nasdaq for approximately 70% of the past month while its correlation with U.S. equities has surged. This unusual movement reflects persistent selling pressure in a risk-off environment. The pattern shows BTC falling more sharply than U.S. stocks and rebounding more weakly, creating what experts call a psychological oversold condition. Several key indicators support this Bitcoin buying opportunity assessment: Spot trading volume spiked during recent sharp drops Net outflow of 62,000 BTC from spot ETFs occurred Temporary panic signs are evident in market behavior Fundamental policy changes differentiate this cycle from previous ones Why Should Long-Term Investors Consider This Bitcoin Buying Opportunity? The cryptocurrency market today is fundamentally different from previous cycles due to significant policy changes. This evolution makes the current environment particularly favorable for beginning long-term investment strategies. However, K33 Research cautions against deploying all capital at once. The firm highlights two important considerations for investors evaluating this Bitcoin buying opportunity: Large open interest in the perpetual futures market creates additional volatility Bitcoin’s tendency to follow a W-shaped recovery pattern suggests gradual entry strategies work best How Can You Maximize This Bitcoin Buying Opportunity? Timing the market perfectly is nearly impossible, but recognizing psychological oversold conditions can help investors make informed decisions. The current Bitcoin buying opportunity emerges from a combination of technical factors and market sentiment that rarely align so clearly. Strategic approaches to this Bitcoin buying opportunity include: Dollar-cost averaging rather than lump-sum investments Monitoring correlation patterns with traditional markets Watching for stabilization in spot ETF flows Preparing for potential W-shaped recovery patterns What Makes This Bitcoin Buying Opportunity Different? Unlike previous market cycles, current conditions combine institutional adoption with retail sentiment shifts. This Bitcoin buying opportunity represents more than just a price dip—it reflects a maturing market finding its equilibrium. The psychological oversold condition identified by K33 Research suggests that fear may be overriding rational analysis among many market participants. This creates a potential Bitcoin buying opportunity for those who can look beyond short-term volatility to long-term fundamentals. The market’s structural changes, including spot ETF availability and increased institutional participation, provide a stronger foundation than in previous cycles. Conclusion: Seizing the Bitcoin Buying Opportunity The current market conditions present a compelling case for considering Bitcoin as a long-term investment. While short-term volatility may continue, the psychological oversold condition identified by K33 Research suggests we’re at a potential inflection point. This Bitcoin buying opportunity combines technical indicators with fundamental market evolution, creating a rare moment for strategic entry. Remember that successful cryptocurrency investing requires patience and discipline. This Bitcoin buying opportunity doesn’t guarantee immediate returns, but it does offer favorable conditions for those with long-term perspectives. Frequently Asked Questions What does ‘psychologically oversold’ mean for Bitcoin? Psychologically oversold describes when market sentiment becomes excessively negative, potentially driving prices below their fundamental value due to fear rather than rational analysis. How much has Bitcoin dropped from its all-time high? Bitcoin is currently down 36% from its all-time high, creating what K33 Research identifies as a potential buying opportunity. Should I invest all my capital at once in this Bitcoin buying opportunity? No, K33 Research cautions against deploying all capital at once due to Bitcoin’s tendency toward W-shaped recoveries and current market volatility. What makes this cycle different from previous Bitcoin corrections? This cycle features significant policy changes, institutional adoption, and spot ETF availability that create fundamentally different market conditions. How long should I hold Bitcoin if I enter at this buying opportunity? This analysis focuses on long-term investment horizons, suggesting investors should be prepared to hold through potential short-term volatility. What indicators suggest this is a genuine Bitcoin buying opportunity? Key indicators include the psychological oversold condition, correlation patterns with traditional markets, and fundamental policy changes supporting long-term growth. Found this analysis helpful?

The recent BTC downturn is pressuring Strategy’s “infinite money glitch.” Strategy will face its first big wave of dividends due toward the end of the year, when about $120M is due on several of its preferred stocks. Strategy reported just $54M in its cash reserves for Q3, meaning it may have to use a part of the proceeds from Euro-denominated STRE preferred shares. For now, Strategy is liquid, despite using some of its funds for dividends and not new BTC purchases. If $BTC drops to our $74K average cost basis, we still have 5.9x assets to convertible debt, which we refer to as the BTC Rating of our debt. At $25K BTC, it would be 2.0x. — Strategy (@Strategy) November 25, 2025 Strategy’s “infinite money glitch,” which worked during BTC expansion, is now unwinding and showing a potential weakness. The bigger test for MSTR will be the MSCI review in mid-January, which may lead to selling pressure as funds unwind their positions. In total, over $9B of MSTR shares are held by passive funds. A removal from indexes may cause $2.8B in almost immediate sales, and more in the coming months. What can Strategy do next? Strategy retains 649,870 BTC, with most identified through on-chain wallets. Even with a low MSTR price, the treasury is not in danger. The company may continue its regular consulting and knowledge product operations while pausing BTC purchases. Some of the preferred shares may have their dividends delayed to decrease the cash burden. If Strategy wants to keep raising funds despite everything, it may have to resort to the STRC preferred shares, raising the promised dividend, and making its playbook even more expensive. In 2025, Strategy has no BTC-backed loans, threatening the need for liquidation. The BTC have no risk exposure, but they are also not considered valuable by MSTR holders, who do not actually have a claim on the coins. MSTR can only be valuable if BTC starts another rally, making the playbook viable again. In general, MSTR is considered a tool to amplify BTC trends. MSTR recovered slightly to $172.19, after dipping to a local low of $166. Strategy is still unable to buy the dip The current stock level means Strategy is unable to “buy the dip,” and instead has been exposed to BTC prices during rallies and near all-time peaks. For now, Strategy’s breakeven is just above $74,000, and the company has hinted at possibly selling some of the BTC to service its obligations. Strategy has some leeway on its $8B in convertible debt, most of which is already out of the money. The maturity dates of this debt are still years away, but creditors may already show impatience with the company’s ability to repay. Strategy generates limited free cash, instead relying on new raises for liquidity. For Strategy, the only hope is another BTC bull cycle as its debt matures, which may also save the MSTR price. The debt will start maturing between 2028 and 2032, potentially creating a scenario of rapidly selling BTC to cover the obligations. In the interim, Strategy will have to service $700M in annual dividend obligations while waiting for an eventual BTC recovery.

At the same time, fresh charts from its spot Bitcoin market show rising sell-side pressure on Coinbase, adding a short-term market angle to the company news. Coinbase Ventures sets 2026 investment priorities Coinbase Ventures said it will direct its 2026 investments toward real-world asset trading, next-generation decentralized finance, and new AI-driven Web3 applications. The firm made the announcement in a blog post published Nov. 25, 2025. It said it will back projects building tokenized asset products, trading infrastructure, advanced DeFi systems, and AI connected to blockchain platforms. Coinbase Ventures said it will also prioritize specialized exchanges and trading terminals. It said these areas will support market demand as digital assets expand into traditional finance and machine-driven applications. Coinbase announces major update for December 17 Moreover, Coinbase said on X that it will unveil “the next evolution of Coinbase” on December 17. The company added that the reveal will stream live on X. Observers note that this teaser follows a recent change to Coinbase’s profile bio — the only text added was “December 17.” Analysts say this build-up fuels speculation. Some expect new products. Others mention possible expansion of services or platform upgrades. Coinbase teaser signals selling pressure on Bitcoin spot markets Meanwhile, Bitcoin order books on Coinbase showed notable sell-side pressure late Nov. 24, according to market data shared by a crypto analyst on X.

DDC Enterprise, a New York Stock Exchange-listed e-commerce company, has significantly increased its Bitcoin holdings with a strategic purchase that demonstrates growing institutional confidence in digital assets. Why Are Bitcoin Holdings Becoming Corporate Strategy? DDC Enterprise recently acquired 100 additional BTC at an average price of $106,952 per coin, bringing their total Bitcoin holdings to 1,183. This move follows a growing trend of public companies allocating portions of their treasury to cryptocurrency. Many corporations now view Bitcoin as: A hedge against inflation A long-term store of value Portfolio diversification Exposure to digital asset growth What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Adoption? The expansion of DDC Enterprise’s Bitcoin holdings signals continued institutional acceptance. When publicly traded companies allocate funds to cryptocurrency, it validates the asset class for other corporations and individual investors. Moreover, these substantial Bitcoin holdings create tangible market support and demonstrate real-world utility beyond speculative trading. How Do Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Impact Markets? Large-scale corporate acquisitions like DDC Enterprise’s 100 BTC purchase create several market effects. First, they reduce circulating supply, which can influence price dynamics. Second, they bring legitimacy that encourages other institutions to consider similar allocations. The growing trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings also introduces new stability factors to what was once considered a highly volatile market. What Challenges Come With Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? While increasing Bitcoin holdings offers potential benefits, corporations face several considerations: Regulatory compliance requirements Secure storage solutions Accounting and reporting standards Market volatility management Actionable Insights From DDC Enterprise’s Move DDC Enterprise’s approach to Bitcoin holdings provides valuable lessons for other companies considering cryptocurrency allocation. Their systematic accumulation strategy, rather than one-time large purchases, demonstrates prudent risk management. Additionally, their public disclosure builds transparency and investor confidence in their digital asset strategy.

Traders anticipate a potential breakout after weeks of tightening price action and rising institutional inflows. The token repeatedly defended key support and inched toward major resistance levels, prompting market participants to look for near-term direction. To gain clarity on the immediate outlook, we consulted Elon Musk’s Grok AI , which supplied a precise December 1, 2025, XRP price target of $2.65 and an upside scenario to $3.20 if volumes sustain. Market Snapshot and Recent Price Action XRP is trading in the low $2s after a late-November rebound. Recent daily candles show higher intraday volumes and short-term momentum improvements. Historical intraday data confirms the token has oscillated between roughly $1.95 and $2.28 across the last week, highlighting compressed volatility ahead of a decisive move. Global payments systems completed the ISO 20022 migration in late November. The upgrade standardizes messaging and increases data richness for cross-border settlements. For XRP, ISO 20022 matters if banks and payment rails adopt tokenized settlement primitives. Without measurable institutional flows, standards alone will not create lasting price appreciation. How Grok’s $2.65 Target Stacks Up Against Market Models Grok’s $2.65 XRP price target is conservative relative to some bullish retail scenarios. CoinDCX’s December outlook allows for stronger year-end momentum and lists a $2.85 scenario under bullish market conditions. Conversely, CoinCodex’s technical models remain cautious, showing a near-term range in the low $2s. The divergence illustrates how model assumptions drive different outcomes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Conditions and What Would Confirm Grok’s Call For Grok’s $2.65 target to materialize, XRP must clear and hold $2.50 with expanding volume. Technical boutiques using Elliott Wave and channel analysis identify that a confirmed breakout requires follow-through buying above resistance. If volume fails to arrive, the token risks re-testing support levels near $1.90–$2.00. These scenarios make volume the single most actionable variable. Macro Context and Systemic Risks Broader crypto market health shapes XRP’s path. A sector-wide risk-on rotation would improve the odds of Grok’s forecast. Recent market coverage shows tentative recoveries in major tokens, but macro risk and investor sentiment remain fragile. Any shock to risk assets or liquidity could derail a measured rally. Probability over Prophecy Grok’s $2.65 projection is a reasonable, data-driven short-term outcome. It presumes ISO 20022 tailwinds translate into verified institutional flows, and that XRP breaks $2.50 with volume. If both conditions hold, a push toward $3.20 is credible. If they fail, prices will likely drift back to the low $2s. Treat AI price calls as one input among verified flow data, technical confirmation, and macro indicators before making trading decisions.

Most of that came from the debut of the Grayscale and Franklin Templeton XRP ETFs on the NYSE, which brought in $67.4 million and $62.6 million on launch. Some traders see this as the first real hint that XRP could outperform Bitcoin in December. The reasoning is simple: when November is weak, Bitcoin usually struggles the following month, and Coinglass data shows that December often stays flat or drops again in those years. Source: Bitcoin Monthly returns / Coinglass XRP has a weird December pattern of its own. Since December 2023, XRP has actually been a green month. However, the median return is around -3.16%, which normally tells traders to be cautious, but the average gain is a massive 69.6% because a few huge years completely skew the numbers. That is why XRP’s setup in December is seen as its own thing. XRP Open Interest Is Rising Again Ever since the Trump tariff crash in October, XRP’s open interest has taken a sharp hit and kept dropping. That trend is finally shifting. Open interest is now climbing again and is on track to push past 4 billion dollars, according to Coinglass data. Source: XRP Open Interest / Coinglass The renewed demand makes sense. Franklin Templeton, a 1.7 trillion dollar asset manager, recently stated that XRP “plays a foundational role in global settlement infrastructure,” which is a strong signal for institutional confidence. On top of that, exchange data looks even more bullish. Glassnode reports that more than 73 million XRP left exchanges over the past week. That usually indicates reduced selling pressure, since tokens stored offline are less likely to be dumped on the market. Taken together, the next question is whether these shifts are strong enough to influence price action in the weeks ahead. XRP Price Prediction: Will XRP Revisit $3? SOL’s price action from July through Wednesday has created a key demand zone that has previously led to a strong move. The area between 2.17 and 2.25 acted as an accumulation zone before a more than 40 percent pump, and if price settles there again, a similar reaction could play out. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) slopes downward, decreasing from 80 to 45 since July, indicating increasing bearish momentum and still not “oversold.” Price could drop further or continue to accumulate in this zone, but as long as it stays above 1.95, the overall setup remains intact. Bored Of OG Plays Like XRP? Bitcoin Hyper Offers Something New With XRP grabbing headlines for its massive ETF inflows and renewed institutional interest, a lot of traders are looking for the next play that can actually move right now. That is where Bitcoin Hyper keeps standing out. While the majors are trying to recover and sentiment is still shaky, Bitcoin Hyper has been quietly stacking serious momentum behind the scenes. The project has already raised 28.5 million dollars in its presale, which is insane considering how cautious the market has been. Big buyers are clearly positioning early, and the reason is pretty simple. Bitcoin Hyper runs as a fast Bitcoin Layer 2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, but it still settles back to Bitcoin for security. So you get cheap and fast transactions without giving up trust. The staking rewards are another major draw. APY is sitting around 41% , which is massive when most tokens are either flat or bleeding. Add in the trustless bridge that lets users mint BTC one-to-one on the L2, and you have an ecosystem that actually benefits from volatility instead of getting crushed by it.

That future just moved closer as Grayscale, the cryptocurrency asset management giant, files to convert its Zcash Trust into a spot ETF. This groundbreaking move could revolutionize how investors access ZEC, bringing institutional-grade exposure to the privacy coin through regulated channels. What Does Grayscale’s Zcash Spot ETF Filing Mean for Investors? Grayscale recently submitted a Form S-3 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking approval to transform its existing Zcash Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund. This Zcash spot ETF would track the actual price of ZEC rather than futures contracts. The filing represents a significant step toward mainstream acceptance of privacy coins. Currently, the Grayscale Zcash Trust operates as a closed-end fund, often trading at substantial premiums or discounts to its net asset value. Conversion to a Zcash spot ETF would eliminate this pricing discrepancy while providing several key benefits: Enhanced liquidity through continuous creation and redemption mechanisms Lower fees compared to the current trust structure Improved accessibility for retail and institutional investors Regulatory transparency through SEC oversight Why is This Zcash Spot ETF Filing So Important? The cryptocurrency industry has been eagerly awaiting SEC approval for various spot cryptocurrency ETFs. However, most attention has focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Grayscale’s move to file for a Zcash spot ETF demonstrates the company’s confidence in expanding the ETF landscape to include privacy-focused digital assets. This Zcash spot ETF application comes at a crucial time for the privacy coin sector. Regulatory scrutiny has increased globally, making institutional products like this potential Zcash spot ETF particularly significant. If approved, it would represent one of the first regulated investment vehicles specifically for a privacy cryptocurrency. What Challenges Might This Zcash Spot ETF Face? While the potential benefits are substantial, the path to approval for this Zcash spot ETF contains several hurdles. The SEC has historically expressed concerns about cryptocurrency ETFs, particularly regarding market manipulation and custody solutions. Privacy coins like Zcash face additional regulatory questions due to their enhanced anonymity features. However, Grayscale has successfully navigated complex regulatory landscapes before. The company’s legal victory against the SEC in 2023 regarding its Bitcoin ETF application demonstrated its willingness to fight for product approvals. This experience could prove valuable in securing approval for their Zcash spot ETF proposal. How Could a Zcash Spot ETF Transform the Privacy Coin Market? The introduction of a regulated Zcash spot ETF would likely have profound effects on the broader privacy coin ecosystem. Institutional participation could bring substantial capital inflows while potentially improving Zcash’s legitimacy in the eyes of skeptical regulators. This Zcash spot ETF could serve as a blueprint for similar products featuring other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the approval of a Zcash spot ETF might encourage other asset managers to explore privacy coin investment products. This competition could lead to better terms for investors and increased innovation in the cryptocurrency ETF space. The potential Zcash spot ETF represents more than just another investment product—it signals growing institutional acceptance of privacy as a fundamental feature in digital assets. What’s Next for Grayscale’s Zcash Spot ETF Ambitions? The SEC will now review Grayscale’s filing, a process that typically takes several months. During this period, we can expect: Public comments from industry participants and regulators Potential amendments to address SEC concerns Market speculation about approval probabilities Price volatility in ZEC as investors position themselves While approval isn’t guaranteed, Grayscale’s persistence in pursuing cryptocurrency ETFs suggests they’re prepared for a lengthy process. The potential Zcash spot ETF represents another frontier in the company’s mission to bridge traditional finance with digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What is a spot ETF? A spot ETF holds the actual underlying asset rather than derivatives. A Zcash spot ETF would hold ZEC tokens directly. How is this different from Grayscale’s current Zcash Trust? The current trust is a closed-end fund that often trades at premiums/discounts to NAV, while an ETF would trade closer to its actual value. When might the Zcash spot ETF be approved? SEC reviews typically take 3-6 months, but cryptocurrency ETFs often face longer timelines due to regulatory scrutiny. Will this affect Zcash’s price? Approval could bring significant institutional investment, potentially positively impacting ZEC’s price and liquidity. Are there other privacy coin ETFs in development? Grayscale’s filing is among the first focused specifically on a privacy cryptocurrency, though others may follow if successful. How can investors participate if approved? Investors could buy shares through traditional brokerage accounts, similar to purchasing stock ETFs. Help spread awareness about this groundbreaking development in cryptocurrency investing!
