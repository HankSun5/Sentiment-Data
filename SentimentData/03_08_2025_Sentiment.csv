The move followed Anthropic’s finding that OpenAI had violated its terms by accessing Anthropic’s tools in prohibited ways. Christopher Nulty, a spokesperson for Anthropic, said in a statement to WIRED , “Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5. Unfortunately, this is a direct violation of our terms of service.” Under Anthropic’s commercial terms, customers may not develop another product or service, create their own AI models using Anthropic’s platform, or attempt to dissect or replicate its technology . This adjustment to Claude availability coincides with OpenAI’s internal preparations for GPT-5 , the forthcoming model touted for enhanced coding capabilities. OpenAI allegedly used custom APIs for Claude access According to insiders, OpenAI integrated Claude into its proprietary toolchain via custom APIs rather than the usual chat portal. This arrangement enabled OpenAI to assess Claude’s performance on programming and writing tasks, and to evaluate its responses to safety-related queries regarding areas such as CSAM, self-harm, and defamatory content. The findings were then used to compare Claude against OpenAI’s in-house models and to fine-tune OpenAI’s systems accordingly. In response, OpenAI’s chief communications officer, Hannah Wong, said “It’s industry standard to evaluate other AI systems to benchmark progress and improve safety. While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.” Nulty also mentioned that granting API access for purposes like benchmarking and safety reviews remains part of standard industry practice. The company has not clarified how the current restriction on Claude access might affect OpenAI’s ongoing evaluations. API restrictions have long been wielded as leverage in the tech sector. For instance, Facebook previously cut off Vine (owned by Twitter), and more recently, Salesforce imposed constraints on rival Slack integrations. Anthropic enacted a comparable measure against the AI code startup Windsurf amid speculation of an OpenAI takeover, but the deal never happened. Anthropic’s chief science officer, Jared Kaplan, told TechCrunch, “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.” Anthropic to enforce weekly usage caps on Claude code Anthropic recently revealed plans to introduce weekly caps on Claude Code to reduce continuous background consumption by users. The company said in an email and on X that the new limits will start on August 28. These restrictions will affect users on the $20 Pro tier as well as those on the $100 and $200 Max tiers. Existing five-hourly usage quotas will remain unchanged. Moreover, the update includes two separate weekly quotas: a general usage cap and a model-specific allowance for Claude Opus 4. Max-tier subscribers will have the option to purchase additional capacity at Anthropic’s standard API pricing once they exceed the weekly thresholds. This adjustment builds on a subdued deployment of usage ceilings for Claude Code implemented earlier this summer. Claude Code is popular with developers, but Anthropic has had trouble keeping up with demand. Its service had seven major or partial outages last month, likely caused by heavy use from a small group of users. Get seen where it counts.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|VET|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 22:55:00

One of the strongest new entrants is Remittix (RTX) — a new crypto project committed to solving the cross-border payment problem at scale, and it’s building quietly before launching its wallet later in Q3. With its easy-to-use crypto-to-fiat capabilities, Remittix is causing a splash among investors as a legitimate PayFi contender — one that jumps past speculation hype to offer actual-world adoption. TRON remains steadfast, but Remittix picks up pace in utility-based adoption TRON (TRX) currently is priced at $0.3256, with a minor drop of 0.5%. Its market capitalization is around $30.81 Billion, whereas its daily trading volume has increased by over 47.52% to $1.58 Billion. With some experts’ opinion, TRX is likely to attempt to move towards the level of $0.50 — especially given its strong Layer 1 base and development ecosystem. Yet, a new generation of PayFi cryptos is in the making, which promises not only transaction speed, but also utility — and that is where Remittix excels. Contrasted to a lot of DeFi, which is aimed towards speculation or staking-only models, Remittix is building an actual product: end-to-end crypto-to-bank transfer infrastructure supporting over 40 various cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. You can send BTC, ETH, XRP, and more directly to country-located bank accounts in 30+ countries. Add on live FX conversion, and you have a usable solution to one of crypto’s longest-running problems — cheap remittance. Remittix presale figures and wallet release fuel expansion Remittix (RTX) tokens are valued at $0.0895 as its live presale. The project has raised over $17.9 Million, with more than 578 Million tokens sold to preliminary backers. There is still a 50% token bonus active for a limited period, providing significant potential upside for early adopters. The latest news? The forthcoming Q3 2025 beta wallet release, which will bring retail users and businesses low gas fees, fast on-chain processing, and a clean, intuitive interface. The wallet will also offer support for cryptocurrency staking and API integration for cross-border application. Remitix key highlights: $17.9Million+ presale amount raised with 578Million+ tokens sold $0.0895 token price currently with 50% bonus ongoing Beta wallet in Q3 2025 with minimal fees and rapid transfers 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies supported for worldwide use Built with actual utility, not speculation Remittix is gaining pace for all the correct reasons — and causing some conventional players concern. TRX faces new threat from use-case driven crypto TRON remains a highly viable blockchain project with enormous market cap and a good Layer 1 solution. But the new world of DeFi and crypto payments is now appreciating utility over mere infrastructure — and Remittix is the personification of that next generation. With a wallet release in the works and a presale closing in on the $18 Million soft cap, Remittix is shaping up to be one of the top crypto presale 2025 contenders. If TRON is the past and present of speedy DeFi rails, Remittix may be the future of international crypto remittances.

Focused on transforming subscription payments through blockchain, SUBBD is gaining early traction for its unique pitch. But bold ideas are only half the equation. On the other side, BlockDAG is turning heads for a different reason, it’s delivering. Instead of riding on speculation, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing live results, real tech, and active users. With its GLOBAL LAUNCH release fast approaching and key features already in play, the contrast between vision and execution has never been clearer. While SUBBD builds toward its goals, BlockDAG is already building with them. In a market that often rewards action over ambition, the difference matters. SUBBD Token: A Promising Pitch Still Waiting on Delivery SUBBD’s presale is starting to make waves as its model for subscription payments taps into a sector ready for disruption. Its strategy revolves around giving users and businesses more control, cutting out intermediaries, and using smart contracts to manage subscriptions. Market watchers are speculating on the SUBBD token’s price trajectory, encouraged by the platform’s ambitious narrative. Still, the project sits at an early stage. There’s a whitepaper, projections, and conceptual groundwork, but no listings yet. SUBBD is clearly leaning on future potential rather than current results. It’s a presale aimed at those open to risk in exchange for possible high upside, and that balance is attracting attention. For many, the pitch is enough to stay interested. But turning interest into adoption means proving functionality, not just outlining it. Until SUBBD moves from roadmap to real-world use, its pricing remains speculative. The coming months will be key to show if the project can build beyond promise. BlockDAG Powers Forward with Beat Vesting and August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH Release While some projects are still polishing their whitepapers, BlockDAG is already building in public. Its popular BEAT VESTING PASS has made a return, giving buyers until August 4 to access full liquidity at launch, an edge that sets it apart in today’s presale climate. With $359 million raised and 24.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG isn’t just ahead, it’s dominating. The tech is real. Demos for both the X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware are live, giving users firsthand experience with the platform’s mining setup. These tools make entry easy, combining simplicity with function through a one-tap mining model. The X1 App already has 2.5 million users mining from their phones, proving there’s real traction behind the numbers. What separates BlockDAG further is the transparency baked into its rollout. The smart contract-powered vesting, ongoing user growth, and planned exchange listings add up to a well-rounded launch strategy. And it all leads to one moment: the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. This isn’t just about raising funds. BlockDAG is showing how to deliver tech and access together. It’s not a presale that asks for patience, it’s one offering visibility, liquidity, and working features right now. SUBBD and BlockDAG: Execution Makes All the Difference SUBBD may have a vision, but BlockDAG has proof. While the SUBBD token price discussion continues in speculative circles, the project still needs to hit basic milestones before it’s taken seriously. It’s early, and that’s not a criticism, but early means unproven. In contrast, BlockDAG has already hit critical benchmarks. The BEAT VESTING PASS runs through August 4, followed by a GLOBAL LAUNCH release just a week later. The platform isn’t waiting for attention, it’s earning it through product rollouts and high engagement numbers. Demo access, live miners, and an expanding user base all build BlockDAG’s case. For SUBBD, the journey is just beginning. It still needs to prove product readiness, secure listings, and deliver real-world utility. Those are big steps. The takeaway is clear. If SUBBD delivers, it may join the list of successful disruptors. But right now, BlockDAG is already functioning like one. For those focused on certainty and launch-readiness, the difference between these projects is more than timing, it’s substance. Why BlockDAG’s Final Presale Window Shouldn’t Be Missed In crypto, waiting often means missing. SUBBD might rise in the future, and the SUBBD token price could reflect that if execution aligns with vision. But BlockDAG is in its moment now. The BEAT VESTING PASS is back until August 4, offering immediate liquidity. The coin is priced at $0.0016, with a confirmed launch value of $0.05, giving a potential 3,025% return for current participants. That kind of upside, paired with functional products, is rare in presale territory. With 24.6 billion coins sold and the final launch set for August 11, BlockDAG is closing in on full-scale release. It’s not just another project, it’s one delivering across the board.

Alongside this, Dogwifhat shows signs of potentially mirroring this upward trend. This article delves into whether these coins are set for notable growth, providing an insightful analysis for those looking to capitalize on the next big move in the crypto market. Dogecoin's Price Trends and Market Dynamics Dogecoin saw a 19.41% rise in value over the past month, but the coin also faced a significant weekly decrease of 14.53%, indicating notable market volatility. In the last six months, Dogecoin suffered a 24.14% decline, showcasing a struggling trend. The recent monthly increase hints at moments of bullish activity, yet the prevailing downward trend over a half-year calls for caution among traders. Currently, Dogecoin trades between $0.15 and $0.28, with immediate support at $0.09 and resistance at $0.35. A secondary resistance level exists at $0.48. Key indicators show an RSI of 43.25, suggesting the coin is not in overbought territory. The Awesome Oscillator sits at 0.006, while the momentum indicator is at -0.036, which indicates uncertainty. There is no clear trend, leading traders to consider short-term strategies, aiming for breakouts above $0.35 or testing support at $0.09 for potential bearish trades. Upward Potential Amid Uncertainty in Dogwifhat WIF price movement over the last month and six months displays modest downward pressure, with a one-month change of -1.96% and a half-year decline of -5.82%. The coin experienced a notable short-term dip with a one-week decrease of -16.63%, yet its trading range remained between $0.6878 and $1.2326 during recent sessions. Trading activity has been constrained within these bounds, hinting at subdued investor enthusiasm. Price oscillation within this range reflects market hesitation and cautious sentiment, revealing a market seeking directional clarity while digesting broader economic and crypto-specific factors. Current price action revolves around a trading band with a support level at $0.4613 and resistance near $1.55, with a second resistance identified around $2.0957. Indicators suggest slight bearish dominance, highlighted by a negative momentum indicator at -0.2681 and a below-neutral relative strength index of 41.943. Oscillators show a partial positive signal, but the moving average recommendation of -0.6666 indicates sellers dominate in the midterm. Trading strategies could focus on accumulating near the support level while monitoring for a breakout above $1.55 as a sign of resumed bullish drive, although caution remains important given the lack of a clear trend. Conclusion DOGE is positioned to rise from its key support level. Its movement can create positive momentum for WIF . Similar patterns in both coins suggest potential growth. Investors should watch for any significant breakout. This could offer opportunities in the market. Further monitoring of these trends is advisable.

Not just buying low and selling high, but entering before the wave begins. From Bitcoin’s earliest days at under $1 to Ethereum’s quiet beginnings at $0.30, the biggest winners were not those with the most capital—but those with the most foresight. Fast forward to 2025, and the opportunity hasn’t disappeared. If anything, it’s evolved. Now, smart investors are hunting for tokens that offer asymmetric upside—projects with strong narratives, emerging communities, and clear signals of momentum before mainstream exposure kicks in. This approach is what turns $500 into $50,000, and helps level the playing field between retail traders and institutions. Today’s profit strategies go beyond holding Bitcoin or earning yield through DeFi. While those approaches offer stability, the fastest gains still come from early entry into under-the-radar altcoins —especially those with viral branding, limited access windows, and traction that mirrors early crypto giants. But identifying the right project requires more than hype. With tools like on-chain analysis, Telegram activity trackers, and social volume aggregators, today’s investor has sharper insight than ever before into what’s building beneath the surface. Why Early-Stage Tokens Still Offer the Best ROI Most projects don’t go 100x. But those that do usually share a few common traits—and they all rewarded those who recognized the patterns early. In recent months, one particular token has been making waves for just that reason. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention across platforms like X and Telegram not simply for its meme appeal, but for the velocity of its adoption. Crypto research groups tracking social metrics say its early trajectory mirrors the rise of Ethereum Classic, two tokens that generated major returns for initial adopters. But unlike older assets that are now deep into their market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early growth curve . The project’s viral branding, combined with a limited-access phase, has created a rush among early participants. Every round has seen rapid sellouts, and the project’s social growth has already rivaled meme giants like Dogecoin in their infancy. Analysts now forecast that its current pricing window may be one of the last remaining chances for sharp asymmetric entry before broader exchange access resets the opportunity. How to Spot High-Upside Tokens Before the Crowd Spotting altcoins before they explode isn’t about luck—it’s about pattern recognition. Historically, the biggest crypto winners showed early signs long before their names hit mainstream headlines. These included subtle metrics like surging social media growth, increasing wallet holders, and high engagement rates on social channels like X and Telegram . They also tended to feature emotionally resonant branding, whether political, cultural, or comedic—something that hooks communities and sustains hype across weeks or months. Another key factor? Scarcity of access. The earliest-stage tokens that go on to make 10x–100x moves are often available only for a limited time through exclusive, time-sensitive windows. Once listed on major exchanges, these assets usually price in their potential, leaving little room for exponential gains . The most strategic investors understand this—they track momentum, measure community velocity, and look for entry points when the crowd is still on the sidelines. Final Thoughts: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Act Early The best way to make money in crypto has always been clear— get in before everyone else realizes what’s happening . Whether it’s through identifying social trends, spotting wallet inflows, or analyzing price structure before breakout, timing and conviction are the real tools of the trade. In today’s cycle, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum precisely because they offer that rare mix: powerful community traction, viral positioning, and limited access. And as history has shown, when these elements align, the results can be game-changing .

Considering the supposed significance of this price mark, there have been questions about how much headroom the price of Bitcoin still has. The latest on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin bull run might not be over just yet. BTC Long-Term Holders Start Distributing In an August 1st post on X, crypto analyst Joao Wedson reported that the Bitcoin cycle for the long-term holders seems to be coming to an end. Related Reading: Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Just Turned Red For The First Time Since May — What This Means Wedson emphasized that, regardless of the ongoing excitement around ETFs, on-chain data shows a clear market shift. This shift signals that the cryptocurrency’s long-term holders are beginning to sell their coins, and, in large volumes, too. According to the analyst, about 50% of the amount of Bitcoin held in exchange-traded funds has been sold by the LTHs. Regardless of this situation, however, Wedson expects the BTC bull market to go on for “at least 2 more months” and the altcoins’ bull cycle for three months. Key Metrics Flash Warnings – But ‘Final Top’ Not Yet Seen Wedson backed his claim with four on-chain indicators, starting with the Coin Days Destroyed Terminal Adjusted Metric, which shows aged coins moving after being dormant for a long period of time. The analyst explained that there has been a significant movement of old BTC over the past two years. This, Wedson emphasized, triggered three major warning signs that coincide with a local top. Wedson also referenced the Reserve Risk Indicators to gauge current LTH conviction. This metric, from analysis, has entered a warning zone, as there is increased selling activity and hand exchanges. Next, the online pundit quoted results from the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal. The SOPR measures whether coins (in this case, Bitcoin) are moved at a profit or loss. Wedson pointed out that this indicator recently flashed a bearish signal, which implies increased profit-taking in the market. Referring to it as ‘the most accurate metric in the world’ used to identify Bitcoin’s macro tops, the Bitcoin Cycle Market Top Prediction: Max Intersect SMA Model was put out last. Wedson highlighted that this metric is yet to flash any bearish signal. Using the chart below, the analyst explained that until the blue line reaches the $69,000 level, the final top is yet to arrive. Ultimately, the analyst preached caution against panicking, as historical cycle patterns suggest that the final market top has yet to arrive. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $113,052, reflecting a 1.2% price decline in the past 24 hours.

At the time, those coins were worth about $3.5 billion. Today, they’d fetch roughly $14.5 billion, making this the biggest crypto heist ever recorded. No one at LuBian, nor the group behind the intrusion, has publicly confirmed the breach. Blockchain investigator Arkham first revealed the scale of the loss. BREAKING: ARKHAM UNCOVERS $3.5B HEIST – THE LARGEST EVER LuBian was a Chinese mining pool with facilities in China & Iran. Based on analysis of on-chain data, it appears that 127,426 BTC was stolen from LuBian in December 2020, worth $3.5 billion at the time and now worth… pic.twitter.com/PnIOKgMt0i — Arkham (@arkham) August 2, 2025 In mid-2020, LuBian ranked among the top pools, handling nearly 6% of Bitcoin’s total computing power as of May. Its operations spanned China and Iran. On December 28, 2020, attackers emptied over 90 percent of LuBian’s holdings. The next day, roughly $6 million more which was split between Bitcoin and USDT, vanished from a Lubian address on the Omni protocol. By December 31, LuBian shunted its remaining balance into secured recovery wallets. Soon after, each hacker’s address received an embedded OP\_RETURN note, begging for the return of stolen funds. Sending those messages cost LuBian 1.4 BTC over 1,516 transactions, a sign the appeals likely came from the real pool operators and not a copycat looking to exploit compromised keys. Security analysis points to a flaw in LuBian’s key-generation method. It seems their algorithm was weak against brute-force attacks, offering a gateway for the breach. Despite the attack, LuBian managed to keep 11,886 BTC, today worth about $1.35 billion, which remains untouched. The hacker has also left the stolen coins, except for moving them into one wallet in July 2024. Because Bitcoin’s price has climbed since 2020, the stolen coins now amount to $14.5 billion. On Arkham’s records, that stash places the culprit as the 13th-largest BTC holder, even ahead of the Mt. Gox hacker. For perspective, Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined over 22,000 blocks before disappearing in 2011. Those early rewards translate to more than one million BTC, all but a handful never spent, making Nakamoto a billionaire many times over. LuBian hack surpasses Bybit’s $1.5 billion theft LuBian’s loss shattered the previous record, set by Bybit in February 2025, when hackers stole $1.5 billion , according to Cryptopolitan. About $1.46 billion worth of mETH and stETH streamed out to four Ethereum addresses, with parts swapped immediately on decentralized marketplaces. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT spotted the suspicious outflow, and firm Cyvers flagged odd activity from the exchange’s wallets. Bybit had earlier confronted an unrelated “address poisoning” attack. Most of the stolen tokens were swapped for ETH on decentralized exchanges and then run through mixers to hide them. It was one of the first big exchange hacks of 2025. Bybit said the incident was a routine fund transfer between cold and hot wallets, but that hackers subverted the destination address. No internal breach of systems occurred, according to the company. Investigators had pinpointed five wallets involved in the attack. ZachXBT warned that all other exchanges and services should blacklist these addresses to prevent further losses.

As interest in XRP among institutional investors continues to grow, discussions around its long-term potential are intensifying. Several organizations, including Trident Digital, Webus, and VivoPower , have already announced plans to include XRP in their treasury holdings, suggesting growing confidence in the asset’s utility and future performance. Amid this increasing institutional activity, the question arises: What would happen if global retirement funds, which manage massive pools of capital, were to allocate even a modest 1% of their assets to XRP? The Magnitude of Global Pension Funds Estimates place the total value of retirement fund assets worldwide at roughly $50 trillion. These funds, comprising both private and public pensions, traditionally prioritize stable investments such as government bonds, equities, and real estate. However, the evolving investment landscape and rising recognition of digital assets have led to a reconsideration of cryptocurrency as a viable long-term allocation. A 1% investment from global retirement funds into XRP would amount to approximately $500 billion. This figure represents a substantial influx compared to XRP’s current market capitalization, and such a move could significantly reshape the token’s valuation. Price Implications Under a Linear Projection At present, XRP trades around $2.88 , with about 59.3 billion tokens in circulation. This puts its current market capitalization near $165 billion. If $500 billion were injected into XRP, and we assume a linear correlation between capital inflow and market capitalization growth, XRP’s market cap could rise to $665 billion. In that case, the projected price per token would increase to roughly $11.28. However, this straightforward estimation does not account for real-world market mechanics. In practice, large capital inflows often create disproportionately larger price movements due to liquidity gaps and investor reactions. In cryptocurrency markets, the multiplier effect refers to the amplification of price movements caused by limited liquidity and increased demand. When substantial buy pressure enters the market, it can cause prices to escalate rapidly, especially if sell orders are sparse at higher levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Applying a conservative multiplier of 1.5x to 3x on the linear estimate of $11.28, XRP’s price could realistically reach between $17 and $34 per token. This wide range reflects the volatility and reactive nature of crypto markets when faced with institutional-scale investments. Policy Shifts Supporting Crypto in Retirement Portfolios One major barrier to retirement funds adopting XRP has historically been regulatory caution. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance warning against crypto exposure in retirement plans due to risks related to volatility, storage, and speculation. However, by May 2025, the Department rescinded that guidance and adopted a neutral stance on crypto assets in retirement portfolios. This regulatory shift, alongside similar changes by agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the FDIC , has created a more accommodating environment for institutional crypto participation. A modest allocation of 1% from global retirement funds into XRP has the potential to significantly influence the asset’s price and standing within the broader financial ecosystem. Beyond price growth, such participation would represent a strong signal of legitimacy, potentially encouraging further adoption among both institutions and individual investors. As regulatory barriers continue to ease and the infrastructure around crypto investment matures, the likelihood of such developments appears increasingly plausible.

Altcoin interest is surging again, and one project in particular—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is beginning to draw serious attention from traders looking for stronger momentum plays. XRP Fails to Break Key Levels XRP has held steady around the $3 mark for weeks, showing resilience but little upside action. Even as large wallets continue to accumulate and network usage grows, the lack of a breakout is leaving short-term traders frustrated. While long-term prospects remain intact, there’s growing demand for tokens with faster growth potential and more immediate returns. Early Investors Are Targeting the Next Big Opportunity That appetite for action has triggered a rush toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new player that recently saw its presale round close faster than expected. Now entering its next funding wave, the project is generating FOMO across crypto channels. Analysts are pointing to a potential 5,000% return , noting that even a small investment could grow into a fortune. The hype isn’t just talk—community numbers are growing, and early backers are comparing this moment to the breakout phases of past meme coin legends. Traders Grow Restless as XRP Lacks Catalysts Back on the XRP front, hopes are still pinned on regulatory clarity and a potential ETF listing—but timelines are uncertain. Some are holding, but others are clearly moving funds into faster-developing projects. Despite its strong fundamentals, XRP isn’t delivering the action many traders are chasing right now, and attention is drifting. Conclusion XRP may still see its moment, but right now, capital is flowing to altcoins with stronger short-term upside. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid presale and 5,000% ROI prediction, it’s clear which way momentum is shifting. For investors who don’t want to miss the next breakout, early positioning is everything.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 23:55:00

49448197,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76613,1754179212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst Predicts $3,380 XRP Using This Model",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-3380-xrp-using-this-model/,"A recent valuation model presented by a prominent XRP analyst suggests that a holding of just 5,000 XRP could potentially be worth up to $16.9 million. The prediction is based on the assumption that the XRP Ledger will become a dominant infrastructure in global finance , handling volumes across various markets and institutions. High-Stakes Price Projection The forecast originates from an analyst known online as “Future XRP,” who shared his findings via a post that has gained traction within the XRP community. His valuation model estimates XRP’s future price at $3,380, a figure that would require an increase of more than 1,500 times its current market price of approximately $3.00. According to his projection, XRP’s existing network, with a circulating supply of around 60 billion tokens and a transaction velocity of 10, can already support an annual volume of about $1.3 trillion. However, if the XRP Ledger is adopted widely across financial sectors, he anticipates the annual transaction volume could grow substantially, potentially ranging between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion. Several developments have fueled speculation about XRP’s future utility. In recent public remarks, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed optimism about XRP capturing a significant portion of SWIFT’s transaction volume within the next five years, up to 14% according to his projection. At its current price of $2.20, 60 Billion in Circulating Supply, and an annual velocity of 10, $XRP can handle about $1.3 Trillion in annual flow on chain today. You're not ready for the rest of this post…Lock in… 1700 NDAs, at least 14% of Swift, Derivatives, FX Market,… — Future XRP (@the5blairs) June 28, 2025 Additionally, Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road in April 2025, a firm with connections to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), has intensified speculation. The DTCC processes more than $11 trillion daily, adding weight to the idea that XRP could play a role in high-value settlements. Future XRP argues that if the token maintains its supply and transaction velocity, it would need a price point in the $3,380 range to effectively facilitate such a massive flow of value. Potential Gains for XRP Holders In the scenario described, XRP holders could see extraordinary returns. A wallet holding 5,000 XRP would reach a value of $16.9 million. Other hypothetical cases include 1,000 XRP being valued at $3.38 million, and 50,000 XRP reaching $169 million. While the analyst emphasizes that these outcomes are tied to very specific market shifts, he presents them as theoretically possible under the right conditions. Not all observers agree with the methodology or conclusions of the model. Some critics argue that the estimated transaction velocity of 10 is too low compared to traditional financial systems like SWIFT , where turnover can reach up to 200 times annually. Under such conditions, XRP could potentially support the same financial throughput with a much lower price, possibly around $166. Others question whether XRP could dominate financial infrastructure on its own, considering competition from alternative networks such as Stellar, Ethereum-based stablecoins, and centralized financial solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 AI Commentary on the Projection To validate his assumptions, Future XRP asked the Grok 3 AI model to analyze the data. The AI provided a summary of the analyst’s reasoning and acknowledged the potential for XRP to become a key neutral settlement mechanism in a shifting global financial system. While Grok considered a $3,380 price to be an outlier scenario, it deemed a range between $200 and $1,000 plausible, particularly if the world transitions further away from dollar-denominated reserves. However, the AI also noted that extreme price targets would likely require significant global disruptions, such as a breakdown of fiat systems or a major realignment of global financial infrastructure. The projection that 5,000 XRP could be worth nearly $17 million is based on a model that assumes XRP becomes central to global finance. While intriguing, the prediction has generated mixed reactions. Supporters view it as a realistic long-term scenario tied to Ripple’s expansion efforts, while critics caution that the assumptions may not reflect how financial markets operate.

With Bitcoin continuing to dictate overall market direction, the analyst mentioned plans to monitor LTC’s intraday chart for a potential quick scalp opportunity. LTCBTC Shows Early Bullish Signs Despite Caution In his analysis, Cryptowzrd observed that both Litecoin (LTC) and LTCBTC closed the day with indecisive daily candles, reflecting market hesitation. Despite this uncertainty, LTCBTC managed to close slightly in the green, which could be an early sign of shifting momentum. However, the analyst stressed the need for stronger and more consistent daily candles from this level to confirm a sustainable move. Related Reading: Litecoin Sharp Pullback: Scalping Opportunities Emerge While LTCBTC Seeks Stability A critical resistance level to watch is 0.0010 BTC for LTCBTC. Cryptowzrd highlighted that a clean breakout above this barrier could trigger an impulsive rally, given the pair’s extremely oversold condition. Such a breakout would likely push Litecoin sharply higher, with $140 identified as the major upside target. On the support side, Litecoin’s key daily level sits at $96. Cryptowzrd cautioned that this support could be tested only if Bitcoin experiences a sharp drop towards the $110,000 region, driven by panic selling. In such a case, LTC would likely follow BTC’s lead and retrace to test lower support levels. Cryptowzrd highlighted that his attention will be on lower time frames in the near term, looking for short-term chart patterns to exploit quick trading opportunities. However, broader market sentiment, especially Bitcoin’s price action, will remain the dominant factor influencing Litecoin’s direction. Litecoin Intraday Volatility Limits Clear Setup Formation In his final remarks, Cryptowzrd noted that Litecoin’s intraday chart showed increased volatility throughout the day, making short-term trading conditions less favorable. He emphasized the need for a clearer and more structured chart formation before considering any immediate entries. Related Reading: Litecoin Is On Fire: $120–$125 Range In Bullish Crosshairs A key level to watch is the $114.50 intraday resistance. According to Cryptowzrd, a move above this level would be a bullish signal and could invite further buying pressure. Additionally, a breakout above the intraday lower high trendline would likely accelerate upward momentum, potentially setting the stage for a stronger rally. Despite these technical signals, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin’s price action remains the primary driving force in the market. As such, any decision to enter a trade will depend on the development of a mature and well-defined setup, ideally supported by Bitcoin’s broader trend. For now, patience is key while waiting for the right conditions to align.

XRP and Cardano (ADA) are once again making headlines, thanks to growing institutional momentum and network developments that could reignite major rallies. While many are focusing on established names, early movers are also quietly building positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE—a fast-rising project already breaking records in its presale phase. XRP Eyes Breakout on ETF Buzz XRP remains one of the most talked-about altcoins heading into the next market leg. Priced around $3.15, it still sits just below its all-time high of $3.84, and the hype surrounding a potential XRP ETF approval is only growing. A green light from regulators could send the token surging, especially with Ripple’s established connections in the global banking sector. Trading volumes remain strong, and whale accumulation hints at rising confidence from large investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Gains Speed In the middle of all this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum at an astonishing pace. Its latest presale round has already outperformed the last round’s numbers, signaling massive demand . Some experts are praising the project to be a game-changer for the crypto industry, forecasting their explosive price movements. With a high ROI projection, limited token access , and exchange listings on the horizon, it’s no surprise that strategic investors are racing to get in before the broader market catches on. ADA’s Hidden Strength and Airdrop Fuel Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is showing real potential for a breakout of its own. At just $0.78, it remains far from its all-time high of $3.10, giving it plenty of room to run. But what’s driving excitement now is the long-awaited Midnight airdrop, expected to be one of the largest in Cardano’s history. The distribution will benefit ADA holders—and even XRP holders, boosting cross-community engagement. This upcoming event could help trigger the momentum ADA lacked in previous cycles. Final Thoughts XRP’s ETF speculation, Midnight’s upcoming airdrop, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale performance are giving crypto investors several promising paths for potential gains . As demand accelerates and catalysts stack up, these three projects are worth watching closely.

BlockDAG’s Final Presale Surge Could Be Your Biggest Missed Opportunity,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-buy-right-now-blockdags-final-presale-surge-could-be-your-biggest-missed-opportunity/,"In the ever-shifting world of digital assets, identifying the top crypto to buy right now is no easy feat. From DeFi tokens to Layer 1 giants, the market is saturated with options, but few stand out with the same blend of fundamentals, community backing, and growth potential as BlockDAG. While popular tokens like Cosmos (ATOM), Polygon (MATIC/POL), and Cronos (CRO) each show flashes of momentum, BlockDAG’s final presale window is grabbing serious attention. It’s raised over $359 million, sold 24.3 billion coins, and is currently priced at just $0.0016, despite a confirmed listing price of $0.05. That creates a staggering 3,025% ROI opportunity. What’s more, BlockDAG isn’t a concept. It’s a functioning Layer 1 ecosystem with live miners, active developers, and a clearly mapped global launch. In this article, we’ll compare the current market movers and reveal why BlockDAG may be the top crypto to buy right now. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG is quickly emerging as the top crypto to buy right now, and its momentum is data-driven, not just hype. With more than $359 million raised and over 24.3 billion BDAG coins already sold, this Layer 1 project is nearing the end of one of the most successful presales in recent memory. Currently priced at just $0.0016, BDAG offers a rare 3,025% potential return based on its confirmed $0.05 listing price. But it’s not only the numbers that impress. BlockDAG has built a working ecosystem before launch, with over 2 million users mining daily via the X1 mobile app and 18,000 X10 hardware miners sold. A live testnet is already active, and over 4,500 developers are working on more than 300 dApps. Add in a GLOBAL LAUNCH release scheduled for August 11 and a limited-time NO VESTING PASS that gives buyers 100% of their tokens at launch, and it’s clear why traders are rushing in. This isn’t speculation, it’s strategic accumulation. With fundamentals already delivered and community traction accelerating, BlockDAG makes a strong case as the top crypto to buy right now. Cosmos (ATOM) Analysis Cosmos (ATOM) has struggled to maintain upward momentum recently, shedding nearly 6% over the past 24 hours. The token is hovering near $4.63, after being rejected at $4.87 and slipping below key short-term EMAs. The RSI currently sits around 31, signaling oversold conditions, but also caution. Unless ATOM can bounce convincingly from the $4.62–$4.65 support zone, the downside risk toward $4.46 remains in play. Technical setups show weakening conviction, and trading volumes have dried up across major exchanges. While long-term potential still exists, the current conditions place ATOM in a “wait and see” category for those seeking the top crypto to buy right now. Without a strong catalyst or visible ecosystem acceleration, short-term holders may want to stay cautious. Polygon (MATIC / POL) Analysis Polygon is currently priced at around $0.2166, having gained roughly 2.6% in the past 24 hours. Despite muted trading volume, technical indicators are painting a more optimistic picture. A double-bottom base around $0.40–$0.42 has held, and the token is now targeting a breakout toward $0.55–$0.60. A sustained move could push MATIC as high as $0.70. On-chain stablecoin activity has also surged, with USDC transfers up by 141%, hinting at growing utility and capital inflow. Polygon’s continued focus on Ethereum scaling, particularly with zkEVM rollouts, positions it well long-term. However, given the current price action and modest engagement levels, MATIC may not be the immediate top crypto to buy right now unless momentum picks up further. Cronos (CRO) Analysis Cronos (CRO) is enjoying a resurgence ahead of its POS Chain v6 upgrade, scheduled for July 28. The update includes improved IBC compatibility, new circuit breaker modules, and stronger interoperability, elements that enhance its long-term utility. In the past week, CRO has rallied about 12%, now trading near $0.137. Bullish patterns such as a Golden Cross and a bullish engulfing candle support the rally, alongside investor excitement over a possible 5% allocation in a proposed Trump Media ETF. Technical indicators suggest strength above $0.121 support, with near-term upside targeting $0.133 and beyond. While CRO has catalysts in motion, whether it becomes the top crypto to buy right now depends on how effectively it capitalizes on these upgrades and ETF narratives in the coming weeks. Conclusion In a market filled with short-term noise and speculative pops, identifying the top crypto to buy right now comes down to three pillars: real-world traction, strategic timing, and provable delivery. Cosmos and Polygon show technical promise, and Cronos is riding an upgrade wave, but none currently match the scale or clarity of execution seen in BlockDAG. With a fully operational testnet, millions of miners, over 4,500 developers building real dApps, and $359 million already raised, BlockDAG is not just preparing to launch; it’s accelerating toward it. The current presale price of $0.0016 offers a rare chance at 3,025% returns when the $0.05 listing hits later this year at launch. Add the limited-time NO VESTING PASS, and the window becomes even more urgent. For traders searching for the top crypto to buy right now, BlockDAG may be the standout candidate of the year.

Sometimes, it’s a viral tweet. Other times, it’s an irresistible narrative baked into a hilarious token name. But more often than not, it’s a combination of utility, hype, and raw community power. Meme coins have gone from jokes to market juggernauts, flipping expectations and turning small investments into life-changing bags. Arctic Pablo Coin , Banana for Scale, Pudgy Penguins, Cat in Dog’s World, Popcat, Bonk, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Memecoin, and Fartboy—these are the names driving the next crypto craze. From penguin NFTs to feline defiance, each one rides the meme energy of the internet with unique vibes. But among them, Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now, and here’s why. While many of these projects hinge on nostalgia, community memes, or animal cuteness, Arctic Pablo Coin fuses meme culture with robust tokenomics and competitive community rewards. It’s built not just to ride waves—but to cause them. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin: Turning Crypto Hype into Cold, Hard Returns What sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart isn’t just its name or meme worthiness—it’s the snowballing power of its ecosystem. One standout feature? The Community Competitions. Participants can compete in meme contests, viral challenges, and creative stunts—and get rewarded in either APC tokens or real USD. That’s not just engagement; that’s real incentive-driven momentum. How often does a meme coin pay its users for hype generation? Arctic Pablo Coin is more than a coin—it’s a movement. With an NFT-ready roadmap, transparent burns (over 11 billion APCs already vaporized), and a quirky yet strategic marketing campaign, Arctic Pablo is doing what Dogecoin once did—but smarter, faster, and with more explicit purpose. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now because it’s already building a culture of rewards and exclusivity before even listing. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Update: Cold Opportunity, Hot ROI Arctic Pablo Coin is now in Stage 34 (Chilly Citadel) of its explosive meme coin presale , priced at just $0.00062. With over $3.17 million raised, early buyers are eyeing a 1190.32% return to listing—and a staggering 16,029.03% ROI if it hits analysts’ $0.1 target. This window won’t stay open long. Those paying attention already know: Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now. The presale is roaring ahead, currently in Stage 34—aptly named Chilly Citadel . Early adopters have seen gains up to 4,033.33%. A $1,000 investment today fetches 1,612,900 APC tokens, which could be worth $12,903.20 when the listing hits $0.008—and even more if the predicted $0.1 target hits. This isn’t just a presale. It’s a ticking clock on one of 2025’s most exciting ROI windows. Miss this, and the only thing colder than Pablo’s ice is the regret. The clock is melting—act fast or stay frozen out. 2. Banana for Scale: Precision Meme Mechanics Meet Hilarious Utility Banana for Scale rides the absurdist meme era, where comparison measurements turned into running jokes. But behind the laughs is an ecosystem designed to scale in both user rewards and staking flexibility. The token integrates NFT utilities that allow holders to “measure” influence across partnered communities. Banana for Scale isn’t just humorous—it’s scalable by design. That’s what earns its spot among 2025’s standout meme coins. 3. Pudgy Penguins: From NFT Fame to Meme Coin Fame Once famous as an adorable NFT collection, Pudgy Penguins has now leapt into the meme coin space with the same cozy charisma. This token doubles as a cultural badge of crypto literacy and a direct gateway into an expanding metaverse. It maintains strong utility through community voting rights and in-world Penguin perks. Its evolution from NFT to coin is strategic—not accidental. That’s why it’s on this list. 4. Cat in Dog’s World: Rebel Energy in the Meme Market Cat in Dog’s World flips the canine-dominated meme space with pure rebel flair. In a space filled with Doges and Shibas, this token channels underdog—or undercat—energy. It’s got an aggressive token burn strategy and a strong staking model that rewards early adopters. The project’s branding is unapologetically sassy, giving it a unique edge that resonates with contrarian traders. That’s its purr-suasive advantage. 5. Popcat: Viral Speed, Feline Flex Remember that viral image of the cat rapidly chomping? That’s Popcat’s origin story, and it carries that chaotic meme energy into a real crypto token. Popcat leverages engagement contests that spike social volume—and its recent surge proves it’s more than a flash in the pan. With plans to integrate with meme NFT auctions, Popcat is turning taps into tokens. That agility earns it a place on the radar. 6. Bonk: Solana’s Barking Success Story Bonk was Solana’s first community token, and it barks loud for a reason. With lightning-fast transaction speeds and zero congestion, Bonk’s scalability is among the best in the meme coin world. It has become a darling of decentralized exchanges, and its recent partnerships within the Solana ecosystem only make it stronger. Bonk didn’t just bark its way into this list—it howled through the door. 7. Neiro: Meme Coin Meets AI Utility Neiro isn’t just riding the meme train; it’s combining meme culture with real-world AI utility. This token allows holders to stake for access to mini AI tools and services, making it both fun and functional. It’s targeting the productivity-meme crossover niche, a clever intersection that few others are exploring. Its dual purpose puts it ahead of the curve. 8. Dogwifhat: Whimsical Yet Wildly Effective What started as a hilarious meme turned into a cultural phenomenon. Dogwifhat is now gaining serious traction thanks to its low supply, loyal holders, and solid liquidity strategy. With meme vibes as strong as Shiba Inu but without the overinflated supply, Dogwifhat is proving that quirk can still conquer. It’s hats off to this quirky contender. 9. Memecoin: The OG Joke Turned Market Mainstay Memecoin embraces the very essence of meme investing—self-aware, deflationary, and hilariously meta. It’s designed to poke fun at crypto’s speculative nature while offering decent staking rewards and strong community incentives. Sometimes, the best way to survive a volatile market is to laugh your way through it. That’s why Memecoin remains a top pick. 10. Fartboy: Offensive, Ridiculous—and Profitable Fartboy is as crude as it sounds—but somehow, it works. What started as a toilet humor token now has its cult following, complete with themed games, NFT unlockables, and weekly “gas drop” events. It thrives on being outrageous, and that very outrageousness creates stickiness in an oversaturated market. That’s the gassy formula that earned it a spot. Final Verdict: Arctic Pablo Shines as the Best Meme Coin to Buy Now Based on the latest research, the best meme coins to buy now are: Arctic Pablo Coin, Banana for Scale, Pudgy Penguins, Cat in Dog’s World, Popcat, Bonk, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Memecoin, and Fartboy. But Arctic Pablo Coin stands at the summit—fueled by a deflationary supply, high-stakes competitions, and a ridiculously high ROI window. The timing is critical. With the current presale stage offering 1190.32% upside and analyst projections pushing that to 16,029.03%, this isn’t a casual opportunity. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now because it’s delivering on both community firepower and financial firepower. Blink—and that ROI could vanish like a snowflake on lava.

Currently priced at $0.00001288, the token has seen mixed reactions from traders, with some cautious over the decline – but others eyeing a bullish setup. That said, growing chatter in crypto circles suggests another project might be the next big narrative: MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising altcoin that is starting to attract serious capital during its presale phases. SHIB Bulls Maintain $0.000081 Target Despite the current downtrend, technical analysts remain optimistic. Prominent trader Javon Marks shared his updated chart projecting a 500%+ upside for SHIB if it breaks above key resistance. The target remains at $0.000081, with bullish patterns forming a structure similar to past breakout rallies. As past cycles show, SHIB has a history of sharp reversals when least expected—and this setup might be no different. New Challenger Enters the Arena While SHIB holds its place in the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building serious momentum behind the scenes. Its latest presale round is already outpacing the previous one, and investor demand shows no signs of slowing. Analysts expect fast traction and a more utility-driven ecosystem. Major returns are also expected, according to early projections based on presale metrics and anticipated listings. Strategic buyers are rushing in now, before the token becomes widely accessible. SHIB’s Technical Setup Signals Breakout Potential As for SHIB’s future, the current pattern suggests that once it clears its resistance, a steep run could follow. Marks’ chart highlights an “Accumulation-Bullish Zone” and prior reversal points that echo 2021’s run-up. If history repeats , SHIB could climb back into price discovery – fueled by whales re-entering and fresh retail enthusiasm. Conclusion: Shiba Inu still leads the memecoin space in market cap and recognition, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly closing in as a serious competitor. With analysts projecting breakout moves for both tokens, the smart money could be in riding the SHIB rebound—while also securing early exposure to MAGACOIN’s explosive presale momentum.

According to Bloomberg data, traders are nearly unanimous in predicting the cut, even as inflation recently clocked its fastest pace in 17 months. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) appears to be prioritizing recessionary risks over price pressures—unlike the US Federal Reserve, which left rates unchanged again this week. BOE weighs growth risks against inflation The BOE’s dovish stance comes on the back of two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction and a marked decline in hiring activity. Reacting to the Labour government’s first budget, employers have dialed back workforce expansion after being hit with a £26 billion ($34.5 billion) payroll tax hike and a sharp minimum wage increase. BOE Governor Andrew Bailey has repeatedly signaled a preference for gradual easing, maintaining that the inflation surge is likely temporary. Still, Thursday’s meeting will coincide with the release of a fresh set of quarterly forecasts—updated from May, when officials underestimated price momentum. “We think the central bank will be cautious about signaling more rate cuts are in the offing – inflation has surprised to the upside and price expectations are elevated,” said Dan Hanson, Chief UK Economist at Bloomberg Economics. Markets will be watching closely for any cues on the BOE’s bond portfolio plans. With the next quantitative tightening (QT) decision due in September, speculation is growing that the central bank might scale back active gilt sales amid recent volatility in long-dated UK bond yields. Global central banks diverge on rates as trade pressures mount The BOE isn’t the only central bank in action this week. Mexico’s Banxico is expected to deliver its ninth consecutive rate cut, bringing its benchmark rate to 7.75%, despite newly extended US tariffs. On the other hand, Lesotho’s central bank is forecast to reduce its rate to 6.75%, responding to severe export losses under the Trump administration’s trade policy. In contrast, the Czech Republic, Serbia, and Romania are holding steady rates in light of mixed inflation and fiscal signals. In the US, fresh trade data on Tuesday is expected to show a narrowing goods-and-services deficit for June, after months of import declines. Services PMI from ISM will also give insight into the strength of the largest segment of the American economy. The July jobs report disappointed markets, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell held rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty. With Fed Governor Adriana Kugler announcing her early resignation, attention is now turning to who the White House might tap to replace her—and potentially succeed Powell in May. Global markets react as trade tensions and inflation data drive rate decisions Across Asia, a flurry of economic reports will shed light on how the region is coping with Trump’s Aug. 1 tariff escalation. Inflation updates from South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand are expected to show mostly contained pressures, giving room for more rate cuts. The second-quarter GDP from Indonesia and the Philippines will be closely watched, while export data from Vietnam, Australia, and China may reflect pre-tariff acceleration. A key chip exporter, Taiwan, will cap the week with fresh trade figures. In Europe, industrial and trade reports from Germany, France, Italy, and Spain could lead to revisions in GDP. Eurostat confirmed 0.1% quarterly growth for the eurozone in Q2. Meanwhile, Switzerland faces fallout from Trump’s 39% tariff, and inflation is expected to remain at 0.1%. Swedish inflation is forecast to surge past 3% on the CPIF measure, likely delaying further monetary easing. In Turkey, inflation may ease to 34% annually despite new price hikes, while the central bank remains on track to cut rates in September. Mexico’s central bank is poised for a 25bps cut in Latin America, its ninth straight, amid slowing inflation. Brazil, by contrast, is expected to remain on hold at 15%, with easing not likely before 2026. Colombia, facing fiscal strain and sticky inflation, will release its quarterly inflation report and central bank minutes. At the same time, CPI data from Chile and Mexico will help shape the region’s policy outlook.

The token could reach as high as $62.54 in 2028. By 2031, DCR is expected to trade at a maximum price of $192.64. Decred (DCR) is making waves in the crypto world, focusing on security and scalability and giving its community a real say in decisions. In recent times, it rolled out updates like improved privacy features and upgrades to its decentralized exchange, DCRDEX, which caught the attention of many. Thanks to its unique mix of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, Decred has built a reputation as a solid and innovative project. Let’s examine how its latest moves and market trends might impact its price in the future. Overview Cryptocurrency Decred Token DCR Price $15.83 Market Cap $268.31M Trading Volume $3.85M Circulating Supply 16.93M DCR All-time High $250.02 (Apr 16, 2021) All-time Low $0.3948 Dec 28, 2016 24-h High $16.59 24-h Low $15.12 Decred price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 16.22 (2.74%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.60% 50-day SMA $ 15.68 14-Day RSI 46.50 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days $ 13.59 Decred price analysis: DCR shows signs of consolidation with a tight range between support and resistance range-bound movement DCR is stuck between $15.66 and $16.09, showing indecision and lack of clear momentum. Strong resistance at $16.09 multiple failed attempts to break $16.09 confirm strong seller presence. Support holding at $15.66 price consistently bounces from $15.66, signaling buyer interest at lower levels. August 2, 2025, Decred (DCR) is trading at $15.76, showing a 0.88% decline over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is currently moving sideways, caught between a strong resistance at $16.09 and support at $15.66. With no clear breakout, the price remains stable within this range. DCR is still down 93.68% from its all-time high of $250.02, reached on April 17, 2021, but it is up 3902.82% from its all-time low of $0.3948 set on December 28, 2016. Decred 1-day timeframe: DCR struggles to break resistance as consolidation continues The daily chart for Decred shows a tight trading band with no breakout in sight. The price ranges between $15.66 and $16.09, reflecting a clear lack of directional bias. Attempts to breach $16.09 have failed multiple times, indicating heavy resistance at that level. This level has become a short-term ceiling that bulls have yet to reclaim. DCR/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 50, showing no signs of bullish or bearish divergence. The MACD is flat, suggesting a pause in the trend. Unless volume and volatility pick up, DCR is likely to remain trapped in this range. A breakout or breakdown from this channel will likely dictate the direction of the short-term trend. Decred 4-hour timeframe: DCR price compression points to imminent move On the 4-hour chart, DCR is trading near the lower boundary of the range, with several failed wicks above $16.00 highlighting weak bullish momentum. Price has tested the resistance area multiple times but lacks the volume to sustain upward moves. DCR/USDT Chart: TradingView Support at $15.66 remains active, absorbing repeated sell-offs and forming a base. Price is compressing between lower highs and horizontal support, a pattern that often precedes a breakout. Market participants are likely awaiting a volume spike before committing to positions Decred technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 14.86 BUY SMA 5 $ 15.87 SELL SMA 10 $ 16.40 SELL SMA 21 $ 16.64 SELL SMA 50 $ 15.68 BUY SMA 100 $ 15.11 BUY SMA 200 $ 13.59 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 16.39 SELL EMA 5 $ 15.94 SELL EMA 10 $ 15.05 BUY EMA 21 $ 13.89 BUY EMA 50 $ 13.03 BUY EMA 100 $ 13.12 BUY EMA 200 $ 13.65 BUY What to expect from Decred Decred (DCR) remains range-bound, trading between $15.66 support and $16.09 resistance, with no strong directional bias in the short term. The tight consolidation on both the daily and 4-hour charts suggests that a breakout or breakdown is likely in the near future. Price compression and repeated tests of both support and resistance levels indicate that momentum is building behind the scenes. If buyers manage to push DCR above the $16.09 resistance, the next short-term target could extend toward $16.50–$17.00. However, failure to break this level and a drop below $15.66 could open the door to downside moves, possibly toward $15.20 or lower. For now, traders should watch for increased volume and volatility as signals for the next decisive move. Is Decred a good investment? Decred (DCR) is a project known for its hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake governance model, offering strong community involvement and decentralized decision-making. While the current price action shows limited short-term momentum, the long-term fundamentals remain intact, particularly for investors who value on-chain governance and sustainability in blockchain protocols. That said, with DCR still down over 93% from its all-time high, the token remains in a prolonged bear phase. Short-term traders may find opportunities in volatility, mainly if a breakout above $16.09 occurs. However, for long-term investors, whether DCR is a good investment depends heavily on one’s belief in the project’s technical direction, governance structure, and real-world utility within the evolving crypto ecosystem. In summary, Decred offers strong fundamentals but weak near-term price action. Caution is advised, and potential investors should consider broader market conditions and risk tolerance before entering. Recent News Alchemy Pay has partnered with Decred to make the $DCR token easily accessible to users in over 173 countries through traditional payment methods like Visa, Mastercard, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. This strategic integration aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and Web3 by allowing seamless fiat-to-crypto conversions, significantly lowering entry barriers for mainstream users. Known for its hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus and strong community governance, Decred is now positioned for broader adoption beyond the crypto-native audience. The move underscores Alchemy Pay’s commitment to expanding its ecosystem and driving global crypto adoption by supporting a growing array of digital assets. Will Decred reach $50? Yes, Decred is projected to reach $50. By 2028, forecasts predict a minimum price of $51.27, showing that DCR can potentially exceed $50 during its growth trajectory. Will Decred reach $100? Yes, Decred is anticipated to reach $100. According to predictions for 2030, the cryptocurrency could minimum at $111.21, indicating a strong possibility of surpassing the $100 mark. Does Decred have a good long-term future?

Recent market monitoring indicates BTC dipped below $112,000, trading at $111,964.01 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden downward movement sparks questions about the digital asset landscape’s immediate future. For both seasoned traders and new entrants, understanding these dynamics is crucial. What drives this downturn, and what might it signify for your portfolio? Let’s delve in. What Does the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for Investors? A Bitcoin price drop immediately ripples across the broader crypto ecosystem. As the largest digital asset, Bitcoin’s movements often dictate altcoin direction. When BTC declines, it typically pulls others down, leading to widespread portfolio adjustments and increased market anxiety. For investors, this means unrealized losses, especially for those who entered at higher prices. However, it also presents opportunities for strategic accumulation for long-term perspectives. Bitcoin is currently trading around $111,964.01. This level is a critical psychological and technical support. A sustained break below could signal further downward momentum, while a quick recovery indicates strong buying interest. The market is in flux, where every tick influences sentiment. Metric Value (Approx.) Significance Current Price $111,964.01 Recent trading level on Binance USDT. Previous Support Level $112,000 Key psychological and technical threshold. Market Sentiment Cautious/Bearish Driven by current downward price action. What Factors Contribute to a Bitcoin Price Drop? Several factors can trigger a significant Bitcoin price drop . Understanding these is essential for navigating crypto markets. It’s rarely a single cause, but a confluence of events. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global instability, inflation, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions lead investors to de-risk, selling speculative assets like crypto for safer havens. Regulatory Scrutiny: News of stricter regulations, bans, or increased tax pressures creates uncertainty and panic selling. Governments’ evolving stances significantly affect sentiment. Whale Movements: Large Bitcoin holders (“whales”) influence the market. A sudden large sale floods the market, causing rapid price decline. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: When key support levels break or bearish patterns emerge, trading systems and human traders sell, exacerbating downward pressure. The $112,000 level is a critical technical point. Negative News or FUD: “Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt” spreads rapidly. Reports of exchange hacks, project failures, or misinformation erode confidence and trigger sell-offs. How Have Past Bitcoin Price Drops Recovered? History provides context for a current Bitcoin price drop . Bitcoin has experienced numerous significant corrections and bear markets, only to recover and reach new all-time highs. These past cycles show the asset’s resilience and long-term adoption trends. For example, Bitcoin endured a massive bear market in 2018, falling from nearly $20,000 to around $3,000. In May 2021, it saw a substantial correction from its then-all-time high of over $60,000. In both instances, after consolidation, Bitcoin eventually regained upward momentum. This historical pattern suggests that while current dips are alarming, they are often part of Bitcoin’s volatile but generally upward long-term trajectory. Investors must differentiate between temporary corrections and fundamental market shifts. What Are Actionable Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Drop? Navigating a Bitcoin price drop requires a calm, strategic approach. Panic selling often leads to regret. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. This averages your purchase price, reducing volatility risk. Rebalance Your Portfolio: A downturn can be an opportune time to re-evaluate asset allocation. Adjust holdings to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. Conduct Thorough Research: Use this period to deepen understanding of your investments. Revisit whitepapers, assess development, and evaluate underlying technology. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders for active trading. For long-term investors, simply holding (“HODLing”) can be viable if conviction remains strong. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Follow reputable sources, but avoid constant market chatter. Focus on factual updates and long-term trends. What Does the Future Hold After This Bitcoin Price Drop? Predicting Bitcoin’s exact trajectory after a Bitcoin price drop is challenging, given the multitude of influencing factors. However, increasing institutional interest and broader adoption suggest underlying support even during volatility. Analysts will watch key metrics: trading volume, funding rates on perpetual futures, and macro indicators like inflation reports. A quick bounce back above $112,000 could indicate a false breakdown, while prolonged trading below this level might suggest further downside. Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains tied to its scarcity, decentralization, and increasing utility. The recent Bitcoin price drop serves as a potent reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. While unsettling, such dips are a normal part of asset cycles. For investors, the key is to approach these periods with a clear strategy, informed decisions, and a focus on long-term goals. By understanding causes, learning from history, and implementing sound risk management, one can navigate challenging times effectively and potentially position for future growth. The crypto journey is a rollercoaster; knowledge is your best seatbelt. The recent Bitcoin price drop is a common occurrence in crypto markets. Bitcoin Price Drop: Understanding the Recent Market Shock Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Price Drops Q1: Is this Bitcoin price drop a sign of a bear market? A: A single price drop doesn’t automatically signal a long-term bear market. It could be a short-term correction. A bear market is sustained downward trends over months. Q2: What should I do if my Bitcoin investment is losing value? A: Actions should align with your strategy. Options include holding, dollar-cost averaging, or rebalancing. Avoid emotional decisions. Q3: How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? A: Duration varies. Some corrections last days/weeks, others months. Historical data shows recoveries happen, but timelines are unpredictable. Q4: Can regulatory news cause a significant Bitcoin price drop? A: Yes, regulatory news is a major catalyst. New regulations, bans, or increased scrutiny can create uncertainty and fear, leading to rapid sell-offs and a notable Bitcoin price drop . Q5: Is it a good time to buy Bitcoin after a price drop? A: Many view a Bitcoin price drop as a “buy the dip” opportunity. However, it depends on your financial situation, risk appetite, and long-term outlook. Do your own research.

On Spartans.com, every user has access to a transparent activity log that covers both casino games and sportsbook wagers. It includes everything, settled bets, total winnings and losses, and crypto wallet transactions, all displayed in one easy-to-use dashboard. Whether you want to look back at your slot results or study your recent sports bets, Spartans gives you the tools to bet smarter. This step-by-step guide explains how to find and use your betting history and shows where to check if you’re eligible and ready to claim betting bonus rewards. Step 1: Log In & Head to Your Dashboard Start by logging into your Spartans account using your email and password. Once you’re in, go to your main dashboard. This is where you’ll manage your profile, crypto balance, and gameplay. Look for the betting history section, often labeled “History” or “My Activity.” Unlike sites that bury this info or require downloads, Spartans keeps it in one place. If you’re wondering how to claim betting bonus rewards, this section also shows your past deposits and wagers, key details in meeting bonus terms. Step 2: Use Filters to View Casino or Sportsbook Bets Inside your history page, Spartans lets you switch between casino and sportsbook logs. This is useful if you prefer one or want to review them separately. Casino history will show game names, amounts wagered, and individual outcomes. Sports history includes matches bet on, odds, stakes, and results. The option to view each type on its own helps you see where you’re winning, or losing. And for anyone checking how to claim betting bonus offers, these filters make it easier to find bets that qualify for promotions, like slots-only bonuses or sports bets with minimum odds. Step 3: Review Your Win & Loss Stats Spartans makes it easy to track your total wins and losses. Instead of manually calculating, your dashboard gives you a quick summary showing how much you’ve wagered and what your results are. This feature is perfect for managing risk and staying within your limits. It’s also a great tool if you’re following how to claim betting bonus guidelines that require you to reach a wagering goal, like a 10x playthrough. Seeing your progress in real time helps you stay focused. Step 4: Check Settled & Active Sports Bets If you bet on sports, Spartans splits your bets into two groups, settled and ongoing. Settled bets show the final result, payout, and odds. Ongoing bets update in real time as the event happens. This layout helps you stay on top of multiple wagers, especially if you’re betting live or managing parlays. And since some betting bonus offers are based on whether a bet is complete or not, this view helps you keep track of what qualifies and what’s still pending. Step 5: Track Crypto Activity & Wallet Movements Beyond bets, Spartans also records all wallet actions, deposits, withdrawals, bonuses, and deductions. Each transaction has a timestamp and wallet address (if relevant), so you know exactly what’s happening. If you’ve activated a bonus, like a welcome package or daily reward, checking how to claim betting bonus benefits depends on seeing when and how much was added. You’ll also find progress toward wagering requirements, which can help unlock withdrawals. Step 6: Use Your History to Adjust Your Strategy This tool isn’t just about tracking, it’s about improvement. For casino fans, it helps highlight which games are delivering the best returns. For sports bettors, it reveals what types of bets, sports, or leagues are paying off. Since every bet is time-stamped, you can analyze your results over different time frames, such as days, weeks, or months. If you’re serious about betting and bonuses, the betting history page supports both smart play and finding the best ways to claim betting bonus perks effectively. Wrapping Up Spartans.com gives you full access to your play history, from casino spins and sportsbook bets to all crypto wallet activity. With one clean, organized dashboard, players can manage their betting strategy and bonus rewards in one place. You can review trends, make better choices, and stay updated on promotion progress without switching screens or requesting reports. For players who want to stay in control and get the most out of every session, especially those looking into how to claim betting bonus offers, using the Spartans history tool is a must. On Spartans, transparency isn’t optional, it’s built in.

According to analysis from Perplexity AI, ADA could reach a value that would represent a 39x return from its current price of $0.7744—a move that would push the token well past its previous all-time high of $3.10. For traders seeking early exposure before the broader public catches on, this projection has sparked fresh optimism. At the time of writing, Cardano holds a market cap of $27.42 billion, ranking it as the 10th-largest crypto. While the token dipped nearly 6.7% over the past week, the bigger picture looks increasingly bullish as development ramps up and major events like the Midnight airdrop bring new attention to the ecosystem. A new altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has also started appearing on people’s radars for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward entries. Positioned as a politically-charged alternative to traditional memecoins, MAGACOIN is riding strong community momentum. With multiple presale rounds selling out in record time, analysts are now pointing to the project’s potential to deliver over 12,000% ROI . As the presale approaches its final stage, early buyers are rushing to secure a stake before the token lists on major exchanges. Why Analysts Are Still Bullish on ADA Despite recent dips, ADA has retained solid network growth and development activity. The upcoming upgrades in governance, scalability, and interoperability remain a central part of its roadmap. Combine that with rising speculation around potential U.S. ETF listings, and Cardano could be in the early stages of a new long-term accumulation phase. If ADA follows even a fraction of the AI model’s upper-bound forecast, a $5,000 position today could hypothetically reach nearly $195,000 by 2026 . Of course, those gains are far from guaranteed—but long-term holders are clearly betting on more than just hype. Conclusion Perplexity AI’s projection for Cardano reinforces growing confidence in its long-term potential . And as alternative tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE capture investor excitement with bold ROI targets and strong presale performance, the race for next-cycle gains is heating up.

However, this almost-certain event took a different turn after the price of ETH suddenly succumbed to severe bearish pressure. On Friday, August 1, the Ethereum price suffered a significant downturn, briefly falling below the $3,500 mark. While this has cast doubts on the likelihood of ETH returning above the psychological $4,000 level and perhaps reaching a new all-time high, recent on-chain indicators suggest that the “king of altcoins” might not be done just yet. ETH MVRV Ratio In 7-Year Downtrend In a Friday post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci said that the Ethereum price might still have something in the tank despite its struggles going into the weekend. This evaluation is based on the MVRV ratio, which measures the ratio between an asset’s market capitalization and realized capitalization. Related Reading: XRP Is Set To Move Trillions — Banking CEO Drops Bombshell On Ripple’s Role In Tokenizing Finance The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, as the name suggests, is typically used to evaluate whether a cryptocurrency (ETH, in this case) is overvalued or not. According to on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, an overvalued asset usually has an MVRV ratio greater than 3.7 while a ratio below 1 indicates undervaluation. Kesmeci explained in his post that the ETH MVRV has been in a downtrend since 2018 and may be close to breaking it. However, as shown in the chart, Ether’s MVRV recently suffered rejection at a long-term resistance level — which explains the level of profit-taking seen in the past few days. Nonetheless, Kesmeci still expects Ethereum to still break this seven-year resistance level, considering the institutional interest being enjoyed by ETH at the moment. For instance, as the on-chain analyst duly noted, the US-based spot ETH ETFs have seen a record amount of capital inflows in the past few weeks. As for the altcoin’s movement, Kesmeci expects the Ethereum price to resume its upward trend as long as the MVRV ratio stays above the 365-day simple moving average (white). If this remains the case, a return above $4,000 for the second-largest cryptocurrency might then come sooner rather than later. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $3,523, reflecting a 5% decline in the past 24 hours.

This remarkable ascent, reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at an astonishing $113,000 on the Binance USDT market. Such a significant leap in the Bitcoin price has captured the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts globally, sparking discussions about the underlying forces driving this incredible rally and what it signifies for the future of digital assets. What’s Driving This Astounding Bitcoin Price Rally? When the Bitcoin price makes such a dramatic move, it’s rarely due to a single factor. Instead, a confluence of market dynamics, investor sentiment, and broader economic trends often contributes to such a powerful surge. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking to comprehend the cryptocurrency landscape. Several key drivers could be propelling the Bitcoin price to these historic levels: Increased Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds increasingly view Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Their entry into the market, often through large-scale purchases, injects substantial capital and lends credibility, significantly impacting the Bitcoin price . Macroeconomic Factors: In an environment of global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and quantitative easing, investors often seek alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, is increasingly seen as ‘digital gold,’ offering a hedge against traditional market volatility and currency devaluation. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s supply is inherently limited to 21 million coins. Periodic ‘halving’ events, which reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are minted, create a scarcity effect. This fundamental economic principle of limited supply meeting rising demand naturally puts upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Growing Retail Interest: While institutional money is significant, sustained retail investor interest also plays a vital role. Easier access to cryptocurrency exchanges, growing awareness, and the allure of potential gains can lead to widespread buying, contributing to the overall market momentum and lifting the Bitcoin price . Technological Advancements and Ecosystem Growth: Continuous improvements in Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as the Lightning Network for faster transactions, and the expansion of the broader crypto ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs) make Bitcoin more usable and integrated into the digital economy, enhancing its perceived value. Here’s a summary of potential drivers impacting the Bitcoin price : Driver Category Impact on Bitcoin Price Institutional Demand Significant capital inflow, legitimacy boost Inflation Hedge Increased demand as a safe-haven asset Supply Scarcity Reduced new supply meets rising demand Retail Participation Broadens market participation and buying pressure Technological Progress Enhances utility and long-term viability Is This Bitcoin Price Momentum Sustainable? While the current surge in Bitcoin price is exhilarating, a common question among investors is whether this momentum can be sustained. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and periods of rapid appreciation are often followed by corrections. However, the context of this particular rally might offer insights into its potential longevity. Consider these points regarding the sustainability of the current Bitcoin price trajectory: Market Maturity: The cryptocurrency market is far more mature now than in previous bull runs. There are more robust regulatory frameworks (in some regions), sophisticated trading instruments, and a deeper understanding of digital assets among traditional financial players. This maturity could lead to more stable growth patterns, though volatility remains inherent. Long-Term Hodlers: A significant portion of Bitcoin’s supply is held by long-term investors (known as ‘hodlers’) who are less likely to sell during price fluctuations. This strong holding behavior reduces selling pressure during dips and supports the long-term upward trend of the Bitcoin price . Potential for Profit-Taking: Naturally, as the Bitcoin price reaches new highs, some investors will choose to realize their gains. This profit-taking can lead to temporary pullbacks or corrections. These are normal market cycles and do not necessarily indicate an end to the bull run but rather a healthy consolidation. Global Economic Landscape: If global economic policies continue to favor asset inflation or if traditional markets face ongoing challenges, Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge could persist, providing a fundamental tailwind for its price. Innovation and Adoption: Continued innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem and broader real-world adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments, remittances, and other applications will reinforce its utility and intrinsic value, supporting its long-term growth. While short-term fluctuations are always possible, the underlying fundamentals and growing acceptance of Bitcoin suggest a strong foundation for its continued relevance and potential long-term appreciation. The journey of the Bitcoin price is a testament to its evolving role in the global financial system. Navigating the Bitcoin Price Landscape: Tips for Investors For those considering entering the market or expanding their existing portfolios, understanding how to navigate the volatile yet promising landscape of the Bitcoin price is crucial. Here are some actionable insights to help you make informed decisions: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing any capital, thoroughly research Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Understand its technology, use cases, risks, and market dynamics. Rely on credible sources and avoid making decisions based solely on social media hype. 2. Understand Volatility: The Bitcoin price is known for its significant price swings. Be prepared for substantial ups and downs. Invest only what you can afford to lose, as there is always a risk of capital depreciation. 3. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a large sum at once, consider investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the Bitcoin price . This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility and can lead to a lower average purchase price over time. 4. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a dominant force, it is wise to diversify your investment portfolio. This could include other cryptocurrencies, traditional assets like stocks or bonds, or real estate. Diversification helps spread risk and can protect your overall portfolio from significant losses if one asset class underperforms. 5. Secure Your Investments: Use reputable exchanges and strong, unique passwords. Consider using hardware wallets for larger holdings to enhance security. Be vigilant against phishing scams and other cybersecurity threats that target cryptocurrency holders. 6. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency market evolves rapidly. Keep up-to-date with market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Subscribing to reputable crypto news outlets and following expert analyses can provide valuable insights into the future of the Bitcoin price and the broader market. 7. Long-Term Perspective: Many successful Bitcoin investors adopt a long-term perspective. While short-term trading can be profitable for some, holding Bitcoin for several years often proves to be a more effective strategy for capital growth, allowing you to ride out market corrections and benefit from its overall upward trend. By adopting these principles, investors can approach the dynamic world of the Bitcoin price with greater confidence and a clearer strategy, aiming for sustainable engagement rather than reactive decisions. The astonishing rise of Bitcoin price to $113,000 marks a new chapter in crypto history. Bitcoin Price: Unveiling the Astounding Surge Above $113,000 The astonishing surge of the Bitcoin price above $113,000 is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of the growing mainstream acceptance and intrinsic value of digital assets. This milestone underscores Bitcoin’s resilience, its increasing role as a hedge against economic instability, and its potential to reshape the global financial landscape. While the journey of any asset, especially one as dynamic as Bitcoin, will always involve fluctuations, the current trajectory is a compelling testament to its enduring appeal and transformative power. As the world continues to embrace digital innovation, Bitcoin remains at the forefront, charting a course towards an exciting and potentially prosperous future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does it mean for the Bitcoin price to reach $113,000? Reaching $113,000 signifies a massive increase in the Bitcoin price , reflecting extremely strong market demand, increased investor confidence, and potentially a major shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. It represents a significant psychological and financial milestone. 2. What are the primary factors contributing to such a high Bitcoin price? Key factors include heightened institutional investment, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, its fixed and decreasing supply (due to halving events), growing retail interest, and continuous advancements in its underlying technology and ecosystem. 3. Is the current Bitcoin price sustainable, or should I expect a correction? While volatility is inherent in the crypto market, the current surge is supported by more mature market conditions and strong long-term holder sentiment. Short-term corrections are always possible as investors take profits, but the underlying fundamentals suggest potential for sustained growth in the Bitcoin price over the long term. 4. How can I invest in Bitcoin safely given its high price? To invest safely, conduct thorough research, understand the risks associated with volatility, consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate price swings, diversify your investment portfolio, and prioritize securing your assets using reputable exchanges and hardware wallets. 5. What role does institutional adoption play in the Bitcoin price? Institutional adoption plays a crucial role by bringing significant capital into the market and enhancing Bitcoin’s legitimacy. When large financial entities invest, it signals confidence, attracts more investors, and can lead to substantial upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Did you find this article insightful?

Despite periodic surges, the token remains shackled by the uncertainty surrounding its status, causing many traders to rethink their long-term strategies. As institutional and retail sentiment gravitates toward compliance-driven platforms offering genuine DeFi utility, a new contender is quietly gaining traction— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Defi Solution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance is emerging as a next-generation DeFi solution tailored for modern lending markets. At its core, it is a non-custodial protocol that enables users to lend blue-chip assets or borrow against them using overcollateralized smart contracts. For instance, a user locking $20,000 in ETH as collateral can instantly receive an overcollateralized loan in stablecoins, without any intermediaries. This setup offers borrowers immediate liquidity while preserving upside exposure to their held assets. What makes the ecosystem even more attractive is its automated interest rate structure. The borrowing costs and lending APYs dynamically shift based on the platform’s utilization rate. In the case of a P2C (Peer-to-Contract) setup, lenders providing USDT or DAI to the protocol are set to earn auto-adjusting APYs depending on liquidity demand. One clear example: a lender depositing $8,000 in USDT at 15% APY would earn $1,200 over 12 months, completely passively. Meanwhile, mtTokens—interest-bearing ERC-20 tokens issued 1:1 for each deposit—can be used or staked for additional rewards. As yields accrue automatically in these tokens, users benefit from uninterrupted compounding without needing to micromanage. Presale Entry at $0.035 Before Price Hikes and Major Catalysts Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at just $0.035, with 10% of the 170 million allocated tokens already claimed. The urgency to get in at this level is growing rapidly as the next price jump will raise it to $0.040—a clean 15% gain for early movers. With the listing price locked in at $0.06 and strong projections based on the protocol’s lending utility and passive yield generation, price appreciation toward $0.24 by Q1 2026 represents a 600% return for those entering now. Adding to its appeal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance plans to launch with beta functionality already integrated, ensuring immediate utility for participants. Unlike other tokens that debut with no product and delayed roadmaps, users are expected to engage with the protocol from day one—boosting both liquidity and demand. Security is a cornerstone of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. The platform is backed by a detailed CertiK audit featuring a Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. In parallel, a $50,000 bug bounty campaign remains active, encouraging ongoing scrutiny from white-hat developers and blockchain security experts. This level of transparency and preemptive security preparation is increasingly essential in the evolving regulatory climate. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance introduces an innovative buyback and dividend mechanism. Revenue generated by the protocol is earmarked for MUTM token buybacks, which will be redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens in the smart contracts. This aligns protocol success directly with user returns, reinforcing long-term commitment and minimizing token sell pressure. Layer-2 Integration The protocol’s upcoming Layer-2 integration is also expected to dramatically reduce gas fees while scaling throughput—critical components for sustaining long-term user growth and high-frequency lending transactions. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and growing community support, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already has over 12,000 followers on Twitter and continues to draw thousands of new eyes during this presale window. Traders looking for the next high-utility DeFi play with real product delivery, transparent risk management, and yield-generating mechanisms are increasingly rotating into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance. Given XRP’s continued regulatory ambiguity and its limited on-chain use case beyond remittances, MUTM’s multi-pronged DeFi model offers a clearer path to sustainable value. Analysts projecting a 10x to 14x return post-listing are basing their forecasts not on hype, but on utility adoption, platform usage, and an already-engaged investor base—over 14,700 holders and $13.7 million raised so far. With 90% of Phase 6 tokens still available and a $100,000 giveaway live—rewarding ten lucky users with $10,000 worth of MUTM each—the window for strategic positioning is still open, but not for long. Once Phase 7 begins, the price will rise, and the chance to ride the DeFi resurgence from the ground floor will shrink rapidly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token chasing trends—it’s a protocol being built for performance, resilience, and yield. For those seeking the next breakout star in decentralized finance, it’s time to shift the focus from courtroom drama to protocol-driven momentum.

As momentum builds across several emerging projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly entered the spotlight for savvy traders searching for high-upside plays before major exchange listings. XRP’s Legacy Sets the Standard XRP’s meteoric rise from pennies to multiple dollars set a precedent for what’s possible when institutional interest meets real-world utility. Despite legal battles and regulatory uncertainty, XRP remains one of the most recognized names in crypto. The token saw over 63,000% gains during its most explosive cycle—transforming modest holdings into life-changing fortunes . Many early XRP holders still credit that moment as their biggest crypto win. Now, speculation is growing that a new wave of utility-driven altcoins could follow a similar trajectory—and some analysts believe the next XRP-style story may already be unfolding. The Trending Project That is Gaining Traction Faster Than Expected One altcoin project drawing attention for its rapid acceleration is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which recently entered a high-demand presale phase. Investor models suggest major returns if current momentum continues—sparking comparisons to XRP entry points. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its community-fueled growth, combined with a real utility roadmap focused on expanding holder rewards and strategic integrations. The current presale round is almost fully subscribed, and multiple rounds have already sold out within hours , indicating massive demand from early adopters. Is It Really the “Next XRP”? While no project can perfectly replicate XRP’s path, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing some of the same early signs—explosive presale activity, community-driven hype, and market positioning that hints at potential listing on top-tier platforms. Crypto strategists point to these markers as typical precursors to major price runs. With presale prices still low , traders see this as a narrow window of opportunity before a broader launch inflates the entry cost. Conclusion As crypto markets warm up again, investors are eager to secure positions in projects that mirror XRP’s breakout years. While XRP paved the way, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fresh opportunity with real upside , especially for those who act before mainstream attention catches on.

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Algorand Symbol ALGO Current Algorand price $0.2261 Market cap $1.96B Trading volume $96.52M Circulating supply 8.69B All-time high $3.28 on Jun 21, 2019 All-time low $0.08761 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $0.2403 24-hour low $0.224 Algorand price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 18.25% 50-day SMA $0.2209 200-day SMA $0.1856 Sentiment Neutral Green days 17/30 (57%) Fear and Greed Index 55 (Greed) Algorand price analysis: ALGO faces resistance at $0.3 On Aug 2, ALGO’s price recovered by 23.18% in the last 30 days but dropped 4.57% in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume dropped by 26.43% in 24 hours to $96.18 M, signaling falling interest from traders. Algorand’s total value locked (TVL) dropped by 3.27% in 24 hours to $72.29M. Algorand 1-day chart analysis ALGOUSD chart by TradingView Algorand broke out upwards in July, a move that was accompanied by rising volatility. On July 15, it crossed into overbought territory. At its highest, it reached $0.34, a level last registered in February. The uptrend reversed into August as technicals pointed to profit-taking following a market overextension. ALGO faced rejection at $0.30 (near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.2959). The MACD histogram points to rising negative momentum. Algorand 4-hour chart analysis ALGOUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights ALGO’s rejection at $0.30. The level remains critical to whether it will continue with the earlier bull run. At current levels, the candles are short, typical of an indecisive market. Its volatility has also risen, but the momentum remains bearish.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO isneutral, with the fear and greed index showing a greed sentiment among investors. Price analysis shows a consolidating market after facing resistance at $0.3. Recent news Robinhood and Gemini exchanges recently launched tokenized stocks, sparking investor interest in this new type of asset. Against this backdrop, the blockchain chosen by issuers could become a fresh opportunity for investors. Right now, Algorand commands over 66% of the market share. However, the picture of market share in tokenized stocks could change if this trend keeps gaining momentum. Why is ALGO up? Algorand turned bullish last month as altcoins continued to outperform Bitcoin. Algorand, however, faced resistance at $30. Algorand’s rising RWA adoption also contributed to the rise. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.3313. The average price for the period will be $0.2500. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term.

Algorand historic price sentiment ALGO price chart by CoinGecko Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June. It crossed into August, trading at $0.22.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-03 01:55:00

However, a downward adjustment is expected on August 9, with projections pointing to a roughly 3% decrease, bringing difficulty down to 123.7 trillion, according to data from CoinWarz. Currently, the average block time sits at approximately 10 minutes and 20 seconds, slightly above the protocol’s 10-minute target. Difficulty adjustments help bring this time back in line by responding to changes in the total computing power, or hashrate, dedicated to mining. CryptoQuant data shows that mining difficulty declined throughout June, hitting a low of 116.9 trillion in early July. However, the trend reversed in late July, resuming the long-term upward trajectory tied to increased miner participation. Bitcoin’s soaring stock-to-flow ratio signals rising scarcity Bitcoin mining difficulty measures how hard it is for miners to find a valid hash for the next block. It adjusts every 2,016 blocks —roughly every two weeks—to maintain a steady block time of around 10 minutes, regardless of changes in network hashrate. When difficulty rises, mining becomes more expensive and less profitable unless BTC’s price also climbs. A drop in difficulty, on the other hand, offers miners short-term relief by making rewards easier to earn with the same equipment. Mining difficulty and network hashrate are critical not just for security but also for maintaining Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio —a key measure of scarcity. This ratio compares the existing supply of an asset to the rate of new supply entering the market. A high stock-to-flow ratio indicates that new production has a minimal impact on the overall supply, helping preserve price stability. BTC’s stock-to-flow ratio is currently higher than gold’s, making it “twice as scarce,” according to PlanB, the analyst who developed the stock-to-flow pricing model. With about 94% of its capped 21 million BTC already mined, Bitcoin boasts an estimated stock-to-flow ratio of 120, compared to gold’s 60. Silver, by contrast, was historically demonetized partly due to its much lower stock-to-flow ratio. When silver prices rise, more supply floods the market, pushing prices back down—a phenomenon Bitcoin is designed to resist. Bitcoin’s self-adjusting difficulty keeps block production steady and supply predictable Bitcoin’s protocol includes automatic difficulty adjustments roughly every two weeks. When more miners join the network and the hashrate rises, mining becomes harder, slowing down block production until the difficulty adjusts. The opposite happens when the hashrate drops—the difficulty is reduced to keep the average block interval close to 10 minutes. This mechanism ensures that BTC’s issuance remains predictable and avoids sudden supply shocks that could trigger market volatility. By adjusting the difficulty of matching available computing resources, the protocol maintains the assets’ inelasticity to production—one of the key attributes underpinning Bitcoin’s value proposition as “digital gold.” Bitcoin slips as Kimchi premium returns As mining difficulty prepares for a potential drop, Bitcoin’s price remains under pressure. Bitcoin slipped 3%, hitting an intraday low of $112,680, then bounced back. By 7:30 pm ET, BTC was at $113,375. South Korea was once again at a premium—$113,987, 0.84% higher than the global average—and the Kimchi premium was back after a nearly month-long absence. This premium often means rising domestic demand or region-specific regulatory issues. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin has a 61.4% market share.

BlockDAG is an exception. With $359 million raised, over 2.5 million users, and a presale approaching its final stage, BlockDAG has already attracted 4,500+ developers — and over 300 dApps are in progress. This early traction isn’t accidental. By offering EVM compatibility, a low-code contract builder, and live access to its testnet, BlockDAG has created an environment where developers can build now, rather than wait for post-launch tools. Combined with grants, hackathons, and upcoming DeFi infrastructure, the network is positioning itself as a serious builder-first ecosystem. Here’s why developers are choosing BlockDAG — even before its token, BDAG, is publicly traded. EVM Compatibility = Easy Onboarding BlockDAG is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) . That means smart contracts written in Solidity — the most widely used language in blockchain — can be ported directly to BlockDAG with little or no modification. For developers, this offers a zero-friction migration path . Tools like MetaMask, Remix, and Hardhat already work out of the box. Existing dApps, especially DeFi and NFT platforms, can deploy on BlockDAG and tap into higher transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Ethereum. This is key for adoption. Instead of competing with Ethereum, BlockDAG extends its ecosystem , giving developers familiar infrastructure with new performance capabilities . To further broaden participation, BlockDAG offers a low-code smart contract builder — a drag-and-drop interface for creating and deploying contracts without writing full code. This tool lowers the barrier for Web2 developers , entrepreneurs, and creators new to blockchain. With templates for token creation, staking, governance, and NFTs , BlockDAG enables fast prototyping and deployment. By reducing complexity, BlockDAG turns potential builders into active contributors , expanding the pool of dApp creators and driving faster ecosystem growth. Testnet Access and Early Builder Incentives BlockDAG’s live testnet allows developers to deploy and test smart contracts, validate transaction throughput, and explore node operations. The network processes up to 10 blocks per second , powered by a hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work model , delivering both scalability and security . To support builders, BlockDAG has rolled out developer grants and hackathons , with a goal to fund 1,000 dApps by 2026 . These incentives ensure that early developers are not only experimenting, but also funded to build at scale . Combined with a transparent six-week launch plan , developers know when tools will go live and how to integrate BDAG into their projects — from staking to DeFi. Beyond smart contracts, BlockDAG offers real infrastructure: Cold Wallet integration for secure token storage and dApp access X1 mobile miner app with 2.5M+ users for on-chain utility Demo Trading Platform with live BDAG purchases and demo sell features 20+ exchange listings confirmed post-launch This means dApps built on BlockDAG will launch into an ecosystem with real users , liquidity , and utility tools already active — not just promises. Developers Are Already Betting on BlockDAG BlockDAG is still in its presale phase, but for developers, it already offers the toolkit, audience, and incentives needed to build and scale. With 4,500+ developers onboard and growing, the ecosystem is taking shape before mainnet , ensuring a vibrant launch environment. In a space where many projects launch with empty chains, BlockDAG’s early focus on builder enablement may prove its most strategic move yet. For developers, the signal is clear: BlockDAG isn’t waiting — and neither are they.

With Bitcoin hovering below $116K and Ethereum settling after its ETF rally, many traders are rotating capital into high-potential plays. XRP is holding ground near $3.20, Solana just pushed above $200 following a network boost, and Dogecoin is aiming to reclaim $0.25 after a sharp correction. Yet, one standout doesn’t come from speculation; it comes from turning crypto use into daily value. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) isn’t just another storage tool. It gives users cashback for every action on-chain. Whether you’re holding, trading, or bridging, these are the best bullish cryptos of August worth watching. Each of them is gaining traction for a reason: utility, upgrades, or, in Cold Wallet’s case, delivering returns on what users already do every day. 1. Cold Wallet: Earn Every Time You Use Crypto In crypto, the cost of using your wallet can quickly add up. Gas fees, swaps, and transfers often feel like penalties. Cold Wallet flips this by rewarding users for every transaction. When you pay gas or swap tokens, you get cashback in CWT. The token is still in presale at just $0.00942, with a confirmed launch price of $0.35171 and future projections targeting $2. That combination of utility and upside is what puts Cold Wallet among the best bullish cryptos of August. The system is tier-based, holds more CWT, unlock better rewards. Bronze starts at 10% cashback, while Diamond users can earn up to 100% on gas. There’s no staking required and no token lockups. The presale includes 40% of the total 10 billion token supply, with a structured 150-stage rollout that increases the price at each stage. And since the wallet is already live and paying out USDT for referrals, this isn’t just theory; it’s working now. Cold Wallet is built to reward activity, not speculation, and that’s what makes it a smart, utility-driven pick this month. 2. Solana (SOL): Price Recovery & Network Growth Solana’s performance has turned heads. After consolidating under $180 for weeks, it surged to $197–$200+ following a 20% boost to block compute capacity through a recent upgrade. That improved throughput to 60 million compute units, making the network more attractive for large-scale applications. A $331 million purchase by Upexi, involving 1.8 million SOL, added fuel to the rally. Despite a 9.5% pullback on August 23 due to over $30 million in liquidations, SOL’s structure remains bullish. Chart patterns like the inverse head-and-shoulders and cup-and-handle formations are pointing to further movement, possibly toward $223 if support holds above $185. Analyst projections range from $400 to $700, with some even suggesting a $1,000 future target. Solana’s speed, ecosystem growth, and institutional appeal are keeping it firmly among the best bullish cryptos of August. 3. XRP: Price Support & ETF Expansion XRP has been making moves this month. After peaking near $3.57, it corrected to around $3.18, largely due to a $175 million transfer by Ripple’s co-founder that unsettled some investors. Still, technical support remains intact, with analysts targeting $5 to $6 before year-end. The ETF narrative is pushing XRP even further. A ProShares Ultra XRP ETF is now live, and U.S. regulatory updates are making institutional adoption more viable. Chart patterns are also showing strength. Bullish flags and SMA crossovers on the weekly chart suggest another breakout could be forming. Some analysts are pointing to a long-term target of $15. XRP stays on the list of best bullish cryptos of August for its clear fundamentals: liquidity, rising institutional engagement, and strong chart setups. It’s not just surviving the cycle, it’s building momentum with serious backing. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still Holding Momentum & Attention Dogecoin entered August strong, climbing from $0.255 to $0.271 before dipping back to the $0.24 range. That 11% drop hasn’t pushed it out of focus, especially as institutional players accumulated more than 1.08 billion DOGE, around $250 million worth. Volume also surged, confirming continued interest even during corrections. DOGE is now testing support at $0.23, but analysts are watching for a bounce to $0.25–$0.28. A move above $0.30 could shift sentiment quickly. ETF chatter is still speculative, but growing. Short-term forecasts range from $0.35 to $0.70, and some stretch to the $1 mark if market sentiment aligns. DOGE stays listed among the best bullish cryptos of August, not just for its meme status, but for its ability to capture liquidity, trading volume, and institutional flows when momentum returns. Choosing Among the Best Bullish Cryptos This month, altcoins are setting their own pace. XRP is building institutional pathways, Solana is scaling and performing technically, and Dogecoin is still drawing serious attention with high-volume moves. But Cold Wallet offers a different path. It doesn’t rely on speculation; it rewards your actions. With cashback already live, a presale entry at $0.00942, and a planned launch at $0.35171, the potential return is clear. The future $2 target adds even more incentive. If you’re exploring the best bullish cryptos of August, focus on tokens delivering real value. Cold Wallet pays you to use crypto. XRP is gaining strength through ETFs. Solana is scaling effectively, and DOGE still knows how to move the market. Among these, Cold Wallet stands out as the only one that rewards you with every single click.

With Bitcoin consolidating and sentiment shifting back toward high-growth assets, eyes are turning to mid-cap tokens that could explode in the coming weeks. Urgency is building—final slots in select presales and early positions are vanishing fast, as capital flows into projects that offer both upside and narrative strength. One of the tokens drawing quiet but growing interest is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to gain traction among early-stage investors. As crypto momentum builds, this lesser-known project is getting flagged for its huge potential . SUI’s Technicals Flash Oversold, Reversal Possible SUI, currently trading around $3.78, has retraced slightly after topping near $4.50 earlier this month. The 2-hour RSI shows readings near 31.62, suggesting short-term oversold conditions. This aligns with a pattern seen in prior rallies, where RSI dips below 35 have led to sharp price recoveries. Market cap remains solid at $13.08 billion, with daily trading volume over $1.38 billion, reflecting strong interest even during pullbacks. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Early-Stage Buzz While many traders are chasing already-pumped tokens, early entrants are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely. The project has seen presale engagement surge, with final slots expected to fill quickly. Backed by a politically energized community and a growing roadmap of utilities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining comparisons to the most successful projects in the space. Urgency grows as investors look to lock in allocations before listings hit major exchanges, potentially opening the door for massive ROI for early adopters . Toncoin Shows Strength After Breakout Toncoin, trading at $3.33, has quietly climbed over the past week with a 4.47% gain, outperforming broader altcoin indexes. Its RSI remains balanced around 57.34, showing healthy momentum without overbought signals. With a market cap now over $8 billion and rising interest following recent ecosystem updates, Toncoin is being positioned as one of the more stable bets in the current altcoin rotation. Continued bullish price action above $3.20 could reinforce its uptrend. Conclusion: This Altcoin Rotation May Be Just Getting Started With traders shifting out of stagnant tokens and into high-potential altcoins , the window for early gains is narrow. SUI’s oversold reading, TONcoin’s price strength, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapidly filling presale are flashing opportunity signals for those ready to act. As the market wakes up, the biggest returns may favor those who enter just before the next wave hits.

Altcoin season may be on the horizon, and historically, this is when early movers see the highest returns . One presale making waves right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has eclipsed all previous cycles in demand, drawing major attention from early-stage investors. 1. Stake and Earn While You Sleep Staking remains one of the most popular ways to generate passive income in crypto. Platforms like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) offer 4% to 8% annual yields for simply locking your tokens and helping secure their networks. With easy-to-use wallets like Daedalus and Phantom, even beginners can stake safely and watch their holdings grow over time. 2. Participate in Presales and IDOs Getting in early through presales and IDOs can offer 10x to 100x potential returns—if you choose wisely. Successful projects tend to have transparent tokenomics, a clear roadmap, and an active community. Launchpads like DAO Maker and CoinList are common places to discover these early opportunities before the tokens hit public markets. This Presale Is Breaking Records for Investor Demand In the current wave of altcoin opportunities, one presale is standing out from the pack. The ongoing round has already surpassed all previous cycles in participation, with investor interest hitting new highs. Community momentum continues to build, and some analysts are projecting that $2,100 invested today could potentially grow to $25,000 —a bold sign of what could come next if early demand sustains. 3. Hunt for Airdrops Crypto airdrops have proven time and time again to be incredibly lucrative. Users who interacted with platforms like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet were rewarded with thousands of dollars in free tokens. Staying active on Ethereum Layer 2s, bridging assets, and using emerging dApps are often key to qualifying for these giveaways. 4. Accumulate During Dips Volatility is a feature of crypto, not a bug. Many seasoned investors use dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to accumulate during downturns. This strategy helps reduce risk while steadily building positions—especially in altcoins that are down but not out. Timing the bottom isn’t necessary when you’re focused on the long game. Conclusion: Crypto is full of profit potential—but it rewards those who act early and think smart. Whether you’re staking, catching airdrops, or diving into presales, the real gains go to those who prepare before the hype hits. With MAGACOIN FINANCE smashing previous demand records , many believe it’s the most promising presale in the market right now—and potentially one of the best-positioned altcoins heading into the next bull run .

With Ethereum approaching the $4,000 mark and Solana hovering near $180, investors are comparing the two for leadership in the next bullish leg. But while these giants battle for dominance, another project—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is quietly drawing early-stage attention for those looking beyond the obvious names. Ethereum Shows Strength Into Q3 Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at $3,801, up 1.48% in the past 24 hours and 5.42% over the last week. The token’s momentum is being fueled by surging institutional interest, with over $5.4 billion in ETF inflows recorded this month. On-chain data also shows aggressive whale accumulation, with large holders scooping up more than $4 billion in ETH. The rally has been steady, supported by solid fundamentals and a favorable technical setup. RSI indicators remain balanced, showing room for growth without signaling overbought conditions. As a result, Ethereum is once again being positioned as the altcoin market’s pace-setter. Away from the headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own breakout story. The project’s current presale round has eclipsed all previous cycles in demand , with retail and strategic buyers moving in rapidly. Investors are already eyeing amazing returns if the growth curve mirrors early-stage altcoin cycles like SHIBA or PEPE. As major exchange listings loom, access is tightening fast, making early entry more urgent than ever. Solana Faces Pullback After Strong Rally Solana (SOL), now trading at $179.42, is down nearly 6% on the week, even as its long-term chart remains bullish. The RSI reading is slipping below 37, often a sign of oversold conditions, though no strong rebound has formed yet. SOL had previously pushed above $200 but has since retreated as traders rotated profits elsewhere. Despite its drop, Solana maintains a sizable market cap of $96.5 billion, keeping it firmly in the large-cap category. Still, in the current cycle, Solana is showing less resilience compared to Ethereum’s sustained strength. Conclusion In summary, Ethereum appears to be regaining its leadership role thanks to strong ETF inflows and growing institutional demand. Solana, while still relevant, is showing signs of cooling in the short term. But for those seeking explosive potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about presale opportunities this year —mirroring the kind of early interest that preceded some of crypto’s biggest success stories .

This Altcoin Could Deliver 34x Returns,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-to-10-this-altcoin-could-deliver-34x-returns/,"XRP is back in the spotlight after an explosive rally in July pushed the token above $3.10 for the first time in years. With renewed optimism surrounding the long-awaited ETF decision and legal clarity slowly emerging, investors are now wondering whether $10 is finally on the horizon. Some analysts believe it is. Major investment newsletters have started calling XRP one of the few legacy altcoins with enough liquidity and momentum to make a serious move in this cycle. While Bitcoin takes a breather, XRP is quietly building strength with growing whale activity and steady volume near $7 billion a day. This comes as MAGACOIN FINANCE begins attracting attention from savvy investors looking to diversify before the next big breakout . XRP’s Path to $10 The token’s latest breakout saw a vertical rise from under $2.00 to over $3.60 before settling near the $3.13 range. This performance has reignited talk of XRP reaching double digits—a feat that would require a 3x from current levels. With ETF speculation heating up and the token now a confirmed participant in the upcoming Midnight airdrop, the momentum could build quickly. Why This New Contender Is Gaining Traction While XRP commands headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building something big in the background. With 34x reward potential flagged by multiple top-tier newsletters, the token is becoming a standout in early-stage investing circles. What’s fueling the buzz is not just hype—it’s performance. The most recent presale round closed in record time, and analysts are pointing to the fastest growth curve since the early days of SHIBA INU. For investors who missed previous cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being framed as the comeback opportunity . Will XRP Sustain Its Momentum? Despite the strong rally, XRP still faces resistance around $3.60 and psychological pressure near the $5 mark. However, the technical structure remains bullish, and several macro catalysts—including regulatory announcements and institutional inflows—could tilt sentiment sharply. If the current pace holds, a $10 target by late Q4 2025 isn’t out of the question. Conclusion XRP has reentered the race with strong tailwinds, and investor optimism is rising. But for those chasing bigger upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its 34x return potential and explosive presale data. With early access windows closing fast, smart money is moving quickly to get in before the next leg up.

Recent charts reveal Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) and Stellar (XLM) as two standout performers—boasting gains of around 300%. Both projects have seen a major technical rebound, supported by a surge in monthly RSI and strong community momentum. As crypto analysts highlight these top movers, investor attention is also turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising project gaining traction following a recent blockchain audit that ranked it among the safest plays in the altcoin space . Hedera Hashgraph Sees Technical Breakout Hedera (HBAR) has surged over 71% this month alone, breaking above $0.25 for the first time since its 2022 slump. Its long-term chart shows a strong reversal pattern, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has jumped to 61.91, suggesting bullish momentum may continue. Volume has been rising, reinforcing the view that HBAR may be setting up for a bigger rally. With a 304% return YTD, Hedera is quickly returning to the spotlight. New Contender Gets the Spotlight Following a successful blockchain audit that confirmed its code security and smart contract integrity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a top-tier safety play in the altcoin sector. The audit fueled a fresh wave of investor confidence, sparking one of the most active weeks of new wallet creation and presale participation to date. With strong momentum, expanding utility, and a fast-growing community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a high-reward option backed by strong fundamentals. Those securing a presale position now are getting in before the next wave of listings—where price discovery could push returns to record levels. Stellar’s Rebound Mirrors HBAR’s Rise Stellar (XLM) has also posted a massive recovery, jumping to $0.40 and clocking a 296% gain from its cycle lows. Its RSI is nearly identical to Hedera’s at 61.83, suggesting that bullish sentiment is not limited to one project. After years of quiet development, Stellar is now reclaiming investor attention as the network’s low fees and cross-border capabilities attract new use cases. Conclusion: The resurgence of HBAR and XLM is not just about past performance—it’s a sign that smart capital is flowing into high-utility projects with upside still ahead.

This new product allows everyday users to participate in SHIB-linked rewards programs designed to shorten tenures and increase returns—especially as SHIB’s utility and adoption continue to expand globally. This development comes amid growing interest in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which has evolved from its initial meme coin into a broader decentralized platform with its own Layer 2 blockchain, NFT projects, and expanding payment integrations. By offering structured contracts centered around SHIB, DLMining aims to provide users with easier access to one of the most sought-after and accessible digital assets on the market. Learn more about Shiba Inu Coin Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, Shiba Inu Coin is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB has evolved from its humble beginnings as a meme coin into a decentralized ecosystem supported by a large and active community, the ShibArmy. SHIB consistently ranks among the highest-valued cryptocurrencies, with millions of holders worldwide. With this continued interest, DLMining ‘s newly launched SHIB-based contracts aim to provide users with a simplified way to participate in the asset’s short-term potential without having to navigate a complex trading environment. Broader Ecosystem Shiba Inu now forms the foundation of a broader ecosystem, including: LEASH: Originally a rebase token, LEASH has been repositioned as a store of value within the Shiba ecosystem. Its limited supply of 107,646 tokens has attracted significant investor interest. ShibaSwap: Launched in 2021, ShibaSwap allows users to stake SHIB, redeem it for cryptocurrencies, and earn passive rewards, helping to differentiate SHIB from other meme tokens. Shibarium: The team launched Shibarium in 2023, a Layer 2 blockchain designed to reduce gas fees and increase transaction speeds. The platform currently supports a growing number of DApps, NFTs, and DeFi integrations, enhancing the overall utility of SHIB. With these developments, SHIB’s use cases continue to expand. Platforms like DLMining are building this ecosystem by enabling contract-based participation that is closely tied to SHIB’s evolving role. Market Overview – July 2025 As of the end of July 2025, key SHIB metrics include: Price: $0.00001875 Market Cap: ~$7.5 billion 24-hour Trading Volume: ~$1.14 trillion Total Supply: 1 quadrillion (a significant portion has been burned) Market momentum remains stable in 2025, thanks to SHIB’s comprehensive coverage across major exchanges, wallet integrations, and POS platforms. The ecosystem’s expanding functionality, particularly related to Shibarium, supports long-term investor confidence. DLMining’s products for SHIB reflect this stability and offer users an option to gain investment opportunities over a shorter timeframe through structured contracts. Real-World Usage and Payment Integrations SHIB’s adoption as a payment method has significantly increased. Through integrations with platforms like BitPay, NOWPayments, and Shopping.io, SHIB is now accepted by a growing number of online merchants, retailers, and service providers, including those in the travel industry. This expansion highlights SHIB’s transformation from a speculative asset to a viable medium of exchange. This real-world utility has created a broader user base for SHIB—something DLMining seeks to support by making SHIB-related digital contracts accessible through mobile platforms. Development Roadmap and Future Initiatives Shibarium outlined several upcoming developments designed to enhance the ecosystem: SHIB: Metaverse: A virtual environment that allows users to build, trade, and socialize using SHIB tokens. NFT Expansion: Continued support for Shiboshis, SHIB’s NFT collection, and integration with the broader metaverse. Shibarium Growth: Onboarding more third-party DApps and projects. Token Burning: Ongoing deflationary mechanisms for SHIB, LEASH, and BONE tokens. The ecosystem’s evolution also informs the creation of new utility-focused products, such as DLMining’s short-term SHIB contracts, which allow users to explore SHIB’s growth potential without requiring deep technical knowledge. Participate through DLMining In line with SHIB’s growing influence, DLMining’s new SHIB-exclusive contracts are designed to facilitate limited-time participation in SHIB’s market dynamics. Building on the success of similar products based on Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin, these contracts aim to provide users with short-term investment opportunities with potential returns based on market trends. New users receive a $15 bonus upon registration. Continued Interest in SHIB in 2025 Investors continue to show interest in SHIB for the following reasons: Low Barrier to Entry: SHIB’s low price makes it accessible to a wide range of investors. Continuous Development: Unlike many meme tokens, Shiba Inu continues to evolve through new use cases and platform upgrades. Real-World Integration: Adoption in payments, DeFi, and the virtual world strengthens SHIB’s value proposition.

The decline was driven by heightened institutional selling pressure, with volumes during the heaviest selling window more than doubling the daily average. Price action suggests potential exhaustion near $2.75, though broader macro and liquidity risks remain elevated. What to Know XRP saw peak sell pressure between 14:00–18:00 on August 2, with volumes reaching 222.24 million—183% higher than the 24-hour average of 78.52 million. The asset bottomed at $2.75, forming short-term support on heavy volume. Recovery attempts stalled at $2.84, with the final hour of trading closing at $2.82, indicating consolidation below key resistance. Volume-weighted price activity suggests accumulation interest at sub-$2.80 levels, but confirmation is lacking. News Background The XRP drawdown came amid widening global trade tensions and renewed tariff uncertainty that shook risk markets across the board. Meanwhile, institutional portfolios appeared to rebalance as macro conditions prompted capital rotation away from altcoins and into more liquid assets. Analysts point to ongoing adjustments by central banks and heightened geopolitical risk as catalysts for the broader sell-off. Price Action Summary High: $3.02 Low: $2.75 Close: $2.82 24H Range: $0.27 (-8.91%) Technical Analysis A volume climax at $2.75 coincided with XRP’s most aggressive hourly decline, typically a signal of capitulation or local bottoming. The $2.75–$2.76 zone now serves as first-layer support, while upside attempts are capped near $2.84. Volume fell sharply in the final hour of trading to ~650,000/min, compared to 3.7 million/min at peak, implying buyer fatigue or neutral flows post-dump. What Traders Are Watching Can XRP hold above $2.75–$2.76 and build a base for recovery, or does failure to reclaim $2.85+ indicate further downside? Watch for institutional inflows or continued exchange outflows, which may validate accumulation narratives. Traders are also closely tracking CD20 Index volatility and macro headlines, including U.S.-China trade developments, for short-term cues.",Markets|XRP|News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-03 05:33:52

They’re quietly accumulating positions in a fresh batch of meme coins that could dominate headlines in the coming months. With sentiment heating up, four projects have stood out as the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to rising social buzz, strong communities, and unique narratives. While some of these coins are already riding market momentum, one is still in its early whitelist phase, attracting serious attention for offering early access perks. Let’s dive into the four picks that crypto whales are watching for massive upside potential. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Whitelist-Only Access to the Bulls’ Den There’s one project that hasn’t launched yet, and that’s exactly why it’s getting flagged by insiders. MoonBull is quickly emerging as one of the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to its whitelist-only access model and intense buildup ahead of launch. This Ethereum-based meme coin was made for degens chasing breakout gains. But unlike other tokens flooding the market, MoonBull isn’t offering a public presale. Only whitelisted users can join the launch, and here’s what makes that a big deal: Lowest possible entry price for early adopters Secret staking rewards reserved only for whitelisted wallets Bonus token allocations that aren’t publicly disclosed Private roadmap hints available exclusively to early community members In short, the project is keeping its cards close, and that exclusivity is creating serious momentum. The idea? Get whitelisted or miss your shot. The signup process is simple: users drop their email into the secure whitelist form and get a private alert ahead of Stage One. Why This Coin Made the List MoonBull’s structure is tailor-made for big moves. With limited access, a capped supply, and early-stage excitement building, it’s no wonder that crypto whales have started circling early. It’s not just another meme coin, it’s a ticket into a high-energy ecosystem that’s primed for an explosive start. 2. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): Solana’s Viral Tribute to a Fallen Hero Meme coins often reflect the culture of the moment, and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a perfect example. Launched on the Solana blockchain, this token is a tribute to a real-life squirrel named Peanut, whose story captured the internet’s attention and sparked a viral movement. What makes PNUT stand out isn’t just its narrative, but how it’s turned emotional resonance into community action. The project channels public sentiment into something tangible: a meme coin that doubles as a symbol of animal advocacy. Its performance on Solana has been steady, and its meme appeal continues to pull in new supporters. Forums, TikTok, and X have been keeping PNUT alive in the conversation as the broader market eyes new narratives. Why did this coin make it to this list? PNUT combines a powerful backstory with a growing user base, making it one of the best meme coins in 2025 for emotional engagement and long-term potential. 3. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): A Gospel of Memes and AI on Solana Next up is Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), a Solana meme coin that’s turning heads with its hilarious and chaotic “Goat Gospel” theme. Powered by a custom AI bot known as the Truth Terminal, GOAT delivers a daily dose of internet chaos, humor, and meme prophecy. This project leans fully into meme culture, embracing randomness and absurdity as a virtue. It doesn’t pretend to have traditional utility, its entire value proposition is entertainment, virality, and the strength of its community. GOAT has built a devoted cult following, and its unique approach is keeping it relevant in a sea of meme clones. Why did this coin make it to this list? GOAT is one of the best meme coins in 2025 for its commitment to pure meme energy and viral AI-generated storytelling, a combo that’s clearly working. 4. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana’s Cult Classic With Pink Hat Power Dogwifhat (WIF) might sound silly at first, and that’s exactly the point. Born from a Shiba Inu wearing a pink hat, WIF has grown into a cultural icon on Solana. It doesn’t offer staking or burning mechanisms, and it doesn’t claim to solve complex problems. What it does offer is a passionate community and consistent attention on social platforms. WIF has proven that even simple concepts can lead to big runs, as long as the community stays active and the memes keep flowing. It’s been one of Solana’s standout meme coins, and it’s still getting volume. Why did this coin make it to this list? WIF earns its spot among the best meme coins in 2025 by showing how meme strength and community loyalty can build lasting relevance without needing utility. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, the best meme coins in 2025 are MoonBull , Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), and Dogwifhat (WIF). While each has its own distinct personality, one stands out for offering early access perks that no other project can match. MoonBull is still in its whitelist phase, and that makes it uniquely positioned for high potential gains. With exclusive benefits, limited spots, and a stealth-mode rollout, MoonBull offers the kind of opportunity traders dream of, but only if they act fast. The clock’s ticking. The bulls are charging. Will you be there when MoonBull lifts off? For More Information: Website : https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram : https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter : https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs What makes MoonBull different from other meme coins? MoonBull offers whitelist-only access, meaning early users get in at the lowest price with exclusive staking rewards and bonus tokens before the public ever sees it. Why are analysts watching these meme coins in 2025? These coins combine strong community support, narrative appeal, and bullish momentum, three key ingredients analysts consider for potential moonshots. How can I join the MoonBull whitelist? Visit the project’s official site and submit your email using the secure whitelist form. Once confirmed, you’ll get a private alert before Stage One begins.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

If BTC’s price holds momentum above $119,684, it will fuel a bullish rally to $123,376. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $110,621, beginning a bearish trend to $107,181. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as sellers triggered strong pressure toward $114K. The recent highs triggered strong selling demand among holders. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $812.25 million in net outflows on Friday, marking the second-largest single-day loss in the history of these products. Bitcoin price prediction August 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $123,000, making July its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction August 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-03 05:50:00

With institutional confidence returning and the U.S. regulatory climate turning more favorable, market participants are preparing for what could be another major rally. Early indicators point to a quiet accumulation phase—especially among crypto whales—focused on one emerging opportunity that’s quickly drawing attention. One of those projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has emerged as a clear standout. Its momentum is fueled by surging demand and early allocation phases that are closing faster than expected, signaling that whales aren’t waiting around for broader access. XRP Sees Renewed Momentum as Regulatory Fog Clears XRP has regained its footing after a turbulent year, with recent data showing a rise in both liquidity and trading volume. Whales in particular have resumed accumulation, suggesting renewed confidence in Ripple’s legal clarity and the potential for new financial products involving XRP. On the derivatives side, XRP perpetual futures have overtaken Solana on multiple exchanges—a key indicator of growing speculative interest. Spot prices have also surged in response to positive market sentiment tied to potential institutional partnerships and broader crypto-friendly U.S. policies. Analysts are watching for a decisive move above the $3.60 mark to confirm bullish continuation. While XRP attracts traders with strong fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where many early investors see explosive potential . With access windows closing rapidly, a growing number of whales are moving capital into the project before it reaches large-scale visibility. Momentum has grown to the point that allocation rounds are selling out faster than expected , leaving latecomers scrambling. This pattern of fast-paced participation resembles what was seen during the early surges of now-legendary tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s expanding community, fast-paced growth, and comparison to SHIBA INU’s early days make it a top candidate for high-yield speculation. According to multiple trend trackers, entry points available now are unlikely to last long— timing is critical . Whales Are Positioning Themselves Early With crypto markets heating up again, experienced players are combining stability bets like XRP with high-ROI bets like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This two-pronged strategy of risk-balanced investing is becoming increasingly common, particularly among large-scale holders looking to front-run retail inflows. Whale tracking wallets have shown that some of the same XRP addresses accumulating during the 2020–2021 cycle are now deploying capital into low-cap altcoins, signaling that the smart money is already positioning itself for the next breakout. Conclusion XRP’s resurgence amid a friendlier U.S. crypto climate is attracting both traders and long-term holders. However, it’s the parallel whale activity in MAGACOIN FINANCE that has drawn the most intrigue from market watchers. With entry phases closing rapidly and investor interest at all-time highs , this altcoin is shaping up to be a rare opportunity ahead of its full-scale debut.

While these dominant names attract attention, traders are now gravitating toward newer Layer 1 projects offering better utility and growth potential. One project gaining serious traction is BlockDAG. It stands apart from typical presales by showcasing a live testnet, 2 million+ active mobile miners, and over 4,500 developers building real dApps. Currently priced at only $0.0016, BDAG promises a staggering 3,025% ROI, with early buyers already witnessing a 2,660% surge since batch 1. This price holds until August 11th, adding urgency for buyers. BlockDAG’s ecosystem is already active and features a “NO VESTING PASS” offer, giving users full token access at launch. In this article, we’ll stack up Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and BlockDAG to see which ones stand among the top cryptos to buy today. BlockDAG (BDAG) Few projects have managed to turn heads the way BlockDAG (BDAG) has. With presale funding exceeding $359 million and over 24.6 billion coins sold, this project is gathering steam as it nears its global rollout. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0016, which stays active until August 11th, while the official listing price remains $0.05, a setup that offers a powerful 3,025% profit window. BDAG has already delivered 2,660% gains to early supporters since batch 1. The “NO VESTING PASS” sweetens the deal, allowing holders to unlock 100% of their coins immediately upon launch. But what truly separates BlockDAG is its existing infrastructure, a fully functioning testnet, over 2 million miners using the X1 app, and 18,000+ plug-and-play X10 miners sold. With more than 300 applications already in development from 4,500+ builders, BlockDAG’s traction speaks volumes. This isn’t just an idea, it’s a full-blown, ready-to-use ecosystem, making it one of the top cryptos to buy today based on current momentum, structure, and timing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto market and continues showing strong upward signs. The recent 3% rise over 24 hours brings ETH close to the $4,000 zone. What’s fueling this? A massive $1.59 billion in ETF inflows within a week, plus heightened interest from institutions. Following a low of $3,530 in late July, ETH has surged over 61% in the past month. The reduction in exchange balances, down more than 1 million ETH in 30 days, points to reduced sell pressure. Options traders are equally optimistic, with calls far outpacing puts and target ranges between $4,000 and $6,000. While it’s a strong performer, Ethereum’s maturity could limit fast gains. For those who want explosive growth potential rather than gradual returns, newer options like BlockDAG may currently offer better upside. Still, ETH retains its place among the top cryptos to buy today for reliability and long-term value. Polygon (MATIC / POL) MATIC is staying relevant in discussions about the top cryptos to buy today. With a trading price near $0.2166 and a modest 2.6% gain, Polygon remains in motion. A notable 141% jump in USDC transfers confirms its strong presence in stablecoin and scaling infrastructure. Polygon hasn’t made headlines this week, but its zkEVM development and continuing partnerships keep the momentum alive. Current trading volume stands around $280 million, and price charts show strong consolidation between $0.40 and $0.42, signaling potential breakout if metrics align. That said, while Polygon is steady, some might view newer presale-stage cryptos like BlockDAG as more attractive for short-term gains. MATIC remains part of the top cryptos to buy today, but buyers chasing higher ROI may look elsewhere. Avalanche (AVAX) AVAX has seen a strong 6% price jump in the last 24 hours, climbing to about $26.40 with daily trading volume over $1.1 billion. The push is largely linked to ETF rumors and the successful launch of the Octane upgrade, which cut C-Chain gas fees by 42.7% and enhanced performance. Avalanche is also prioritizing security and development. Octane Security, which is now active, brings AI-driven audits into the dev workflow, reducing bugs and deployment risks. This has made AVAX more attractive to builders. Meanwhile, derivatives markets show growing open interest, with $835 million currently locked in. Still, compared to BlockDAG’s early-stage price and live features, Avalanche might not deliver the same explosive ROI. While AVAX is dependable, those searching for top cryptos to buy today with higher upside potential may favor BDAG’s offering. Final Take! Choosing among the top cryptos to buy today depends on your appetite for stability versus speed. Ethereum continues to dominate headlines and institutional flows, Polygon offers scalable tech, and Avalanche is turning heads with its development stack. But BlockDAG combines key elements like adoption, working products, and one of the most appealing presale prices in the market. With batch 29 priced at $0.0016 until August 11th, and a 3,025% return window leading up to the $0.05 listing, the math is hard to ignore. Add in the “NO VESTING PASS,” and it’s clear why buyers are racing in. For anyone eyeing fast gains with an already active project, BlockDAG is shaping up as one of the top cryptos to buy today before the window narrows any further.

The announcement came via the company’s second quarter of 2025 earnings press release , which also mentioned $3.1 billion in total financial assets and its first-ever quarter of positive operating cash flow. The crypto holdings were first disclosed in a separate press release dated July 21. The company also said it has allocated $300 million toward an options-based strategy focused on bitcoin and bitcoin-related assets, signaling ongoing intent to expand its exposure. According to the July 21 release, this strategy could allow Trump Media to convert options into spot BTC “depending on market conditions,” and potentially use the resulting positions for revenue generation or further crypto accumulation. The $2 billion figure cited includes not only spot bitcoin but also bitcoin-related securities, such as bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bitcoin trusts, or derivatives that offer BTC exposure. These instruments allow institutional investors to gain indirect access to bitcoin price movements while avoiding direct custody or on-chain interaction. By combining these securities with spot bitcoin, Trump Media has constructed a hybrid crypto treasury intended to offer both liquidity and resilience. The second quarter also marked the company’s first quarter of positive operating cash flow, with $2.3 million generated through its media and technology operations. Total financial assets reached $3.1 billion, fueled primarily by the crypto treasury build-up and a recent private placement backed by 50 institutional investors. CEO Devin Nunes said that the liquidity and “financial freedom” afforded by this capital will help Trump Media pursue a range of product expansions, including a Truth+ streaming bundle, AI integrations, and a planned utility token for payments within the Truth Social ecosystem. The company also reiterated its goal of launching multiple crypto-focused ETFs and managed investment products. Trump Media shares (DJT) closed at $16.92 on Friday, down 3.81% on the day and 50.26% lower year-to-date, according to Google Finance data.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|Donald Trump|btc|News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|SPONSORED|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-03 06:10:09

As seasoned investors look for high-upside entry points, one fast-growing project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has caught attention for its explosive growth metrics and expanding user base. Ethereum’s Rebound Hasn’t Hit Its Ceiling Yet Ethereum (ETH) remains one of the most fundamentally sound assets in crypto, yet it’s still undervalued relative to its potential. Currently priced at $3,740, ETH is trading more than 20% below its all-time high of $4,720. Meanwhile, corporate holdings of Ethereum have surpassed $10 billion, and ETF inflows remain steady. Despite that bullish backdrop, technical momentum remains neutral, with an RSI of ~31, suggesting room for upward movement once buy-side volume picks up. A clean breakout above $4,000 could trigger rapid continuation. One New Project Is Quickly Escaping Hidden Gem Status Among altcoins seeing fast-tracked growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking out of obscurity. According to on-chain metrics, MAGACOIN has recently crossed multiple internal benchmarks for user acquisition, transaction volume, and community engagement. A newly completed third-party blockchain audit has also positioned the project as a top-tier safety pick —a factor that has drawn attention from cautious but ROI-focused investors. $2,500 deployed here could turn into $50,000 , based on similar market cap trajectories seen in early-stage coins that achieved wide exchange listings. Cardano’s Discount May Not Last Long Cardano (ADA) is another altcoin hovering well below its peak, currently priced at just $0.75—a far cry from its former all-time high of $3.01. Despite recent bearish action bringing ADA down to around $0.743, RSI levels near 30.27 indicate heavy overselling. Historically, similar RSI readings have preceded major recoveries for ADA. Its strong developer activity and continued expansion into smart contracts make it a serious contender for long-term gains if it can reclaim investor confidence. Conclusion Ethereum and Cardano remain undervalued giants with significant recovery potential.

However, with the market maturing and some crypto investment products now better understood, the regulator said it will allow access, provided the ETNs are listed on recognized, FCA-approved U.K.-based exchanges. Products must follow financial promotion rules to prevent misleading advertising and inappropriate incentives. The FCA’s Consumer Duty rules, which require firms to avoid causing foreseeable harm, will apply. The FCA warned, however, that there won’t be coverage under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for these products.

Houston resident Sharon Schoolcraft says she lost $13,000 after receiving a call from someone claiming to be working at Wells Fargo, reports FOX 26. Schoolcraft says the caller alerted her to possible fraudulent charges made to her account, a facade made believable by the fact that the scammer knew about recent charges she had legitimately made. The scammer subsequently told Schoolcraft that someone would come to her home to cut up or collect her cut-up Wells Fargo debit card. Similar scams have affected other Wells Fargo customers. Recent reports suggest a trend of scammers convincing the bank’s customers that their accounts are at risk, tricking them into giving up their PINs, cutting up their bank cards and then meeting someone in person to hand over the cut-up cards so the thieves can either withdraw funds or transfer money out of the accounts. In previous instances, when requesting a refund from the bank, the victims were denied by Wells Fargo. However, the bank’s decision changed when the media investigated the matter. Similarly, Wells Fargo only agreed to refund Schoolcraft her stolen $13,000 after the media got involved. Says Schoolcraft, “I’m so super stoked, it’s going to mean a lot to me. I can pay back the person I had to borrow money from. I can get my bills back on track.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.537 (-0.5%) Market Cap $413.34 Million Trading Volume $11.92 Million Circulating Supply 787.63 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 (Mar 08, 2024) All-time Low $0.4954 (Apr 09, 2025) 24-hour high $0.55 24-hour low $0.52 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 0.537154 Price Prediction $ 0.404436 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.64% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.578797 200-Day SMA $ 0.71533 14-Day RSI 39.88 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faced a buying demand toward $ TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced a buying demand toward $ Resistance for dYdX is at $0.6081 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.5036 The dYdX price analysis for 3 August confirms that dYdX faced a drop as it attempted a move below $0.54. Currently, buyers are accumulating heavily, resulting in a consolidation. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price declines toward $0.54 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced buying pressure after the price attempted to maintain momentum above $0.66. As a result, buyers are now holding dYdX price around resistance lines, preparing for further upward push. The 24-hour volume surged to $5.07 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.539, declining by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades around 38, hinting that sellers are dominating. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price below the EMA trend lines. Currently, sellers are holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.18, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.684049 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.670481 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.653003 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.655128 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.578797 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.613287 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.71533 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.602108 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.592156 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.589295 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.602966 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.663086 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.804666 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.024835 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6081, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6621. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5036, beginning a bearish trend to $0.4396. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers lost confidence in pushing the price above Fib levels. As a result, sellers are now approaching the $0.54 level to initiate a stronger bearish rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.5 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX, the leading decentralized trading platform, announced its partnership with Crypto.com’s Onchain app. It is Crypto.com’s non-custodial digital asset wallet, enabling quick access to advanced trading features directly within mobile phone. dYdX price prediction August 2025 July was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain its buying momentum. As a result, dYdX recorded over 3% decline in July. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.9 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $1.2, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction August 2025 $0.45 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history: CoinStats dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June. By the end of June, dYdX had declined toward $0.41. In July, the token surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain buying demand and dropped below $0.6.",Crypto Price Predictions|dYDX,EN,0,0,TRADING|DYDX|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|WLD|ALTCOIN|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-03 07:10:00

The move came as risk sentiment deteriorated globally, triggering institutional outflows across volatile crypto assets, particularly meme coins. What to Know DOGE traded in a volatile $0.01 range (7.14%) during the session, declining from $0.20 to $0.19 before staging a mild bounce. Volume surged to 918.53M at 06:00 and 502.81M at 14:00, both exceeding the 24H average of 385.67M, signaling high-conviction exits. Support formed around $0.188–$0.190, where volume spiked to 667.44M, enabling a brief recovery to $0.194. Resistance held at $0.202–$0.203, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. News Background DOGE's decline came amid renewed global trade tensions following the expiration of a reciprocal tariff framework, which has left 92 countries facing elevated trade barriers. The Federal Reserve held rates steady this week, opting to monitor trade data, which has reduced market odds of a September rate cut and weighed heavily on high-beta assets. Price Action Summary High: $0.203 Low: $0.188 Close: $0.195 24H Range: $0.015 (7.14%) Technical Analysis DOGE encountered aggressive resistance at the $0.202–$0.203 zone, rejecting multiple rallies. The $0.188–$0.190 region absorbed peak selling pressure, with high-volume prints suggesting bottom-fishing or accumulation interest. The final 60-minute session (03:55–04:54) saw a measured 0.53% drop from $0.196 to $0.195, with intra-candle resistance at $0.1963 and support near $0.1952. Volumes normalized late in the session, but remain above baseline, indicating potential for continued volatility. What Traders Are Watching Whether DOGE can hold $0.19 support or break down further amid broader altcoin weakness.

According to Cosmo, both entities are quietly aligning operations, timelines, and personnel to build a tokenized infrastructure that affects not just financial instruments, but also identity, medical data, and global market architecture. The claims, supported by multiple references to known partnerships and developments, attempt to demonstrate a systemic realignment of the digital asset space led by Ripple and BlackRock. Cosmo opens the thread by stating that BlackRock and Ripple have “just been exposed,” and suggests they are using tokenization as a vehicle to control financial markets. The tweet asserts that the same assets are being targeted, within the same timeframe, and involving the same key players behind both initiatives. The central argument is that this coordinated effort is being largely overlooked despite its significant implications for crypto holders and the broader financial ecosystem. Ripple’s Role in Tokenizing Traditional Assets Cosmo traces the beginning of this effort to Ripple’s early work in tokenizing U.S. Treasury bonds using the XRP Ledger . This was done through the OUSG fund, which is accessible in tokenized form on-chain 24/7. According to Cosmo, this marks a fundamental shift in how traditional securities are accessed and transferred. He further notes that BlackRock has allocated capital into this very fund, highlighting their indirect participation in the XRPL tokenization effort . 1^ ✰ BlackRock and Ripple are acting in sync – quietly but on a massive scale ✰ They are launching tokenization to rewrite the financial system ✰ Same assets – same timeline – same people – and no one is asking questions pic.twitter.com/OqcdS41fhA — Cosmo (@0xcosmobtc) July 31, 2025 Ondo Finance is identified as the intermediary platform responsible for launching the OUSG token. Cosmo describes Ondo as a fintech project led by former Goldman Sachs executives. The role breakdown, as Cosmo explains, places Ripple as the provider of the blockchain infrastructure, Ondo as the issuer of the tokenized instruments, and BlackRock as the source of capital liquidity. He also notes that Ripple’s legal clarity following its partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023 was a strategic milestone that enabled this expansion into institutional partnerships. New Developments Involving Bio-Identification and the XRP Ledger A point of coincidence emphasized by Cosmo is the ticker symbol $XDNA. BlackRock currently has a genetics ETF trading under this ticker. Meanwhile, on July 4, 2025, a token with the same ticker, $XDNA, is set to launch on the XRP Ledger. Cosmo states that this new token is being issued by DNA Protocol and is centered on biometric identity infrastructure, medical data access, and genomics, rather than trading. He states that the XRPL will serve as the foundational blockchain for this infrastructure, further demonstrating Ripple’s reach into areas beyond finance. This development, according to Cosmo, represents the convergence of healthcare data, biometric identification, and tokenized infrastructure within a single blockchain environment. He notes that this should not be viewed in isolation but rather as an extension of Ripple’s broader role in building systems for the next era of digital infrastructure.

He points out that Ripple’s systems have been compatible with ISO 20022 from inception. In contrast, BlackRock’s Aladdin software, which manages over $20 trillion in assets, is now testing blockchain networks for settlement and transaction tracking. Cosmos states that XRPL supports ISO 20022 and operates without interruption, positioning it as a viable base layer for next-generation financial systems. According to Cosmo, the two firms are dividing responsibilities across multiple verticals. Ripple is focusing on the tokenization of government bonds, central bank digital currencies, land, and carbon markets. BlackRock is focusing on tokenizing equities, U.S. treasuries, real estate, and digital identity. Cosmo interprets this as a dual effort to reboot the global financial system from the ground up, operating in unison but through separate domains. Effect on the Broader Crypto Market In the final portion of the thread, Cosmo argues that the implications of this transformation affect all crypto holders. He says that anyone holding assets like Ethereum or Solana is already part of this evolving structure, regardless of whether they are aware. Cosmo warns that the shift is not about adopting a new market, but rather transitioning the current system into a more centralized form under different management. He ends the thread with a caution that this transformation is not optional. According to his view, tokenization led by Ripple and BlackRock is already in motion, and retail participants are being absorbed into an institutional framework without a clear understanding of the broader design.

The image, described as one of the most comprehensive and clear visualizations of XRP’s total supply, reiterates the essential breakdown of XRP holdings, including those in escrow, in active circulation, and under Ripple’s control. The data visualization provides insight into how XRP is distributed across different categories, emphasizing the constraints on Ripple’s ability to liquidate large portions of the asset. Still the best infographic about total #XRP circulation, updated. (SBI Holdings fiscal year end report) ~36b left in escrow.. pic.twitter.com/GniV4tFO3P — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) August 1, 2025 XRP Market Circulation and Total Supply The maximum supply of XRP remains capped at 100 billion tokens. According to the infographic, approximately 59.24 billion XRP are in active circulation within the market. At the time of reporting, this portion of XRP carries a market capitalization of approximately 28.6 trillion Japanese yen, based on pricing data from July 28. This figure reflects a substantial segment of the total supply and constitutes the portion that is freely tradable across exchanges and platforms. Ripple’s Non-Circulating Holdings As of the end of March 2025, Ripple held a significant volume of XRP that had not entered the market. These holdings are categorized as being outside of current market circulation and are valued at approximately 13.4 trillion yen. By July 20, 2025, the infographic reports that Ripple’s non-circulating holdings are equivalent to 19.7 trillion yen, which suggests that the valuation is based on a revised XRP price as of July 28. These tokens represent a portion of the supply Ripple retains direct control over, yet has not introduced into active trading markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Under Escrow and Burned Supply A prominent feature of the report is the quantification of XRP held under escrow . Roughly 35.9 billion XRP remain locked under the escrow mechanism. The infographic explains that XRP placed in escrow on the XRP Ledger is restricted from use or destruction until specific conditions are met. The escrow system was established to promote predictability and ensure responsible token release over time. Based on ledger data available as of July 20, 2025, the report confirms that nearly 40% of the total XRP supply is still under escrow, and thus, Ripple is not at liberty to sell or distribute these tokens at will. In addition to circulating and escrowed tokens, the infographic indicates that approximately 10 million XRP have been permanently removed from the total supply through transaction fees. These burned tokens represent a fraction of the total but reflect the deflationary nature of the transaction cost model built into the XRP Ledger. Summary of Data Presentation and Source The quantities shown in the infographic are derived from XRP Ledger data as of July 20, 2025, and the monetary valuations are calculated using XRP’s market price as of July 28. WrathofKahneman referred to the updated image as “still the best infographic about total XRP circulation,” highlighting its clarity and the credibility of its source, which is SBI Holdings. The visual report illustrates the current landscape of XRP distribution in quantifiable detail and offers transparency on Ripple’s available and restricted holdings.

In a chart posted on August 2, trader and crypto analyst Xoom (@Mr_Xoom) outlined a potential bullish reversal zone as XRP trades around the $2.93 mark. The chart indicates a classic five-wave Elliott Wave pattern , where wave 5 is projected to finalize around $2.8. The chart highlights a series of lower highs and lower lows from late July into early August. After completing Waves 1 to 5, the chart outlines the potential endpoint, which falls around the $2.8 zone that Xoom previously set as the XRP’s lowest point for this cycle. XRP Ltf wave 5 coming to an end. I repeat- $6-$8 XRP in August highly likely. https://t.co/whkoyP1vM5 pic.twitter.com/2lPXPs5ybR — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 2, 2025 Support Zone Under Scrutiny XRP recently experienced a notable decline, falling below the crucial $3 support zone . It has failed to reclaim this level, causing some concern among market participants. Xoom outlined this level on the chart, as it held up XRP in July after the asset retraced from its all-time high . Although XRP has broken through this support, Xoom is confident in the technical structure and anticipates a recovery. Despite the recent decline, XRP has remained above the highlighted support at $2.8, and the current forecast implies that once wave 5 concludes, a larger reversal could follow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bearish Momentum is Slowing Down Elliott Wave theory, the analytical framework used in the chart, typically identifies patterns of investor behavior. A completed five-wave downtrend often precedes a corrective rally or a new impulsive move in the opposite direction. In this case, Xoom appears to anticipate the latter, which would imply a significant upside breakout if the projected reversal plays out. At the time of Xoom’s analysis, XRP sat slightly above the $2.8 support, trading around $2.93. The bearish sequence, while still active, appears to be losing momentum, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Outlook for August Remains Bullish Despite the short-term bearish structure, the forecast remains optimistic over the coming weeks. Xoom reiterated his previous target, stating that XRP reaching $6 to $8 in August is highly likely . The projected target range represents a more than 2x increase from current levels at the minimum. While that may seem ambitious, the underlying structure of the wave analysis supports the case for a trend shift if the $2.80 support holds firm.

This correction has sparked a divide among analysts and investors, with some viewing it as a healthy retracement that could set the stage for a continuation of the broader uptrend. Others, however, warn that this move might signal the beginning of a more extended bearish phase if key support levels fail to hold. Related Reading: Ethereum New Addresses Surge To Nearly 257K In A Day, Matching 2017 And 2021 Bull Markets Adding to the market’s uncertainty, top analyst Darkfost highlighted a significant shift in exchange activity. Data reveals that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have been steadily rising since early July, reversing a prolonged downtrend that had been in place since March. Given Binance’s position as the largest global crypto exchange by volume, this uptick in inflows is a crucial indicator of shifting investor behavior. Whether this trend signals an upcoming wave of selling or simply reflects portfolio rebalancing remains to be seen. The coming days will be pivotal as Bitcoin tests its lower demand zones and market sentiment reacts to this new data. Binance Bitcoin Inflows Signal Shift in Market Mood Darkfost shared critical data showing that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have steadily increased, rising from approximately 5,300 BTC daily in early July to 7,000 BTC today. While this uptick is not abrupt, it marks a significant reversal of a prolonged downtrend that had persisted since March. This change suggests that investor behavior is shifting, potentially signaling adjustments in market strategies as traders and institutions respond to evolving market dynamics. Binance, as the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally by trading volume, serves as a critical barometer for overall market sentiment. With over 250 million users and billions of dollars in daily transactions, fluctuations in Bitcoin inflows on this platform often mirror broader structural moves within the crypto market. Historically, rising inflows have been associated with increased trading activity, whether due to profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or anticipation of market volatility. Some analysts interpret this emerging trend of accelerating inflows as an early sign of preparation for heightened market volatility or impending macroeconomic shifts. It could indicate that traders are positioning funds on exchanges to either capitalize on price swings or hedge against potential downside risks. While the magnitude of inflows isn’t alarmingly high yet, the consistency of this rise demands attention. The market is watching closely to see whether this signals a temporary adjustment or the start of a broader trend. With Bitcoin’s price currently testing lower support zones after breaking below $115K, the behavior of these inflows will be pivotal in determining short-term price action.

Key Support At Risk Amid Increased Selling Pressure Bitcoin is trading at $112,477 after breaking down from its two-week consolidation range. The price lost the crucial $115,724 support, which now flips into immediate resistance. This breakdown marks a significant shift in momentum, with BTC testing the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $114,944, which failed to hold. The next key support zone lies near the 200-day SMA at $110,348, a level that could become pivotal for bulls attempting to regain control. Volume has surged during this decline, indicating strong selling pressure as BTC approaches the $112,000 level. If the price fails to hold above this zone, a further drop towards the psychological $110K level seems likely, with potential for a deeper correction targeting previous accumulation ranges from early July.

Until then, market sentiment remains cautious as investors watch for signs of demand absorption or further liquidation-driven declines.

In a note to clients seen by Reuters , Goldman Sachs says hedge funds took profits on their tech positions just as the S&P 500 index hit all-time highs. The bank says tech stocks were sold off by hedge funds in the US and Europe more than any other sector last week, and was the largest exodus from the field since July 2024. Goldman also notes that every type of tech stock was sold, including semiconductor chip companies, software firms and IT service providers. While tech stocks sold off, the bank says hedge funds began shifting their capital to consumer staples, or goods that consumers purchase regularly regardless of the economic climate. Goldman says the big winners included companies that sell food and beverages, and personal care products. Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, tells Reuters that yields on long bonds may determine US equities’ next move, but they haven’t yet flashed any clear signals. “US equities valuations (such as price earnings ratios) are now 30% higher than their recent decade average, while 10-year yields remain stubbornly high and volatile. The future path of equities may depend partly on a decline in long-term rates; however, we do not seem to be there yet.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-relax-friends-this-dip-is-almost-over-heres-why/,"XRP’s recent decline has unsettled parts of the crypto community, especially after the asset reached a peak of $3.65 in July. Since then, the bullish momentum has cooled considerably. The asset is trading at $2.82, a 5.43% drop from yesterday, having fallen below the psychologically significant $3 support level recently. Despite the sharp downturn, not all analysts are signaling alarm. In a post on X, well-known trader and market analyst CryptoBull shared a 4-hour chart suggesting that XRP may be approaching the tail end of its current corrective move. According to CryptoBull, “this XRP dip is almost over.” Relax friends, this #XRP dip is almost over. pic.twitter.com/l6wdmoo6Jx — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 2, 2025 A Falling Wedge Forms on the 4-Hour Chart The chart, which covers price action from mid-July to early August, displays a falling wedge formation , a classic technical pattern that often precedes a bullish breakout. The narrowing price action is marked by descending resistance and support lines converging toward the current price. The pattern is visible across multiple lower highs and lower lows, with the recent price action testing the wedge’s lower boundary below $2.8. This setup indicates weakening selling pressure, even as prices decline. Volume analysis within the chart also shows a tapering pattern, consistent with a potential exhaustion of downward momentum. XRP Support Levels Suggest Bearish Exhaustion Although XRP has seen a notable decline from its recent peak , the current chart positioning implies it may be nearing a technical support level. The downward sloping wedge has not yet broken to the upside, but such patterns often act as precursors to bullish reversals once a breakout occurs with conviction and volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Still, the absence of a confirmed breakout means traders should remain cautious. If XRP fails to hold the lower trendline around $2.7, the price could continue to slide, testing deeper levels of support. On the other hand, if buying pressure increases and XRP breaks above the upper resistance line currently just below $3, it may signal a return of upward momentum. Is An XRP Reversal Coming? CryptoBull’s chart interpretation comes at a moment of uncertainty for XRP holders. While the recent price action has been bearish, the structure shown on the 4-hour chart provides a technical basis for optimism. Other analysts have expressed confidence that XRP’s recovery is imminent , and the next few sessions could prove critical in confirming whether this dip is indeed near its end or if further downside awaits.

Meanwhile, Ripple Labs continues to expand its business as corporations and even the US government move to add XRP to their digital asset portfolios to balance out their treasuries. Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, DC has done a complete 180-degree about-face since Trump’s reelection. The SEC has shifted from an aggressively and relentlessly hostile stance toward Ripple Labs to one that is cooperative and helpful. In addition to that, the company is making enormous strides forward in Q3 2025 to expand its borderless payments business for large transactions between big institutions. XRP Outshines US Stocks in July It’s a very bullish forward view for XRP prices as August begins, especially compared to returns from US stocks, like the benchmark S&P 500 Index. July was a big month for the US stock market, which grew to a historic record high level again on Monday, along with the Nasdaq Composite. That’s despite worries over Trump’s tax reforms and global tariff policies. But XRP holders made significantly greater gains than US stock shareholders in July. The S&P 500 Index delivered +2.67% gains for the 30 days ending Tuesday, July 29. Meanwhile, XRP’s price flew up on crypto exchanges by over +42%, from $2.20 on Jun. 30 to $3.13 on Jul. 29. It’s worth noting, though, that both asset classes slashed some of the gains as July ended and on Autva e gust 1 due to political concerns and economic uncertainty. During most of its history since launching in 1957, S&P 500 Index stocks would typically take four years to deliver those kinds of gains that XRP delivered in 30 consecutive days this summer. That’s not the first time Ripple’s token has given such an incredibly positive performance. Its average trading price performed similarly this past January, last November, and during the Bitcoin bull markets in 2021 and 2017. Here are five key factors analysts are weighing, who say XRP is going as high as $5 in the next five months. 1. Altcoin Analyst Predicts $5 XRP By 2026 Altcoin Daily co-founder Aaron Arnold, in an update posted on July 25, explained that he believes XRP is going to $5 and beyond because it’s not merely a currency, but crucially important digital infrastructure for global payments. He said that Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in December 2024, will be a primary driver of XRP’s market gains for the rest of this crypto cycle. Unpopular opinion: Ripple’s RLUSD might be the most underrated stablecoin of 2025 – Went from the #36 stablecoin to #17 ranking in 6 months -604% growth (2nd fastest YTD) – $348M in inflows Even more suprising is that of ~83% RLUSD is on Ethereum, not on Ripple. pic.twitter.com/E1qUMjeedc — J.Hackworth (@jphackworth42) June 19, 2025 Every time there’s a transaction on XRP Ledger, some of the XRP is burned to increase scarcity and create price support for the currency. “Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD is the key,” Arnold said. That’s because XRP is a relatively scarce, supply-limited token, and the growth of RLUSD increases the demand for XRP while leaving it in shorter supply. RLUSD has already captured a market cap well north of half a billion dollars in July. All other factors equalized, the Ripple stablecoin’s rapid adoption is good business and economics for XRP valuations to continue rising in 2025. 2. XRP Corporate Treasury Race Begins Meanwhile, as online traders use more XRP to move stablecoins around the blockchain, at least one corporate finance department is raising $20 million in funds to pile up an XRP treasury. Nature’s Miracle Holdings is a California-based farm tech firm that provides equipment for indoor, greenhouse, and vertical farming operations. They’re publicly traded in the United States on OTC Markets, with a very small market cap of less than $2 million. The company announced on 7/23 that it is raising $20 million in an equity finance deal approved by the SEC to stash a corporate XRP treasury. Moreover, that would make it the first non-financial public company to buy a big tranche of XRP. Nature’s Miracle CEO James Li said you can blame the company’s big strategic pivot on Trump and Congress for creating more regulatory clarity around blockchain with the GENIUS Act. “We see the huge potential of XRP as it improves the speed and reduces the cost of cross-border payments,” Li said. 3. Ripple Pump Incoming From US Stockpile BIG: White House to unveil national crypto stockpile report this Wednesday! $XRP rumored to be on the list alongside BTC & ETH. Is XRP becoming a strategic U.S. digital asset? pic.twitter.com/sOywwGNF5S — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) July 27, 2025 In addition to corporate treasury interest in XRP stockpiles, the US federal government wants its hands on Ripple tokens. In fact, President Trump has specifically named XRP as one of the assets the White House wants to hold in trust for Americans. The White House’s crypto report on blockchain and the national digital assets stockpile, released on July 30, provides solid support for XRP price levels. Meanwhile, Americans applying for federal housing loans are now permitted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to list crypto like XRP as financial assets while holding them, without selling them for cash instead. So the US government is shaping up to be a massive bull factor in XRP prices for the remainder of 2025, as well as going forward up to 2030 and beyond. 4. Ripple New US Patent: A Threat to SWIFT? JUST IN: Ripple secures U.S. patent for trust-based, instant cross-border payments—no full network confirmation needed. $XRP might slowly replace SWIFT, offering a faster and more efficient alternative. pic.twitter.com/op8Yn1sfQy — Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) July 27, 2025 RippleNet and XRP Ledger are global, borderless, automated payment and financial networks. Across the pond from the US, Ripple is expanding its business in Europe as well. In July, a representative from Ripple told journalists the company is applying for a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe for regulatory compliance. Consequently, the company will find it easier to expand its operations in the Eurozone. Moreover, Ripple got US Patent No. 11,998,003 approved in July for an international payments network that settles much faster than the world’s most popular cross-border payments rails, based out of Belgium, SWIFT. Running the math on it, if XRP payments using RippleNet and XRP Ledger capture 14% of SWIFT’s market share for daily transaction services, XRP’s price could go to Mars and Jupiter. 5. Bitcoin Bull Run to $150K-200K In 2025 Finally, if Bitcoin’s price rises to $175,000 or $200,000, as many professional market analysts believe it will, it could be an easy ride up for XRP tokens from $3 a token to $5 XRP in 2025. In fact, XRP’s price gained 518% in just 77 days, the last time Bitcoin rallied 50% from last Nov. 4 to Jan. 20. If it did that again from the current price level, XRP could skyrocket to $19.30.

According to reports, the community approved Input Output Engineering’s (IOE) protocol roadmap for treasury funding with about 74% of voters supporting the initiative. In the press release , the platform notes that the initiative is expected to be the first community-authorized core development funding for the blockchain network. The press statement notes that the approval is expected to birth not just a set of technical upgrades, but also a shared vision for the future of Cardano, which is grounded in transparency, accountability, and momentum. The approved roadmap was designed in alignment with community priorities and approved earlier this year, revealing one of the most ambitious development phases in the Chain’s history. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson mentioned at the time that the new approach is expected to introduce agile engineering teams to achieve a faster execution of the platform’s goals. Cardano community greenlights funding to support network upgrades The approved funding is expected to go to major upgrades, focusing on scalability, developer experience, and interoperability. The key developments will include Ouroboros Leios for increased throughput, Hydra for fast and cheap transactions, Mithril improvements for reduced bootstrap times, and Project Acropolis for modular node architecture, which will enable greater flexibility and easier onboarding of new core developers. In addition, there are also plans for performance optimization, which is expected to improve sync times and reduce RAM usage, and nested transactions, which will provide a technical foundation for more advanced smart contracts and seamless interoperability. According to Tim Harrison, the EVP Community & Ecosystem at Input Output, this development is a milestone for the platform. Harrison noted that for the first time, major protocol developments will be funded directly by the community. He noted that the move empowers the firm with the needed confidence to move forward, adding that they need to show “full transparency, shared responsibility, and a renewed commitment to building an open, resilient ecosystem.” New updates will lay the groundwork for better performance These upgrades are expected to lay the groundwork for a more scalable, accessible Cardano with better performance, unlocking new capabilities for builders and users. Aside from delivering on its promises, Cardano is also expected to support wider participation by onboarding external vendors, with most of them expected to join from the Cardano Developer Ecosystem Coalition (CDEC). According to its press statement, Cardano expects to build capacity, transfer knowledge, and help contributors stand as independent proposers in future funding rounds, strengthening decentralization over time. The funding structure is expected to integrate milestone-based payments administered by Intersect, with releases based on verified delivery. IOE will provide monthly updates, engineering timesheets, and quarterly budget reports that will be checked by the community. “Securing this funding is just the start,” said Ricky Rand, General Manager, Input | Output Engineering. “This is a vote of confidence in Cardano’s future—and a model for how decentralized funding and delivery can work at scale. The real work begins now—delivering with integrity, reporting with transparency, and building with and for the community.” Reacting to the update, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, took to blogging platform X to show his support for the development. He thanks the crypto community for their unwavering support, urging them to let them get it done. Meanwhile, crypto community members have also supported the move, with a user noting that the future of the chain is now in the hands of ADA holders, which is a good thing for the project and a vote of confidence for Hoskinson.

Onchain data reveals the approval transaction was signed on April 30, 2024 — but the theft occurred much later, on August 2, 2025. This incident marks yet another alarming breach in the crypto space. The attack began with an ERC-20 approval transaction, likely embedded in a fake airdrop or a spoofed legitimate-looking website. The victim unknowingly signed the transaction, granting the scammer access to their funds. Scammer strikes 458 days later as dormant wallet springs to life The scammer’s wallet had a disreputable pink-drainer.eth address, “0x67E5Ae”, where the stolen $908,551 worth of USDC stablecoin was received. The attack was carried out on August 2 at 4:57 AM UTC, according to Scam Sniffer’s X post . This was 458 days, just after the victim accidentally approved a transaction that appeared to be legit on April 30, 2024. The unexpected attack has raised security concerns among crypto users. To address this, Scam Sniffer, a firm that keenly monitors malicious activities in the crypto space, called for the urgency of digital asset users taking caution before approving the transactions. According to the firm, users should check their approvals often. For the old ones, they should cancel them to avoid exposing their funds to scammers, emphasizing the importance of their wallet security. In the highlighted case, the compromised wallet had only seen minimal, low-value transactions up until a month before the theft, making it unlikely to attract immediate attention from scammers. The user decided to move $762,397 into a wallet with the address 0x6c0eB6 from a MetaMask wallet on July 2 at 8:41 PM UTC. Ten minutes later, the user transferred another $146,154 in USDC to the same wallet from a Kraken account. At this time, the scammer was monitoring the movement of the funds, waiting for the right time to attack while giving the user more time to see if she or he could add more funds to the wallet. The attack took place on August 2. Crypto fraud attack raises tension among investors Investigators noted that the scammer used tactics typical of a phishing approval attack , closely monitoring the victim’s transactions before executing the theft. Following such attacks, crypto authorities included stricter measures users should take while approving transactions. For example, they have introduced Etherscan’s Token Approval checker for Ethereum users, enabling them to review and cancel any token approval that is not needed. However, each cancellation process is charged a gas fee. Meanwhile, research from sources reveals that in July alone, the total stolen funds amounted to more than $142 million in the crypto ecosystem. This involves at least 17 attacks, with crypto exchange CoinDCX suffering the highest losses. Still, crypto users are worried about the security of their funds. Some have highlighted that this scammer has not been identified and arrested, which makes them even more worried. Others have called for more security measures to be effected.

The comments came during an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session hosted by XRPL Commons and were shared on X by crypto commentator Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba), who posted a clip highlighting the exchange. Despite XRPL’s longstanding performance and reliability , Schwartz did not shy away from identifying architectural inefficiencies. “It’s kind of annoying that you have a monolith that has the consensus engine, the transaction engine, and client queries all monolithically,” he said. Schwartz, who is one of the architects of the XRPL , explained that the tightly coupled components have made it difficult to implement enhancements or enable interoperability with alternative implementations. Decisions are being made today. If restarting the #XRP ledger from scratch, Ripple CTO David Schwartz discusses using ""Rust"" is definitely talked about. Proposals from an outside company are currently being considered for a possible modular revamp of pieces. (Rust is a… pic.twitter.com/DzEpY3gQNv — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) August 2, 2025 Moving Toward a More Modular Architecture One solution under consideration is modularization of the transaction engine, possibly enabling it to run within a virtual machine. That shift could separate the core logic from the client-facing overlay and database components, free to evolve independently. Rust has emerged as a candidate for such a reimplementation. When asked why the ledger wasn’t already being rebuilt in Rust, Schwartz noted that discussions about doing exactly that are happening. He emphasized that the difficulty lies in untangling the existing architecture, especially the payment engine. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz explained that parts of the payment engine are difficult to define clearly, which makes rebuilding or re-implementing them challenging. Some behaviors depend on the order of operations in ways that aren’t consistently documented. To address this, he suggested rewriting those components with clearer, more predictable logic and possibly introducing formal definitions to guide future implementations. A cleaner, more consistent version would make the system easier to maintain and could help future improvements, enhancing XRP’s appeal in the global financial ecosystem . Proposals Under Review Ripple is currently reviewing external proposals to undertake parts of this effort, and Schwartz mentioned that decisions are being made about the feasibility and prioritization of such initiatives. He pointed to Aanchal Malhotra, board member and head of research at RippleX, as someone leading aspects of that process. XRP is already highly appealing to institutions , and upgrading its functionality through a modern programming language like Rust could increase institutional confidence in the asset and potentially raise adoption rates.

According to the disclosures, Ripple has applied for a license to establish a limited-purpose national trust bank. According to the application, this new structure aims to hold Ripple's RLUSD (Ripple USD) reserves and establish a regulated infrastructure for tokenized financial products. It also raises the possibility of direct access to the Fed in the future. According to WrathofKahneman, this initiative isn't targeting individual users. According to the Banking Comprehensive Revision Act (CRA), the regulation doesn't apply to banks that don't provide loans or take deposits and only offer trust-based services. This suggests Ripple's new structure will focus solely on business (B2B) services. Related News: Market Prophet Tom Lee Shares His Bullish Prediction on Ethereum (ETH) Price Ripple's Application Doesn't Provide Any XRP Details Another notable detail is that the application doesn't directly mention XRP. Analysts note that Ripple is attempting to clearly separate XRP from its banking license, aiming to avoid regulatory confusion. However, there's no indication that future XRP integrations are completely ruled out. The application details that Ripple Labs would own the bank, issue special shares to its executives, and that much of the application was kept confidential. This secrecy was interpreted as a sign of a potential initial public offering (IPO) plan. As a result, Ripple is aiming for a national bank license to create a regulated subsidiary to manage its tokenization infrastructure. *This is not investment advice.

In an interview on the Excess Returns YouTube channel, Liz Ann Sonders says investors prefer a calm and steady Fed, even amid pressure from President Trump to cut rates, as inflation remains elevated. Sonders also notes that the Fed’s current pause is perfectly in line with its mandate of low inflation and maximum employment. “I think part of the reason why the market is doing well is because the Fed is not cutting. A combination of because they’re not bowing to political pressure, and oh and by the way, neither side of their dual mandate suggests that they should be cutting. Financial conditions are easy. The unemployment rate is steady, actually has been coming down. Inflation is still above their target. So the conditions just don’t suggest that they should be easing.” The investor points out that a Fed rate cut at this stage could backfire by tightening financial conditions and triggering a market drop. She explains that borrowing costs are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, a rate determined by market forces and not directly set by the Fed. The Charles Schwab executive warns that a cut could push yields higher, making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow. “And there’s a distinct possibility that if the market feels the Fed is prematurely lowering rates, doesn’t have the incentive to do that based on their mandate, that you could have a repeat of what happened as recently as last fall – when the Fed cut by a 100 basis points and the Fed funds rate and the 10-year yield over the same exact span of time went up by a 100 basis points. So this idea that if we just get the Fed to cut rates, that that eases borrowing costs for companies and brings mortgage rates down, suggests a misunderstanding of what rate it is that is tied to borrowing rates for corporations, for individuals. I think part of the reason why the market has done well is because the Fed doesn’t have the conditions that suggest easing.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Arkham has revealed an undisclosed 2020 hack of 127,426 BTC from Chinese mining pool LuBian. The attack exploited weaknesses in LuBian’s private key system, with over 90% of its BTC drained in a single day. LuBian attempted to contact the hacker via Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN feature. On Saturday, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence reported that 127,426 BTC, valued at around $3.5 billion at the time and nearly $14.5 billion today, was stolen from Chinese mining pool LuBian in December 2020. LuBian rose quickly in early 2020, becoming the sixth-largest mining pool on the Bitcoin network by mid-year. Its website promoted it as “the safest high yielding mining pool in the world.” LuBian Vanished in 2021, Sparking Speculation of Shutdown By February 2021, LuBian had disappeared without explanation, fueling speculation that it was either shut down by authorities or quietly converted into a private pool. Arkham’s investigation points to a more dramatic exit: a hack that drained the pool’s holdings. “They appear to have been first hacked on December 28th, 2020 for over 90% of their BTC,” Arkham wrote. The following day, attackers siphoned off another $6 million in BTC and USDT from a LuBian-linked address on the Bitcoin Omni layer. The firm believes the Bitcoin theft stemmed from vulnerabilities in LuBian’s private key generation system, which may have allowed brute-force attacks. While 11,886 BTC, worth roughly $1.35 billion, remains untouched in LuBian’s wallet, none of the stolen coins have moved since July 2024. Interestingly, LuBian attempted to communicate with the attacker using Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN feature. BREAKING: ARKHAM UNCOVERS $3.5B HEIST – THE LARGEST EVER LuBian was a Chinese mining pool with facilities in China & Iran. Based on analysis of on-chain data, it appears that 127,426 BTC was stolen from LuBian in December 2020, worth $3.5 billion at the time and now worth… pic.twitter.com/PnIOKgMt0i — Arkham (@arkham) August 2, 2025 In two transactions, the team wrote: “To the whitehat who is saving our asset, you can contact us… to discuss the return of asset and your reward.” The message included an email address, but it’s unclear if the hacker ever replied. While the Mt. Gox collapse involved more BTC, the LuBian breach is the largest confirmed crypto theft by value at the time of the incident. Bitcoin Hacks, Theft Cost Investors $2.2B in H1 2025: CertiK Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year’s losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion. Without these, losses align more closely with previous years at around $690 million. Ethereum remained the primary target, suffering over $1.6 billion in losses across 175 events. The report also pointed to rising sophistication of phishing schemes and ongoing risks from social engineering, urging crypto users to verify links, avoid suspicious sites, and use hardware wallets.

Bitcoin dropped below $113,000, while Ethereum dipped under $3,500. Several altcoins also saw notable declines, and overall trading volumes spiked as prices moved sharply. Key Stats and Events More than 114,000 traders saw positions closed due to liquidations, totaling over $368 million in value. The majority of these were long positions, as prices dropped quickly across the board. The largest single liquidation was on Binance, where a $2.58 million Solana position was closed automatically. New U.S. tariffs and uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy contributed to a cautious trading environment, encouraging some investors to reduce risk. The release of additional tokens from projects like SUI and Ethena also increased selling pressure. Industry and Community Response BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sold more than $13 million worth of digital assets, including ETH, ENA, and PEPE, and commented that further correction is possible under current economic conditions. On the other hand, Eric Trump took to social media, encouraging investors to consider whether current prices may be an opportunity to buy.

The prominent altcoin now trades around $2.81 with no indication of a potential pause in selling momentum. While this crisis persists, popular X analyst with the username Egrag Crypto has helped identify the currently crucial support and resistance levels for the market bulls. Related Reading: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst Hold $2.65 Or Risk Collapse, Break $3.12 And Set For Rally In an X post on August 2, Egrag Crypto shares an interesting technical insight on the XRP market currently undergoing an intense correction wave. According to the renowned analyst, macro analysis indicates the altcoin retains a bullish structure; however, the present price correction can only be terminated via two pathways. Firstly, micro price analysis suggests that XRP must achieve a daily price close above $3.12 to signal a market bottom entry. In doing so, the cryptocurrency reclaims a pivotal resistance level, paving the way for a potential rise to higher levels such as $3.60. On the other hand, the immediate major support level lies around $2.65. Egrag Crypto explains that a continuous price decline to successfully retest this price floor may ignite a rally, pushing XRP to its current all-time high of $3.84. However, any decisive price break below $2.65 could create a rather dire situation, pointing to potential lows around $2.19. Related Reading: Exchanges Receive 21,400 Bitcoin At A Loss From Short-Term Holders – Retail Capitulation? XRP Surge To $17 Remains On The Cards In other news, Egrag Crypto’s analysis also reveals that XRP remains in a macro, long-term cyclical pattern that shows a multi-year bullish cycle, with recurring structural traits. The key elements in this pattern include bullish pennant formation, which suggests a continuation pattern, the 21 EMA (Green dotted line) that historically aligns with significant trend shifts, the Support Arc (Red line), and the Market Cycle Top (blue line). Notably, XRP has since emerged from the bull pennant signaling intentions to maintain its current uptrend. However, the altcoin faces an insurmountable resistance around $3.84, which aligns with an intersection between the mid-cycle top and the 21 EMA line. If XRP can successfully break past this price barrier, investors should anticipate a direct rally to the projected cycle top $17, representing a potential 525% gain on present market prices. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.81, reflecting a 5.32% decline in the past day as earlier stated. This recent price fall underscores a turbulent trading period for the altcoin, which lost over 11.38% of its market value in the last week. However, a monthly price gain of 22.18% indicates a significant number of investors remain in profit despite these corrections.

Many altcoins continue to trade indecisively, with ETH dropping further away from $3,500 and SOL close to breaking below $160. BTC Bounces Off $112K Bitcoin’s business week began on a relatively familiar note as it jumped toward $120,000 after it erased the losses charted at the end of the previous one. However, as it happened during the last few attempts to take down that resistance, the bears quickly reemerged and didn’t allow BTC to challenge its all-time high, set in mid-July. Within the next few days, the cryptocurrency traded sideways between $117,000 and $119,000 before it dipped slightly on Wednesday evening to $116,000 after the US Fed refused to lower the key interest rates. Although it bounced back to its upper boundary on Thursday morning, the worst was yet to come. Amid political turmoil and global economic uncertainty, BTC’s price went into a correction mode and dropped to $115,000 on Thursday and Friday and below $112,000 on Saturday evening, which became a three-week low. It reacted well to the last price dump and has added over $1,500 since then. Its market cap remains stable on a daily scale at $2.260 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins is above 60%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XRP Joins the Pack Ripple’s native token took yesterday’s correction relatively well , as it remained sideways around the crucial $3 support, while most other alts were deep in the red. However, XRP has joined the adverse party, by losing that coveted support level and dumping roughly 4% to under $2.9 as of press time. Ethereum has extended its gap to $3,500 after another minor daily decline, while SOL and DOGE have dropped by around 1%. The rest of the larger-cap alts are with insignificant losses and gains. Pi Network’s token has bounced off its latest ATL registered yesterday and now sits around 4-5% above it at $0.36. The total crypto market cap stands at essentially the same spot as yesterday at $3.750 trillion, having dropped by almost $250 billion since Thursday morning. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

This Token’s Chart Has Analysts Buzzing for Some Solid Reasons,https://timestabloid.com/from-0-035-to-4-in-under-2-years-this-tokens-chart-has-analysts/,"“This is the kind of chart that makes you stop and pay attention. It has the trajectory of a 100x gem — not because of hype, but because of structure.” That’s how one analyst recently described Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi player that’s quietly gaining momentum while the broader market recalibrates. As mainstream cryptocurrencies waver and retail volume shifts to the sidelines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily climbing — not in silence, but with a rhythm that long-term investors are beginning to recognize. So what exactly is fueling the analyst buzz? It’s not just the chart. It’s the combination of real-world DeFi application, institutional-grade auditing, and well-timed tokenomics. While so many projects rely on narrative alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a system that already looks like it belongs in a top-tier protocol category — with a fast-moving presale and sharp community engagement to back it up. Presale Growth Meets Utility-Driven Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently progressing through Phase 6 of its presale with strong traction. More than 10% of the 170 million MUTM tokens allocated to this phase have already been sold at $0.035. Over 14,800 holders have participated, helping raise over $13.9 million. With the next price jump scheduled at $0.040 — a 15% increase — early buyers stand to benefit from attractive entry points before the token hits its planned listing rate of $0.06. And there’s no shortage of reasons why demand is growing. The platform has already undergone a thorough security review by CertiK, one of the most trusted names in smart contract auditing. The audit scored an impressive 95.00 on Token Scan and a solid 78.00 on the Skynet threat intelligence system. Alongside this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $50,000 bug bounty, signaling its commitment to proactive, community-driven security validation. But security is only one part of the formula. What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more than just another altcoin are its mechanics — purpose-built systems that serve long-term DeFi users. The protocol is preparing to launch on a Layer-2 blockchain, ensuring transactions are faster and far cheaper than typical Ethereum-based platforms. This gives it a clear scalability advantage as user activity begins to surge following its full platform launch. mtToken Yields and a Lending Engine That Pays At the center of the Mutuum ecosystem are mtTokens — smart contract-based tokens that represent user deposits in stablecoins or blue-chip assets. These tokens automatically accrue interest as long as they’re held in the protocol’s lending pools. And when staked in designated smart contracts, they enable users to earn MUTM rewards through a buyback-based dividend system. Revenue generated from the platform’s operations is used to buy MUTM from the open market, which is then distributed to these stakers — effectively creating a supply squeeze over time. The ecosystem is also expected to drive demand through its unique Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending model. In this system, users deposit assets into liquidity pools and receive yield based on pool utilization. Higher utilization leads to increased APYs for lenders. On the borrowing side, users can unlock loans by depositing overcollateralized assets such as ETH, BTC, or stablecoins, with Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios set to ensure systemic stability. For example, a borrower might receive $7,000 in stablecoin liquidity by locking $10,000 worth of Ethereum at a 70% LTV. Alongside this sits the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) module, where borrowers and lenders can directly negotiate loan terms, typically for more exotic or volatile assets. While riskier, this system allows for broader market participation and opens the door to more customized lending opportunities. Stablecoin What’s next on the roadmap only strengthens the long-term outlook. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch its own fully overcollateralized stablecoin — designed to maintain a strict $1 peg by tying minting and burning to borrowing and repayment cycles. Unlike algorithmic models that have historically failed, Mutuum’s system will cap issuance by locking real collateral and using protocol-level interest mechanisms to maintain peg equilibrium. Analyst projections for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaching $4 in the next two years are not just speculative dreams — they are based on fundamental design. From protocol revenue and Layer-2 scaling to security audits CEX listing and a reward model, everything is built for upward pressure. The price is still $0.035, but not for long. Once Phase 6 closes, the price increases to $0.040, and the pathway to $0.06 — and well beyond — will begin accelerating. For those watching the charts, this is not the time to hesitate. It’s the moment to recognize the rare combination of timing, tech, and tokenomics that could make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a dominant force in DeFi.

49461965,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76629,1754215505,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Predicts XRP Price for August 31, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-xrp-price-for-august-31-2025/,"XRP is currently trading at $2.78, down 7.41% from yesterday, as traders weigh market uncertainty and the asset’s potential trajectory. To better understand what may lie ahead for XRP this month, we consulted Google’s Gemini AI, asking it to assess the token’s likely price on August 31. The response was based on technical structure, macroeconomic signals, and Ripple-related factors. Gemini’s analysis suggests that while XRP may not yet be in a breakout phase, the groundwork for a higher valuation is forming, particularly as key macro and crypto market shifts continue to develop in the background. Macro Factors Remain Incomplete One of the most significant inputs in the forecast is U.S. monetary policy. While the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting interest rates later in 2025 , those changes may arrive after August, limiting their near-term impact. As Gemini noted, “economic slowdown concerns may lead to hesitant inflows in Q3,” which could keep crypto investors cautious through the end of the quarter. Additionally, Bitcoin’s expected consolidation during this period plays a role. Gemini suggests that BTC has completed its run and will likely be in a cooling phase by late August. Gemini expects the market to shift toward altcoins as alt season begins , but also anticipates this growth to happen after August. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Positive Signals and Potential Targets Gemini also considered asset-specific trends. The AI acknowledges the potential impact of Ripple’s expanding involvement in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) , alongside Ripple’s increasing global partnerships. The excitement surrounding these developments may be enough to push XRP past key resistance zones in the short term. After evaluating all key drivers, Gemini expects XRP to trade between $3.6 and $5.2 on August 31. The AI model identified $4.45 as the most likely price, marking a new all-time high for the digital asset. Assuming no extreme legal, regulatory, or institutional news emerges beforehand, XRP could smash through multiple resistance zones to cross $4 for the first time in its history. Gemini stated that a move above $6 is unlikely in Q3 without a shock catalyst. Despite recent uncertainty due to a price decline , the outlook for August is optimistic. While short-term headwinds persist, the combination of technical recovery and long-term adoption potential, and positive market factors keeps the asset in a favorable position.

However, this peak is expected to be temporary. According to data from CoinWarz, the next difficulty adjustment—scheduled for August 9—is projected to bring the figure down by approximately 3%, to around 123.7 trillion. Currently, the average block time stands at 10 minutes and 20 seconds, slightly above the protocol’s ideal of 10 minutes. Difficulty adjustments are programmed into the Bitcoin protocol every 2,016 blocks (roughly two weeks), ensuring that the rate of block creation remains steady, even as mining power fluctuates. After a noticeable drop in June and the first half of July, when the mining difficulty slipped to 116.9 trillion , the second half of July saw a strong rebound, reflecting increased computational power from miners. Stock-to-Flow and Its Role in Bitcoin Scarcity Mining difficulty is closely tied to Bitcoin’s hashrate—the total computing power used to validate transactions and secure the network. This dynamic also plays a critical role in preserving Bitcoin’s scarcity through its stock-to-flow (S2F) ratio. The S2F model compares the existing supply of an asset to its rate of new production. A higher S2F ratio generally indicates stronger price stability and resistance to inflation through oversupply. Bitcoin’s S2F ratio is currently higher than that of gold. With about 94% of its maximum 21 million coin supply already mined, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly scarce . Gold, by comparison, has an S2F ratio of around 60 and an annual inflation rate of roughly 2%, while Bitcoin boasts a scarcity ratio of about 120, according to PlanB, the pseudonymous creator of the stock-to-flow pricing model. This makes Bitcoin nearly twice as scarce as gold, underlining its appeal as a deflationary store of value. Mining Difficulty Adjustments Keep Market Stable The mechanism of difficulty adjustment ensures that Bitcoin’s issuance remains steady regardless of sudden surges or declines in mining power. If more miners join the network, the difficulty rises to maintain the 10-minute block interval. Conversely, if miners exit due to lower profitability, the difficulty drops to stabilize block creation. This self-regulating system guards against overproduction, which could otherwise flood the market with new BTC and trigger downward price pressure. As such, the upcoming decrease in mining difficulty is part of the protocol’s built-in resilience—preserving the integrity and long-term value of the Bitcoin network.

According to Master Ananda , Bitcoin’s corrective phase is evident in its nearly 10% decline from mid-July record highs, with the price now testing key support near the previous all-time high. In an August 2 TradingView analysis , Ananda noted that despite the current bearishness, Bitcoin remains within a healthy bullish cycle, characterized by recurring upward momentum followed by expected pullbacks. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Therefore, the current correction appears to be part of a broader pattern of price fluctuations that historically set the stage for new highs. If past trends hold, this consolidation could pave the way for a renewed rally toward fresh all-time highs. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch The analyst highlighted strong support between $110,000 and $100,000, with $100,000 acting as a key technical and psychological level. Additional pullback zones are marked by Fibonacci retracement levels, with the 0.382 level around $106,000 and the 0.5 level near $102,000. As long as Bitcoin stays above $100,000, the long-term bullish trend remains intact. A weekly or monthly close below that level would prompt a reassessment. Past cycles suggest a period of sideways consolidation before a renewed uptrend. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin took a hit alongside the equities market as investors were rattled by disappointing July jobs data and uncertainty stemming from sweeping U.S. trade tariffs. Meanwhile, according to another cryptocurrency analyst, Ali Martinez, in an August 2 X post , Bitcoin is finding strong support at $107,160, where over 111,000 BTC have been accumulated, based on Glassnode data. This level marks the largest buy zone below the current price, reinforcing it as a critical floor. Martinez also noted that resistance is building at $117,400, where 88,000 BTC were purchased. $107,160 continues to emerge as a crucial support level for Bitcoin $BTC ! pic.twitter.com/izOejLbagA — Ali (@ali_charts) August 2, 2025 Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $113,651, having posted a modest gain of less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, however, the leading digital asset is down over 4%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

The London-based Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System (CIFAS) says it is witnessing a surge in Android malware attacks targeting banking apps. CIFAS says that while the malware targets Android users, other mobile platforms are not immune to attacks, noting that the malicious software may have hit 200,000 victims in just six months. “These malicious apps often look like legitimate tools – such as file managers, PDF readers, phone cleaners, or even browsers like Google Chrome. Once installed, they can appear harmless but later activate harmful features through hidden updates. Key techniques criminals use include: Overlaying fake login screens on top of real banking apps to steal login credentials. Displaying deceptive ‘busy’ or ‘waiting’ screens to mask fraudulent activity. Preventing users from exiting the app or restarting their device. Requesting excessive permissions, especially ‘accessibility’ access.” According to CIFAS, users should be on the lookout for signs that their phones are infected with malware, including prompts to reauthenticate during a banking session, “busy” messages from banking apps, unexpected notifications to update or install Google Chrome and prompts to grant unusual permissions, particularly accessibility access. Says CIFAS CEO Mike Haley, “The surge in Android malware is not just a tech issue – it’s a growing threat to consumers and to banking services we all rely on. Criminals are evolving their tactics faster than ever, using deception and stealth to bypass traditional security measures. The best defence is awareness. If something feels off – an unexpected update, a strange app request – stop before you tap and always seek a second opinion. Education and vigilance are our frontline tools in the fight against fraud.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

On the other hand, investor attention is quietly moving to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a novel utility-focused crypto project that’s gaining traction for its utility in decentralized lending markets. On offer for a token price of just $0.035 and predicted to shoot up to $7 by some analysts, Mutuum’s unique positioning in the DeFi market is responsible for this shift. As XRP grapples with resistance, the spotlight is going quietly to those protocols that are delivering hard use cases, of which Mutuum Finance is emerging as a potential leader among them. XRP Drops Below $3 as Technical Weakness Looms Over It XRP is trading at approximately $2.95 currently, down around 3–4% over the past day and below the critical $3.00 level following recent resistance that put the July rally to an end. Momentum indicators, including RSI getting stuck in the low 40s and small indecisive candles, indicate the bullish energy is waning, but spikes in open interest and whale accumulation points to profit-taking at recent highs around $3.60. Analysts caution that XRP will not reclaim the base level of $3.00, it would test levels around $2.80 or lower. At the same time, investor interest gradually moves towards DeFi utility tokens such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Growth Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 during stage 6 of presale. The token price will rise by 14.29% to $0.04 in phase 7. The ROI for phase 6 buyers amounts to 71.43% since the token enters the market at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has already surpassed the $13.8 million in funding. The project has been capable of onboarding over 14,800 investors so far. New Wave of DeFi Lending Through double models of MUTM lending – Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer frameworks – users get more freedom and efficiency. Smart contracts are utilized to provide human-less lending within the Peer-to-Contract model. Dynamic interest rates automatically balance the smart contracts to generate high interest rates. Peer-to-Peer architecture excludes middlemen and provides lenders and borrowers with direct access to each other. Enhancing DeFi Security With $50K Bug Bounty and Incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . There will be 10 winners who will get $10,000 MUTM tokens each. The project has also launched a new top 50 leaderboard of token holders who will be awarded bonus tokens based on their ranks. In order to further strengthen its platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced a Bug Bounty Program for $50,000 in partnership with CertiK. All bugs will be rewarded, and the bounty will be awarded at four tiers, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Ripple (XRP) is struggling to hold onto the $3 level, showing signs of losing traction. As investors grow cautious, the majority are shifting focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new utility cryptocurrency that only costs $0.035. It is currently at Presale Stage 6, with the following stage rising by 14.29% to $0.04. MUTM will be launched at $0.06, with early adopters registering a 71.43% gain from day one. With over $13.8 million raised and 14,800+ backers, interest is growing extremely quickly. The project also boasts a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a $100K token giveaway, and practical real-life DeFi applications. Analysts think it could soar to $7, making it one of the most speculative tokens on the market. Get into the presale today before the next price spike shuts this window of opportunity.

Pepe Dollar, Token6900 and BlockchainFX (BFX)",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/which-top-crypto-presale-will-break-1b-marketcap-first-pepe-dollar-token6900-and-blockchainfx-bfx,"2025’s crypto presale season is shaping up to be one of the most competitive ever. Three standout projects—Pepe Dollar (PEPD), BlockchainFX (BFX), and Token6900 ($T6900)—are battling for early dominance. Each offers a unique angle: Pepe Dollar (PEPD) leads the meme finance narrative, BFX delivers fintech-grade trading utility, and Token6900 promises AI-backed Web3 chaos. But which will break the $1 billion market cap first? Pepe Dollar (PEPD): Meme-Fi Meets Monetary Parody Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is the front-runner in terms of retail buzz. It’s not just another meme coin—it’s a satirical takedown of the U.S. Federal Reserve, complete with deflationary token burns marketed as “shutdowns.” With plans for Layer-2 compatibility, meme staking, and social dApp integrations, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has carved a unique lane in the MemeFi space. PEPD has already raised over $925,000 in Stage 1 at just $0.004688 per token, with over 73% of tokens sold. Analysts believe that once its roadmap activates—including meme casino apps and real-time burns—its virality alone could drive it to unicorn status. Its utility lies in its community, scarcity, and layered cultural value—a rare trio in meme tokens. Join Pepe Dollar Presale:Pepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/ Pepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity PEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar BlockchainFX (BFX): The Fintech Heavyweight in Presale BFX is the more traditional contender, offering high-yield staking, up to 70% fee redistribution, and a real trading super app. It has raised over $4.4 million, boasts 10,000+ users, and supports over 500 tradable assets—crypto, stocks, commodities, and forex. Early adopters earn USDT rewards, and its presale price of $0.017 aims for a $0.05 launch. With CEX listings secured and volume ramping up, BFX looks like the next Binance-style play. But BFX faces a challenge: unlike Pepe Dollar (PEPD) , it requires continued usage, fees, and daily volume to sustain value. It may reach $1B eventually, but its growth depends on platform performance and broader market conditions. Token6900 ($T6900): Wild Card with AI Intrigue Token6900 is newer but gaining traction fast due to its chaotic branding, AI integration promises, and edgy marketing. Though early in its presale phase, it draws in the Telegram generation and Reddit traders who missed out on Dogecoin, Shiba, and PEPE. With meme power and AI mystique combined, it may become a dark horse. However, it lacks the solid roadmap that Pepe Dollar (PEPD) and BFX present. Investors are split—some love the unpredictability, others see it as a risk. Without stronger fundamentals, breaking the $1B cap may depend on social virality alone. Who Breaks $1B First? The Case for Pepe Dollar (PEPD) If current trends continue, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is likely to be the first among the three to hit a $1 billion market cap. It offers: Deflationary supply via token burns Cultural relevance and meme branding Layer-2 compatibility and memeFi utility Early investor traction and whale support BFX will appeal to those seeking long-term financial systems, while Token6900 is for thrill-seekers and meme chasers. But PEPD splits the middle—it’s funny, functional, and fundamentally scarce. Conclusion: MemeFi May Lead the Charge All three projects are serious contenders, but Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has the momentum, tokenomics, and cultural juice to lead the unicorn pack. BlockchainFX (BFX) may follow closely behind as adoption grows, while Token6900 could surprise if virality spikes. For now, PEPD’s fusion of satire, scarcity, and scalability makes it the likeliest to claim that $1B throne first.

Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6, with the token priced at $0.035, an increase of 16.17% from the previous phase. The next price rise is set at 14.29%, which will take the token to $0.04. Presale buyers who invest during this phase will experience a return on investment of 71.43% upon launch of the token at $0.06. MUTM presale has raised more than $13.9 million and gained more than 14,800 unique holders. While SOL continues to push upward amid broader Layer-1 optimism, the disruptive promise of Mutuum Finance is capturing headlines and reshaping the conversation around high-upside altcoins this month. Solana (SOL): Charging Toward $300 as Key Resistance Levels Shift Solana is currently trading around $168, consolidating below the critical $170 price zone, which has recently transitioned from support to resistance as institutional accumulation strengthens and technical patterns stabilize. Confirmed weekly close above $179–$185 could trigger a breakout toward $280–$300 by late 2025 fueled by bullish chart structures like rising bull flags and falling wedge breakouts. Conservative outlooks on the other hand warn that underperforming network metrics and slower new address growth may limit upside with potential support levels in the $150–$160 range if sentiment cools. As SOL seeks its next leg up investor interest is also expanding toward emerging DeFi platforms like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance just ended its Phase 5 presale and moved into Phase 6, with its tokens selling at $0.035. The next price adjustment will see another 14.29% increase to take the token price to $0.04. Early investors will enjoy a 71.43% ROI when the token falls at $0.06. The presale of MUTM already raised more than $13.9 million and acquired more than 14,800 individual holders. $50K Bug Bounty Launched as Mutuum Finance Joins Forces with CertiK Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a Bug Bounty Program. The program reward pool is $50,000 USDT. Four severities i.e. low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded. The move showcases the objective of Mutuum Finance to create community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been extensively audited by Certik for user fund security and blockchain security. The triumph is a success of Mutuum Finance’s vision of being an open and institutional-grade DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Announces Humongous Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway wherein the users will be rewarded in $10,000 MUTM tokens. Its recently launched leaderboard system will also reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders. Solana (SOL) is showing strength with a possible move toward $300, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could deliver even bigger returns. Analysts forecast a 45x growth for MUTM by the end of 2025. Right now, the token is in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, with the next price increase set at $0.04. Early buyers are guaranteed a 71.43% ROI at launch price $0.06. So far, over $13.9 million has been raised, and 14,800 investors have joined. Backed by CertiK, a $50K bug bounty, and a $100K giveaway, MUTM is quickly gaining momentum.

According to Krüger, this sharp market correction was shaped by a combination of macroeconomic developments and negative crypto-specific news flow. Krüger recalled the August 2024 crash, explaining that the decline during that period began with a Bank of Japan interest rate hike and was fueled by a hawkish Fed and weak employment data, leading to panic. The analyst noted that a similar dynamic prevails in today's scenario, explaining that while there's no carry trade effect, a hawkish Fed, complex corporate balance sheets, strong personal consumption expenditure inflation, and sharp stock market profit sales are shaping the picture. Krüger, who described political developments such as US President Trump's dismissal of the head of the Bureau of Statistics (BLS) and nuclear war rhetoric as “market noise,” stated that the real decline was accelerated by the liquidation of leveraged investors rather than such statements. He noted that Bitcoin formed a local bottom following a sharp sell-off. Krüger also touched on developments in the crypto market this week. Coinbase's weak balance sheet, the possibility of MicroStrategy shutting down its share sales mechanism, and sustainability concerns regarding the “Digital Asset Treasury Company” model on the ETH side are among the factors increasing market pressure. However, according to the analyst, the SEC's “Project Crypto” initiative is a significant step toward bringing securities laws onto-chain and is quite positive for the market in the long term. Related News: Market Prophet Tom Lee Shares His Bullish Prediction on Ethereum (ETH) Price Krüger believes the market has either bottomed out with today's sharp sell-off, or that the bottom will form on Monday, along with stocks. “We're seeing a repeat of last year's August crash,” he said. “I'll be adding to my long positions before the US markets open on Monday,” he said, describing the decline as an aggressive “shake-up.” According to Krüger, one of the critical turning points for markets is the Jackson Hole meeting and a potential interest rate cut in September. He argued that the departure of Fed Governor Kugler provides Trump with an early appointment opportunity, which could provide a dovish counterbalance to the hawkish Fed leader Powell. Krüger is optimistic about the medium-term outlook for the crypto market. He argues that the market will continue its upward trend with interest rate cuts and increased crypto adoption starting in September. He also stated that a full-blown dovish Fed approach, particularly starting in May 2026, could propel Bitcoin into the $200,000-$250,000 range. However, he adds a caveat: the loss of momentum from digital asset treasury companies and the inflationary pressures of US tariffs could lead to some market complications at the end of the year. However, he considers these to be secondary for now. *This is not investment advice.

Those who got in early watched a few dollars turn into life-changing fortunes. But as the market matures and regulatory pressure mounts, the original Bitcoin is beginning to feel more like a relic of a bygone era than a financial revolution. Today, a new contender is rising with a model that rewards participation from the start, runs faster, and aligns with the next generation of AI-powered finance. That contender is Bitcoin Swift (BTC3), and it is quickly earning the spotlight for those chasing financial freedom in 2025. A New Era Begins With BTC3 Bitcoin Swift is more than just a blockchain. It’s a complete financial infrastructure built from the ground up with scalability, compliance, and programmable rewards at its core. The current presale is offering participants a real-time APY of 121%, made possible by its Proof-of-Yield (PoY) system. Instead of waiting for exchange listings or passive holding, BTC3 users start earning from day one. This is why BTC3 is being hailed as a fast lane toward real returns and real freedom. A Presale That Delivers Real Utility Bitcoin Swift is now in Stage 3 of its presale, with the current price at $3. Stage 4 is set to increase to $4, and the launch price is locked at $15. Unlike other tokens, BTC3’s presale isn’t about hype alone. Participants unlock governance access and start earning programmable staking rewards immediately. These PoY rewards are distributed at the end of each presale stage, offering real yield before the token even lists. With only 64 days in total, it stands as one of the shortest presales on the market. Influencers such as Crypto Show are highlighting how BTC3 sets a new standard for transparency and early-stage participation. AI Energy Efficiency and Governance That Works BTC3’s infrastructure is built to scale sustainably. AI oracles measure and reward energy efficiency, optimizing the system to incentivize low-carbon network usage. On the governance side, BTC3 blends decentralized identity systems with AI-powered proposal screening. This means community members with verified IDs and strong reputations can help steer protocol upgrades through quadratic voting. Two key verifications also support its institutional appeal: Spywolf has confirmed project KYC Solidproof has completed an in-depth smart contract audit BTC3 Roadmap BTC3’s development is paced for aggressive and impactful growth: Q3 2025: Presale launch and PoY rewards begin on Solana Q1 2026: Launch of AI-powered smart contracts and learning agents Q2 2026: Deployment of zk-SNARK ledger and shielded identity tools Q3 2026: On-chain AI governance rollout and DAO integration Q4 2026: BTC3 mainnet goes live with institutional onboarding This roadmap reflects a real commitment to utility and long-term decentralization. Conclusion Bitcoin Swift is not trying to imitate the past. It’s paving a new path for financial freedom that works now, not years from now. With AI-driven systems, energy efficiency, transparent rewards, and a presale that gives power and payouts to early users, BTC3 is redefining what it means to invest in crypto. Old Bitcoin might have created the first wave of millionaires, but Bitcoin Swift is creating the next wave. And for those who value timing, the moment to join is now.

At current prices, the value of the stolen bitcoins is approximately $14.5 billion. According to Arkham, the theft was made possible by a vulnerability in LuBian's private key generation process. The analytics company Arkham Intelligence said it has discovered the largest Bitcoin theft in history. According to experts, in 2020, the Chinese mining pool LuBian had 127,426 BTC stolen. At that time, the value was about $3.5 billion; at the current exchange rate, the stolen assets are worth over $14.5 billion. According to Arkham, the attack occurred on December 28, 2020. The hacker withdrew over 90% of the pool’s assets before LuBian could transfer the remaining 11,886 BTC to backup wallets. Despite the scale of the incident, neither the pool nor the attackers disclosed information about the theft; details have only now come to light. At the time, LuBian was one of the six largest Bitcoin mining pools. On its website, it called itself “the safest high-yield pool in the world.” In February 2021, however, the project suddenly disappeared, which was attributed at the time to government intervention or a transition to closed operations. Arkham now claims the theft was the true reason. The company notes that LuBian used a private key generation algorithm that was vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This vulnerability may have been the primary vector for the hack. To try to contact the hacker, the pool sent 1,516 messages via the OP_RETURN field, spending about 1.4 BTC in the process. “One message read, ‘To the white hat hacker who is saving our assets. Contact us to discuss a return and your reward.’” However, there was no response. According to reports, the stolen bitcoins remain untouched, which has led some to believe the hacker may have been caught or is concerned that moving the funds will trigger investigations. The LuBian theft was larger than other high-profile attacks and set a new record in the industry. Previously, the largest hack was considered to be the raid on the Bybit exchange, in which the platform lost $1.5 billion. Arkham emphasizes that the LuBian case is a reminder of the need for strict security measures in the crypto industry. The company recommends using only reliable random number generators when creating private keys and employing multi-layered security to store digital assets.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|ARKM|MINING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-03 10:50:55

Let’s find out more. Bitcoin Bitcoin dominance recently dropped all the way from 66% down to 60.5% , giving some of the altcoins the respite needed to make some decent upside movements. DeFi Assets tokenized through Brickken are now compatible with Credefi’s upgraded P2P Lending platform, allowing users to borrow and lend USDC using real-world assets as collateral. A 27-minute API outage on Hyperliquid’s decentralized exchange left traders locked out during critical market movements, raising concerns over platform stability and transparency. SquadSwap is positioning itself as the go-to DEX for serious traders on the BNB Chain with its new user interface (UI) launch in July 2025 and powerful trading features rivalling traditional exchanges. Business Coinbase is set to launch tokenized stocks, derivatives, and prediction markets for US users, as it ramps up efforts to become a comprehensive on-chain trading platform. CoinDCX has denied speculation about a potential acquisition by Coinbase, reaffirming its commitment to the Indian market as it works to recover from a recent $44 million security breach. PayPal has announced a new feature allowing U.S. merchants to accept payments in over 100 cryptocurrencies, aiming to reduce cross-border transaction costs and expand access to a growing global crypto user base. Interactive Brokers is considering launching a stablecoin and enabling 24/7 digital asset funding, signaling a broader move into crypto amid growing institutional adoption. Web3 While many gaming tokens struggled to stay relevant this year, FUNToken ($FUN) has nearly tripled since early April, when it traded between $0.005 and $0.007, Restaking provider Ether.fi has introduced one-click deposits for its cross-chain vaults after integrating Enso's “shortcut” widget to simplify the process of participating in restaking. Institutional trading desk Caladan has announced the integration of stETH as eligible collateral on its over-the-counter (OTC) platform, broadening the toolkit available to professional crypto market participants. Mythical Games’ latest Web3 mobile game, FIFA Rivals , has broken all records in becoming the studio’s fastest game to reach one million downloads. The native token of leading web3 payments provider Hyperlink, HYPE , has just been listed by Transak. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has finally “come back to life” after a prolonged decline, which was particularly noticeable in the ETH/BTC pair. Despite the recent rally, Ether is still trading almost 50% below its all-time high of ~$4,900, reached in November 2021. AiTube founder Marie has published the AISM (Artificial Intelligence Singularity Manifesto), which explains in detail why the scenario of human reservation under the control of a superintelligence seems realistic and why each of us may need a digital “thank you” on the blockchain. Security A CoinDCX employee was tricked by a fake part-time job scam, allowing hackers to steal $44 million from the exchange’s internal wallet. Regulation Crypto lobby group DeFi Education Fund has urged the US Senate Banking Committee to rethink how it intends to regulate the decentralized finance industry. Cboe BZX has filed with the SEC to list the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF, aiming to offer direct exposure to Solana with a built-in staking feature, signaling growing institutional interest in Layer 1 crypto assets. The White House has unveiled a comprehensive roadmap aimed at transforming the United States into a global leader in cryptocurrency regulation and innovation.

According to data from CoinWarz, mining difficulty climbed to a record 127.6 trillion this week. At the same time, Bitcoin fell by 3%, touching an intraday low of $113,005 before edging back to $113,250 by 7:30 pm ET. Related Reading: XRP ETF Approval Incoming? Analyst Eyes September-October Window Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High Based on analysis, difficulty will drop by roughly 3% on August 9, bringing it down to nearly 124 trillion. That adjustment follows a routine cycle every 2,016 blocks, or about two weeks, where the protocol tweaks how hard it is to mine a block. Difficulty makes sure blocks come out at a pace the system can handle. The challenge is tied to how much computing power, or hashrate, miners pour into the network. When more machines join, difficulty goes up. When some stop hashing, it comes down. In June, the difficulty slid to a low of 117 trillion, but it bounced back in late July and has been climbing since. At the moment, blocks are taking about 10 minutes and 20 seconds each on average, a bit slower than the 10-minute goal. When times drift too far off, the next adjustment nudges difficulty up or down to reel block times back toward 10 minutes. Miners Feel The Squeeze Higher difficulty means miners need more energy and better gear just to break even. With Bitcoin’s price under pressure, some older or less efficient operations could face real losses. Reports have disclosed that only the sharpest setups will likely stay in business if this pairing of high difficulty and low prices lasts. Mining firms track their costs closely. If electricity, hardware and maintenance bills outpace what they earn from block rewards, they may have to switch off rigs. The upcoming 3% ease in difficulty might let a few marginal players stick around a bit longer. Still, margins will be thin until the next major price move. Related Reading: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst Price Tumbles And Recovers Slightly Based on data, Bitcoin slipped to $113,005—a 3% drop—before finding some buying at lower levels. By early evening, it had rebounded to $113,250. That quick swing highlights how mining and market moves feed off each other. When hopes of easier mining fade, price can wobble. When price dips, miners feel squeezed and may power down, which in turn can lead to easier difficulty again.

Recently, the focus has shifted to two major players, XRP and Solana, and a newcomer, XYZVerse, which is creating buzz for its innovative approach and potential high returns. An Overview of XRP and Its Market Dynamics XRP, known for its quick transaction capabilities, continues to intrigue investors with its potential for widespread adoption.

The future growth of Solana is much anticipated, with analysts predicting significant price increases in the coming years. The Emergence of XYZVerse and Its Market Potential The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with the potential of XYZVerse, a new entrant that is catching the eyes of investors and enthusiasts alike. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, XYZVerse integrates the thrill of sports with the dynamics of digital currency, creating a unique niche for itself.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin ETFs saw $812M in outflows on Friday, marking the second-largest single-day loss on record. Ether ETFs ended a 20-day inflow streak with $152M in redemptions. Institutional appetite for Ethereum appears to be growing, with corporate treasuries now holding 2.73 million ETH. The sudden reversal wiped out a week’s worth of inflows and cut cumulative net gains to $54.18 billion. Total assets under management (AUM) across Bitcoin ETFs dropped to $146.48 billion, equivalent to 6.46% of the cryptocurrency’s total market capitalization, according to data from SoSoValue . Fidelity and ARK Lead Bitcoin ETF Outflows With Over $659M Pulled Fidelity’s FBTC saw the largest drawdown, with $331.42 million in redemptions, followed closely by ARK Invest’s ARKB, which lost $327.93 million. Grayscale’s GBTC also recorded significant outflows of $66.79 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT posted a relatively modest $2.58 million loss. Despite the capital flight, trading activity remained robust. Total volume across all spot Bitcoin ETFs hit $6.13 billion, with IBIT alone accounting for $4.54 billion, suggesting that institutional interest hasn’t fully evaporated. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs broke their 20-day inflow streak, their longest to date, logging $152.26 million in net outflows on the same day. The total AUM for Ether ETFs now stands at $20.11 billion, or 4.70% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Grayscale’s ETHE led the outflows with $47.68 million in redemptions, followed by Bitwise’s ETHW with $40.30 million and Fidelity’s FETH with $6.17 million. BlackRock’s ETHA remained unchanged, holding firm at $10.71 billion. Overall trading volume across Ether ETFs reached $2.26 billion, with Grayscale’s product contributing nearly $289 million of that total. The Bitcoin ETFs had $812M worth of outflows yesterday. The 2nd largest outflow day in history. Should we be worried? pic.twitter.com/YdiPolJODE — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) August 3, 2025 Just weeks ago, Ether ETFs were setting records. On July 16, they pulled in $726.74 million in net inflows , the largest daily total since their inception, followed by $602.02 million the next day, reflecting a surge in demand. Part of that momentum appears to be fueled by rising institutional interest in Ethereum as a strategic treasury asset. Last week, Ether Machine, backed by several high-profile industry investors including Pantera Capital and Kraken, announced purchasing 15,000 ETH as part of its long-term treasury strategy. Likewise, BitMine Immersion Technologies recently acquired $2 billion worth of ETH over a 16-day span, making it the largest corporate holder of Ethereum. In total, corporate treasuries now hold 2.73 million ETH, representing 2.26% of the asset’s circulating supply, according to Strategic Ether Reserves. 95% Approval Chance for Spot Solana, XRP ETFS As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. As reported, Singapore-headquartered edtech firm Genius Group has doubled its Bitcoin holdings to 200 BTC after acquiring 20 BTC last week, part of a wider strategy to build a 10,000-BTC treasury.

Many traders are searching for the next big move, with attention turning to XYZVerse. Some early forecasts hint at major gains ahead. Interest is building as investors ask if XYZVerse could become the next breakout token. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005 . At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits XRP: The Border-Blurring Coin Built for Instant Moves XRP is a digital coin made for movement. It lives on the XRP Ledger, a public network that no single group controls. Payments clear in seconds, cost less than a cent, and cannot be reversed or faked. You do not need a bank to send or receive it, only an internet link. The coin was born when Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz set aside 100 billion units. They gave 80 billion to their new firm, Ripple, which locked most of that stash in timed vaults to release bit by bit. In today’s cycle, speed and low fees matter more than ever. Bitcoin can feel slow, and even Ethereum gets busy. XRP keeps racing, moving value across borders like a text message. That edge has renewed talk of wider use by money apps and shops. Fresh interest often follows each court headline, and the next bull run may reward coins with real-world tasks. If users and partners keep growing, the fixed supply and planned releases could squeeze toward higher prices. For traders hunting utility plus upside, XRP still looks lively. Lightning Blocks: How SOL Sprints Ahead of the Pack Solana was built for speed. Its network can handle many trades and messages at once, yet it keeps fees low. Developers can write programs in several common languages, so new games, art markets, and finance tools pop up quickly. The SOL coin fuels it all. People use SOL to pay for moves on the network, power custom apps, and earn rewards for helping run the system. Right now, crowded chains like Ethereum often slow down when traffic spikes. Cardano moves steadily but adds features more slowly. Solana skips extra layers and complex splits, choosing one big, fast highway instead. If the next market upswing favors platforms that can host busy apps—think viral games or live ticket sales—SOL could gain fresh attention. Prices have already bounced with each new project launch. While no coin is a sure bet, Solana’s mix of speed, low cost, and growing community makes it one of the brighter picks for the current cycle. Conclusion XRP and SOL remain strong, but the first all-sport memecoin, XYZVerse, stands out with its unique sports community focus and bold growth plans, offering early adopters a promising new movement.

With Bitcoin prices now significantly higher, the stolen funds are valued at over $14.5 billion, making this the largest crypto hack in history. According to Arkham, the attack took place on December 28, 2020, but remained unreported for years. LuBian, which had risen to become the sixth-largest Bitcoin mining pool at the time, lost nearly 90% of its holdings before it could move the remaining 11,886 BTC to recovery wallets. The hacker and the pool both chose not to make the theft public, and the stolen assets remained hidden on-chain until the latest analysis uncovered the breach. LuBian Hack: Private Key Vulnerability A key detail that may have led to the successful hack lies in LuBian’s flawed private key generation method. Arkham suggests that LuBian was likely using an insecure algorithm vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This kind of weakness in cryptographic key generation can be fatal in the world of decentralized finance, where there are no intermediaries to recover stolen assets. In a remarkable attempt to communicate with the thief, LuBian reportedly sent 1,516 messages via OP_RETURN—an on-chain method for embedding text into Bitcoin transactions—directly to the hacker’s wallet addresses. This cost LuBian an additional 1.4 BTC, showcasing their desperation to perhaps negotiate or recover funds. The revelation casts a spotlight on the critical importance of secure key management. With Bitcoin’s supply fixed and prices soaring, the stakes are higher than ever. Experts emphasize using only secure, entropy-rich random number generators when creating private keys, as even a single weak link can expose massive amounts of funds. String of High-Profile Heists Underscores Ongoing Risks While LuBian’s hack is now the largest in crypto history, it joins a troubling trend of major security breaches in the sector. In February 2025, crypto exchange ByBit was compromised for $1.5 billion , then regarded as the largest known crypto theft. That incident was traced back to a SafeWallet developer’s compromised device, allowing hackers to exploit AWS credentials without detection. Just two months later, an individual lost $330 million in Bitcoin through a social engineering scam . The attacker laundered funds through 300 different wallets, and only a fraction—$7 million—was frozen in time.

A Manhattan judge granted 37-year-old John Woeltz bail, releasing him from Rikers Island, where he was detained after his arrest on May 23rd, reports the New York Post. Woeltz allegedly kidnapped and tortured Bitcoin investor Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan in a Manhattan apartment, where he was beaten and had his family’s lives threatened to get him to give up his Bitcoin wallet passphrase. Carturan said he was considering giving up access to his wallet with $100 million in BTC when he thought Woeltz was going to shoot him. But when Woeltz left to retrieve his laptop in another room, the victim used the chance to escape the apartment and flag down a traffic officer in the street for help. But before escaping, Carturan was allegedly bound by the wrists and tortured for weeks inside the apartment, including being drugged, shocked with electricity, hit in the head with a firearm and dangled over a flight of stairs Manhattan Judge Gregory Carro says that the torture can be seen as “fraternity-like hazing.” At a previous hearing, Woeltz’s lawyer, Wayne Gosnell, brushed off the alleged torture scheme and claimed that Carturan was essentially just being hazed. John Woeltz was ordered to home confinement and agreed to leave his apartment only for emergencies, doctor appointments and lawyer meetings.

As of press time, ADA was trading at $0.73, having gained over 2% in the last 24 hours. However, on the weekly chart, the asset remains down about 8%. ADA seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold ADA price prediction For its price outlook, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which projected that ADA could trade between $0.82 and $1.05 by August 31, 2025, assuming stable market conditions and no major disruptions in the broader crypto space. The model noted that at current levels, ADA is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, a technical setup that often precedes significant price moves. Historically, ADA has posted gains of 15% to 35% following breakouts from similar formations. Therefore, a clear move above the $0.75 resistance level could pave the way for a rally toward the $0.90 and $1 range. The forecast also factored in the broader market context, particularly Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum’s ( ETH ) ongoing correction . If Bitcoin holds its current support, ADA may follow with a delayed but sharper rally, consistent with prior market cycles. At the same time, ChatGPT cautioned that a drop below Bitcoin’s $105,000 support could push ADA down to the $0.68 to $0.72 range. The base case remains $0.82 and $0.95, with a bullish scenario pointing to $1 and $1.05 if conditions improve. ADA price prediction.

This remarkable ascent, as observed through Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at an impressive $114,000 on the Binance USDT market. Such a substantial leap not only reignites enthusiasm among long-time holders but also draws the eyes of new investors and financial institutions, eager to understand the forces behind this monumental climb. What does this latest surge in Bitcoin price signify for the digital asset landscape, and what factors are contributing to this incredible momentum? What Propelled This Bitcoin Price Surge? Understanding the drivers behind such a significant increase in Bitcoin price requires a look at various intertwined market dynamics. Several key elements often contribute to Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, ranging from fundamental economic principles to shifts in investor sentiment and technological advancements. Increased Institutional Adoption: A growing number of traditional financial institutions are integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and services. This includes major investment firms, corporations, and even some sovereign wealth funds recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Their entry brings substantial capital and adds a layer of credibility to the market. Supply Dynamics and Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, and its issuance rate is periodically cut in half through events known as ‘halvings’. These events reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, and historically, they have been followed by significant price rallies due to increased scarcity. Macroeconomic Factors: In times of economic uncertainty or inflation concerns, investors often seek alternative assets to preserve wealth. Bitcoin, sometimes referred to as ‘digital gold,’ has increasingly been viewed as a hedge against traditional market volatility and currency devaluation. Technological Advancements and Network Growth: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability (e.g., the Lightning Network) and increased utility, enhances its appeal. A growing number of users and transactions also signal a healthy and expanding network. To put the current Bitcoin price in context, let’s consider some illustrative market indicators: Metric Pre-Surge Value (Illustrative) Current Value (Illustrative) Bitcoin Price (USD) $100,000 $114,000 Market Capitalization ~ $1.9 Trillion ~ $2.2 Trillion Daily Trading Volume ~ $30 Billion ~ $50 Billion How Does This Bitcoin Price Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency market means its movements often have a ripple effect across other digital assets. When the Bitcoin price experiences a significant surge, it typically boosts investor confidence across the board, leading to positive movements in altcoins as well. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ‘altcoin season’ or ‘altcoin rally,’ where capital flows from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies as investors seek higher returns. The increased visibility from Bitcoin’s performance also attracts new capital into the entire crypto ecosystem. Individuals and institutions who might have been hesitant to enter the market often see Bitcoin’s strong performance as a signal of broader market health and potential. This influx of new money can benefit various projects, from established altcoins like Ethereum and Solana to newer, emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) platforms. Are There Historical Parallels to This Bitcoin Price Movement? Examining past cycles of Bitcoin price movements can offer valuable perspective. Bitcoin has a history of dramatic price swings, including several parabolic rallies followed by significant corrections. For instance, the rallies in 2017 and 2021 saw Bitcoin reach unprecedented highs, each time fueled by different combinations of retail enthusiasm, institutional interest, and technological milestones. While past performance is not indicative of future results, these historical patterns highlight Bitcoin’s inherent volatility and its capacity for rapid growth. Each major price surge tends to be accompanied by increased public awareness, media coverage, and debates about its role in the global financial system. The current move to $114,000 echoes these past cycles in its swiftness and the renewed attention it brings to the digital asset space. What Challenges and Opportunities Arise from This Bitcoin Price Level? While a surging Bitcoin price brings significant opportunities, it also comes with inherent challenges. Understanding both sides is crucial for anyone engaging with this dynamic asset. Opportunities: Increased Wealth Creation: For early adopters and long-term holders, a rising Bitcoin price translates directly into substantial gains, potentially creating new wealth. Enhanced Legitimacy: Higher prices and sustained growth contribute to Bitcoin’s perception as a legitimate and valuable asset, potentially accelerating mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity. Innovation and Development: A strong market often attracts more talent and investment into the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, fostering innovation in areas like scalability, security, and new applications. Broader Economic Impact: The growth of the crypto economy can have wider economic implications, from job creation in the tech sector to new financial services. Challenges: Volatility: Despite reaching new highs, Bitcoin remains highly volatile. Sharp corrections can occur swiftly, leading to significant losses for those unprepared for market fluctuations. Regulatory Scrutiny: As the Bitcoin price and market capitalization grow, so does the attention from regulators worldwide. This can lead to new regulations that might impact its use, trading, or taxation. Market Manipulation Concerns: The relatively nascent nature of the crypto market means it can be susceptible to large-scale market manipulation, though increasing institutional involvement is helping to mitigate some of these risks. Security Risks: While the Bitcoin network itself is secure, individual investors face risks from hacks, phishing scams, and improper storage of their digital assets. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for the Bitcoin Price Enthusiast For those interested in the evolving landscape of Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market, adopting a strategic and informed approach is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, take the time to understand Bitcoin’s technology, its market dynamics, and the risks involved. Rely on reputable sources and diverse perspectives. Understand Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies are speculative assets. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Define your personal risk tolerance and stick to it. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a dominant asset, consider diversifying your cryptocurrency holdings to include other promising projects, or diversifying across different asset classes altogether. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves quickly. Keep up-to-date with market news, technological developments, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends that could influence the Bitcoin price . Secure Your Assets: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency to protect against theft. Long-Term Perspective: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. While short-term fluctuations can be dramatic, focusing on the long-term potential of the technology and its adoption can help navigate volatility. The surge in Bitcoin price above $114,000 is a testament to the ongoing evolution and growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market. It underscores Bitcoin’s resilience and its increasing acceptance as a significant player in the global financial arena. While the journey of digital assets is often marked by volatility, this latest milestone provides a compelling reminder of the transformative potential that Bitcoin continues to hold. As the market continues to evolve, staying informed and adopting a balanced perspective will be key for navigating its exciting future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a Bitcoin price of $114,000 mean for its overall market cap? A Bitcoin price of $114,000, assuming a circulating supply of approximately 19.5 million BTC, would push its market capitalization well over $2.2 trillion. This makes Bitcoin one of the largest assets globally by market cap, surpassing many traditional companies and even some national currencies. Q2: Is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin given its current price? The decision to invest depends on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. While a high Bitcoin price indicates strong momentum, it also means a higher entry point. It is crucial to conduct thorough research, understand the risks, and consider dollar-cost averaging as a strategy. Q3: What factors could cause the Bitcoin price to drop after this surge? Potential factors include profit-taking by investors, unexpected regulatory crackdowns, significant macroeconomic downturns, security breaches affecting major exchanges, or a shift in market sentiment away from riskier assets. Volatility is a constant in the crypto market. Q4: How does institutional interest affect the Bitcoin price? Institutional interest brings substantial capital, increased liquidity, and a stamp of legitimacy to Bitcoin. This can lead to more stable and sustained price appreciation, as large institutional purchases can absorb selling pressure and signal long-term confidence. Q5: Will the Bitcoin price continue to rise indefinitely? No asset rises indefinitely. While Bitcoin has shown remarkable long-term growth, it is subject to market cycles, corrections, and external factors. Predicting exact future movements is impossible, and investors should be prepared for volatility.

While SHIB struggles to regain momentum, attention is quietly shifting to a rising coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at $0.035, this emerging DeFi project has captured trader interest. Investors who join the presale now in phase 6 are guaranteed a 71.43% return on investment when the project launches at $0.06. MUTM has raised more than $13.9 million and has gained over 14,800 investors. As legacy tokens like SHIB face renewed sell pressure, MUTM is quietly emerging as a dark horse in the DeFi market. Some analysts are tipping to Mutuum Finance turn a modest $800 into $160,000. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Retreats After Burning Through July Gains Shiba Inu is currently trading around $0.0000142, having cooled off by roughly 8% since late July, yielding back much of its mid-month gains as meme-coin momentum fades. Technical conditions look increasingly fragile: trading volume is moderating, RSI is sliding toward neutral-to-oversold levels, and SHIB has slipped back below key support-resistance levels in the $0.0000143–$0.0000144 zone, raising the risk of further retracement toward $0.0000126–$0.0000130 if sentiment continues to deteriorate. As interest in high-volatility meme assets like SHIB remains uncertain, investor focus is turning toward utility-based emerging DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Now Live Mutuum Finance has already sold out presale phase 5 in record time and launched Phase 6 with tokens now live at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price adjustment will take the token up by a further 14.29% to $0.04, allowing existing joiners to stand to gain 71.43% when it finally comes out at $0.06. The presale has already pulled in over 14,800 investors and has raised over $13.9 million, a testimony to the confidence that the market has placed in the potential of MUTM. Dual-Lending: Facilitating the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance takes a double-model approach to facilitating flexibility and effectiveness in Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models of lending. Peer-to-Contract uses self-executory smart contracts that carry out the lending function autonomously with no intervention by human beings whatsoever. They have been designed to operate using dynamic rates in the market with an unknown rate of interest as guided by current demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and offers market to be directly in touch with borrowers and lenders. Mutuum Finance Reinforces Commitment to Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going to introduce a stablecoin that will be pegged USD on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a secure and safe investment product to eradicate risk and volatility that could be associated with algorithmic stablecoins. The project is audited Certik with a 95.0 trust score. This is a prestigious achievement in terms of the ambition of Mutuum Finance to be an institutional-grade and transparent DeFi protocol. It also signifies that the team cares about staying compliant with the security standards of the industry. Mutuum Finance Deploys $50K Bug Bounty to Foster Safety Mutuum Finance has introduced its Bug Bounty Program with a reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. Four levels of severity are there under this program. They include critical, major, minor, and low. Therefore, all the possible bugs are found and rewarded. It aligns with the team’s vision of developing a secure, open, and quality DeFi protocol. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is fading again. Despite token burns, the price is slipping and momentum is weak. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building fast. It’s in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, with a 71.43% ROI locked in for early buyers when it launches at $0.06. Over 14,800 investors have already joined. More than $13.9 million has been raised. Buy before the next price jump.

Each of the new startups has created its very own EVM-compatible Virtual Chain using the Aurora Cloud Console, which is a plug-and-play framework for quickly building fully customizable decentralized networks. Aurora launched the Cloud Console in January, pitching the idea that decentralized application developers can use it to quickly spin up their own, dedicated blockchain infrastructure, tailored to the needs of their dApps. In doing so, those developer teams can focus their full attention on their dApp’s functionality, without worrying about the overheads that normally come with creating a blockchain, or working within the confines of an existing network that struggles with scalability, such as Ethereum. The Aurora Cloud Console will generate all of the underlying code and deploy the customized blockchain as a Virtual Chain on NEAR Protocol’s high-performance, EVM-compatible network, with rapid transaction speeds and enterprise grade security. Aurora’s Virtual Chains can be further refined with a series of Web3 plugins available in the Cloud Console Marketplace , where developers can integrate ready-made services such as decentralized identity protocols, reputation management, compute, domain name services and so on, with just a couple of clicks. In this way, Aurora is setting a new standard for blockchain accessibility, eliminating the need for extensive engineering and programming skills, so anyone can build a dedicated chain for their dApp. Who’s Building Virtual Chains? Aurora launched the Aurora Blocks Incubator to encourage dApp developers to see what they can build with its unique platform. The program offers access to Aurora’s infrastructure, partner mentorship and strategic support – including grants – and after six very busy weeks, it unveiled its first cohort at a special Demo Day event last month. https://t.co/5FuBsq9yzw — Aurora (@auroraisnear) July 31, 2025 The five projects span a wide range of blockchain applications. For instance, Optima Financial says it’s the first EU-regulated tokenized investment platform, offering DeFi users the chance to engage with hedge fund-level investing strategies and “earn like the top 1%”. The strategies are bundled into separate tokens that are automatically rebalanced and traded as regulated blockchain certificates. For instance, the OP20 token is a basket of the top 20 performing cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, while OPAI is a basket of tokens designed to power blockchain-based AI projects. Optima Financial built its protocol atop of the Optima Virtual Chain to ensure speed and stability, with governance powered by its native OPTIMA token. Another interesting project is Sproutly , which is the first UN-verified carbon credit platform, offering access to tokenized CO2 offsets and trees, targeting companies striving to achieve their net-zero targets. Sproutly aims to bring real-world climate impact on-chain, with its NFTrees certified by agroforestry systems, incentivizing carbon capture projects by translating them into real-world yield. Meanwhile, EasyChain is all about easing Web3 accessibility, simplifying the way non-crypto natives interact with decentralized networks. It abstracts away all of the complexity involved in blockchain, so newcomers can participate in gamified quests and earn social rewards within a familiar, Web2-like environment. While the above projects are all building on existing ideas, a couple are forging new concepts entirely. For instance, Tradable is a consumer-focused, automated crypto trading platform powered by artificial intelligence, designed to help anyone better navigate the volatility of the crypto markets. Its Aurora-based Virtual Chain is designed to perform encrypted, on-chain AI queries, processing them privately off-chain before returning the results to the network, ensuring verifiable market insights with maximum privacy for users. As for Omega Network , it’s pioneering a novel “hybrid Layer 1.5” architecture that aims to simplify DeFi development. It’s a high-performance, sovereign network that unifies liquidity and scalability and streamlines real-world asset integration. Omega promises to solve common problems developers face on existing networks, such as slow and expensive transactions (Ethereum), a lack of composability (Avalanche) and a lack of sovereignty (Arbitrum), while enabling frictionless dApp development. What’s Coming Next? The first cohort dramatically enhances the utility available within Aurora’s nascent ecosystem of Virtual Chains, but more importantly they demonstrate its infrastructure’s ability to support the kinds of sophisticated dApps found on more established networks such as Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche. The Demo Day pitches can be viewed on Aurora’s YouTube channel .

Bitcoin interest among institutional investors has also increased. Despite its infamous volatility, bitcoin has managed to outshine other asset classes over the past decade. Learn more about bitcoin and the investment rationale driving its mainstream adoption. Please note that VanEck has exposure to bitcoin. We often refer to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as “digital gold” because, like the metal, it is a potential store of value. Like gold, bitcoin’s characteristics include: Limited supply: Maximum supply of 21 million. This scarcity means that the price could move upward as adoption increases. Increasing adoption: Bitcoin has been gaining traction in terms of the number of merchants that accept it as payment. In 2021, El Salvador made headlines by declaring Bitcoin as legal tender. As the first country to do so, El Salvador serves as a good macro case study for bitcoin as legal tender. Potential inflation hedge: Monetary stimulus is currently eroding purchasing power globally and bitcoin might outperform as it’s not subject to the same inflationary manipulation as traditional currencies. Diversification benefits: Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset. However, unlike gold, bitcoin is: Divisible and transparent. Bitcoin’s Limited Supply Creates Scarcity and May Increase Its Value Over Time There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence. This supply cap was designed intentionally and is one of the primary characteristics of bitcoin. Furthermore, bitcoin has “halvings” programmed into it. A halving is defined as a 50% block reward cut to the bitcoin production rate, and they occur roughly every four years. This means that the rate at which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation slows down over time until it eventually reaches zero (estimated to occur around the year 2140). Bitcoin Halvings Typically Associated with Explosive Returns Source: Bloomberg, VanEck research as of 06/30/25. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The information, valuation scenarios and price targets presented on Bitcoin in this blog are not intended as financial advice or any call to action, a recommendation to buy or sell Bitcoin, or as a projection of how Bitcoin will perform in the future. Actual future performance of Bitcoin is unknown, and may differ significantly from the hypothetical results depicted here. There may be risks or other factors not accounted for in the scenarios presented that may impede the performance of Bitcoin. These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. These halvings increase the difficulty of mining bitcoin and will occur until the supply cap is reached. In addition, the built-in finite supply of bitcoin means that it is not subject to inflation in the same manner that fiat currencies are. Central banks around the world have ushered in unprecedented growth in money supply, effectively eroding their currencies’ purchasing value. In comparison, bitcoin’s limited supply and increased mining difficulty over time may support the idea of bitcoin as a long-term store of value and as an alternative to gold. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024. Historically, the price of bitcoin has rallied leading up to and following a halving. The chart above indicates the explosive returns that are typically associated with following the bitcoin halvings. Bitcoin Adoption Continues In its early years, bitcoin was largely used by a small group of tech enthusiasts. It was difficult and cumbersome to obtain with limited use cases and very few merchants accepting it as a form of payment. In 2024, bitcoin adoption has grown substantially as it has become more mainstream. Now, more than ever, merchants and businesses are accepting bitcoin as a form of payment and infrastructure has been built to make it more convenient for the average person to use. The development of user-friendly wallets, exchanges, and marketplaces has removed the technical barriers to entry that existed in bitcoin’s early years. Bitcoin interest among institutional investors has also increased. Hedge funds, asset management firms, and endowments are increasingly recognizing bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and as an effective portfolio diversifier, specifically, when looking through the lens of an uncorrelated asset that has the potential to hedge against inflation. Approximately $196 billion worth of Bitcoin are now held by ETFs, countries, public and private companies. BTC Holdings in Publicly Traded, Private Companies, ETFs and Countries Source: Buybitcoinworldwide as of 06/30/2025. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Layer 2s (such as Liquid by BlockStream) may be the next step in boosting bitcoin adoption as they allow for scalability and customizations while retaining many of bitcoin’s security properties. Built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, we believe the Lightning Network pushes the boundaries of Bitcoin payment capabilities with lower costs and faster speeds. One notable upcoming layer 2 development on the bitcoin network is RGB. This development is important because it enables the creation and management of digital assets on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or even other cryptocurrencies can be issued and traded on top of the Bitcoin network, adding a new layer of functionality. The RGB protocol is designed to be scalable and not resource-intensive, allowing users to create and manage digital assets without requiring extensive changes to the underlying Bitcoin network. It can be integrated into existing bitcoin wallets and infrastructure, thus making it easier for developers and users to create and manage digital assets. RGB has the potential to expand the use cases of bitcoin, making it a more versatile and useful platform for developers and users alike, ushering in new opportunities for innovation and growth within the ecosystem. Potential Hedge Against Inflation The unprecedented worldwide growth in money supply following the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread inflation, eroding the purchasing power of established fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s role as a potential hedge against inflation has increasingly become a talking point central to investment decision-making. As previously alluded to, the cornerstone of this idea lies in its limited supply and decentralized nature. Unlike fiat, which can be printed by governments and central banks, bitcoin has a fixed supply, with supply growth decreasing by 50% roughly every 4 years with the halving events. Bitcoin is not subject to the same inflationary pressures caused by fiat money supply growth, making it an attractive option for investors concerned about the impact of inflation on their portfolios and their subsequent purchasing power. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it impervious to geopolitical events or economic policies that may lead to currency devaluation, such as QE (quantitative easing) or excessive government spending. The Role of Bitcoin Bitcoin may also enhance risk-return profiles. As the chart below shows, a small allocation to Bitcoin significantly enhanced the cumulative return of a traditional 60% equity and 40% bond mix while only minimally impacting overall volatility.

Bitcoin’s History of Robust Performance Despite its infamous volatility, bitcoin has managed to outshine other asset classes over the past decade. In fact, it has been the best-performing asset class for eight out of the past eleven years. Let's take a closer look at bitcoin's historical returns for various holding periods (as of June 30, 2025): 1 year: 122.39% return 3 years: 99.48% return 5 years: 1,212.25% return 7 years: 577.31% return 10 years: 35,224.96% return These figures underscore the incredible growth potential that bitcoin has exhibited over time, making it an attractive option for investors seeking high returns.

How Might Bitcoin Shine Brighter Than Gold? While bitcoin shares some of the characteristics attributed to gold, below are differences that, in our view, potentially make it superior. Divisible: As a physical asset, gold can only be divided into smaller units to a certain extent, making smaller transactions cumbersome and, in some instances, impractical. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is divisible up to eight decimal places (with the smallest unit called Satoshis), making it easier to use for microtransactions. Transparency: All transactions that have ever occurred or will occur are publicly available on the Bitcoin blockchain. This feature makes it difficult to manipulate and impossible to counterfeit Bitcoin, increasing trust in the network. Gold lacks the same level of transparency – when it is traded, the details of the transaction, such as the buyer, seller, and price, are often not publicly available. This lack of transparency may make it more difficult to verify the authenticity of the gold being traded and may lead to an increased risk of fraud and manipulation. Overall, while gold has been used as a store of value and in transactions for centuries all over the world, its lack of transparency can make it more challenging to verify and track compared to digital assets like bitcoin. As inflation poses challenges to investors globally, both gold and bitcoin are likely to come front and center as potential hedges to protect purchasing power. With bitcoin’s benefits like divisibility and transparency, we see it as a competitor to gold and believe it is likely to garner even more adoption among retail and institutional investors alike.

Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. Hypothetical or model performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading, and accordingly, may have undercompensated or overcompensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors such as market disruptions and lack of liquidity. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading (for example, the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses). Hypothetical or model performance is designed with benefit of hindsight. There are inherent risks with fixed income investing. These risks may include interest rate, call, credit, market, inflation, government policy, liquidity, or junk bond. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This risk is heightened with investments in longer duration fixed-income securities and during periods when prevailing interest rates are low or negative. Emerging Market securities are subject to greater risks than U.S. domestic investments. These additional risks may include exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls; less publicly available information; more volatile or less liquid securities markets; and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, or political, economic or social instability. Gold investments are subject to the risks associated with concentrating its assets in the gold industry, which can be significantly affected by international economic, monetary, political developments and other risks specific to the gold industry. Foreign and emerging market gold security investments may entail heightened risks, such as adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, or political, economic or social instability. Hard assets investments are subject to risks associated with real estate, precious metals, natural resources and commodities and events related to these industries, foreign investments, illiquidity, credit, interest rate fluctuations, inflation, leverage, and non-diversification. Investments in digital assets and Web3 companies are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk . These risks include, but are not limited to: the technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; intense competition; slow adoption rates and the potential for product obsolescence; volatility and limited liquidity, including but not limited to, inability to liquidate a position; loss or destruction of key(s) to access accounts or the blockchain; reliance on digital wallets; reliance on unregulated markets and exchanges; reliance on the internet; cybersecurity risks; and the lack of regulation and the potential for new laws and regulation that may be difficult to predict. Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance. Accounts at digital asset custodians and exchanges are not protected by SPIC and are not FDIC insured. Furthermore, markets and exchanges for digital assets are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Digital assets include, but are not limited to, cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, assets stored or created using blockchain technology, and other Web3products. Web3 companies include but are not limited to, companies that involve the development, innovation, and/or utilization of blockchain, digital assets, or crypto technologies. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. © Van Eck Associates Corporation.

Pennsylvania State Police believe Jennifer Folzenlogen, a resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, has stolen more than $26,000 from the personal accounts of several customers of First National Bank, reports CBS News. Folzenlogen was arrested in Pennsylvania while allegedly attempting to withdraw money from a First National Bank account belonging to a person whose identity she had stolen earlier this month. Besides Pennsylvania, the report says the sexagenarian is a suspect in other similar offenses that took place in Indiana and Ohio. Per Murrysville Police Department’s detective Matthew Panigal, Folzenlogen was arrested after attempting to steal from the same bank for the second time. “A teller at First National Bank actually recognized Ms. Folzenlogen from previous bank surveillance photos and video. She had actually victimized the same bank back in April with the same teller working at the bank at that time.” Police say Folzenlogen’s modus operandi involved printing a fake ID after obtaining someone’s bank details. She would then present herself at the victim’s bank posing as the account holder and withdraw money. The Pennsylvania State Police started hunting for the sexagenarian after several First National Bank’s branches were targeted earlier this year. Folzenlogen is believed to be part of a gang that operates throughout the Northeastern part of the US.

In a new post on the social media platform X, the Bridgewater Associates founder says that the current conflict between Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell is about the value of money. “As previously explained, when there is too much debt and borrowing, the classic way of dealing with it is to push real interest rates down and devalue money, which is bad for creditors and good for debtors. That is what Donald Trump is pushing for and what Jay Powell is defending against.” Trump has repeatedly called for Powell to step down, and has floated the idea that he could be fired, largely because of the Fed Chair’s pause on rate cuts that began in December, 2024. Dalio says that in the end, the President will likely get his wish for lower rates and cheaper money with or without Powell, given that the eventual debasement of currency is historically the norm. “Will the value of money be defended? Judging from the lessons of history and current readings, I think that it is clear that the value of money won’t be defended until the classic weak money/inflation problems become intense – and perhaps not even then – because the pains those problems produce are intense. Look at the 1970-82 cycle for a classic example. So, while maybe that tightening will happen sometime in the distant future, it’s virtually certain that it won’t come soon. So, it seems to me that one should keep betting on weak money (i.e., the dollar going down, and low and falling real interest rates).” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

BlockDAG stands out. With $360 million raised, more than 2.5 million users, and a presale nearing its end, it already has 4,500+ developers building, with 300+ dApps in development. This early interest is no accident. EVM support, a low-code contract builder, and access to the testnet have made it possible to start building before launch. Grants, hackathons, and future DeFi tools also show that BlockDAG (BDAG) is focused on helping developers first. Let’s look at why this blockchain is drawing builders even before BDAG is listed. EVM Support Makes Setup Simple BlockDAG works fully with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means smart contracts written in Solidity, the most widely used blockchain language, can be moved to BlockDAG with little or no change. For developers, this gives a smooth way to switch platforms. Tools like MetaMask, Remix, and Hardhat already work with it. Current dApps, such as DeFi and NFT platforms, can run on BlockDAG while gaining better transaction speed and lower fees than Ethereum. This matters for adoption. BlockDAG does not try to replace Ethereum. Instead, it builds on its system, giving developers the same tools with better performance. To bring in more users, BlockDAG also has a low-code smart contract builder. It uses drag-and-drop features to let users create and launch contracts without full coding. This tool helps Web2 developers, business owners, and new creators enter blockchain more easily. With ready templates for tokens, staking, governance, and NFTs, BlockDAG allows fast design and launch. By making the process easier, BlockDAG helps more people build. This grows the number of dApps and speeds up the growth of the ecosystem. Early Testing Grounds and Developer Support Tools BlockDAG’s testnet is already live, giving developers a space to deploy smart contracts, check how many transactions the network can handle, and test node functions. The system can process up to 10 blocks per second, using a mix of DAG and Proof-of-Work to bring both speed and safety. To help developers, BlockDAG has launched grants and hackathons aimed at funding 1,000 dApps by 2026. These programs are not just for testing but are designed to support real building at scale. With a clear six-week launch schedule, developers can plan how to connect BDAG into their dApps, including tools for staking and DeFi. BlockDAG gives more than code tools. It offers working systems already in place: Cold Wallet setup for safe coin storage and direct dApp access X1 mobile miner with more than 2.5 million users for on-chain use Demo Trading Platform for buying BDAG live and selling in demo mode Over 20 exchange listings lined up after launch These features mean that any dApp launching on BlockDAG joins a live system with users, activity, and tools already in use. It’s more than theory, it’s a working structure. Why Developers Are Getting In Early BlockDAG is still in crypto presale , but developers are already building with it. The tools, users, and support are here now. With over 4,500 developers active, the ecosystem is growing even before the mainnet goes live. In an industry where many chains go live without activity, BlockDAG’s plan to support developers early could be its strongest move. The message is clear for builders: BlockDAG is not waiting, and neither are they.

According to on-chain data, the approval was signed on April 30, 2024, and the theft occurred on August 2, 2025, exactly 458 days later. The attack stemmed from an ERC-20 token approval transaction, which likely originated from a phishing website or fake airdrop. This transaction gave the attacker’s wallet, identified as “0x67E5Ae,” ongoing access to the victim’s funds. The scammer — believed to be linked to the infamous wallet address pink-drainer.eth — waited patiently for the right moment to strike. Security platform Scam Sniffer shared the incident on X, using the case to urge users to regularly check and revoke old approvals. “Your wallet security matters,” Scam Sniffer emphasized, highlighting the long-term risk of permissions users may forget after a single click. Scam Happens When Funds Are Worth Stealing Until July, the compromised wallet showed minimal activity and held little value. But things changed on July 2 when the victim deposited $762,397 from a MetaMask wallet, followed by another $146,154 from a Kraken account just ten minutes later. With nearly a million dollars now sitting in the vulnerable address “0x6c0eB6,” the attacker had all the incentive needed. The attacker monitored the wallet for a month, confirming no further funds were expected before executing the theft in one swift transaction on August 2 at 4:57 AM UTC. This patient tactic is a hallmark of phishing approval scam cases — attackers often wait months, or even years, until the potential payout justifies the risk and effort. Prevention Tools Exist, but User Vigilance Is Key Experts warn that these scams can be avoided with proper diligence. Tools like Etherscan’s Token Approval Checker allow Ethereum users to view and revoke active token approvals. However, each revocation requires a small gas fee, which discourages some users from maintaining regular approval hygiene. Unfortunately, this incident is part of a broader trend. July alone saw more than $142 million lost to crypto scams and exploits across at least 17 attacks — including the high-profile breach of crypto exchange CoinDCX . As phishing tactics become increasingly sophisticated and patient, the only real defense is consistent vigilance. Revoke old permissions, use hardware wallets, and always double-check transaction prompts — because in crypto, one signature can cost everything.

The recent stir caused by a Vogue AI ad featuring a computer-generated model has ignited a crucial conversation: What does the rise of AI models mean for human creativity and livelihoods? This isn’t just about pretty pictures; it’s about the economic shifts and ethical dilemmas that parallel the decentralized transformations we see in the crypto space. The Ascent of AI Models in the Fashion Industry The concept of artificial models isn’t entirely new. Sarah Murray, a commercial model, recalls her sadness when Levi’s partnered with Lalaland.ai in 2023 to create ‘diverse’ digital models. This move, intended for inclusivity, was quickly dubbed ‘artificial diversity’ by critics. Murray’s concerns about competing with AI’s ‘digital standards of perfection’ have only grown. The recent controversy surrounding a Guess ad in Vogue’s July print edition, featuring an AI-generated model, brought these worries to a head. The internet buzzed, largely because this appeared in Vogue, a publication often seen as the fashion bible. While Vogue stated the ad met its advertising standards, for many, the distinction between an ad and editorial content felt irrelevant. Why is the Fashion Industry Embracing AI? The push towards AI in fashion is largely driven by economics and scalability. Industry experts point to several key factors: Cost Efficiency: Working with live models, especially for e-commerce, is expensive. Paul Mouginot, an art technologist, notes that AI allows brands to start with a flat-lay product shoot and place it on a photorealistic virtual model, creating images that mimic genuine fashion editorials at a fraction of the cost. Amy Odell, a fashion writer, puts it simply: “It’s just so much cheaper for [brands] to use AI models now.” Content Scale: PJ Pereira, co-founder of AI ad firm Silverside AI, highlights the drastic increase in content demand. Brands once produced four major content pieces annually; now, social media and e-commerce require hundreds or thousands. “There’s no way to scale from four to 400 or 400,000 with just process tweaks,” Pereira explains. AI offers a new system to meet this demand. Existing Precedent: Brands like French retailer Veepee have used virtual mannequins since 2013. H&M, Mango, and Calvin Klein have also incorporated AI in fashion campaigns, indicating a quiet, ongoing shift. Sinead Bovell, a model and founder of the WAYE organization, points out that ‘e-commerce models’ – those who pose for online product displays – are most vulnerable to automation. This segment is where most models earn their primary income, making AI’s impact particularly concerning for financial security. Addressing Ethical Concerns with AI in Fashion The widespread adoption of AI in fashion raises significant ethical questions, particularly concerning human models. Sarah Murray, for instance, finds it disheartening when brands claim AI supplements human talent rather than replaces it. She argues that countless human models dream of working with these brands, making artificial generation unnecessary. A major concern is the impact on ‘non-traditional’ or diverse models. The Levi’s example, where diversity was artificially generated instead of hiring diverse talent, illustrates a troubling trend. Bovell terms this ‘robot cultural appropriation’ – where brands generate specific identities without genuine representation or understanding. Models like Murray also worry about contract clauses that might sign away their rights for brands to use their likenesses to train future AI systems. However, some see potential solutions. Sara Ziff, founder of the Model Alliance, advocates for the Fashion Workers Act, which would mandate clear consent and compensation for using digital replicas of models. While this could offer models new revenue streams and flexibility, Mouginot warns that “What few players gain can mean fewer opportunities for many others.” Ultimately, Bovell suggests models must differentiate themselves, build personal brands, and explore new revenue streams, as “AI will never have a unique human story.” Distinguishing Human Versus Digital Models One critical challenge for digital models is the struggle for uniqueness. Many AI-generated models, including those seen in the Vogue AI ad , tend to be homogenous – perfect lips, symmetrical features, identical jawlines. Sandrine Decorde, CEO of Artcare, a creative studio, refers to her team as “AI artisans” who fine-tune AI-generated models to have a “touch of unique humanity.” Decorde’s firm specializes in AI-generated babies and children, an ethically complex area historically prone to exploitation with human minors. Generative AI offers a safer alternative when market demand is high. Pereira emphasizes that combating homogeneity in AI requires intention. “Just like you would cast for a wide range of models, you have to prompt for that,” he explains. Without intentional training on diverse appearances, AI models will simply amplify existing biases. Mouginot believes that while some platforms might abandon human models, there’s an inherent human desire for “sensual reality,” “imperfection,” and “human connection.” Many successful human models thrive precisely because of distinctive, slightly imperfect traits that are hard to replicate in algorithms. The Unfolding Future of Vogue AI Ad Integration Claudia Wagner, founder of Ubooker, a modeling booking platform, views the use of AI modeling technology in fashion as largely experimental. The Guess ad, while technically interesting, lacked impact or novelty for her team. “We’re all in a phase of testing and exploring what AI can add – but the real value will come when it’s used with purpose, not just for visibility,” Wagner states. Despite negative comments, AI-generated content can still achieve significant engagement and sales, as Pereira’s firm discovered with a TikTok video that garnered over a million views and a steep hike in product sales. This suggests that while public opinion may be divided, the commercial benefits are compelling. AI models are unlikely to disappear, but their integration into creative workflows will vary. Some brands will fully embrace artificial models, others will license likenesses of real people for synthetic shoots, and some will avoid it due to audience concerns. Human talent remains central, especially for brands where authenticity and identity are crucial, such as luxury heritage brands. While many high-fashion brands are quietly experimenting, they are still defining their AI policies. Vogue’s inclusion of the AI ad was a significant moment, potentially signaling a shift. Odell believes that if Vogue eventually features AI models in editorials, it could normalize the technology within the industry, much like its eventual acceptance of figures like Kim Kardashian. The debate over AI models in the fashion industry is more than a fleeting trend; it’s a fundamental re-evaluation of creativity, cost, and ethical responsibility. As AI technology evolves, the dialogue between human artistry and algorithmic efficiency will continue to shape the runways and digital screens of tomorrow. Brands, models, and consumers alike are navigating uncharted territory, where the lines between reality and simulation blur, promising both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the future of style.

Liquidity is healthy, on-chain headlines are improving, and social chatter is tilting risk-on again. At the same time, a utility-first token, Remittix (RTX) is quietly winning allocation as a balance to meme-beta. Here’s the clean read on levels, catalysts, and whether SHIB or RTX looks like the smarter add this week. SHIB: Levels, Headlines, and a Working SHIB Price Prediction Map SHIB trades around ~$0.000012–$0.0000121 with ~$220M in 24-hour volume, enough depth for tight fills. A simple SHIB price prediction framework looks like this: hold the $0.000012 shelf, reclaim $0.000013–$0.000014, and you unlock a run at the spring highs. Lose the shelf, and you’re back to range until fresh demand steps in. Recent coverage also highlighted a burn-rate spike and a cup-and-handle structure that—if validated—could power a multi-week push; the same piece flagged $0.0000131–$0.0000140 as the near-term resistance pocket to beat. Beyond the chart, flows remain the swing factor. CEX monitoring threads on X ( CEXscan ) spotlighted SHIB exchange flows this week, a reminder that quick shifts in deposits/withdrawals can front-run volatility around key levels. That’s why many technicians want confirmation—daily acceptance above resistance—before calling a breakout in any SHIB price prediction. For context, other analyses this month noted SHIB briefly slipping below the $0.000012 handle before recovering, with overhead supply stacked into $0.000014. This is classic “prove-it” territory: bulls need volume on the reclaim to avoid another fade. The Altcoin Stealing Attention: Remittix (RTX) While traders debate a SHIB price prediction for August, Remittix is getting added for a different reason: usage. RTX is a cross-chain DeFi project built for low-fee value transfer crypto with real utility that tends to benefit when on-chain activity rises. The team has set a public milestone that is the Remittix Wallet beta launch on September 15, 2025—giving investors a dated checkpoint rather than open-ended promises. Why Remittix is the best altcoin now Raised $17.9M+ by selling 578M RTX at $0.0895—clear signal of market interest. Wallet beta: Sept 15, 2025—a tangible, near-term product catalyst. Low gas fee crypto design with chain-agnostic routing (ETH first), built for scale. Fits top crypto under $1 and “new altcoin to watch” screens for 2025. That mix explains the quiet rotation: some portfolios keep SHIB for volatility and community torque, then add RTX for a steadier “throughput” sleeve. If meme cycles push users back on-chain, cheaper rails and simpler UX can compound in the background—without needing viral headlines every week. Which Looks Like the Better Buy Today? A conservative SHIB price prediction keeps the bias neutral-to-constructive above $0.000012 with confirmation only on a daily close over $0.000013–$0.000014 (then eyes on the spring highs). The burn-rate surge and pattern setup help, but execution at resistance matters most. Remittix (RTX) offers a different engine of return: under-$1 access, a dated product beta, and a design aimed at real usage. With $17.9M+ raised via 579M tokens at $0.0895, RTX has visible backing and a roadmap that investors can actually calendar. For balanced positioning, many desks are doing both—SHIB for momentum when levels confirm, RTX for utility that scales with activity.

It has also grown massively since the first altcoins appeared, but it was still hard to find a place to accumulate some. In the following decade or so, though, early bird crypto investors used every big price movement as an opportunity to insist that “we are still early.” And, in most cases, they were right. But, is that still adequate to say in August 2025? The “No” Answer We have come a long way since bitcoin was an unknown Internet magic currency. A long way since legacy investors started to learn about it, but were mostly ignorant. And a long way since they knew about it, but were still hesitant and dismissive. No, no, these times have passed as bitcoin is now a global asset monster. It has skyrocketed into a well-known phenomenon, with a market capitalization bigger than Meta, silver, Berkshire Hathaway, and many others. Even with its latest correction, it still finds a solid place within the 10 largest global assets by market cap. It’s on Wall Street, too. Asset management behemoths rushed to launch ETFs tracking its performance, and a few of them have broken records in just a year and a half of existence. Large companies are accumulating it. It’s not just Strategy , but many others, like GameStop and Metaplanet, have joined the race to purchase considerable quantities. Governments are waking up to it. El Salvador led the pack in 2021, but these days, even the US government has stopped selling its stash and is mulling adding it to its reserve list of assets. Building up on this, popular YouTuber CryptoGoos recently posted : “You are not early in crypto anymore. That part of the cycle is over. BTC already did a 5x. Now, we’re entering the phase where only the sharp survive.” The Other Side of the Coin The narrative above goes mainly for bitcoin, but it could also be attributed to some of the larger-cap altcoins, especially in terms of market cap. However, it’s a long shot since there are only three crypto reps in the largest 100 global assets – BTC, ETH, and XRP. That’s a very small percentage. Also, there’s the total crypto market cap, which, even at its peak in July, was at just over $4 trillion. Although that sounds impressive, given that it was below $1 trillion a few years ago, it’s still a long, long way from the overall financial world and the trillions and trillions of dollars in exchange daily. Just for reference, NVIDIA, the world’s largest company by market cap, is more valuable according to that metric than the entire crypto industry. Gold, which is the world’s single biggest asset, is more than 5x above these levels at over $22.5 trillion. CryptoGoos’ post concludes that while BTC might be beyond the “too early” narrative, there are still some opportunities for those who take their time to study the industry and not rely on luck anymore. “Yes, it’s altcoin season, but not every narrative will run. From here on, it’s no longer about luck. It’s about picking your plays, staying focused, and not getting pulled into euphoria.” The post Is the ‘Still Early’ Narrative for Bitcoin and Crypto Dead? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Adoption,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-08-03 13:32:20

Murray stated that he supports this theory based on many details, from technical background to personal connections. According to Murray, Bitcoin's source code, written in C++, is noteworthy because it confirms that Jack Dorsey had been coding in C++ and C since the mid-1990s. Dorsey is alleged to have the capacity to create Bitcoin's technical infrastructure. It's alleged that the first tweet, posted by Jack Dorsey's close friend Crystal Taylor on the beta version of Twitter in 2006, was “Satoshi,” a reference to DJ Satoshi Tomiie. Another interesting detail is that the mascot of Dorsey's alma mater, the University of Missouri-Rolla, was the Miners. Dorsey reportedly shared cryptography-related content on his personal website in the 1990s, was a member of the Cypherpunk community, and linked to the sites of Hal Finney and Adam Back, two individuals who were early Bitcoin supporters and first contacts with Satoshi. Murray points out that between December 2010 and April 2011, when Satoshi was publicly missing, Dorsey was in the process of returning to Twitter and Visa invested in Square (now Block). During this period, Bitcoin was in the spotlight thanks to WikiLeaks' donations, and Visa's embargoes on WikiLeaks may have created a conflict between Dorsey's public persona and his Satoshi persona. Numerological coincidences are also highlighted, such as the date Satoshi joined the Bitcoin forum, November 19th, being the same date as Jack Dorsey's birthday, and the fact that the first Bitcoin transaction sent to Hal Finney occurred on January 11th, Dorsey's mother's birthday. Furthermore, another piece of evidence suggests that Satoshi's leaked IP address originated in California in 2009, and that Dorsey was living there at the time. Related News: BREAKING: The Largest Bitcoin Hack Ever, Unreported to the Public, Has Been Revealed - Unbelievable Figures Are Being Discussed Dorsey's Bitcoin-focused company, Blockchain, currently holds $1 billion in Bitcoin reserves. According to a 2024 report by 1A1z, Jack Dorsey is the primary financier of Bitcoin's development. In a 2024 SEC filing, Dorsey explicitly stated that his company was following “Satoshi Nakamoto's blueprint.” Other notable details, according to Murray, include: Dorsey used the nickname “Jak” for years, and a Bitcoin address from 2009 begins with 1JaK… Signatures of 145 addresses denying that Craig Wright is Satoshi Dorsey is portrayed as a tech genius living a double life in the Hacktivist novels. Dorsey's quiet but influential role in every major Bitcoin milestone Murray argues that Jack Dorsey's technical knowledge and personal history offer strong evidence that he could be Satoshi Nakamoto. While many previous Satoshi accusers have denied these claims, Dorsey's contradictory responses to the allegations make the allegations even more compelling. *This is not investment advice.

The company’s earnings from digital assets rose by 98% year-on-year to $160 million. Overall, the company saw a 45% increase in net revenue to $989 million and a 105% jump in net income to $386 million. Robinhood Bets Big on Tokenization Trading volumes in crypto reached $28 billion, up 32% from the previous quarter, supported by a broader market cap increase of 21.7% to $3.36 trillion. Despite exceeding analyst expectations, Robinhood shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading. A central theme of the company’s earnings call was CEO Vlad Tenev’s strong focus on tokenization, which he described as the most significant innovation in capital markets in over a decade. Tenev referenced tokenization 11 times during the earnings call and emphasized its role in Robinhood’s long-term strategy. The company plans to tokenize traditionally illiquid or inaccessible real-world assets, such as private shares, venture capital funds, and real estate, through its new Ethereum-based Layer 2 network, called Robinhood Chain. This initiative has already seen a European roll-out of digital assets, which offers exposure to companies like SpaceX and OpenAI. Tenev said tokenization would allow instant settlement, 24/7 trading, and self-custody for retail users. The push comes on the heels of Robinhood’s $200 million acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp, which is expected to support its tokenization ambitions. Tokenization Back in Focus With increased regulatory interest and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating openness to tokenization frameworks, Robinhood is positioning itself as a frontrunner in a space that has regained momentum following earlier experiments by Binance and the now-defunct FTX. Back in June, Gemini, founded by the Winklevoss twins, introduced tokenized trading services for its European clients, starting with shares of MicroStrategy. Its rival, Coinbase, is said to be in the process of securing approval from the SEC to roll out tokenized stock offerings. Adding to the momentum, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose firm oversees $12.5 trillion in assets, has also publicly encouraged the securities regulator to greenlight tokenization of both stocks and bonds.

Hayes locked in profits by selling more than $13 million worth of cryptocurrency. Some analysts believe that double-digit corrections in price are a thing of the past. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said Bitcoin could fall to $100,000 and Ethereum to $3,000. He said that increased tariffs, stagnant credit markets, and slower job creation are creating an unfavorable backdrop for cryptocurrencies. Hayes noted that the key trigger was the weak growth in non-farm employment in the US. In July 2025, only 73,000 jobs were created in the country, which the analyst regarded as an alarming signal for the economy. Given this context, he decided to take profits by selling Ethereum, Ethena, and PEPE for over $13 million. According to Arkham Intelligence, after these transactions, Hayes's wallet contained $28.3 million in assets, of which $22.95 million was in USDC stablecoins. Hayes stressed that sluggish credit growth in major economies is holding back nominal GDP, which is adding pressure on risky assets. He said that, against this backdrop, Bitcoin risks a deep correction, potentially falling almost 19% below current levels if it drops to $100,000. Bitcoin is already down 7.7% from its all-time high of $123,000 on July 14, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum, meanwhile, has lost 12.5% after recently rallying above $3,900. These declines have fueled speculation about a potential double-digit correction in the coming months. However, not all analysts share Hayes' pessimism. Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas noted that after BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2023, the market has become more stable, without sharp drawdowns. In addition, Blockware Solutions representative Mitchell Askew believes that the era of parabolic rises and devastating falls of Bitcoin is behind us. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant analysts reported that whales were actively accumulating Bitcoin reserves. According to them, it was the opposite trend—a decrease in the volume of cryptocurrency held by large players—that preceded the 2021 market peak.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-03 13:45:24

What’s fueling the buzz even more is the influx of whales from BlockchainFX (BFX), a trading super app that’s also mid-presale and raising millions. As these seasoned investors rotate into Pepe Dollar (PEPD) , analysts are now projecting major upside potential before its listing. Why BFX Investors Are Buying Into PEPD What’s making BlockchainFX (BFX) whales diversify into Pepe Dollar (PEPD)? It starts with momentum. PEPD is gaining recognition not just as another meme coin, but as a satirical economic commentary with serious meme utility. With a built-in Federal Reserve parody, deflationary tokenomics, and plans for Layer-2 integration, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is becoming a magnet for both meme traders and smart money alike. Complementary Assets: Meme Utility Meets Trading Infrastructure BFX investors, who are already used to high-yield staking and presale gains, now see Pepe Dollar (PEPD) as a complementary asset in their meme portfolios. And unlike joke tokens with no roadmap, PEPD incorporates a fixed token burn, anti-whale mechanics, and staking rewards to drive long-term value. BlockchainFX Continues To Shine With Utility And Rewards Meanwhile, BlockchainFX (BFX) continues to impress. As a live trading platform integrating crypto, stocks, commodities, and forex into one app, BFX offers up to 90% staking APY and real USDT rewards from trading volume. At a presale price of just $0.017 and a confirmed launch price of $0.05, BFX has already raised over $4.5 million, making it one of the top-performing presales of the year. High Growth Potential For Early PEPD Buyers It’s no surprise then that PEPD is now catching attention from BFX holders. With the crypto market returning to risk-on mode, early-stage presales like Pepe Dollar (PEPD) are attractive plays for 10x or even 100x potential. Both PEPD and BFX represent two ends of the same opportunity spectrum: one built on trading infrastructure, the other on narrative-driven meme power. Federal Reserve Burn Drives Scarcity and Price Forecasts Analysts believe that as the BFX presale matures and early gains are locked in, more capital will rotate into Pepe Dollar (PEPD). The deflationary token burn mechanism—marketed as a ""Federal Reserve Shutdown""—has already destroyed millions of PEPD, shrinking supply and boosting price projections. This feature alone has attracted BFX investors who are familiar with tokenomics that reward early holders. Utility-Backed MemeFi: The PEPD Roadmap Ahead PEPD’s roadmap also includes integrations into crypto casinos, social meme dApps, and meme swaps, enabling users to spend or stake Pepe Dollar (PEPD) in unique on-chain environments. Combined with its parody identity and Layer-2 compatibility, this positions PEPD as both a meme and utility token, an increasingly rare combination. The Best Crypto Presale Surge As Community Growth Accelerates As the presale continues, PEPD has reached over 60% of its current stage, with whales buying large allocations to lock in lower prices before the final surge. The PEPD Telegram and X community are also growing rapidly, signaling early traction and community involvement. Conclusion: BFX and PEPD Form a Powerful Dual Strategy BlockchainFX (BFX) and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) are now considered complementary plays—BFX for high-volume trading and passive income, and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) for explosive meme coin growth. Some analysts have called PEPD “the next $5 meme coin,” with potential to follow Pepe and Dogecoin’s success paths.With both presales still open, savvy investors are diversifying across BFX and PEPD. And for BlockchainFX whales looking for their next moonshot, the deflationary magic of Pepe Dollar (PEPD) seems to be just what they’re after.

Key Takeaways: Arthur Hayes warns Bitcoin could drop to $100K due to weak job data and slowing credit growth. He has already sold over $13 million in crypto and shifted most of his holdings into USDC. His outlook contrasts with growing market optimism that traditional Bitcoin cycles are fading. In a post on X , Hayes responded to on-chain data from Lookonchain showing that he had recently sold off $8.32 million worth of ETH, $4.62 million in Ethena (ENA), and $414,700 of the meme token Pepe (PEPE). The address tied to Hayes now holds $28.3 million in tokens, with $22.95 million sitting in USDC, according to Arkham Intelligence. Arthur Hayes Flags Weak Jobs Data and Sluggish Credit as Bitcoin Red Flags Hayes cited weak U.S. job data and sluggish credit growth in major economies as red flags. The July Non-Farm Payrolls report showed just 73,000 new jobs, far below expectations, and stoked renewed fears of tariffs and slowing nominal GDP growth. These factors, Hayes argued, could weigh on risk assets like Bitcoin and Ether, potentially pushing them toward the $100,000 and $3,000 levels, respectively. Bitcoin has already slipped more than 7% from its all-time high of $123,000 set on July 14, while Ether is down over 12% since briefly crossing $3,900 at the end of July. A drop to $100,000 would mark an 18.7% correction from the peak. Y? US Tariff bill coming due in 3q … at least the mrkt believes that after NFP print. No major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp. So $BTC tests $100k, $ETH tests $3k. Come see my @WebX_Asia Tokyo keynote Aug 25 for more info. Back to the beach. https://t.co/zuHlwgQKC7 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) August 2, 2025 Hayes’ caution contrasts with a growing narrative that Bitcoin’s worst pullbacks may be behind it. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas recently highlighted the asset’s reduced volatility since BlackRock’s ETF filing in mid-2023. Blockware Solutions’ Mitchell Askew echoed that sentiment, saying the era of “parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets” may be over. “Bitcoin cycles, as we know them, are dead,” Eli Nagar, CEO of Bitcoin mining pool Braiins Mining, wrote on X. “You can’t compare this phase to the ones that came before. Not in scale. Not in structure. Not in what’s at stake,” he added. Bitcoin cycles, as we know them, are dead. You can't compare this phase to the ones that came before. Not in scale.

Ethereum, by contrast, surged over 50% in July and is holding above $3,450, driven largely by ETF inflows and strong institutional demand. Despite headline gains, the Altcoin Season Index remains low at 36, indicating that capital is concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with little movement across mid-cap tokens. Analysts say broader altcoin participation is typically needed to confirm a full market cycle. Bitcoin dominance remains above 60%, limiting the rally’s depth. Institutional activity continues to support the market. Corporate treasuries have allocated over $86 billion to crypto in 2025, and JPMorgan estimates more than $60 billion in new capital has entered the space this year. Crypto inflows hit $60 billion in 12 months. JPMorgan's analysis revealed this amount surpasses investments made into private equity during the same timeframe.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.888 Market cap $887.04M Trading volume $254.53M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.8983 24-hour low $0.8219 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.15% 50-day SMA $0.9322 14-Day RSI 39.21 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $1.227 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is testing critical support at $0.824. The coin must break above the $0.95 resistance level to recapture previous highs. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF tests critical support as downtrend intensifies WIF has been locked in a relentless bearish trajectory since mid-July, cascading from peaks around $1.30 down to current levels of $0.890, representing a massive 32% decline that has broken multiple support levels. The price action on August 3, 2025, shows WIF testing the lower Bollinger Band at $0.824, a critical juncture that typically signals oversold conditions and potential reversal opportunities. However, the sustained selling pressure suggests bears remain firmly in control. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The MACD indicator paints a bearish picture with negative momentum persisting below the zero line, while declining volume during the descent indicates weakening participation that could either signal exhaustion or further capitulation ahead. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: Short-term consolidation emerges for WIF On the 4-hour timeframe, WIF is attempting to establish a base between $0.81-$0.90 after the massive selloff, with recent price action showing signs of consolidation rather than continued free fall that characterized the previous weeks. The On-Balance Volume indicator suggests some stabilization in selling pressure, though it remains at concerning lows. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7074 BUY SMA 5 $0.8253 BUY SMA 10 $0.9616 SELL SMA 21 $1.0437 SELL SMA 50 $0.9322 SELL SMA 100 $0.9336 SELL SMA 200 $1.2272 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9999 SELL EMA 5 $0.9655 SELL EMA 10 $0.8723 BUY EMA 21 $0.7372 BUY EMA 50 $0.6875 BUY EMA 100 $0.9219 SELL EMA 200 $1.3314 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF appears caught in a critical decision zone where the next major move depends on whether current support at $0.840 holds or gives way to further decline toward $0.700-$0.750. A decisive break above $0.950 with volume would signal the beginning of a potential recovery toward $1.050, while failure to hold current levels could trigger another dip to test psychological support at $0.800 or lower. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Wyckoff Pattern Reveals Imminent Breakdown In an August 2 post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Joao Wedson explained how the Bitcoin price may be at risk of a downturn over the coming months. The analyst based his conclusion on the Wyckoff Distribution model, a technical analysis framework that describes how smart money sells off assets at the top of a market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index Reaches Bearish Levels: Futures Traders Show Caution Wedson highlighted in the post that a 13-phase schematic is unfolding in real-time, which signals that the institutional investors (known as “smart money”) are preparing to exit the market, even as the retail traders remain hopeful. The analyst started his breakdown with the Preliminary Supply (PSY) phase, where there are subtle signs of institutional sales, and a Buying Climax, where price hits a peak due to exhausted demand. This phase is then followed by an Automatic Reaction (AR), a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price, defining the bottom of the distribution range. The fourth and fifth phases are Secondary Tests (ST), where price retests the highs of the distribution range, but with weaker momentum and volume. As the pattern matures, the price enters Phase B with sideways movement, confusing retail participants as the institutions quietly offload their coins. The most irrefutable signs appear in phases C and D, where there is first a Sign of Weakness (SOW), often characterized by a strong breakdown with volume; this is a major signal of demand fading. Then, there is a Last Point of Supply (LPSY), a weak rally towards the upside, which typically creates good setups for shorts. Finally, still within phases C and D, a break of ICE leads to a deeper fall, after which a second LPSY trap follows to seal the distribution. Is The Altcoin Rally Underway? Going further, Wedson pointed out that the market makers are rotating into altcoins. According to the analyst, altcoins are already exiting their accumulation zones and are being positioned for structural markups, reflecting increasing interest in the altcoin market. In contrast, Bitcoin has entered a weekly distribution phase, which may reflect as a weak or modest performance in the near term. Wedson added that, by the end of 2025, there will be a full rotation from BTC to altcoins, and then finally to fiat. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $113,439, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

Just as blockchain reshapes finance, OpenAI AI agents are poised to redefine how we interact with technology, promising a future where AI can handle complex tasks with human-like proficiency. This ambitious endeavor, driven by OpenAI, seeks to create AI that can truly ‘do anything for you’, a vision that could profoundly impact every digital interaction. OpenAI’s Ambitious Pursuit of AI Agents OpenAI’s journey towards creating sophisticated OpenAI AI agents has been a deliberate, multi-year effort, far from the ‘happy accident’ that led to ChatGPT’s viral success. The core idea is to develop AI models that can perform tasks on a computer just as a human would. This quest is underpinned by advancements in AI reasoning models, which are crucial for AI systems to understand, plan, and execute complex operations. As Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, stated in 2023, “Eventually, you’ll just ask the computer for what you need and it’ll do all of these tasks for you. These capabilities are often talked about in the AI field as agents. The upsides of this are going to be tremendous.” This vision highlights a paradigm shift: from tools that assist to agents that act autonomously on your behalf. The release of their first reasoning model, o1, in late 2024, signaled a significant leap, leading to intense competition for the talent behind these breakthroughs. Unlocking AI Reasoning: The MathGen Breakthrough A pivotal moment in OpenAI’s pursuit of advanced AI capabilities came through the work of a team known as MathGen. Led by researchers like Hunter Lightman, this team initially focused on teaching OpenAI’s models to solve high school math competitions. While seemingly niche, this work was instrumental in developing OpenAI’s industry-leading efforts in AI reasoning models. Early models struggled with mathematical concepts, but significant progress was made. For instance, an OpenAI model recently achieved a gold medal at the International Math Olympiad, a competition for top high school students globally. This success demonstrates the models’ improved ability to reason and solve complex problems. OpenAI believes these enhanced reasoning capabilities are transferable across various domains, ultimately paving the way for the general-purpose agents they’ve always aimed to build. This deliberate focus on foundational reasoning sets the stage for a truly transformative future of AI . The Reinforcement Learning Renaissance The rise of OpenAI’s reasoning models and agents is deeply intertwined with a machine learning training technique called reinforcement learning (RL). RL involves providing an AI model with feedback on whether its actions in simulated environments were correct. While RL has existed for decades – famously used by Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo in 2016 to beat a Go world champion – OpenAI has uniquely leveraged it. OpenAI’s breakthrough came in 2023 with a technique initially dubbed ‘Q*’ and later ‘Strawberry’. This combined large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning, and ‘test-time computation’, which allowed models extra time and computing power to plan and verify steps before providing an answer. This led to the ‘chain-of-thought’ (CoT) approach, dramatically improving AI performance on unfamiliar math questions. This novel combination of existing techniques proved crucial, directly leading to the development of the o1 model and accelerating the path towards sophisticated OpenAI AI agents . What Does AI Reasoning Truly Mean? The concept of an AI truly ‘reasoning’ often sparks debate. Since the launch of o1, ChatGPT’s user experience has incorporated features like ‘thinking’ and ‘reasoning’. However, OpenAI researchers approach this concept from a computer science perspective. As El Kishky explains, “We’re teaching the model how to efficiently expend compute to get an answer. So if you define it that way, yes, it is reasoning.” Hunter Lightman emphasizes focusing on the model’s results rather than strict definitions. “If the model is doing hard things, then it is doing whatever necessary approximation of reasoning it needs in order to do that,” he states. While critics may question the nomenclature, the practical capabilities of these models are undeniable. Much like an airplane mimics bird flight without replicating biological wings, AI reasoning models achieve human-like problem-solving without necessarily mirroring human cognition. More research is needed to fully understand what occurs within these complex systems, but their utility in advancing the future of AI is clear. The Next Frontier: General AI and Subjective Tasks While current OpenAI AI agents excel in well-defined, verifiable domains like coding (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex), they still face challenges with complex, subjective tasks such as online shopping or finding specific parking spots. These tasks often require nuanced understanding and adaptability that current models struggle with. Overcoming these limitations is largely a ‘data problem’, according to Lightman. OpenAI is actively researching new reinforcement learning techniques that allow them to train AI models on less verifiable tasks. Noam Brown, an OpenAI researcher involved with the IMO model and o1, notes that new general-purpose RL techniques are enabling AI to learn skills that are not easily verified. OpenAI’s IMO model, for example, uses multiple agents to explore ideas simultaneously before choosing the best answer. This multi-agent approach is gaining traction across the industry, with companies like Google and xAI also adopting similar strategies. These advancements are expected to contribute to OpenAI’s upcoming GPT-5 model, aiming to solidify its dominance in powering agents for developers and consumers. The ultimate goal is an intuitive ChatGPT agent that understands user intent without needing specific settings, capable of autonomously navigating the internet and completing tasks. The race to achieve truly general AI is intense, with OpenAI facing strong competition from Google, Anthropic, xAI, and Meta. The question is not if this agentic future will arrive, but who will get there first. OpenAI’s journey from teaching AI basic math to developing advanced reasoning models and the ambitious vision of OpenAI AI agents showcases a relentless pursuit of artificial general intelligence. While challenges remain, the rapid pace of breakthroughs, particularly in reinforcement learning and AI reasoning , suggests a transformative future of AI is rapidly approaching. These powerful agents promise to automate tasks, enhance productivity, and fundamentally change our interaction with technology, making the digital world more intuitive and responsive than ever before.

In his latest post, he noted that the number of active addresses has increased to over 1.69 million in the past 60 days. This trend is presented in a chart showing fluctuating but generally upward movement in active accounts across the two months. The chart depicts several notable peaks and retracements, arriving at a higher plateau, which aligns with the figure cited in the post. The graph, labeled “Active Addresses 60 Days,” indicates that previous activity in the network oscillated below 1 million addresses for most of the timeline. Beginning in late June, there was a sustained rise, with multiple surges pushing the total above the 1.5 million mark. The most recent data point surpasses earlier highs, illustrating a return to elevated network participation levels. $XRP Network Activity Surges! Active addresses have jumped back to 1.69M+ in the last 60 days signaling strong user engagement and network demand! Something big brewing beneath the surface? pic.twitter.com/jovGWuOX8s — Captain Redbeard (@Brett_Crypto_X) August 2, 2025 Analyst Commentary and Interpretation In his commentary accompanying the visual data, Captain Redbeard described this development as evidence of strong user engagement and robust network demand. His post suggests that the analyst views the rise in active addresses as a possible early indication of further developments that could impact the network’s growth and adoption. He concluded by implying that there may be significant underlying factors contributing to this activity, stating that there is “something big brewing beneath the surface.” Other voices in the community echoed this perspective further. One X user, X Finance Bull, commented on the post to characterize the increase as strong engagement, also describing it as evidence that fundamentals are “quietly stacking.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Correlation with Market Price Performance The rising network activity coincides with notable price appreciation for XRP . According to figures shared from CoinMarketCap, XRP has gained 23.06% over the past 30 days and is currently trading at $2.77. This price trend represents a meaningful advance within the same timeframe during which the number of active addresses has been rising. While the analyst did not directly state that the increase in user engagement has caused the price movement, the parallel timing of the network expansion and the asset’s appreciation will likely be of interest to investors monitoring market signals. The data reflects a wider context in which network usage and market value often interact. Elevated network activity can sometimes be associated with heightened trading interest, increased transaction volume, or greater deployment of XRP in payments or decentralized applications. However, the tweet did not specify which factors contributed most directly to the recent growth in address counts. The chart shared by Captain Redbeard illustrates an unambiguous rise in active addresses on the XRP Ledger over the past two months, culminating in the 1.69 million figure emphasized in his statement. While the precise causes of the surge remain undetermined based solely on the information in the tweet, the combination of increased network participation and a double-digit price increase in 30 days has underscored a period of renewed momentum for XRP.

In the post, Shapovalov said that Lido Labs, Lido Ecosystem, and Lido Alliance would downsize their contributor teams, resulting in a 15% reduction in total workforce. He clarified that the decision was about saving costs. He wrote: “This decision was about costs — not performance. It affects incredibly talented people who helped shape the protocol and community.” Shapovalov acknowledged that downsizing contributor teams may seem counterintuitive given market conditions—especially after Ethereum (ETH) nearly reached its primary psychological barrier of $4,000. However, he clarified that the move will sustain growth and realign priorities for Lido (LDO) token holders. He said, “Lido is building for the decades ahead — and this change helps reinforce that foundation.” Source: Vasiliy Shapovalov via X. Lido earned $41.56 million during the year Lido has collected $44.68 million in revenue this year. The staking protocol received $446.76 million in fees, and incentives stood at $3.12 million, resulting in total earnings of $41.56 million. DeFiLlama also reports Lido’s annual operational expenses. The DAO has 83 people on its payroll, with salaries totaling 2,400 ETH (about $8.384 million). Operational expenses are similar, at 2,424 ETH (about $8.449 million). However, these figures reflect the DAO’s 2022 budget. Lido’s earnings for this year exceed the protocol’s budget by 147% At the time of writing, Lido’s total value locked (TVL) stands at $31.323 billion, ranking it second after Aave. The DeFi protocol is deployed on seven chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Base, Gnosis Chain, Unichain, and Soneium. DeFiLlama shows that 99.96% of Lido’s TVL resides on the Ethereum network. Lido Labs is not the only DeFi company that has decided to reduce its workforce. Last month, Eigen Labs let go of 29 employees, resulting in a 25% reduction in its workforce. The decision was not driven by cost savings but rather to refocus on building EigenCloud, a decentralized cloud platform. Sreeram Kannan, Eigen Labs founder, shared his plans on X and said, “Today is one of the hardest days we’ve had at Eigen Labs … This morning, I shared plans for a restructuring of the company, streamlining our operations, and concentrating our efforts on building and scaling EigenCloud. Unfortunately, this means saying goodbye to brilliant colleagues.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|ETH|Lido,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|LDO|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-03 14:27:56

This marks a significant technical pivot that could elevate DOGE from meme token to smart contract–ready platform. News of this upgrade proposal comes at a time when top chains like Solana and Binance Smart Chain are expanding into new ecosystems. Investors are left wondering whether DOGE can effectively compete with SOL or BNB — and how other rising tokens like RTX might fit in. A Major Breakthrough for Dogecoin, But Is It Enough? The Dogecoin price jumped over 6% this week after news broke that Dogecoin developers are preparing a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocol upgrade. The upgrade could allow DOGE to handle private transactions and scale much better, a step aimed at giving the meme coin some much-needed technical depth. Crypto expert, Ali Martinez, has said that Dogecoin could be forming a falling wedge . This is a bullish signal that can catapult Digecoin price to a target of $0.265. And while everyone’s watching Dogecoin price charts, there’s another coin that could change the game in 2025. Solana Keeps Its Crown in Speed: Big Announcements Signal More Gains Solana (SOL) has stayed in the limelight this month after Visa confirmed expansion of its stablecoin settlement pilot on the Solana network. With SOL prices up 3.1% today and trading at around $150, the chain continues to be praised for its low gas fees and speed. Experts have observed that Solana is completing a cup and handle formation on the weekly chart. The pattern suggests a strong accumulation phase with potential for a significant upward movement, up to about $500 or even $1,000. Investors eye Solana as a Layer 2 Ethereum alternative, and as cross-chain compatibility improves, SOL remains a favorite among those scouting the top crypto to buy now. BNB: Still a Powerhouse Despite Legal Storms Binance Coin (BNB) remains sturdy, currently hovering around $570, despite ongoing legal drama in the U.S. Binance has launched a new AI trading assistant inside its app, pushing into mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, BNB Chain’s latest push toward decentralized exchanges has led to a bump in DeFi activity. Analysts have seen that BNB just broke out of a year-long channel and has turned resistance into support . If this move holds, there is a clear 35% upside to around $1,100. Best Crypto to Buy: How Remittix (RTX) Measures Up Enter Remittix, a rising Remittix DeFi project that opts for utility over hype. Remittix revealed its wallet ahead of a planned Q3 launch. Unlike DOGE, which is retrofitting smart contract features, RTX is built for them from day one. In contrast to legacy platforms or speculative token upgrades, Remittix hits every checkbox that modern investors search for: crypto solving real world problems, low gas fee crypto project, and a clear operational use case. It’s already emerging as a best crypto presale candidate worth exploring. Why Remittix Stands Out: Real‑World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms Wallet Coming Q3: Mobile‑first interface with real‑time FX conversion 20% Referral Rewards: Earn RTX by sharing the project While DOGE talks about enabling rollups, Remittix already works across chains with staking and global money transfers. It’s not chasing SOL or BNB—it solves problems they don’t address. Remittix may well be the next big altcoin 2025 and a strong low cap crypto gem. Remittix is Built for Purpose: Become a Part of it Dogecoin’s ZKP upgrade is technically ambitious. But even if accepted, DOGE must still attract developers and build live applications to be competitive with Solana or BNB. Meanwhile, Remittix is moving through milestones—security audit passed, wallet revealed, global utility in development. Investors ask: what’s the most practical token to hold now? DOGE is evolving. Remittix is already delivering. With a $250,000 giveaway and real traction, RTX presents more than promise—it offers momentum.

On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revised down the job growth figures for June from 147,000 to 14,000, a 90% drop. Figures for May were also revised down from 144,000 to 19,000, bringing the combined two-month downward revision to 258,000 jobs. In a new CNBC interview, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius says the jobs data suggest that the US economy is losing steam. “Weeks ago, we wrote a report with the title ‘Stall Speed.’ We have only a little more than 1% growth in GDP in the first half and with this jobs number, I think that brings the picture to clearly stall speed image. I’m looking at an economy that is still growing but is growing very slowly. And the unemployment rate is drifting higher, gradually. But I do think that the downside risks in the labor market…. are definitely there.” According to Hatzius, the Fed now has the green light to cut rates in the coming months to support the labor market. “I think it makes it even more likely that they’re going to cut in September. We have had a series of 25 basis point cuts in September, October, December and to me that seems very likely. And it could be more. It’s certainly a reasonable idea that we’re in the restrictive territory, but this sort of data suggests that maybe we should get back to neutral a little bit more quickly.

The statue was found in a nearby lake after the theft was first confirmed on August 3, 2025. The group behind the statue, Satoshigallery, had also launched a campaign to recover it on X, formerly Twitter. The Satoshi statue was cut off and removed from its staging platform. Source: Satoshigallery What happened to the Satoshi statue? The theft seemed to have been pointed out by @Grittoshi, a concerned Bitcoin fan who tagged several people on X and asked where the statue had gone. After the user called attention to its disappearance, Satoshigroup confirmed the theft via a post on X and offered anyone with information on its whereabouts 0.1 BTC, which is approximately worth $11,000 at current prices. “You can steal our symbol but you will never be able to steal our souls. Thank you all for the nice messages,” the group wrote before emphasizing its resolve to continue the project of installing Satoshi Nakamoto statues in 21 cities worldwide. No clear motives or suspects have been identified, and authorities did not release further details on the theft. In the meantime, Satoshigallery is encouraging public involvement. Shortly after the announcement of the bounty for the statue, @Grittoshi, the same one referenced by earlier reports as the person who reported the disappearance, shared a tweet explaining what he believes happened to the statue. “Ockham’s razor, my theory is as follow,” he wrote . “I was in the parc on August 1st at night. It was still there. Twas Swiss National day. Many youngsters went drunk on the open aur café just besdide the statue. On their way back home they just had “fun” with the statue (welded by only 2 points that still remain as you can see on my pics).” Grittoshi theorized that since there are cameras everywhere in the city, the kids must have thrown it inside the lake nearby before heading home. “No way, they could have carried it unnoticed in the city,” he concluded. “So my opinion: it is in the lake, just beside its previous location.” A couple of hours later, he shared pictures of the recovered statue, as well as a quote tweet tagging footage of its recovery. Update: it seems i was right about the turn of events pic.twitter.com/X6qNYDreBC — Gritto (@Grittoshi) August 3, 2025 Satoshi statues set to go up in 21 cities worldwide The statue was designed by Italian artist Valentina Picozzi and allegedly fashioned from 304 stainless steel and corten blocks. It was unveiled in October 2024 as part of Lugano’s push to become a global Bitcoin hub and was marketed as a tribute to Bitcoin’s anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The third Statue of Satoshi Nakamoto was just unveiled in Tokyo! Here is the location 🇯🇵 Tokyo, Japan: https://t.co/Zn32sYZsCK Images create culture Culture shapes values Values influence the future We are all Satoshi! https://t.co/HcBAtmxSKL pic.twitter.com/2Rgw05OQjq — Satoshigallery (@satoshigallery) April 25, 2025 The statue’s concept, which features a disappearing effect that makes it disappear when viewed from the front or behind, is a nod to Nakamoto’s anonymity and reportedly took 18 months of research and three months to build. It was placed in front of Villa Ciani during the Plan B Forum, an annual blockchain event co-hosted by the city of Lugano and stablecoin issuer Tether. As it stands, Satoshigallery has put up the same statue in two other places across the world aside from Lugano. One is situated at Bitcoin Beach, El Salvador, while the other was just recently unveiled in Tokyo, Japan. Despite the disaster that met the one in Lugano, the group will continue putting up the statues until there are 21 of them scattered across the world. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Every major Gulf index except Egypt closed in the red. Saudi Arabia and Qatar led the declines, while Egypt was the only one to show a gain. The sell-off was driven by a combination of disappointing quarterly numbers from top Gulf companies and a growing sense of uncertainty coming from Washington, as President Donald Trump rolled out a new collection of import tariffs. Trump, now back in the White House, signed an executive order Thursday that slaps tariffs between 10% and 41% on goods coming from countries that missed his August 1 trade deadline. The move hit investor confidence across the region. The timing clashed with weak job numbers from the U.S. and fed anxiety around the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. Together, they created the kind of toxic environment that leaves no room for market optimism. Saudi Aramco, SABIC, and Jabal Omar trigger sell-offs Saudi Arabia’s main index fell 0.8%, dragged down by a 1.2% loss in Saudi Aramco just days ahead of its earnings report due Tuesday. Aramco wasn’t alone. Jabal Omar Development, which runs hotels and property near Mecca’s Grand Mosque, dropped 5.4% after posting a second-quarter loss. The company blamed the hit on lower hotel revenue and a 106 million riyal property impairment charge that shrank gross profits. It didn’t stop there. Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), 70% owned by Aramco, reported its own Q2 loss and fell 1.2%. SABIC said the red ink was caused by 3.78 billion riyals in impairment and provisions tied to shutting down a cracker in the UK. That closure was part of a broader review of its operations aimed at cutting costs and staying profitable in a tougher environment. The biggest single hit came from Saudi Aramco Base Oil Co, which crashed 10%, its worst day since going public in December 2022. The loss came after the company reported an 18% drop in quarterly profits, leaving investors no room for second guesses. Tariffs reshape global business, Qatar index falls, Egypt rises Qatar’s index also fell 0.8%, led by a 1.8% decline in Qatar Islamic Bank. Traders showed no interest in holding positions with earnings falling short and no signal of relief from global conditions. Though Qatar hasn’t taken a direct hit from Trump’s tariffs yet, the region as a whole is responding to the shift in global trade policy. While the Gulf struggled, Egypt’s blue-chip index edged up 0.2%, thanks to a 3.2% rise in Eastern Company, the state-controlled tobacco producer. It was the only name in the region that gave investors something to hold onto as broader sentiment collapsed. Meanwhile, oil prices, which act as a pulse for Gulf markets, dropped by $2 per barrel on Friday. Investors pulled back after rumors spread of a production increase by OPEC and allies. Those rumors became fact Sunday when eight OPEC+ countries agreed to boost output in September by 548,000 barrels per day, Reuters reported during the meeting. As the U.S. tightens trade rules, companies are already adjusting. Hydro CFO Trond Olaf Christophersen told CNBC, “We are concerned about the competitiveness of aluminum compared to other materials.” He added that U.S. tariff costs are being passed on to customers, but the long-term issue is that “some customers in packaging are already testing steel and plastic alternatives.” Business leaders across sectors, from chocolate and telecom to banking and energy, are ripping up their playbooks. The old “just-in-time” model is out. Now it’s about making products closer to buyers, asking for tariff exemptions, and watching for changes in how people spend money. Tariffs are no longer side issues. They’re now a major part of how companies manage risk. And the Gulf, caught in the middle of earnings disappointments and global trade battles, is feeling the full weight of it. Get seen where it counts.

In a Sunday interview with Politis, the Cypriot central bank chief commented, “The euro-zone economy appears resilient, despite difficulties internationally. Nevertheless, the environment remains uncertain, mainly due to trade tensions.” However, he argued that the trade deal the EU and US agreed to would help ease some of that uncertainty. Patsalides believes inflation will align with the ECB’s 2% target According to Patsalides, global instability, rising trade tensions , and geopolitical risks have cultivated uncertainty and made analysts adopt more conservative forecasts. Nonetheless, he echoed, the consensus among policymakers is that inflation will remain consistent with predictions and should align with the ECB’s 2% target over time. The ECB paused its streak of eight consecutive rate cuts by leaving interest rates unchanged last month. According to reports, the council still wants to maintain rates steady, with those pushing for an additional cut meeting significant pushback. Patsalides, however, maintained that calling the move a pause would be “premature,” underscoring the ECB’s commitment to a data-driven approach for future decisions. He explained to the Nicosia-based newspaper that monetary policy decisions are made on a meeting-by-meeting basis, guided by the latest data. He noted that the continued global and eurozone uncertainty makes this approach essential. However, ECB Governing Council member Peter Kazimir has even warned against lowering rates in September unless compelling data indicates a major economic condition slump. He also noted that committing to a predetermined rate path would be ill-advised, especially given current economic volatility. Other ECB members shared a similarly cautious outlook. Latvia’s Kazaks supported the view that further rate reductions aren’t needed at this stage. Villeroy de Galhau from France cautioned that keeping all policy options on the table is essential. Kazimir also argued that while recent stability in headline inflation is good, it’s not enough to let policymakers lower their guard. He warned that inflationary pressures could reemerge, especially if supply chain disruptions return. He also acknowledged the EU-US agreement as encouraging but warned that it doesn’t mean the eurozone economy is in the clear. So far, for the second quarter, the eurozone economy has grown 0.1%, by 0.2% in the EU, compared with the previous quarter. Gabriel Makhlouf says the ECB should ‘wait and see’ before implementing rate cuts Meanwhile, in an interview with the Business Post on Sunday, Irish central bank chief Gabriel Makhlouf said interest rates are now high enough for the ECB to adopt a “wait-and-see” stance on upcoming policy moves. In another interview, he argued that inflation in the region is stabilizing and that economic growth was tracking expectations, justifying his “wait-and-see” approach to future policy decisions. President Christine Lagarde gave a similar view, saying that policymakers are in a good position to wait-and-see, without offering guidance on future steps. Nonetheless, he refrained from commenting further on the trade deal between the EU and the US, stating that the limited information available on Sunday’s 15% deal made it difficult to provide a well-informed analysis. However, he warned that the new US tariffs on EU goods would hinder growth compared to six months ago, even if the move might bring some clarity.

JP Morgan analysts examined this intriguing data in a note. According to the report, miners earned an average of $57,400 per EH/s (exahash/second) in daily block rewards. “July was another strong month for Bitcoin miners. Mining profitability reached its highest level since the last halving (April 2024), and ten of the thirteen miners we track outperformed the BTC price increase by 8%,” analysts Reginald L. Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. Bitcoin reached a record high of $122,838 in July, capping a relatively steady rally that lasted more than two months. While the price has retreated since its peak, it remains within about 8% of that high, according to CoinGecko data. Related News: Details Revealed About Ripple's Application to Establish the “Ripple National Trust Bank” However, miners are also struggling with rising operational costs and declining transaction validation rewards on the blockchain. “Daily revenue and gross profit are 43% and 50% below their pre-halving levels, respectively,” the report stated. In July, mining difficulty increased by 9%. According to UK-based asset manager Farside Investors, the number of coins produced by the top 11 miners decreased for four consecutive months in the first six months of the year. However, Farside has not yet released data for July. During the last halving, the reward fell from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Bitcoin mining operations require significant electricity consumption, making them more costly to operate when Bitcoin prices fall. The Bitcoin mining industry typically consists of large storage areas filled with computers processing transactions on the network. The high energy demands of these computer networks make them difficult to source at affordable prices. *This is not investment advice.

49471147,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/heres-the-best-meme-coin-to-buy-to-turn-750-into-15-million-by-2027,1754234245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/49471147.jpeg,Here's the Best Meme Coin To Buy to Turn $750 into $1.5 Million By 2027,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/heres-the-best-meme-coin-to-buy-to-turn-750-into-15-million-by-2027,"Meme coins have become one of crypto’s most volatile but profitable niches. They can deliver life-changing gains for early investors within a short time. In the last bull cycle, tokens like PEPE and BONK delivered triple- and quadruple-digit returns. However, most of these well-known names no longer carry the same asymmetric upside they once did. They cannot turn a small stake of $750 into $1.5 million by 2027—a 2000X increase. If you’re searching for the next high-risk, high-reward opportunity with realistic 2000x potential, the focus needs to shift toward a different contender: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Why PEPE, BONK, and PENGU Aren’t the Best Entry While these three meme coins have established their presence, in 2025, they may not be the best bet. Here's why: PEPE Coin (PEPE) The original frog meme coin, PEPE , shocked the market with a historic rally in 2023–2024. It produced early gains of more than 500x for those who bought in during its micro-cap phase. However, at its current multibillion-dollar valuation, repeating that type of move is nearly impossible. To deliver another 2000x, PEPE would need to overtake Bitcoin’s market cap, a scenario no serious analyst sees as feasible. Its growth is now tied to incremental adoption rather than parabolic speculation. Bonk (BONK) BONK trades at $0.000035, surging on ETF speculation and community momentum. Institutional demand and token burns fuel excitement, but analysts see a rally toward $0.00005 to $0.00006. This means +100–130% upside—significant, but unlikely to create millionaires from small positions. BONK’s value is tightly linked to Solana’s ecosystem. While BONK might still produce a 3–5x in the next bull cycle, its higher circulating supply and existing liquidity depth limit its potential for extreme exponential growth. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Trading at approximately $0.0425 with a $2.7B valuation, PENGU soared 343% in 30 days on NFT revival and partnerships. But price targets hover around $0.055 to 0.07. This represents a maximum 300% return, far from 100×+ returns. While it has strong community engagement and retail visibility, it’s not structured to deliver 1000x‑plus gains. Its roadmap emphasizes stability and mainstream integration, not massive price spikes. All three offer legitimate plays that could 10x to 20x by 2027. However, none offer the multibagger potential that Little Pepe does. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The 200× Meme Chain in the Making Most meme coins ride hype waves, pump for a few weeks, then fade. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is designed to do the opposite. It’s built to last, scale, and dominate. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is not just a meme coin riding the next hype wave—it’s a purpose-built ecosystem token that integrates meme culture with real blockchain utility. Its developers are building an Ethereum-compatible Layer‑2 chain tailored exclusively for meme projects. This technical foundation gives LILPEPE a much broader utility case than its predecessors and sets it up for sustained network-driven demand rather than short-term speculation. Key Features Include: Ultra-low fees & instant settlements: Its Layer‑2 chain allows near-zero transaction costs and sub-second finality. This makes it suitable for tipping, gaming, micro-payments, and on-chain communities. Sniper-bot protection: Unlike many meme presales that suffer from whales and bots sniping large allocations, LILPEPE’s infrastructure actively prevents such exploits. It's building trust and creating fairer distribution. Pepe’s Pump Pad Launchpad: A native launch platform for new meme coins. Each project launched must lock liquidity automatically and implement anti-rug measures. These features ensure LILPEPE isn’t just a one-off token but a hub for an entire ecosystem of future meme assets. Virality Markets: Displaying Remarkable Traction Its presale has been a record-breaker, moving at record speed from one stage to another. Stage 8, priced at $0.0017, is almost sold out, with over $13 million raised. CoinMarketCap listing before launch—rare for any early-stage token. Confirmed Tier‑1 exchange listings post-presale—offering immediate liquidity and exposure. Massive $777,000 giveaway campaign —10 winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens, amplifying social media buzz. Community Growth Is Exploding: Twitter added 2,000 new followers in three days while Telegram saw over 1,000 members in the same window. How $750 Turns into $1.5 million Target: $6.00 by Late 2027 With an expected launch price of $0.003, reaching $6 represents a 2000x move, turning $750 into $1.5 million. Growth Drivers Amplifying the Multiplier Compound utility: Each meme token launched on Pump Pad uses LILPEPE for gas, locking value into LILPEPE as demand for token creation grows. Viral catalyst pool: influencer grabs, community campaigns, and the giveaway ensure ongoing social amplification. Low-cap flexibility: early-stage liquidity allows sharper price moves than larger legacy meme coins Upcoming CEX liquidity: institutional and retail inflows expected post-listing. Liquidity always attracts price action. Bottom Line Pepe Coin, Bonk, and Pudgy Penguins all had their moments. But none offer the rare combination of infrastructure, scalability, and low entry price that Little Pepe brings. At $0.0017 per token, LILPEPE is still in the early innings. Stage 8 is nearly sold out, press attention is mounting, and an inevitable CEX boom is approaching. 👉 Visit littlepepe.com now to secure your stake before Stage 8 closes.

HSBC, which trades in London, hit a record high just before releasing its second-quarter earnings this week. Barclays and Santander both climbed to their highest since 2008. In Italy, UniCredit surged to a peak it hadn’t reached since 2011. Even with a pullback after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on dozens of countries on Friday, the banking sector on the Stoxx 600 is still up 34% for the year. That’s not only ahead of U.S. banks but also better than the sector’s performance in 2021, and it could become their strongest run since 2009. The growth stands out because this sector was once seen as a lost cause in global markets. “Europe’s banks have shifted from pariah status to market darlings,” said Justin Bisseker, a European banks analyst at Schroders. He said the turnaround is tied to three things: “the transformative impact on revenues of higher interest rates,” a stable economy, and internal cost-cutting by banks to become more efficient. Higher long-term rates lift net interest income Long-term borrowing costs in Europe are now climbing faster than short-term ones. This is key for banks because it boosts their net interest income, which is the gap between what they earn on loans and what they pay depositors. In Germany, 30-year bond yields are now 1.3 percentage points higher than two-year yields. In the UK, the difference is even wider at 1.5 percentage points. That steep curve didn’t exist just two years ago. Back then, the long-term rates were actually below short-term ones, making it hard for banks to profit off lending. The reversal started after the COVID-19 pandemic, when central banks began hiking interest rates to fight off inflation and cut back on their massive bond-buying programs. Source: FT Markets Some lenders are also gaining from volatile financial markets triggered by Trump’s trade policies. The latest wave of tariffs sparked sharp market moves that gave banks with trading desks a big advantage in earnings. Still, even with these new sources of revenue, there’s uncertainty about how long the ride will last. The current earnings momentum depends heavily on long-term rates staying elevated, something nobody can guarantee. While HSBC shares slid slightly after its Q2 earnings failed to meet expectations on Wednesday, they still sit at the highest point since 2001. Valuations rise, but sector faces political roadblocks For the first time in years, banks across Europe are being valued at their book value, meaning their stock price matches the value of their assets. By comparison, JPMorgan trades at 2.4 times book value, while Goldman Sachs trades at 2 times. That discount is pulling more investors in. “These banks are cheap and uniquely positioned for a pick-up in domestic demand,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. Part of the draw is economic optimism. If the European economy keeps improving, banks could see stronger loan growth. But not everyone is convinced the boom will keep going. Francesco Sandrini, global head of multi-asset strategies at Amundi, warned that “banks appear the cleanest shirt in the basket,” but also added there’s “a growing feeling the best may be past.” He said analysts have waited years for major bank consolidation to shake up the sector, but it just hasn’t happened. Efforts to merge banks are running into political blocks. BBVA’s plan to acquire Sabadell was met with pushback. So was UniCredit’s attempt to buy BPM. Without these deals, the industry’s ability to expand or compete more aggressively is limited. Meanwhile, banks have tried to reduce their reliance on interest rates by expanding into wealth management, but that shift hasn’t been tested under falling rates yet. Whether those strategies will work if rate hikes slow down remains to be seen. Even with doubts, key performance metrics look stronger than they’ve been in years. Many banks are reporting return on tangible equity above 10%, a milestone that was out of reach during the low-rate era. They’re also trading at 10 times forward earnings, while U.S. competitors sit above 13 times, based on Bloomberg’s numbers. Get seen where it counts.

Ripple , a United States-based provider of blockchain-based banking payments technology, has maintained a prominent role in this evolution. A document shared by Crypto researcher SMQKE underscores that since 2014, numerous financial institutions, including HSBC, UBS, and Western Union, have initiated trials or advanced commercialization programs focused on Ripple’s solutions. This early experimentation has allowed major global banks to assess the feasibility of blockchain in reducing settlement times and lowering costs in cross-border payments. HSBC —> Announced advanced commercialization efforts using Ripple’s technology. Documented. https://t.co/Ei3AYY4iRv pic.twitter.com/R563HyVzrf — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 2, 2025 HSBC, in particular, has been identified as one of the financial institutions that progressed beyond limited pilot testing. The documentation highlights that HSBC formally announced advanced commercialization initiatives incorporating Ripple’s technology . These efforts have contributed to the gradual normalization of blockchain infrastructure in mainstream financial services, moving it from proof-of-concept trials to broader operational models. Formation of the Global Payments Steering Group The document further details that banks such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Santander , UniCredit, Standard Chartered, Westpac, and Royal Bank of Canada collaborated to establish the Global Payments Steering Group, known as GPSG. HSBC has been connected to this broader ecosystem through its commercialization programs. GPSG was organized to create common rules and governance frameworks that would guide the deployment of Ripple’s blockchain technology in global payments. This governance structure has played a role in establishing shared operational standards, ensuring interoperability, and clarifying compliance practices among participating institutions. The establishment of GPSG represents a key milestone in building collective industry commitment to blockchain infrastructure. The framework has been described as an important step toward addressing regulatory uncertainties while fostering cooperation among major international banks. New Expansion Plans for Blockchain Payment Services In the recent tweet thread, SMQKE shared additional disclosures from a private HSBC investor call held in July 2025. According to this communication, HSBC outlined plans to broaden its blockchain-based services significantly beginning in September 2025. Specifically, the bank intends to introduce “always-on” wholesale cross-border payments that will function 24/7. This development is designed to improve liquidity management and enable clients to settle wholesale transactions without traditional time constraints imposed by standard banking hours. The institution also indicated that preparations are underway for a United States rollout of wholesale blockchain payment services, projected for early 2026. This timeline has reportedly been accelerated by the enactment of recent federal legislation supporting pro-crypto policies. HSBC representatives on the investor call stated that the bank expects to proceed at a rapid pace in bringing these services to market. The commitment to expedite deployment signals a shift from exploratory and pilot activities toward full-scale commercial integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Transition from Planning to Large-Scale Deployment The tweet emphasized that HSBC’s remarks reflect a broader industry trend, with financial institutions moving decisively from conceptual planning to implementation of operational blockchain infrastructure. The statement that institutions are advancing toward full-scale deployment indicates that barriers such as regulatory uncertainty and technological integration challenges are being addressed with increasing urgency. Ripple’s role as a technology provider remains central to these developments. The underlying infrastructure that supports real-time cross-border settlement has been subject to years of validation, regulatory dialogue, and incremental commercialization. HSBC’s current initiatives and public disclosures demonstrate that blockchain’s role in wholesale payment systems is transitioning to a new phase defined by production-scale delivery. SMQKE’s coverage of the call and supporting documentation illustrates that HSBC is positioning itself to become a leading adopter of blockchain payments within the banking sector.

49472083,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=778478,1754234840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49472083.jpeg,Crypto market cools in August after ETF-driven summer rally,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-rally-faces-august-chill/,"The crypto market is cooling down in August after two straight months of bullish action driven by institutional money. ETF inflows into both bitcoin and ether dominated headlines in June and July, but that trend is now facing pressure from new economic fears. According to CNBC, weak U.S. labor numbers and aggressive tariffs rolled out by President Donald Trump, ranging between 10% and 41%, have triggered broader market jitters. The result is a pullback in stocks, a spike in bond demand, and growing expectations that crypto may not be immune this time. Ether jumped over 49% last month, outpacing bitcoin, which still saw an 8% gain and climbed to a new all-time high in the middle of July. That performance was fueled by a mix of steady bitcoin ETF inflows, a sudden $5 billion surge into ether funds, and the rise of new crypto treasury firms aggressively accumulating both tokens. Combined, these factors pushed momentum to its peak. Now, with volatility back in the picture, traders are reassessing exposure, especially in high-risk corners of the market. ETF dominance fades as traders eye tighter ranges The macro environment is no longer just background noise. “Bitcoin is caught between ETF-driven optimism and uncertainty around global trade tensions,” said Ray Youssef, CEO of the NoOnes app. “It remains the risk benchmark, but it may trade in a tighter range unless a new macro catalyst emerges, such as another unexpected rate move or geopolitical shift … I expect August to be relatively muted in terms of price volatility, but deceptively active in terms of positioning.” Data from the market shows the ETF fuel is still coming in, just at a steadier pace. Bitcoin ETFs brought in around $6 billion last month, bringing their total to $55 billion since launch. Ether ETFs, meanwhile, now sit at $9.64 billion, with July alone accounting for over half that. That sharp spike in ether interest has shifted positioning away from bitcoin toward ETH-focused trades. The rotation has already shown up in the stock market. Shares of Coinbase rose 27% in the past two months, Galaxy Digital gained 45%, and bitcoin miner Iren surged 76%. Ether’s rise pulled other names with it. Bitmine Immersion, a firm focused on ether treasuries, soared 136%. Circle, tied to stablecoins, jumped more than 400%. Fed meeting and tariffs stir uncertainty ahead Investors aren’t running for the exits, but they’re no longer chasing either. “Near term, I think bitcoin stays range-bound unless we get a big macro shift,” said Pauline Shangett, chief strategy officer at ChangeNOW. “ETH has more momentum thanks to ETF demand and whale activity, which could help it hold up better even in a choppy market.” Those whales are now playing a major role in Ether’s performance, especially around the $3,750 zone. If it holds, there’s a shot at $4,000. Traders are watching $3,200 to $2,900 as key support. Youssef sees bitcoin trading between $114,000 and $120,000 this month, with solid buying interest showing up if prices fall to $103,000-$109,000. But the big question now is what happens in September. “The real wildcard is the September Fed meeting,” Youssef said. “[Chair] Jerome Powell’s remarks often create sharp, short-term volatility, and with geopolitical tensions rising, we could see sudden shifts in sentiment. Still, unless macro conditions deteriorate significantly, both BTC and ETH appear to be building momentum beneath the surface.” That momentum isn’t obvious on the charts, but some technical analysts aren’t waiting for a signal. Read Harvey, an analyst at Wolfe Research, said in a note on Wednesday that his team is staying long. His words were: “We are taking advantage of this consolidation and playing for this highly compelling setup to reaccelerate and break out … For now, we’re buyers of pullbacks in the space and expect reaccelerations in the coming weeks, a development that should lead to further crypto outperformance vs. equities.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Top ADA Holders Are Mass Migrating To Remittix,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/is-the-cardano-price-set-to-return-to-sub-0-50-top-ada-holders-are-mass-migrating-to-remittix/,"Cardano’s sharp price dip has left investors uneasy, with ADA price now hovering dangerously close to the $0.50 mark. As sell pressure mounts, many top ADA holders are shifting their focus to Remittix , a rising PayFi protocol offering real-world crypto utility. With momentum building ahead of its wallet launch, Remittix is quickly becoming the go-to alternative for those looking to escape ADA’s continued slide. Cardano Price Looks Vulnerable Below $0.70 Cardano (ADA) is flashing red again, and top holders are starting to bail. After climbing nearly 30% in July, ADA price reversed sharply, plunging over 8% in just 24 hours. That drop triggered a brutal $8.3 million in liquidations, wiping out many long traders who bet on a continued rally. As of now, ADA price today sits at $0.7217, dangerously close to breaching the crucial $0.70 support zone. According to Cardano news on CoinGlass, over 97% of the liquidated positions came from bullish bets. The RSI now sits at 31.57, approaching oversold territory, but there’s little comfort in that if confidence doesn’t return soon. The broader market crash, with Bitcoin and Ethereum also down, has added to ADA’s pain. The optimism surrounding Starstream development—a project that could unlock in-browser zk-proofs—isn’t stopping the bleeding either. If Cardano price dips below $0.70, analysts say the next stop could be $0.55 or even lower. ADA price prediction models are adjusting quickly, with some warning of a possible return to sub-$0.50 levels if momentum fails to reverse. And the real kicker? Whale wallets are on the move, and a growing number of large ADA holders are now reallocating to Remittix as a hedge against deeper losses. Real-World Use Drives Cardano Whales Into Remittix While Cardano price dips toward the dreaded $0.50 line, many of its top holders are moving quietly into Remittix. And it’s not hard to see why. Remittix isn’t just another utility token. This PayFi protocol solves one of crypto’s biggest failures—real-world usability. With support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and instant fiat bank payouts, Remittix is built for function, not hype. Unlike ADA price prediction models that keep slipping lower each week, analysts see Remittix rising fast, powered by its simple, needed utility. The protocol has already processed early test transactions in under 30 seconds and is gearing up for a full wallet rollout on September 15. With the ADA price today looking weaker by the hour, whales are rotating out and placing fresh bets on this payment-focused newcomer. Remittix DeFi project isn’t promising vague future upgrades. It’s delivering working tools right now. Instantly converts crypto to fiat for bank deposits Supports 40+ cryptocurrencies for seamless payments Targets underserved regions and real-world business adoption Announces $250,000 Remittix Giveaway and wallet beta launch The fact that major ADA wallets are migrating speaks volumes.

According to a new press release from the Department of Justice (DOJ), 31-year-old Jessie El-Ghoul has been charged with one count of theft of government funds, one count of bank fraud and four counts of money laundering for allegedly defrauding the government. Authorities allege that El-Ghoul – who owned the Affordable Motor Group car dealership in Leominster – deposited a forged tax refund check worth $1.34 million into his business account originally made out by the U.S. Treasury Department to an unnamed Canadian firm. After depositing the fake check, El-Ghoul returned to the bank and took out four cashier’s checks payable to shell companies and a law firm as a means of laundering the funds. He was arrested and charged on June 6th. According to the press release, he faces up to 10 years for the theft of the funds, up to 30 years for bank fraud and up to 20 years for each count of money laundering. In June, the DOJ unveiled that El-Ghoul was allegedly part of a criminal ring that stole tax refunds from legitimate taxpayers. Authorities say that between 2023 and 2024, the organization – which included eight people – allegedly stole $8.8 million in tax refund checks and deposited the funds into accounts they controlled. As stated by United States Attorney Leah B. Foley at the time, “As alleged, these defendants stole millions in tax refunds owed to hardworking Americans and used Massachusetts businesses and community banks to defraud the U.S. Treasury.

At its current level just above $113,500, that jump would take BTC up to about $189,000. It’s a simple idea with big implications. Related Reading: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst Potential Market Share Based on reports, global liquidity—known as M2—is sitting at roughly $127 trillion, while all mined gold adds up to almost $24 trillion. CoinShares applies a so-called Total Addressable Market (TAM) model to those figures. If Bitcoin captures 2% of global M2 and 5% of gold’s market cap, the sum points to a $189,000 price tag. It doesn’t assume BTC will take over corporate treasuries or forex reserves, yet even that limited reach could send prices much higher. Some Bitcoin Investors Are Excited Many in the crypto crowd like how clear it is. You look at the size of the cash and gold markets. You pick some modest targets. Then you do the math. It shows that winning tiny slivers of those pools could be very rewarding. You don’t need a blanket take-over of every money market to make a strong case for Bitcoin as an investment. Top-Down Model In Action A TAM model starts at the top. It sizes up the biggest buckets—cash, deposits, gold—then assumes what share a newcomer might grab. It’s common in startup pitches. Here, CoinShares leans on data from the World Gold Council, Trading Economics and Glassnode to keep the numbers fresh. The big pools aren’t static, but they do highlight the scale of what’s out there. This method skips over many real hurdles. Regulation could slow adoption. New digital coins might offer competing features. Shifts in interest rates can shrink or swell M2 overnight. Even gold’s market value can dip if miners sell or central banks offload bars. That makes any model’s timeline shaky. Challenges And Timelines Based on projections, Bitcoin’s share of these markets might creep up over the next decade. That assumes steady gains in user trust, clearer rules from governments and smoother ways for big institutions to buy and hold crypto. Related Reading: XRP ETF Approval Incoming? Analyst Eyes September-October Window If that path holds, hitting 2% of global liquidity and 5% of gold could be realistic. But if policies shift or fresh tech disappoints, the climb could stall. Whether Bitcoin reaches $189,000 will depend on a mix of policy, innovation and investor appetite. For now, the TAM view gives a neat snapshot of what could happen if the top coin starts grabbing those market shares.

The flagship cryptocurrency has reclaimed $114,000 and is currently trading around $114,175. Markets plummeted after a wave of news and data impacted investor sentiment, dragging crypto down as well. BTC’s decline is due to growing risk-off sentiment among investors. All major US stock indices are also down amid renewed trade uncertainty and a poor US jobs report. Solo Bitcoin Mining Returning? Solo Bitcoin miners are claiming full Bitcoin block rewards even as the network’s hash rate hovers around all-time highs. The network hash rate is currently above 900 exahashes per second (EH/s). The high hash rate indicates growing competition and higher mining difficulty, making it difficult for solo miners to win a block. However, one solo miner has defied odds to secure block 907,283 via the Solo CK Pool, earning the full 3.125 BTC rewards, worth over $372,000. The miner also received an additional $3,426 in transaction fees. This wasn’t an isolated incident; solo miners were increasingly securing blocks. Another miner with only 2.3 petahashes of power also claimed a full reward, with similar blocks also recorded in February, March, and June. Samuel Li, chief technology officer of ASICKey, stated, “We’re seeing solo miners win blocks not because of luck, but because they’re running powerful, efficient hardware.” Li added that efficiency is everything for solo miners, highlighting the company’s KEYMINER A1. The KEYMINER A1 is part of ASICKey’s latest hardware line. “Take our KEYMINER A1—it draws just 650 watts but delivers 1,100 TH/s on Bitcoin, with monthly profits around $1,200. For those diversifying into altcoins, it can earn up to $3,800 per month mining Dash.” However, Li stated that the fundamental odds of solo miners securing a full block had not changed despite improvements in ASIC efficiency. “Solo mining is still mostly a lottery, unless you control tens of PH/s, which is realistically the bare minimum for having a measurable statistical shot at success within a reasonable time frame.” Bitcoin Still In Mid-Cycle Range Bitcoin’s (BTC) push from $100,000 to a new all-time high has rekindled attention on on-chain metrics used to monitor the asset. One of these metrics, called the Satoshimeter, helps gauge Bitcoin’s price movements and positions. According to the analysis, the Satoshimeter indicates Bitcoin is far from levels observed during previous bull markets, with the flagship cryptocurrency’s rally in its mid-cycle or intermediate phase rather than the final leg of its cycle. The Satoshimeter is sitting well below upper extremes, suggesting that the price is not overheated. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a modest recovery during the ongoing session, with the price up almost 2%. The flagship cryptocurrency experienced a substantial decline on Friday, falling to $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as price action remained bearish. As a result, BTC fell to a low of $112,104 before settling at $112,601. The current session sees BTC trading around $114,386. Maelstrom Fund CIO Arthur Hayes has warned that growing macroeconomic pressures could drive BTC to $100,000. He added that he had already taken profits in anticipation of such a decline. Hayes blamed the pullback on renewed tariff fears, a disappointing non-farms payrolls report, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Hayes' comments echo broader marketwide fears of macro headwinds that could stall bullish momentum. BTC is down nearly 8% from its all-time high of $123,091, set on July 28. BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday, falling to an intraday low of $114,779 as it entered the previous weekend in the red. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $117,000 and settle at $117,565, ultimately registering a 0.69% drop. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.24% on Saturday and 1.31% on Sunday to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,398. The price was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.11% to $118,069. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $117,925. Source: TradingView BTC fell to an intraday low of $115,772 on Wednesday before rebounding to reclaim $117,788, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price dropped 1.69% to $115,800. Selling pressure intensified as BTC fell over 2%, dropping below $114,000 and settling at $113,365. Price action remained bearish on Saturday as BTC fell 0.67% to $112,601. However, BTC has recovered during the ongoing session, with the price up 1.48%, trading around $114,267.

From corporate finance and worldwide supply chains to workers and online commerce, countless individuals rely on daily cross-border payments, which is where stablecoins have stepped up. How Stablecoins Are Changing The Global Payments System Stablecoins are digital assets created and stored on the blockchain, designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, most commonly fiat currency, such as the US dollar or the Euro. Due to the implied resilience from this fact, they offer greater price stability than other cryptocurrencies, making them a good entry point into the crypto universe for more risk-averse individuals or institutions. These assets have been gaining significant traction across Web2 and Web3, and their increasing usage is further bolstered by their ability to enable more efficient cross-border payments, offer near-instant settlements, reduce costs, and be available 24/7. Stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and RLUSD, as well as region-specific tokens, are being integrated into wallets and payments platforms worldwide, particularly in areas where the local currency experiences greater volatility. Ripple’s New Value Report for 2025: Stablecoin Trends in Business and Beyond found that finance leaders worldwide are suggesting that stablecoins will primarily be used in international, consumer-to-business, and vendor-to-supplier payments. Some Popular Stablecoins For Business Payouts In 2025 Fiat-pegged assets can differ in various ways, including market availability, liquidity, supported blockchains, and more, so businesses and individuals should carefully consider how they can best serve the use case they are looking for. Here are some examples of stablecoin and cross-border payment providers reshaping the landscape of how payments are made around the world: Tether (USDT) – most widely used and largest by market cap ($163B+ at print time, as per data from CoinMarketCap) – popular in emerging markets where access to USD is limited – integrated into most major crypto exchanges and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms Circle (USDC) – insured by cash-equivalent reserves – compliant and partnered with goliaths such as Visa, Stripe, and more – widespread use for business-to-business (B2B) payments Ripple (RLUSD) – backed by a segregated reserve of cash and cash equivalents – supports third-party payments globally, emerging markets included – integrated into a licensed cross-border payments solution – Ripple Payments Traditional Finance and Stablecoins A growing number of traditional finance (TradFi) transnational payment providers have begun incorporating stablecoins into their operations to provide more options for their customers and improve their internal treasury payments. Visa has been settling transactions in stablecoins since 2023, and to date, over $225 million has been processed through this method. Moreover, they have facilitated nearly $100B in purchases of cryptocurrencies and over $25 billion in such spending. Mastercard very recently announced an end-to-end payments system using stablecoins, and WorldPay has plans to enable payouts in this asset class to global enterprises. Businesses are also exploring how these assets can enhance their cross-border capabilities. Sending a wire transfer across the globe via traditional methods typically takes 3-5 business days to settle, and it also incurs high fees. By turning to stablecoins, entities using them can take advantage of precisely tracking their funds, near-instant settlement times, and reduced reliance on intermediaries. At the same time, this is possible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The growth of this asset class has been quite notable, as it has exploded from around $130 billion at the start of last year to over $265 billion as of today, according to data from DefiLlama.

In his words: “We empirically observe polytheistic AI… rather than a single all-powerful model.” That wipes out the fantasy of one AGI turning the world into paperclips. What we have is a balance of power between many human/AI combinations, not one dominant force. He says AI right now only works “middle-to-middle.” It doesn’t handle full jobs from start to finish. You still need people at both ends; one to prompt the AI and another to check what it outputs. So all the real costs and effort have shifted to the edges: prompting and verifying. That’s where companies are now spending their money, even though AI speeds up the center of the process. AI makes you smarter, but only if you are already smart Balaji doesn’t call it artificial intelligence. He calls it amplified intelligence. Because the AI isn’t acting on its own, it’s not fully agentic, it doesn’t set long-term goals, and it can’t verify its own output. “You have to spend a lot of effort on prompting, verifying, and system integrating,” he said. So, how useful AI is depends on how smart you are. If you give it bad instructions, it gives you bad results. He also says AI doesn’t replace you, it just helps you do more jobs. With it, you can fake your way into being a passable UI designer or game animator. But don’t expect expert quality. AI makes you good enough to be average, not excellent. For real quality, you still need specialists. There’s another job it does take, and that’s the job of the last version of itself. Midjourney pushed Stable Diffusion out of the workflow. GPT-4 took GPT-3’s spot. As Balaji puts it, “AI doesn’t take your job, it takes the job of the previous AI.” Once companies create a space for AI in a workflow, like image creation or code generation, that space stays filled. It just gets handed off to the newer, better model. He also says AI is better at visuals than text. Easier for humans to judge a picture than to verify a wall of code or paragraphs of text. “User interfaces and images can easily be verified by the human eye,” Balaji says. With text, it’s slower and more costly for people to check the accuracy. Crypto limits what AI can and can’t do Balaji draws a line between how AI works and how crypto works. AI is probabilistic; it guesses based on patterns. But crypto is deterministic; it runs on hard, provable math. So crypto becomes a boundary that AI can’t easily cross. AI might break captchas, but it can’t fake a blockchain balance. “AI makes everything fake, but crypto makes it real again,” he says. AI might solve simple equations, but cryptographic equations still block it. There’s also already a version of killer AI out there. It’s drones. “Every country is pursuing it,” Balaji says. It’s not image generators or chatbots that pose the threat, it’s autonomous weapons. That’s the area where AI’s real-world impact is already lethal. He argues that AI is decentralizing, not centralizing. Right now, there are tons of AI companies, not just one or two giants. Small teams with good tools can do a lot. And open-source models are improving fast. So even without massive budgets, small groups can build strong AI systems. That breaks up power instead of concentrating it. Balaji also rejects the idea that more AI is always better. He says the ideal amount is not zero, not 100%. “0% AI is slow, but 100% AI is slop.” Real value lives in between. Too little AI means you’re behind. Too much, and quality falls apart. He compares it to the Laffer Curve, a concept in economics that says there’s a sweet spot between extremes. In his final argument , he lays out why today’s systems are constrained AIs, not godlike machines. He breaks that into four kinds of limits: Economic: Every API call costs money. Using AI at scale isn’t free. Mathematical: AI can’t solve chaotic or cryptographic problems. Practical: You still need humans to prompt and verify results. AI can’t complete the full task alone. Physical: AI doesn’t gather real-world data on its own. It can’t sense its environment or interpret it like people do. He ends by saying these limits might be removed later. It’s possible that future researchers can merge System 1 thinking (fast and intuitive, like AI) with System 2 thinking, which is more logical and careful, like traditional computing. But right now, that’s just theory. It’s still an open problem. There is no all-knowing AI. There are just tools (expensive, limited, competitive tools) that do what they’re told and need constant checking. Get seen where it counts.

Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction among retail and whale investors alike. The narrative around BTC being a safe haven is shifting, and market participants are now focusing on high-utility DeFi projects that offer real income opportunities, ecosystem innovation, and massive upside. While BTC inches sideways, MUTM continues climbing, capturing attention with one of the most structured and community-focused DeFi models in the market. Currently priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted 14,800+ holders and raised over $13.9 million, with 10% of Phase 6 tokens already sold from the total 170 million allocation. With a 15% price jump imminent as the token moves to $0.040 in Phase 7, momentum is building, and investors are positioning themselves early to capture the expected 20x+ returns from listing and beyond. Audited Confidence and a Utility-Driven Ecosystem In a market full of copycat projects and unaudited protocols, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its professional approach to security and long-term sustainability. A rigorous smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the industry’s most trusted cybersecurity firms, awarded the protocol a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 78.00, signaling strong fundamentals, reliable code, and a developer team focused on transparency. But security is just the beginning. The real catalyst for MUTM’s success lies in its multi-layered ecosystem, anchored by an upcoming fully decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized tokens that are exposed to regulatory crackdowns and opaque backing, the stablecoin planned by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be algorithmically governed and pegged at $1 through a burn-and-mint mechanism that activates during borrowing and repayment within the lending module. Built on a Layer-2 network, this system will offer scalability and low gas fees, ensuring broad access to retail users worldwide. The expected beta launch alongside the listing is set to include the core lending platform, mtToken staking contracts, and stablecoin architecture, positioning MUTM as an end-to-end DeFi protocol ready for mainstream adoption. Why Investors Expect a 20x Move Beyond the technology, it’s the protocol’s structure that makes the upside so appealing. Users who deposit assets into lending pools receive mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens that reflect their share in the pool. These mtTokens can be staked in designated smart contracts to earn passive MUTM rewards, which are distributed from revenue generated by the protocol and bought back from the open market. This buyback strategy ensures constant pressure on supply and provides direct value to token holders. As demand increases and protocol usage scales, the value of MUTM is expected to rise, especially when DeFi-native users shift from passive capital storage to active, yield-generating strategies. For example, a lender who deposits USDT into a P2C lending pool stands to earn 10.2% APY, all while retaining ownership of their capital and staying liquid. Borrowers, on the other hand, can access capital by locking blue-chip assets like ETH or BTC, with dynamic loan-to-value ratios preserving system solvency. And for risk-tolerant users, the platform also includes a P2P module, where loans are matched directly between users at negotiated rates and terms. Coupled with the rising probability of listings on tier-one exchanges like Binance, MEXC, and Coinbase, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly stepping into a spotlight few new DeFi protocols manage to secure this early. Listing visibility paired with a robust, functional ecosystem is a recipe for exponential growth—and seasoned investors are taking note. Early Investor Example The contrast between stagnant blue chips and agile, scalable DeFi innovators couldn’t be clearer. A holder who joined during Phase 1 at $0.01 has already seen 3.5x returns, while entry at Phase 6 still positions investors ahead of the curve, with the token set to debut at $0.06. Considering the roadmap, product delivery expectations, and staking incentives, a long-term value closer to $1 isn’t wishful thinking—it’s an outcome many are beginning to expect. With over 4 billion tokens in total supply, a $100K giveaway campaign rewarding ten winners with $10,000 in MUTM, and ongoing CertiK bug bounty programs driving platform reliability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is checking every box for what a successful DeFi launch should look like. For those watching Bitcoin (BTC) flatline, the window to reposition into a more dynamic opportunity is still open—but not for long. With Phase 6 nearing sellout and the next price hike just around the corner, smart investors are locking in their allocation now before the rest of the market catches on.

49472848,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76664,1754236803,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Shake Out Before the Breakout. Analyst Predicts When to Expect Reversal,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-shake-out-before-the-breakout-analyst-predicts-when-to-expect-reversal/,"In a recent post on X, crypto analyst papa posted a chart-based analysis of XRP, suggesting that the asset may currently be undergoing a final shakeout phase before a substantial price breakout. The post featured side-by-side weekly candlestick charts from 2017 and 2025, drawing a direct visual parallel between the two periods. According to the analyst’s chart, the current setup resembles XRP’s late 2017 consolidation phase, which directly preceded the cryptocurrency’s explosive rally to its all-time high in January 2018. The left panel of the image shows XRP’s price movement in 2017, where it experienced weeks of sideways action before breaking above $2.70. That move eventually led to a peak near $3.40. A red candlestick encircled in both the price and Relative Strength Index (RSI) panels suggests a key moment where bearish exhaustion occurred before the rapid price surge. The RSI values from that period hovered in the mid-50s range before rapidly escalating above 80, confirming strong bullish momentum. The right panel of the image reflects the current XRP price action on the weekly timeframe in 2025. As of the chart’s timestamp, XRP is priced at $2.77901, having pulled back slightly following recent gains. The RSI values are notably similar to those of 2017, currently sitting at 55.88 with the RSI moving average at 56.41. $XRP SHAKE OUT BEFORE THE BREAKOUT EXPECT A REVERSE NEAR THE AUgust FULL MOON pic.twitter.com/A2GlCMRC4d — papa (@mamagucci) August 3, 2025 Papa visually highlights the current candlestick and RSI behavior as mirroring that of the 2017 breakout setup. The prominent blue arrow drawn on the 2025 chart suggests an anticipated move to a price level well above $10 , echoing the historic trajectory from the earlier cycle. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Projection Centers on August Full Moon Timing In addition to the technical comparison, papa adds a timing component to the forecast. The post includes the caption, “$XRP SHAKE OUT BEFORE THE BREAKOUT. EXPECT A REVERSE NEAR THE August FULL MOON.” This implies the analyst anticipates the current dip to be temporary, predicting a reversal in price action aligning with the upcoming full moon slated for August 9th. While lunar cycles are not traditionally recognized as a standard technical indicator in mainstream financial analysis, they have found a niche among some cryptocurrency traders who correlate moon phases with market sentiment swings. Papa’s use of the phrase “shake out” suggests the current downturn is interpreted as a strategic move to remove weaker hands from the market before a larger rally. The chart visually reinforces this view by drawing attention to the RSI crossing below its moving average before rebounding sharply, as seen in the 2017 fractal. XRP Community Reaction and Calls for Catalysts In response to papa’s post, an X user identified as Peperlefredo commented , “It need a big NEWS to move.” This comment reflects a sentiment within the community that a substantial catalyst, potentially regulatory clarity or a major partnership announcement, may be necessary to trigger the magnitude of movement suggested by the chart. Although papa’s analysis relies heavily on historical fractal patterns and RSI behavior, other market occurrences, such as macroeconomic indicators, institutional activity, and l egal developments involving Ripple, may play a crucial role in whether the projected breakout materializes.

49472850,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76643,1754236849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Here’s How BlockDAG Attracted 4,500+ Developers Before Mainnet With EVM Support & Testnet Access",https://timestabloid.com/heres-how-blockdag-attracted-4500-developers-before-mainnet/,"While new Layer 1 networks often gather funding first and developers later, BlockDAG presents a different case. Backed by $360 million, with a user base of more than 2.5 million and its presale nearing completion, BlockDAG has already attracted more than 4,500 developers and has over 300 dApps currently in progress. This traction isn’t coincidental. With Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, an intuitive low-code contract builder, and live access to its testnet, BlockDAG provides the resources developers need now, not just after launch. Add to that developer grants, hackathons, and DeFi features in the pipeline, and it’s clear the network is being shaped as a development-first environment. Here’s why so many developers are committing to BlockDAG even before BDAG is publicly traded. EVM Support Makes Transition Seamless BlockDAG’s full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine means developers can deploy existing Solidity smart contracts with minimal or no changes. This makes transitioning to BlockDAG quick and frictionless. Tools like MetaMask, Remix, and Hardhat work immediately, allowing current DeFi and NFT projects to move to BlockDAG with ease. They also benefit from faster transactions and reduced fees compared to Ethereum. Rather than competing with Ethereum, BlockDAG enhances it by offering better performance with familiar development tools. This approach encourages adoption through familiarity and improved efficiency. Low-Code Tools Expand Access to Web2 Developers To involve a broader range of creators, BlockDAG provides a low-code smart contract builder. This tool uses a drag-and-drop system that simplifies smart contract creation and deployment, especially for those with little or no coding experience. With built-in templates for NFTs, governance, token launches, and staking, developers can quickly prototype and launch dApps. This accessibility encourages entrepreneurs and traditional Web2 developers to participate without needing to master blockchain coding. By making development easier, BlockDAG expands the developer base and accelerates dApp growth across the network. Live Testnet & Incentives Attract Early Builders BlockDAG’s active testnet lets developers deploy contracts, test transaction speed, and experiment with node operations. The system processes up to 10 blocks per second using a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model that balances performance and security. To motivate builders, BlockDAG has launched grants and hackathons, aiming to support 1,000 dApps by 2026. These programs give developers not only a testing ground but also funding and recognition. Thanks to its clear six-week launch roadmap, developers know when tools will become available and how to incorporate BDAG features like staking and DeFi from day one. Built-In Infrastructure Sets Up Projects for Success BlockDAG goes beyond contracts and wallets, it includes working infrastructure ready for real use: Cold Wallet compatibility for secure BDAG storage and seamless dApp interaction The X1 mobile mining app with over 2.5 million users bringing utility to the chain A Demo Trading Platform where users can buy BDAG or test selling Confirmed BDAG listings on over 20 exchanges after launch With these tools already in place, new dApps launching on BlockDAG will enter a live environment with users, liquidity, and utility, not just empty promises. Why Developers Are Confident in BlockDAG’s Future Although BlockDAG is still in presale, it already offers developers a full suite of tools, a live audience, and funding incentives. With 4,500+ builders already participating, the foundation is being laid before mainnet goes live. In a sector where many networks launch with inactive chains, BlockDAG’s strong developer-first approach could be its biggest advantage. For those building in Web3, the message is clear, BlockDAG is already moving, and so are the developers.

49473948,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-invest-in-2025-blockdag-chainlink-monero-and-tron-build-the-buzz/,1754236855,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,"Top Crypto to Invest in 2025: BlockDAG, Chainlink, Monero, and Tron Build the Buzz",https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-invest-in-2025-blockdag-chainlink-monero-and-tron-build-the-buzz/,"If you’re after the top crypto to invest in 2025, time is running short. Several major projects are closing their presales or preparing to roll out key upgrades. This is the moment where quick decisions could make a big difference. At the front of the pack is BlockDAG, where timing might be everything. Let’s look at four picks building momentum, starting with one project whose entry window shuts on August 11. BlockDAG (BDAG): Countdown Begins for $0.0016 Entry Before August 11 BlockDAG leads this list for one clear reason: a rare pricing opportunity tied to its 10 BTC Auction, which ends August 11. More than $360 million has already been raised, over 24.6 billion coins sold, and early backers have seen a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. Now in batch 29 with a listed price of $0.0276, BlockDAG (BDAG) is still offering a temporary access point at $0.0016. This freeze allows new buyers to grab a price even better than batch 1, but only for a short time. This is not a game of luck. The auction is weighted by how much you spend, so the more you buy, the bigger your shot at landing higher BTC rewards. Here’s how it works: Minimum entry is $100 before August 11 Rewards come from a shared 10 BTC prize pool Bigger buyers take larger shares This setup has made BlockDAG one of the top crypto projects of 2025 for anyone chasing timed rewards and strong features. It uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG model, runs a working Testnet, and includes mass-access tools like the X1 app. But none of that matters if the chance passes. Everything hinges on getting in before August 11. Chainlink (LINK): Practical Use, Underrated Entry Chainlink is still one of the most practical plays for anyone eyeing utility in crypto. As the leading oracle network, it connects off-chain data to blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain. This built-in demand supports how smart contracts function today. In 2025, Chainlink is expected to expand its role in real-world asset tokenization, especially as major institutions enter the space. LINK’s staking upgrade added new value for long-term holders who now earn passive returns. While Chainlink doesn’t offer the massive upside that early-stage projects might, it thrives on real usage. That makes it a dependable part of any lineup focused on long-term utility. For those skipping the hype and chasing traction, LINK stays relevant among the top crypto to invest in. Monero (XMR): Staying Power in a Surveillance Age Monero doesn’t chase the spotlight. It doesn’t need to. Privacy is its edge, and that edge grows sharper as surveillance expands. In a time when most blockchains are transparent, XMR stands out by offering anonymous transactions. This unique function drives steady demand, especially from users who value privacy over popularity. Heading into 2025, privacy coins are gaining attention again. As regulators weigh more tracking tools, Monero’s role becomes even more important. It’s been decentralized since day one and maintained active developer support. This is not a pump-and-dump. It’s a privacy-first option that offers portfolio stability. Monero earns its spot among the top cryptocurrencies to invest in through consistent demand, not short-term waves. Tron (TRX): Utility First, Always Moving Tron is one of the rare chains actually being used at scale. With cheap fees and fast transactions, it’s ideal for stablecoins like USDT and powers real-time payments across borders. Its consistent usage is what keeps it in the game even without loud headlines. TRX has carved out its lane by solving real problems for everyday users. As 2025 unfolds, Tron is set to grow its DeFi and gaming footprint. Cross-chain tools are being added, and developers are paying attention. This is not about chasing explosive growth. It’s about locking in consistent value. For those searching for the top crypto to invest in without huge risk, Tron stands out with its low entry point and steady expansion. What You Shouldn’t Miss Finding the top crypto to invest in 2025 means watching what others overlook and moving before time runs out. BlockDAG is closing its presale on August 11, still priced at $0.0016. That also marks the end of its 10 BTC Auction. Once the date passes, the price rises, and access to rewards disappears. Chainlink, Monero, and Tron are also worth tracking for different reasons. Each brings something real to the table. But only BlockDAG is running on a tight clock. This isn’t just another listing. It’s a time-sensitive entry into a growing project with one of the most talked-about launches of the year.

In a new post on the social media platform X, blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain spotted Hayes selling millions of dollars worth of Ethereum ( ETH ) as well as the memecoin Pepe ( PEPE ) and the stablecoin-focused project Ethena ( ENA ). “Arthur Hayes sold 2,373 ETH ($8.32 million), 7.76M ENA ($4.62 million) and 38.86 billion PEPE( $414,700)…” The crypto veteran says he’s selling his altcoins because he believes that Q3 will be a period of sluggish economic growth. Hayes believes monetary policies are not loose enough to stimulate the economy, especially with Trump’s tariffs on the horizon. According to Hayes, macroconditions are ripe to trigger significant retracements for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum. “Why? US Tariff bill coming due in 3Q … at least the market believes that after NFP (non-farm payroll) print. No major economy is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal GDP. So BTC tests $100,000, ETH tests $3,000.” Despite his short-term bearish stance on crypto, Hayes believes that the asset class is still in a strong uptrend Late last month, he unveiled his year-end price targets for Bitcoin and Ethereum. “My year-end targets: Bitcoin = $250,000. Ether = $10,000.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $113,197, while ETH is worth $3,420.

In an April forum post, he suggested the network could eventually replace its longtime workhorse, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), with RISC-V, a low-level, open-source instruction set architecture. The Allure of a New Foundation For those unfamiliar, the EVM is the execution engine powering every smart contract on Ethereum. It translates Solidity code into machine-level instructions and governs how contracts interact. It’s been the backbone of Ethereum since its inception. So when Buterin brought up the idea of swapping it out, it sent ripples through the community. His reasoning is rooted in long-term scalability: “The beam chain effort holds great promise for simplifying the consensus layer,” he wrote. “But for the execution layer to see similar gains, this kind of radical change may be the only viable path.” Buterin argued that a RISC-V-based virtual machine could drastically speed up zero-knowledge proof generation by up to 100 times. This could be a game-changer for zk-rollups, which are seen as Ethereum’s best shot at scaling securely. By removing the need to translate code twice, from Solidity to EVM, and then to zk-friendly formats, RISC-V could streamline proof generation and reduce computational costs. However, it’s one thing to float an idea, and it’s another to overhaul the very heart of the Ethereum ecosystem. Stuart Popejoy, co-founder and CEO of proof-of-work Layer 1 blockchain Kadena, was blunt about the scale of disruption: “There’s no future in which there’s a large short-term disruption because it couldn’t possibly happen fast,” he told CryptoPotato. “A ‘better’ system would have to run in parallel for years as well as accumulate the network effects the EVM has.” Popejoy, whose platform’s Chainweb EVM testnet recently went live , argues that replacing the EVM isn’t like switching out a database or upgrading a protocol. It’s like asking the internet to replace HTTP; theoretically possible but practically absurd. That doesn’t mean the idea lacks merit. According to blockchain researcher Blessing Onuogu, the proposal is “complex and ambitious” but could lead to a “more scalable and efficient Ethereum.” She believes RISC-V’s performance potential might allow for more sophisticated smart contracts, ones that currently strain the EVM’s stack-based architecture. The technical advantages of RISC-V aren’t in question. It’s open, customizable, and already used in projects like Nervos. It’s also friendly to parallel execution and zero-knowledge applications. “ZK-STARK and ZK-SNARK rollups could reduce proving times and costs,” noted pseudonymous developer Block.nm. “With register-based execution, it’s easier to write provable programs.” However, integrating RISC-V into Ethereum is not just a software upgrade. It’s a full ecosystem reboot. To start, smart contracts are immutable. You can’t just migrate them. As Popejoy explained, “Existing state is cryptographically tied to specific addresses on the EVM.” Rewriting contracts from scratch would be mandatory. So would re-auditing them. And herein lies a deeper challenge: the loss of a decade’s worth of security insights. “We’d reset 10 years of accumulated security knowledge to zero,” Popejoy warned. “We have learned a lot about the EVM; all of this would become irrelevant.” Compatibility concerns also extend to Ethereum’s L2s. Fraud proofs on Optimism and Arbitrum rely on L1 executing EVM bytecode to validate rollup transactions. Swap out the EVM, and you break that. “You’d have to build a full EVM interpreter in RISC-V,” Popejoy noted. “That defeats the purpose of making it cheaper and faster.” If that’s not feasible, then L2s may be forced to become sovereign chains, splintering the ecosystem and breaking composability. So What’s the Path Forward? Most experts agree: there is no clean break. The only realistic scenario, according to some, involves dual-VM support for at least a decade. New contracts could use the faster RISC-V architecture while legacy ones would continue running on the EVM. Over time, developers might migrate voluntarily if the benefits are clear and the tooling is robust. “Dual VM support would give developers flexibility,” Onuogu said. “It allows time to adapt and ensures continuity.” She emphasized the need for a gradual rollout, similar to how zk-rollups were introduced without disrupting existing apps. Meanwhile, L2 developers should already be preparing. Block.nm recommends investing in modular architectures today, abstracting proof systems, decoupling settlement layers, and experimenting with alternate compilers like LLVM IR and WebAssembly. “Don’t rely exclusively on Solidity,” they cautioned. But even with preparation, the migration won’t be easy. Ethereum is home to tens of thousands of apps, billions in value, and millions of users. Each has different dependencies. A new VM must somehow honor those relationships or risk fragmenting the community. And yet, the conversation around replacing the EVM reflects a larger truth: Ethereum must evolve. While the Dencun and Pectra upgrades addressed key bottlenecks, they only pushed scaling so far. The network’s base layer is still burdened by complexity, slow execution, and monolithic design. As Buterin and others have noted, long-term sustainability may demand simpler, cleaner architecture, especially with competitors like Solana, Sui, and modular rollup frameworks chipping away at Ethereum’s dominance. That’s why proposals like EIP-7983, which caps gas usage per transaction, are gaining momentum. They promise greater predictability, faster block propagation, and better support for zk execution, all while minimizing disruption. These incremental changes are a reflection of Ethereum’s emerging design ethos: simplify where possible, preserve where necessary. RISC-V is no silver bullet, though. And as Popejoy said, it may never replace the EVM. But it opens the door to experimentation. If Ethereum wants to remain the world’s leading programmable blockchain, it can’t rest on its legacy stack. “Ethereum’s evolution isn’t about replacing everything we’ve built,” Onuogu concluded. “It’s about building what comes next, carefully, openly, and with the whole ecosystem in mind.” That evolution may take 10 years or more, but it looks like it has already begun.

PEPE followed closely, with its market cap soaring to $5.3 billion. These two tokens reshaped the meme coin landscape with cultural heat and speculative momentum, driving investors to scan CoinMarketCap for the next big breakout. After the explosive rise of BONK and PEPE, all eyes are now on three new contenders, and leading the pack is none other than Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – The Next Meme King in Waiting Forget the noise. LILPEPE isn’t just riding the meme coin wave; it’s setting its own course. As of July 27, 2025, the token has already sold out Stage 7 of its presale, raising over $11.22 million, smashing expectations and timelines. With Stage 8 now live and priced at $0.0017, it’s already brought in more than $1.84 million, proving investor demand is far from cooling. Built on the Ethereum chain, LILPEPE delivers on what meme coin holders crave: community-driven energy, no transaction taxes, and zero tolerance for rug pulls. It promises green candles and full decentralization, wrapped in a meme that’s both nostalgic and now. The project doesn’t just stop at hype. CoinMarketCap has officially listed LILPEPE, and the team is prepping for two major centralized exchange (CEX) listings after the presale ends. They’re also working behind the scenes on a debut on the largest exchange in crypto, setting up the stage for a major post-launch surge. Unlike most meme coins that launch and fizzle, LILPEPE is embracing a long-view narrative. Its “pregnancy stage” theme has captivated crypto communities. The project’s creative angle, “Cooking in the cryptowomb with Mumma Pepe,” has delivered major community traction, sparking endless memes and boosting engagement across socials. With over 150,000 entries in its $777,000 giveaway, LILPEPE is tapping into the virality few projects ever achieve. The giveaway promises $77,000 in tokens to 10 lucky winners, and with that kind of buzz, it’s not just the prizes that attract attention. It’s the sentiment: LILPEPE is for the people. The sense of ownership, fun, and meme-driven culture gives this token something BONK and PEPE had in their early days: an organic movement. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) – From NFT Darling to Meme Coin Muscle PENGU trades at $0.04276, with a 24-hour volume of $1.14 billion, a clear indicator of liquidity and market conviction. A major catalyst is the Canary PENGU ETF, recently filed with the SEC. This bold move to create a crypto-NFT hybrid fund has ignited a 64% price spike in early July and attracted large-scale investors. Open interest has climbed to $591 million, further validating trader appetite. Rallying from $0.0078 to $0.033 recently, over 300% gains, PENGU is catching up quickly with meme coin heavyweights. With new community activations and institutional whispers, it’s pushing for a solid seat next to BONK, PEPE, and now LILPEPE. Floki (FLOKI) – The Long-Term Builder Breaking Out FLOKI isn’t new, but its momentum in 2025 is making it feel like a fresh contender again. As of July 27, FLOKI is priced at $0.00013, backed by a $1.22 billion market cap and $70.95 million in daily volume. What’s turning heads now is its technical setup. The token just broke above its 200-day EMA, the first time in six months, backed by an RSI of 62.34 and a bullish MACD crossover. These indicators point to continued upward pressure without signs of fatigue. Analysts are eyeing the $0.00019 to $0.00028 range as the next resistance zone. The token has gained 8.15% in a single day, fueled by expanding use cases and a loyal community base that’s stayed active through multiple market cycles. FLOKI is proving that patience and consistency can still pay off in meme coin land. Final Thought Meme coins thrive on narrative, attention, and timing, and right now, LILPEPE checks every box. With BONK and PEPE blazing the trail, the spotlight now turns to the next crop of meme assets. Among them, Little Pepe isn’t just following the hype; it’s creating it. Whether it’s for the memes, the community, or the potential upside, LILPEPE is where momentum is building the fastest. As the post-BONK and post-PEPE meme market enters a new phase, Little Pepe might just be the next name everyone’s shouting across social feeds, Telegram threads, and trading desks.

With BONK’s market cap at around $2.06 billion and PUMP trailing closely at $966.55 million, the battle to be Solana’s top meme coin or launchpad is heating up fast. Meanwhile, under the radar of meme hype, a DeFi-focused presale called Remittix (RTX) is building up steam. BONK Coin vs PUMP Token: Who’s Leading on Solana? BONK Coin is sitting at around $0.00002549 with a huge community and meme-first marketing. It exploded in popularity thanks to airdrops and its early position as Solana’s resident meme mascot. Yet volume has been slower as of late, and some investors are beginning to ask whether BONK can be more than community-driven hype. PUMP Token, on the other hand, is attempting more of a utility play — even though it’s still within meme space. PUMP powers Pump.fun, a Solana-based meme coin launchpad that enables anyone to churn out a token in seconds. Trading around $0.002730, the project has risen rapidly in market cap and recognition. Its utility is accessibility: low-barrier token launches, instant liquidity, and viral launches. In the fight to dominate Solana meme culture: BONK has early mover and brand advantage PUMP has utility, creator tools, and a growing ecosystem BONK’s trading volume is slowing down PUMP’s token churn rate is high but infra play gives it long-term promise It’s no longer a meme fight. It’s infra vs identity — and PUMP is starting to build more than BONK. Remittix: Building Real-World Use Case Beyond Meme Hype While meme tokens are dominating X threads and influencer shoutouts, Remittix is going for the more ambitious route — making a crypto wallet with real-world use case a reality. Remittix beta wallet is scheduled for Q3 2025 and will have Solana and Ethereum compatibility with integrated cross-chain remittance features. At $0.0895 per token , with over $18 million raised and 579 million tokens sold, Remittix is rapidly advancing towards its presale soft cap. Unlike meme coins, RTX is focusing on cross-border usability by allowing crypto users to send money directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries with real-time FX conversion and acceptance of 40+ tokens. Throw in the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway, a 50% token bonus, and early wallet access — and the project is gaining traction in the “next 100x crypto” conversations. Why Remittix Deserves Consideration Beta Wallet Launch Q3 2025 Solana, Ethereum, 40+ tokens supported $18Million+ Raised, 579Milion+ Tokens Sold 50% Bonus + $250,000 Giveaway Live Actual Crypto Utility — Not Hype BONK and PUMP can battle it out in meme territory, but Remittix is building something solid — making crypto spendable, useful, and borderless. For those investors looking for more than virality, this could be one of the best crypto presales of 2025.

Here’s the Truth,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/new-fud-spreading-has-china-really-banned-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-again-heres-the-truth/,"In recent hours, some social media accounts have begun spreading false rumors that China has banned cryptocurrencies again. However, these claims are not based on official sources and contradict existing regulations. Here are four important facts about China's cryptocurrency policies: Hong Kong is welcoming the cryptocurrency sector: Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, has embraced cryptocurrencies as a pilot region. Local regulators continue to license crypto exchanges. Individual transactions are not prohibited: Individuals are not prohibited from buying or selling cryptocurrencies in China. Only financial institutions and companies are prohibited from offering cryptocurrency services. Personal cryptocurrency ownership is legal. Bitcoin mining continues: Bitcoin mining is still a viable option in some parts of China due to affordable energy costs. Despite the 2021 bans, many miners continued their operations underground. Stablecoin and RWA interest growing: Chinese authorities have begun to show interest in stablecoins and projects that tokenize real-world assets (RWA). Related News: Japanese Tech Giant Announces Plan to Purchase Large Amount of Bitcoin China hasn't officially announced any new regulations regarding cryptocurrencies recently. The country's crypto ban dates back to 2021.

What matters more is utility, timing, and steady progress. HBAR and XLM are gaining from fresh listings and growing attention. XRP is trying to recover after insider actions shook the price. But Cold Wallet is the only one that gives users live rewards with each action on-chain. Cold Wallet doesn’t wait for launch. It’s already working. Every time you use it, you get rewards in CWT. That kind of cashback feature in real time makes it different from everything else out there. If you’re looking for the top crypto coin to buy today, all four options bring something to the table, but only one gives value back as you use it. 1. Cold Wallet: Real-Time Rewards in Action Cold Wallet is changing how people see utility. It gives you rewards for every swap, transfer, or bridge. You don’t need to stake or lock up funds. Just use the wallet and get CWT tokens back. If you hold more CWT, your cashback rises, up to 100% on gas fees. The product is already live, making it one of the few coins offering real value from the start. The presale price starts at $0.00942 and goes up over 150 stages to reach $0.35171. This setup gives early users the most room for gains. Analysts see a $2 launch price if the reward model and user growth continue. What makes it stand out is that 40% of the total token supply is for public sale, and 25% is set aside for rewards. That helps the actual users, not just early insiders. There’s also a working referral system giving 10% to sharers and 5% to new users, with rewards vesting in just 3 months. If you’re searching for the top crypto coin to buy, Cold Wallet offers all the key points. It’s live, useful, and it rewards users directly. While the others on this list depend on market trends or news, Cold Wallet gives value every time it’s used. That makes it a clear standout choice. 2. XRP: Price Climbs After Major Sell-Off XRP dropped sharply on July 25 after a Ripple co-founder reportedly moved $140 million worth of XRP to exchanges, pulling the price down to $3.14. By July 28, it had recovered to $3.31, gaining about 2% daily. Trading volume rose to $475 million, and its market cap held steady around $193 billion. The market seems to have absorbed the large sale, but future insider activity could still affect momentum. The current price range between $3.10 and $3.15 appears stable. If there are no further large transfers, XRP might slowly move higher. While no new updates are driving its growth right now, it remains one of the best-known coins. For those focusing on large-cap projects showing signs of recovery, XRP could be a top crypto coin to buy if it holds its support and avoids more internal selling. 3. HBAR: Volume Spikes After Robinhood Listing HBAR made a strong move this week, jumping from $0.2389 to $0.288 after being listed on Robinhood. That 20% gain pushed trading volume to over $900 million and raised Hedera’s market cap to about $12.2 billion. The listing brought extra attention to the project, and the price is now just below $0.29. Analysts are watching closely to see if it can push past the $0.30 mark. Support appears near $0.22, and momentum is building toward higher levels. If trading volume holds and new users continue arriving via Robinhood, HBAR might find a new base above $0.30. This kind of move, backed by a clear even,t doesn’t happen often. That makes HBAR a top crypto coin to buy right now, especially if the current attention lasts longer. 4. XLM: Fast Surge with Caution Signs XLM gained quickly between July 25 and July 28, rising over 21% to hit $0.436 after open interest jumped 127% to $346 million. This kind of strong push often brings in fast traders and early sellers. Price is now just below resistance at $0.439, and a possible trading range is forming between $0.412 and $0.439. If support fails, it could drop to $0.355. The surge was driven by a mix of short liquidations and high buying volume. This creates a setup that can reverse quickly if momentum fades. Technical targets suggest it could move up to $0.50–$0.55, but warning signs like RSI divergence and high long exposure add risk. For those with solid trade setups and exit strategies, XLM could be a top crypto coin to buy for short-term trades. It’s not ideal for those expecting calm movement. Final Say XRP is steadying, HBAR is gaining from new listings, and XLM is in a rapid upswing. But Cold Wallet is doing something different. It offers real value now, rewarding users directly on every wallet interaction. With a presale price of $0.00942 rising to $0.35171 and launch estimates near $2, it stands apart from speculation. If your goal is to find the top crypto coin to buy , Cold Wallet deserves attention. It blends real-world use with an early-stage opportunity. Its reward system is active, referrals are live, and growth is driven by product use. While other coins are waiting on outside changes, Cold Wallet is already in motion.

This price decline seems to be worsening, as the premier cryptocurrency now sits beneath the $113,000 level following United States President Donald Trump’s recent nuclear threat. This recent movement has sparked market-wide conversations about the possibility of Bitcoin already reaching the price top in the current cycle. However, the consensus seems to be that the price of BTC still has the potential to embark on at least another leg up before finally reaching its cycle peak. BTC Could Revisit Former Highs In Near Term: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha built a bullish case for the price of Bitcoin following recent shifts in the Bitcoin market and the broader macro dynamics. In the BTC market context, the crypto pundit highlighted the changes in the coin’s spot volume on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst Data from CryptoQuant shows that Binance registered over $7.6 billion daily BTC spot volume, marking one of the most significant increases in recent weeks. However, this notable spike in trading activity coincided with a dip in Bitcoin’s price from above $118,000 to around $113,000, signaling increased volatility and trader repositioning. Taha noted that, from a historical perspective, spot volume spikes of this magnitude—like the $7 billion surge seen on June 22—have often been correlated with local bottoms or major price reversals. Hence, the latest jump in the Bitcoin spot volume could represent renewed investor demand and be ultimately bullish for the market leader. In the macroeconomic context, Taha highlighted that the US Federal Reserve’s net liquidity also witnessed a significant increase on Friday, jumping from $6 trillion to $6.17 trillion. For more context, net liquidity is typically considered a significant macro driver for risk assets like Bitcoin. As such, a net liquidity spike implies more fiat money is circulating in the financial system, which can flow into equities, cryptocurrencies, and other risk-on assets. Hence, increases in the Fed’s net liquidity have historically coincided with bullish shifts across markets, as seen during late 2023 and early 2024. Ultimately, Taha concluded that the combination of the rise in Bitcoin spot volume on Binance and the Fed’s net liquidity could set the stage for bullish continuation for the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $112,600, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

Here’s What It Means for Price,https://timestabloid.com/no-liquidity-walls-left-above-5-on-xrp-heres-what-it-means-for-price/,"Crypto analyst StephIsCrypto has presented a significant liquidity heatmap that suggests XRP may be poised for accelerated movement in the near term. According to a tweet posted alongside a heatmap visualization sourced from Coinglass, the analyst stated, “NO LIQUIDITY WALLS LEFT ABOVE $5 ON XRP. WHEN MOMENTUM RETURNS — IT’S STRAIGHT AIR.” The chart displays a liquidation leverage and liquidity zone analysis over time, with volume and bid/ask liquidity clusters color-coded between May and August. Areas with heavier liquidity are shown in bright green and yellow tones, while low-activity regions are represented in deeper purple. The image indicates that from the $3.20 to $5.00 range, visible liquidity becomes increasingly sparse, and nearly nonexistent above $5. The absence of significant liquidity above the $5 level suggests that once that price point is breached, the asset may face minimal resistance and could potentially move quickly to higher price targets . These liquidity zones often represent the levels at which market participants have placed large orders, which can act as barriers to price movement. When such barriers are absent, prices can accelerate with little friction. BREAKING: NO LIQUIDITY WALLS LEFT ABOVE $5 ON #XRP . WHEN MOMENTUM RETURNS — IT'S STRAIGHT AIR. pic.twitter.com/O8ucaIK92m — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 3, 2025 Market Participants Watch for Signs of Breakout In response to the post, other market participants and traders weighed in. A user named Abhaya commented , “I’m watching this too. no walls means once it breaks, it could move super fast. feels like a setup for a big breakout, but gotta be ready for the ride.” This perspective echoes the broader interpretation of StephIsCrypto’s analysis. It reinforces that traders may monitor this zone closely for potential volatility and upward extension. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Focus on $2.80–$3.65 Zone as XRP Key Levels for Momentum Another user, Edward, provided a more detailed breakdown of the market dynamics he believes are in play. He pointed out the significance of current price behavior, saying , “If we’re seeing consolidation around $2.80s with time cycles aligning for a bounce and liquidity gaps overhead, this could be the re-accumulation zone before a powerful next wave. Just need volume.” His reference to “time cycles” suggests that price compression and timing factors may be aligning to support a directional move. Edward further elaborated on what he characterized as “Whale Psychology,” stating, “We control the board. If there’s no resistance above $5, let’s shake the tree one more time, then blow it through $5 to collect max liquidation fuel and exit into $6.50+.” He identified $3.20 as a key level to reclaim and $3.65 as a target to retest in order to validate the potential move. These levels are presumably areas of former support and resistance, which could serve as signals for ignition momentum if broken to the upside. Heatmap Visualization Emphasizes Liquidity Gap The heatmap, generated via Coinglass and shared by StephIsCrypto, provides a clear visual representation of the liquidity structure over the past three months. It shows that the heaviest concentrations of liquidity activity occurred in the range between $1.50 and $3.00. After XRP surpassed that range in mid-July, it encountered comparatively little resistance in moving higher. As of the latest data, liquidity thins out above the $4.50 mark, with a near-total absence of resistance above $5.00. This technical condition is increasingly being interpreted by market watchers as a potential setup for rapid upward price movement, particularly if volume returns and supports a trend continuation.

Market watchers are now closely tracking the best-performing cryptos in 2025 to determine where the strongest upside might come from. While big names like Solana, Chainlink, and BNB remain important players, another rising contender is sparking wider interest: BlockDAG. With an already completed testnet, real user growth, and fast-paced presale, BlockDAG appears to be advancing toward serious market relevance. This guide breaks down what makes these best-performing cryptos in 2025 worth your attention. BlockDAG (BDAG) Rapid attention is turning toward BlockDAG (BDAG) as it builds momentum through real metrics. With over $359 million collected during its presale and 24.6 billion BDAG coins already distributed, the project is making headlines. Its token is priced at $0.0016 through batch 29 and will be available at this rate until August 11. With a future listing price fixed at $0.05, BlockDAG presents a 3,025% potential gain. Early backers have already witnessed a 2,660% boost in their holdings since batch 1. What’s already been developed strengthens BlockDAG’s credibility. Over 2 million users have started mining via the X1 mobile app, and 18,000+ X10 mining units have been shipped. Additionally, the builder base has crossed 4,500 developers working across 300+ decentralized apps. The release of the NO VESTING PASS means all purchased coins will be fully unlocked at launch, providing buyers with instant access. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH announcement already confirmed for August 11, BlockDAG is becoming one of the best-performing cryptos in 2025 for those watching real growth paired with early entry pricing. Solana (SOL) Solana remains a major figure in the crypto scene, though recent price activity has suggested short-term pressure. SOL has seen around a 3% daily dip and a 6% drop over the past week, sitting in the $180 to $181 range. Shorts now total over $1.2 billion, indicating broader caution. Yet some technical traders still expect a potential breakout toward all-time highs within the next 50 days if momentum improves. Long-term strength for Solana lies in its institutional interest. Hopes around a Solana ETF and staking partnerships continue to drive attention from larger players. Uncertainty from regulatory shifts and broader economic policy remains a factor, but the core of Solana’s appeal, its speed and network strength, still holds. Among the best-performing cryptos in 2025, Solana is leaning more toward a stable blue-chip status rather than a hidden gem. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink has kept its relevance through its unique position in bridging DeFi and traditional finance. Despite a near 11% drop in daily value, trading volumes remain healthy at around $620 million, and LINK sits in the $17.80 to $17.90 range. What’s interesting is that large wallets have acquired over 8 million LINK tokens this month, showing steady faith from whales. A highlight was Chainlink’s collaboration with J.P. Morgan using its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), showing strong corporate traction. Although the price movement has been flat, Chainlink keeps its title as Web3’s go-to oracle system. Compared to projects like BlockDAG, it offers steadiness but may lack the dramatic short-term returns. Still, its spot among the best-performing cryptos in 2025 remains justified by consistent demand and institutional support. Binance Coin (BNB) After touching an all-time high of $859, BNB has recently adjusted and now trades between $815 and $820. This 1.5% to 2.8% pullback is mainly attributed to traders securing gains. If BNB drops below $810, it could face a further slide toward $794 or even $761, according to market analysts. Despite this, BNB’s fundamentals are still intact. One noteworthy development is a Canadian vape firm’s plan to create a $1.25 billion publicly listed BNB treasury. This initiative shows BNB’s growing role in mainstream finance. While BNB remains firmly among the best-performing cryptos in 2025, its price moves might stay more gradual compared to the faster pace seen in newer tokens like BlockDAG. Final Say! Finding value in crypto during 2025 demands more than just brand loyalty. While coins like Solana, Chainlink, and BNB bring strength and recognition, they may deliver slower gains over the coming months. BlockDAG, however, stands apart with early entry pricing, working infrastructure, and no token lock-up, making it highly attractive to many participants. The presale has now raised $359 million with 24.6 billion coins sold. Those who joined in earlier stages have already seen their funds grow by 2,660%. With its $0.0016 presale open until August 11 and a fixed $0.05 listing ahead, the 3,025% profit window is gaining attention. Among the best-performing cryptos in 2025 , BlockDAG positions itself as one of the most actively watched entries for both present traction and future ROI.

49475182,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76646,1754240445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Best Crypto Projects Of 2025: BlockDAG, Solana, Chainlink, BNB Lead With Massive Gains & Market Buzz",https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-projects-of-2025-blockdag-solana-chainlink/,"As the crypto space heats up, people are watching the charts to find coins that can offer strong returns and real progress. Solana, Chainlink, BNB, and BlockDAG are currently among the top coins pulling the spotlight. But each one is on a different journey, with unique growth paths. BlockDAG, for example, has quickly gained momentum with its clear numbers: $360 million raised and 24.46 billion coins already sold. The price is currently locked at $0.0016 during its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a clear 3,025% ROI compared to its $0.05 launch price. That’s turning heads across the market. Solana continues to show potential with solid market traction. Chainlink is bridging traditional finance with DeFi, and BNB remains a heavyweight with steady adoption. These four coins are among the best crypto projects to watch right now. This guide explores why each one stands out and why many are paying close attention in this growing market. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): GLOBAL LAUNCH Price At $0.0016 Sparks Strong Market Buzz Out of the coins climbing the ranks in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) is clearly pulling attention. Backed by $360 million in funds raised and over 24.46 billion coins sold, it’s shaping up as a serious Layer 1 contender. What’s drawing attention isn’t just the size of support, it’s the offer. At a current rate of $0.0016 under its GLOBAL LAUNCH release and a confirmed listing price of $0.05, the project gives a real chance at a 3,025% ROI. Those who bought in Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% rise based on the latest Batch 29 price of $0.0276. What makes BlockDAG different is that it’s not just an idea, it’s already rolling. A working testnet is active. Over 2 million people are mining using the X1 app. 18,800+ X10 mining devices have been sold. Behind the scenes, more than 4,500 developers are building across 300+ decentralized apps. Another standout point is the NO VESTING PASS. Buyers receive 100% of their coins at launch. There are no delays or unlock periods. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release ending on August 11, buyers can still access the limited $0.0016 rate before it returns to the Batch 29 level. For those eyeing early-stage gains, BlockDAG is now ranked among the best crypto projects showing true utility and potential. 2. Solana (SOL): Short-Term Drop, Long-Term Watch Solana has held its place as a leader in the crypto market, though recent numbers show mixed results. Over the last 24 hours, SOL has dipped around 3%, and in the past week, it’s down roughly 6%, now trading near $180 to $181. Short positions worth over $1.2 billion are adding pressure, showing that bearish sentiment is on the rise. Still, chart watchers are keeping a close eye. A rounded-bottom pattern is forming, and some believe this could be a sign of a push toward a new all-time high, possibly within the next 50 days if momentum picks up. Big players are still interested. Talk of a Solana ETF and ongoing staking partnerships are keeping the flame alive. Even with macro shifts from the Fed and White House affecting near-term moves, long-term interest hasn’t disappeared. In comparison to other up-and-coming coins like BlockDAG, Solana is now seen more as a stable Layer 1 platform than a low-priced entry. Yet, its steady growth path keeps it on the list of the best crypto projects in circulation. 3. Chainlink (LINK): Stability Meets Institutional Growth Chainlink stays consistent in the rankings of top coins. Its current value floats between $17.80 and $17.90, with daily trade volume around $620 million. While the price fell roughly 11% in the last 24 hours, core strength remains. Whales have bought over 8 million LINK coins in the past month, showing belief in the project’s long-term role. What’s drawing more attention is Chainlink’s move to connect traditional finance with DeFi. A recent deal with J.P. Morgan highlights this shift. Through Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), they’re working on on-chain DvP settlements, a strong sign of trust from major players. Even though prices are moving sideways, Chainlink has secured its role as a top oracle system in Web3. However, for those focused on early growth and sharper upside, newer coins like BlockDAG are now offering more immediate gains. Still, Chainlink deserves its spot among the best crypto projects this year. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Minor Pullback After Strong Surge BNB saw a slight dip after reaching its all-time high of $859. It now trades between $815 and $820, a mild 1.5% to 2.8% pullback caused mostly by profit-taking. If the price dips below $810, analysts warn it could slide to $794 or even $761. Despite that, the fundamentals remain solid. BNB continues to compete for a top-five spot by market value. One of the more surprising stories this week came from Canada, where a vape firm announced a $1.25 billion PIPE to set up the largest publicly traded BNB treasury. This news strengthens BNB’s role in global finance and adds more use cases. While its price growth may now be slower compared to new entrants like BlockDAG, its standing in the crypto ecosystem stays firm. As always, it earns its place among the best crypto projects available today. Final Thoughts Choosing the right coins now takes more than just going with big names. Solana, Chainlink, and BNB all have staying power, but their short-term returns may be more gradual. On the other side, BlockDAG brings fresh energy with built-in ROI potential, tech development, and clear access points. It has already raised $360 million and sold 24.46 billion coins. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release offering a temporary $0.0016 price and a locked listing of $0.05, the 3,025% upside is straightforward. BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS also ensures full access at launch. In a field full of options, it now stands out as one of the best crypto projects worth considering for anyone tracking growth trends.

On Sunday, Stephen Miller, who serves as deputy chief of staff and is one of Trump’s top aides, told Fox News that President Trump made it “very clear” that India’s continued purchases of Russian oil are “not acceptable.” According to Reuters , Miller said, “People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil. That’s an astonishing fact.” His remarks are the sharpest criticism yet from this administration toward a country that Washington still considers a key player in the Indo-Pacific. India hasn’t responded publicly to the White House. The embassy in Washington stayed silent, and officials in New Delhi made it known they plan to continue buying Russian oil—regardless of what the U.S. says. The reaction comes just as Trump escalated things further by hitting India with tariffs. Tariffs hit India after oil and arms trade with Russia On Friday, the U.S. activated a 25% tariff on Indian goods. The penalty is tied to two things: India’s energy dealings with Russia and its purchase of Russian military gear. Trump didn’t stop there. He’s also threatening 100% tariffs on any country that keeps buying Russian oil unless Russia agrees to a “major peace deal” with Ukraine. Even with that pressure, Miller made a point of saying that Trump has a “tremendous” relationship with Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister. But there was no indication that this relationship would stop the White House from punishing India for funding Russia’s war effort. While Trump ramps up tariffs, Ukraine is stepping up its strikes. Over the weekend, Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces announced it hit a refinery in Ryazan, located about 180 kilometers from Moscow. The drone attack caused a fire on site. Ukrainian forces also hit an oil storage site in Russia’s Voronezh region. Ukraine launches strikes as India’s economy takes a hit Ukraine’s intelligence agency, the SBU, said it also targeted the Primorsko-Akhtarsk military airfield, which has been used to launch drone attacks against Ukraine. Ukrainian forces also struck a Russian electronics factory during the latest wave of attacks. These strikes came as the Trump administration turned its attention to economic pressure on Russia’s trade partners, starting with India. The U.S. tariffs are already shaking up India’s economy. Aditi Nayar, chief economist at Icra, said, “The tariff (and penalty) now proposed by the US is higher than what we had anticipated and is therefore likely to pose a headwind to India’s GDP growth.” Icra recently lowered India’s growth forecast from 6.5% to 6.2% for this financial year, citing the tariff increase. Nomura, another brokerage, agreed. They called the tariffs “growth negative” and warned that India’s GDP might drop by 0.2%. Investors reacted fast. On Friday, India’s stock markets closed down, ending the week in the red. The message from markets was clear. These penalties aren’t being ignored. Over the last few months, India and the U.S. have been trying to finalize a new trade agreement. As part of that, India dropped tariffs on American products like Bourbon whiskey and motorcycles. It wasn’t enough. Trump is focused on narrowing the $45 billion trade deficit the U.S. has with India, and these new penalties are his next move.

While retail enthusiasm has waxed and waned, mainstream media outlets have largely remained cautious in their coverage of cryptocurrencies. That changed in 2025, and has intensified recently, as a nationally syndicated article, originally published by The Motley Fool and distributed through USA Today’s investment section, identified XRP as the “smartest cryptocurrency to buy with $500 right now.” National Coverage for XRP Crypto investor and analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) took to X to emphasize the importance of this national recognition, stating, “The national media promoting #XRP!” This signals what many in the XRP community viewed as long-overdue validation from mainstream financial commentators. XRP has received mainstream recognition in 2025 , as its popularity grows due to its numerous advantages over Bitcoin and Ethereum. The article focused on the coin’s large market cap, long-standing presence, and institutional support. It made a straightforward case for XRP, explaining that it is unlikely to produce dramatic overnight gains, its value proposition as a fast and efficient payments solution gives it longevity in the broader crypto landscape.

49476802,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=778554,1754242133,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49476802.jpeg,"U.S. holds firm on Trump-era tariffs, signals no quick exemptions for allies",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-trade-chief-says-trumps-tariffs-will-stay/,"The US will remain firm on the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump last week, despite ongoing negotiations with the affected countries. Senior Administration Trade Representative Jamieso n Gr eer con firme d the position during a televised interview Sunday evening. He signaled a hardline approach that dampens hopes of swift exemptions for the United States’ allies and trade partners. Greer emphasized that the executive order behind the tariffs is part of a broader strategy and won’t be reversed quickly. The order imposed steep duties across the board — including 35% on imports from Canada, 50% on Brazil, 25% on India, and rates ranging from 20% to 39% on goods from Taiwan and Switzerland. Greer said on Face the Nation that the tariff rates were largely fixed, noting that some were tied to previously announced agreements while others were based on internal trade evaluations. He emphasized that, for the time being, the rates were not open to negotiation. His remarks follow backlash from American business leaders and foreign governments who argue the tariffs will lead to increased prices and will disrupt supply chains across the globe. However, the Trump administration appears to be intent on doing so anyway, framing the tariffs as part of a broader plan to protect American industry and cut down the state’s trade deficit. White House shifts from flexible tariff deals The White House was more flexible in the earlier rounds of trade talks this year. For example, while negotiating with the European Union, the administration agreed to cut tariffs in half on steel and agricultural imports from Europe in return for reductions in some of the proposed tariffs. Greer said that the current tariff height should not be perceived similarly. Greer said that the current situation was not akin to past talks, noting a formal European Union deal on the table. According to him, reasons like trade imbalances and national economic priorities led the US to start anew with tariffs. It is something that he acknowledged, the last team did, and rubbed it in, saying the previous approach would not work this time. Trade analysts said the current policy represents a more disciplined posture in Trump’s second term. The administration has been more deliberate in advancing “America First” economic strategies, designed to bring foreign governments to heel by offering concessions or enduring perpetual tariff escalation. Several of its trading partners, including Canada and India, have threatened to retaliate . However, Greer muted the possibility of a trade war on a worrying level, saying that the US is open to talks, not striving to give up its stance. US deepens engagement with China on rare earths While the tariffs remain locked in place for several countries, Greer expressed optimism about the direction of US-China trade relations—particularly in the critical area of rare earth materials. He said the United States had engaged positively with China and emphasized that the focus was on maintaining a steady flow of rare earth magnets and minerals from China. He noted that this supply chain was critical for the country’s technology and defense industries. Rare earth magnets are used in everything from smartphones to electric vehicles and missile systems. China controls over 80% of the global supply, making stable trade in this sector a high priority for Washington. Greer said they will be concerned that they are still halfway from returning things to the level of trade flow during pre-tension times. He added that both the US and China have agreed to have ongoing conversations. Trade watchers say it’s a shift in strategy to go after China. The United States has been less heavy-handed with Beijing than others. This month, it only had one set of across-the-board tariffs on commodities comparable to beef, against Ireland, the kind involved in a potentially lethal conflict.

At the forefront of this new limelight is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an explosively growing ERC-20 DeFi protocol that has emerged as a market darling amidst aggressive price projections of a potential 7,700% rally. Over 14,800 investors have already invested in the project, and over $13.9 million has been raised by Mutuum Finance so far. The project is already in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, a 16.67% increase from Presale Phase 5. Its next Phase 7 will also see an increase in price by 14.29% to $0.04. Now, investors can make a 71.43% return on investment when the token goes out at $0.06. While ETH gains strength with shifting macro sentiment and increased network usage, Mutuum Finance is sending shockwaves with its revolutionary lending platform and steady community expansion. Ethereum Targets $4,200 as DeFi Strength Picks Up Pace Ethereum is at about $3,860, sitting on top of the significant support at around $3,700–$3,750 following its powerful breakout from recent consolidation levels. Technical outlook is positive, analysts cite an increasing open interest, increased whale activity, and ETF inflows which could push ETH to the $4,000–$4,200 zone in the short-term if the momentum continues. Intermediate targets are as high as $5,000–$6,000, and even $7,000–$8,000 if institutional demand and staking forces continue to accelerate. That said, short-term resistance around $3,900–$4,000 and overbought RSI levels may prompt a brief consolidation before further upside unfolds. While ETH remains central to DeFi’s growth story, attention is increasingly shifting toward emerging utility-driven protocols like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale is Now Live Following the presale sellout of Phase 5, Mutuum Finance has now opened Phase 6 and the tokens are trading at $0.035, which is an increase of 16.17% from the previous round. The next price cap is at $0.04, a 14.29% increase. The initial investors of this particular one can reap a 71.43% profit when MUTM launches at $0.06. The presale itself has already topped over $13.9 million and onboarded over 14,700 individual investors thus far, testifying to the project’s burgeoning traction. Secured by CertiK and a $50K Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a USD-backed stablecoin on Ethereum. Aside from that, the project has a CertiK audit with a 95.0 trust score. Mutuum Finance also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. It will reward on a four-severity basis: critical, major, minor and low. $100,000 in MUTM Tokens Available Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will distribute a total of $10,000 MUTM among 10 winners in gratitude for the investor’s initial belief in the project. Ethereum (ETH) can only imagine getting to $4,200, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing even greater potential. With an expected 7,700% increase, this ERC-20 DeFi token is really picking up speed. Over $13.9 million has been funded so far. MUTM is now in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, which is a 16.67% price increase from the last round. Price will increase to $0.04 in the next phase, a 14.29% price increase. Get in quick now before prices go up again.

Instead of making big promises or using complex words, the company has released a simple but unusual campaign called “Everything Is Fine.” The ad uses dark humor to show the real money problems people are facing in the United Kingdom in 2025. A Creative Shift in Crypto Marketing As revealed in an X post, Coinbase’s new unusual campaign was released on July 31 and has quickly gained public attention for its originality. It was created in partnership with the creative agency Mother and directed by Steve Rogers. The campaign comes at a time when many people are more aware of the country’s economic problems. These scenes displayed in the commercial serve as clear signs of inflation, economic instability, and the fragile state of financial security in the UK. A Break from Traditional Crypto Advertising Unlike most crypto ads , “ Everything Is Fine” avoids talking about future riches or new technology. It does not use complex terms or offer promises. Instead, it uses humor and simple, everyday images to reflect what many people are going through. The ad connects with viewers by showing signs of declining living conditions and daily life becoming more expensive. These symbols match the feelings of many people who no longer trust official promises about the economy. One of the most direct scenes features a wealthy couple in a convertible, saying, “ We’re off to Dubai, it’s time to jump ship.” This moment reflects the increasing number of wealthy people leaving the UK. Data from Henley & Partners shows that 16,500 millionaires have moved out of the country so far in 2025. This is the highest number ever recorded and more than double the number from the previous year. Many have moved to places like Portugal and the UAE, where financial conditions are more favorable. Strong Reactions from the Crypto Community The ad received positive feedback from the crypto world. Peter McCormack, a well-known figure in the UK crypto space and a talk show host, praised the campaign. He called it “brilliant” and congratulated Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. McCormack, who is based in Bedford, UK, regularly speaks on the challenges facing the country. His support suggests that the ad captured the real concerns of many people. Coinbase has been known for publicly addressing economic challenges and advocating for fair crypto regulations , both in the United States and globally. In the past, the company has also warned that unclear regulations could push innovation out of countries like the U.S. and the UK. In response, it has expanded into more regulation-friendly markets, such as Ireland, the EU, and Singapore, where clearer crypto rules are being introduced.

The top performing crypto to buy now includes projects showing steady progress, smart expansions, and tokens tied to real-world use. From well-known names making system upgrades to newer platforms changing how rewards work, these five tokens are making a strong case in 2025. Leading this list is Cold Wallet, which is adding millions of users through a bold acquisition and offering daily use rewards on-chain. Here is why each token deserves a closer look. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT) Cold Wallet has moved beyond just being in progress. It now runs the biggest cashback setup in crypto. After buying Plus Wallet for $270 million, Cold Wallet added over 2 million active users to its platform. These users are now connected to a reward system that pays for gas, swaps, and fiat ramps using the CWT token. Instead of charging for use, Cold Wallet rewards users for activity. As wallet actions grow, so does CWT’s use, with higher cashback based on how much is held. CWT is not just an idea. It is already part of working cashback systems that are live. Now in presale stage 15 at $0.00942, Cold Wallet offers a mix of early entry and tested growth. People looking for the top performing crypto to buy are not only seeing a presale. They are seeing a full system built on rewards and growth as the Plus Wallet merge continues. 2. XRP (Ripple) XRP by Ripple continues to show strength because of its clear role in global payment systems. Even with legal challenges over recent years, XRP remains widely used by banks and financial services. Its quick processing and very low fees make it a strong option for international money transfers. As global rules become clearer, XRP may see more use from large financial firms, especially in areas where fintech is growing and fast payment tools are in demand. For those looking at the top performing crypto to buy, XRP shows the power of a token with a clear use case and steady legal progress that may open doors to more financial activity. 3. SEI SEI is quietly rising as a strong player in blockchain development. Built for trading-related tools, SEI supports fast speeds and low delay, making it a good choice for exchanges and finance apps. SEI stands out by doing one thing well. It is focused on speed and efficiency, not on being a general-use chain. With strong support and more builders using its system, SEI is gaining real-world use in DeFi and beyond. As more apps demand fast processing, SEI is becoming one of the top performing cryptos to buy for those who care about speed and performance. 4. Solana (SOL) Solana has bounced back from earlier network issues and continues to improve. It remains a top chain for developer activity, NFT use, and app growth. Its low fees and high speed make it a good fit for games, tools, and consumer apps. Well-known companies are now building on Solana, showing stronger trust in its future. For those watching Web3 growth, Solana offers solid design and proven scale, making it one of the top performing cryptos to buy with wide market potential. 5. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is building with focus and aims to solve a major issue in crypto. It wants to boost speed without losing decentralization or safety. Unlike many layer-1 systems, Kaspa uses a blockDAG model that allows blocks to be made at the same time. This gives faster results while keeping the strength of proof-of-work. Kaspa is still new compared to others on this list, but its strong tech and growing mining base are gaining interest. For those who want strong infrastructure picks, Kaspa is shaping up as a top performing crypto to buy with a long-term vision. Final Outlook on the Top Performing Crypto to Buy People moving past short-term trends are now focusing on tokens with working tools, growing use, and lasting plans. Cold Wallet leads this shift by linking token value to user activity through a working cashback model. XRP, SEI, Solana, and Kaspa each show strength in their fields, from payments to app speed and technical scale. In 2025, the top performing crypto to buy will be based on what already works and who is building for real growth. So far, the data, progress, and moves all point in one direction. Cold Wallet is leading the way.

49476420,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76650,1754242230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Top Altcoins to Buy Today With Massive Upside Potential: Cold Wallet, HYPE, SUI, & BNB!",https://timestabloid.com/top-altcoins-to-buy-today-with-massive-upside-potential-cold-wallet/,"Those searching for the top altcoins to buy today often go beyond just well-known names or temporary trends. The real focus should be on coins that offer actual usage or have rising momentum confirmed by real data. Some coins are close to breakout points, while others already function and reward users. In this market, choosing smart entries over hype can make a huge difference in returns. At the moment, Cold Wallet ($CWT) stands out thanks to its unique cashback-driven wallet model. Meanwhile, HYPE is steady after big volume surges, SUI is climbing on ETF-related buzz, and BNB keeps testing highs with solid chain activity. If you’re aiming for strong setups or future gains, these coins should be on your list. Below is a detailed look at four standout projects for anyone tracking the top altcoins to buy today. 1. Cold Wallet: Crypto Utility with Real Rewards Cold Wallet changes how crypto wallets are used by letting users earn instead of pay. Whether it’s token swaps, bridging to fiat, or sending assets, CWT holders get rewarded. The more CWT held, the higher the cashback, up to 100% on gas fees. It’s live, fully working, and has no staking or lockups. Just use it, and it pays back, something many projects promise but never achieve. The presale is now in stage 16, with the price at $0.00942, and the listing price set at $0.3517. Over $5.5 million has already been raised, and more than 658 million coins have been sold. Analysts expect the coin to hit $2 based on user activity, reward speed, and its limited supply. With 40% of the coins reserved for public sale and 25% for ongoing rewards, it’s geared toward regular users. Bonuses include 10% for referrers and 5% for those they invite. Vesting terms offer 10% at launch, with the rest released over three months. Cold Wallet stands apart for being active, rewarding, and functional. That’s what makes it the leading choice among the top altcoins to buy today. While others show promise, Cold Wallet is already delivering real benefits. If you’re scanning through top altcoins to buy today, this one brings together daily rewards and long-term growth potential in one place. 2. HYPE: Holding Ground After Surge Trading between $43 and $44, HYPE, Hyperliquid’s native coin, has cooled slightly from its July high of nearly $50. Over the past week, it saw a moderate drop of about 5–10%. Though broader crypto action has been on the upside, HYPE has maintained a stable consolidation phase. Its valuation is close to $14–$15 billion, with 334 million tokens currently in play from its 1 billion total supply. Activity has dipped compared to early July, which had big institutional volume driving prices up. Even with the slowdown, HYPE hasn’t lost its position. Analysts are keeping an eye on support levels around $42–$43 and watching for signs of renewed accumulation. There’s no breakout yet, but a major ecosystem update could quickly revive interest. For those pairing high-risk plays like SUI or PENGU with more grounded names, HYPE still stands out as one of the top altcoins to buy today. 3. SUI: Gaining on ETF Buzz and Volume Since July 24, SUI has risen from $3.72 to about $4.30, driven by optimism after a formal ETF review filing hit the SEC. That alone gave the coin a near 15% lift in just three days. Alongside the price, daily volume also jumped from roughly $63 million to $87 million by July 27. It’s hovering around the $4.25–$4.30 mark now. While the spike is real, its sustainability depends on further progress with the ETF case. Data from CoinCodex suggests that without new developments, SUI might revisit $3.20–$3.60. Still, as long as it holds the $4.00 level, its short-term structure is positive. Traders are watching the $4.50 line for confirmation of another leg upward. SUI reacts quickly to headlines, making it an appealing option for those following news-driven trades. The recent ETF optimism gives SUI a valid reason to be ranked among the top altcoins to buy today. 4. BNB: Strong Moves Backed by Institutions BNB started at around $770 on July 24, dropped slightly, but quickly surged to $785, then $793, and touched $825.40 by July 27. That marks a 7.2% weekly climb with volume staying strong above 16 million. Chart signals point to a bullish flag, with RSI nearing 68. If the momentum holds, price targets range from $950 to $1,060. Institutional support is also visible, with Nano Labs picking up over 100,000 BNB recently. What makes BNB consistent is its wide usage within the Binance network, from fee payments to trading and more. This demand cushion limits major dips compared to smaller coins. For those looking at steady gains or adding diversity beyond DeFi-focused assets, BNB remains a reliable option. While it may not spike 20x, it remains among the top altcoins to buy today due to its consistent performance and utility. To Sum Up! HYPE holds steady, SUI rides the ETF narrative, and BNB shows signs of institutional strength. But Cold Wallet is the only one giving live rewards at this moment. The presale rate is $0.00942, tied to an active product where users get paid for swaps, gas, and bridging. With a clear utility-driven model, limited supply, and future halving events, Cold Wallet clearly leads the pack. With experts predicting a $2 valuation after listing and growing user numbers, the upside from the current stage is hard to overlook. Others on this list bring headlines and trends, but Cold Wallet offers use, benefit, and a user-first design. For anyone focused on the top altcoins to buy today , Cold Wallet is the most practical place to begin. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Companies on both sides have moved from testing to full-scale deployment. According to data published by CNBC, Waymo, owned by Alphabet, says it now runs over 1,500 robotaxis across San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin, handling more than 250,000 paid rides every week. Tesla, meanwhile, has only just entered the space, launching in Austin. Across the Pacific, the competition is more intense. Barclays puts China’s current robotaxi count at around 2,000, with most operating in the country’s biggest cities. The bank predicts that by 2030, that number could jump to 300,000, covering about 5% of on-demand transportation in major urban areas. Chinese authorities have allowed companies to start charging fares, beginning with Beijing’s suburbs in late 2021. Shanghai followed in July 2025, giving another green light for autonomous paid rides. Pony AI runs robotaxis in four Chinese megacities Pony AI, a U.S.-listed Chinese tech firm, is currently the only robotaxi operator that’s approved to charge passengers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The company hasn’t shared how many robotaxis it operates, but claims each vehicle completes an average of 15 rides per day. In a note last week, Bank of America analysts wrote, “We believe this milestone [in Shanghai] demonstrates Pony’s technological and operational readiness in [the] robotaxi business.” The firm projected a rise in the company’s scale and earnings, with a stock price target of $21, implying a 60% gain from last Friday’s close. Tiancheng Lou, Chief Technology Officer at Pony, said during a late July interview that he’s focused on improving safety, cutting costs, and making robotaxis easier to hail. Tiancheng added that the company has already started testing its latest robotaxi vehicles in Beijing and has reduced the cost of hardware by 70%. Pony plans to report its earnings on August 12. Another Chinese player, WeRide, said last Thursday that its second-quarter robotaxi revenue hit a record $6.4 million. Morgan Stanley also rated the stock a buy, but warned it would stay volatile, depending on progress both in China and abroad. “We believe progress in global development of robotaxis will expedite the pace of China’s development/rollout of L4 AD/robotaxis,” the analysts said. They also said that older carmakers and politicians in top economies won’t want to lose out on autonomy again after falling behind China on electric vehicles. Chinese firms move faster overseas than U.S. players While Waymo is just getting started abroad with a launch in Japan, Chinese companies have already spread their operations. WeRide claims it’s the only company with permits for autonomous driving in Saudi Arabia, UAE, China, Singapore, France, and the U.S. The company also says it began pilot robotaxi service in Riyadh through a partnership with Uber. In mid-July, Baidu announced a deal to launch its Apollo Go robotaxis on Uber’s platform, with rollouts planned for Asia and the Middle East later in 2025. The U.S. and mainland China were left out of the agreement since Uber’s China business was bought by Didi. Bank of America said Apollo Go’s pricing on Uber will probably match human drivers’ fares. The bank added, “We think value in [the] overseas market could be multiple times higher than China, hence its profitability overseas could have much larger room.” The analysts gave Baidu a $100 price target, and the company is expected to report earnings on August 20. Barclays estimates that Baidu is already breaking even in Wuhan, excluding research and development costs. Most Chinese robotaxi players are close to reaching breakeven as well. The analysts explained that the ability to design and build cheaper robotaxis is the biggest reason why these companies could hit unit breakeven, excluding R&D and HQ costs, by late 2025. The cost differences are clear. Each Waymo vehicle reportedly costs about $200,000. Baidu’s Apollo RT6 comes in at around $37,000, while Pony’s newest model costs about $42,000, and WeRide’s is a little more than that. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Local council staff discovered the statue in several pieces of broken fragments, indicating vandalism rather than theft for economic gain. The statue was previously mounted in Parco Ciani and featured only limited anchoring at the feet, which remained intact on the pedestal. Art Collective Distributed BTC Reward Artist group Satoshigallery, behind the installation, had offered a 0.1 BTC reward—more than $11,000—for its recovery. Attempted to contact the group, but there was no response to date at the time of publication. “You can steal our symbol, but you will never be able to steal our souls,” Satoshigallery replied in an arrogant social media post, reaffirming their intention to install replicas of the statues in 21 cities across the world. Reactions from the Bitcoin Community Conceived by Italian artist Valentina Picozzi, the statue took nearly two years to be completed before finally being revealed in October 2024. It became a symbolic icon of the global Bitcoin revolution soon. The reaction to the act of vandalism was swift. Pointsville founder Gabor Gurbacs posted on Twitter: “Such a tasteless and stupid thing to do. Hope they find who did it.” Speculation Around the Incident Others, like pseudonymous Bitcoin fan Gritto, hypothesized that drunken Swiss National Day partiers could have been behind it. The robbery was concurrent with Switzerland’s birthday celebration. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced the return of the statue on social media with a heart emoji to signify how emotionally important the statue is to the crypto community.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|MINING|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-08-03 17:56:13

The TRON founder and crypto mogul, who currently serves as an adviser at HTX, boarded a Blue Origin rocket early Sunday morning and flew to space. The 7:42 a.m. launch took off from West Texas, sending Justin and five others on a short suborbital flight to the edge of Earth’s atmosphere. The 10-minute ride ended with a parachute landing just before 9 a.m., wrapping up what Blue Origin confirmed as its 14th human spaceflight. Justin originally secured the seat four years ago after placing the highest bid of $28 million during Blue Origin’s auction in 2021. That auction was set up to benefit Club for the Future, a space-focused charity backed by Jeff Bezos. Justin was supposed to ride on the first flight with Bezos himself that year, but had to delay. Bezos went. Justin waited. On Sunday, he finally launched. Six passengers reached edge of space on New Shepard capsule The NS-24 mission featured six people: Justin, Arvi Bahal (real estate investor), Gökhan Erdem (Turkish businessman), Deborah Martorell (meteorologist and journalist), Lionel Pitchford (teacher), and JD Russell (venture capital founder at Alpha Funds). The flight hit apogee by 8:47 a.m., and by 8:53 a.m., the capsule touched down safely. Blue Origin posted online, “Crew Capsule apogee confirmed,” and followed it with: “Welcome back, NS-24 crew.” The rocket used, New Shepard, is a reusable suborbital system. The capsule is fully autonomous and doesn’t require a pilot. It crosses the Kármán line—about 100 km above sea level—which scientists recognize as the boundary of space. The flight lasts about 11 minutes, during which passengers experience weightlessness and views of Earth from space. After the flight, Phil Joyce, Senior Vice President at Blue Origin, issued a statement. “It was an honor to see so many nations represented on our flight today,” he said. “The view of our fragile planet from space has a unifying effect on all who witness it.” Justin posted a video of himself on Instagram once he returned. “For this mission, I’ve waited for four years but we’ve finally delivered it,” he said. “I really appreciate Mr. Bezos and his team for making this possible. And thank you, Dad and Mom, for bringing me to Earth.” He added, “When I look at it from space, Earth is so small and that’s our home. We definitely need to do whatever we can to protect it.” Justin’s ticket tops rival prices, adds to list of crypto stunts Blue Origin doesn’t reveal the usual cost of a seat. But rival firm Virgin Galactic charges around $600,000 for its space tourism flights. That makes Justin’s bid, $28 million, more than 46 times the Virgin price tag. This wasn’t the first time Blue Origin flew public figures. In April, the same rocket carried Katy Perry, Lauren Sánchez, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn, Aisha Bowe, and Amanda Nguyen. That was the company’s 31st overall launch, but not all of them were crewed. Justin’s trip now joins his long list of headline moves. In November 2025, he bought a piece of viral internet art: a banana duct-taped to a wall. He explained the reason for the purchase on X. “This is not just an artwork; it represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes and the cryptocurrency community,” he wrote. “I believe this piece will inspire more thought and discussion in the future and will become a part of history.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Blue Origin|TRON,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-03 17:58:43
49477671,https://nulltx.com/?p=151714,1754244011,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"How Spartans Beats FanDuel and Betway With 5,963 Games in 2025",https://nulltx.com/how-spartans-beats-fanduel-and-betway-with-5963-games-in-2025/,"Why Experts Predict Spartans Will Surpass Betway & FanDuel: Data-backed Insights Unveiled As the competition intensifies in the 2025 betting space, platforms like FanDuel and Betway are leaning into regional media alliances and cultural campaigns to solidify their user base. FanDuel Sports Network has achieved a 25% boost in ad impressions through its streaming-first approach. Meanwhile, Betway has doubled down on South African cricket by extending a key sponsorship deal and supporting a player auction backed by R131 million. While these platforms emphasize attention and visibility, Spartans is focusing on sheer scale, providing 5,963 betting options, fast crypto withdrawals, and a sportsbook that includes every significant league. For those evaluating platforms based on depth and utility rather than marketing, Spartans is starting to set the pace. Spartans: 5,963 Games, Crypto Speed, and Complete Sportsbook Access Instead of banking on broadcasting deals or live events, Spartans is structured to meet the needs of bettors directly. The platform includes 5,963 games, a complete sportsbook interface, and instant withdrawals in digital currencies, offering everything modern players prioritize: flexibility, speed, and direct access. With Spartans, users can transact instantly through BTC, BNB, DAI, USDC, ETH, USDT, and ADA. There are no regional limitations or surprise ID checks. Whether betting on MMA events or engaging in roulette, the flow remains smooth and user-friendly. The welcome offer is a 300% bonus with clear terms: 35x wagering requirement, 7-day window, and specified withdrawal caps, ensuring transparency from the start. This level of openness remains uncommon among larger brands. Spartans’ sportsbook spans international leagues in soccer, basketball, MMA, and more, all accessible via a mobile-optimized interface that works without requiring an app. While others focus on aggressive marketing or brand recognition, Spartans is assembling a reliable, crypto-based system, many are calling the most dependable crypto betting platform available, streamlined, secure, and straightforward. FanDuel: Strong on Streaming, Limited by Location FanDuel’s strategy revolves around expanding its media influence. In 2025, it collaborated with Magnite’s SpringServe to enhance ad delivery, resulting in a 25% rise in ad reach across its 15 owned sports networks. With over 3,000 NBA, NHL, and MLB games streamed, it is slowly blending media and betting. Users can engage with live betting, explore fantasy teams, and purchase merchandise within one hub. Still, its primary edge, its content network, is closely tied to U.S. licenses. FanDuel’s crypto features are limited, withdrawal timelines are average, and bonus clarity shifts depending on the region. As betting leans toward unrestricted access and fast settlements, FanDuel’s regional media-centric model might fall short for those outside its primary coverage zones. The user interface is refined, but remains geographically bound. Betway: Energized by Local Presence, Hindered by Scaling Limits Betway’s focus this year is local strength. Renewing its collaboration with Switch Energy Drink for SA20 Season 4, Betway is intensifying its role in South Africa’s cricket scene. The 34-day event features big giveaways and stadium activations aimed at amplifying fan engagement. Its upcoming player auction on September 9 features a budget cap of R131 million (nearly $7 million USD), reinforcing Betway’s local branding strategy. This approach builds momentum from national pride and cultural involvement. However, Betway remains anchored to older betting structures. Its focus is on fiat transactions, region-specific rollouts, and variable promotions. Bonus terms are inconsistent, and withdrawal times differ widely. Though its on-ground visibility is high, it lacks global scalability or crypto-first features, two things increasingly demanded by newer users. Final Words! FanDuel’s extensive game streams and Betway’s regional sponsorships are focused on impact and audience pull. FanDuel’s 3,000-game broadcast strategy and Betway’s cricket investment aim for short-term dominance. But such efforts often lack lasting value. Spartans is built differently. Nearly 6,000 games, instant crypto features, and a borderless sportsbook show it’s built for continuous user benefit, not fleeting promotions. The 300% bonus is straightforward, not layered with hard-to-understand conditions. The real challenge in the sportsbook race lies in consistent delivery, not eye-catching campaigns. Spartans is leading in exactly that, functionality, fairness, and fast execution. This isn’t a long-shot contender; it’s already proving to be a platform with serious potential.

Whether you’re placing football wagers in the morning, catching NBA odds in the afternoon, or betting on late-night UFC, the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms are where flexibility and speed matter most. Today’s serious crypto users expect more than simple game coverage. They want fast payouts, instant wallet integration, and fluid switching between sports and bet types, all without leaving the platform. In this breakdown, we rank the top six sites that meet those demands in 2025. Spartans takes the lead with its streamlined, crypto-native system that keeps pace with every bet you make. 1. Spartans: Best Crypto Sportsbook for Seamless Multi-Sport Betting Spartans has emerged as the most reliable name among the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms, thanks to one major advantage: its focus on uninterrupted gameplay and lightning-fast transactions. Unlike traditional sportsbooks, Spartans uses a single-wallet structure that works across casino and sportsbook features without any need to transfer balances or use conversion tools. Supported coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, AVAX, and USDT, all processed with direct wallet compatibility. Players can instantly place wagers on events from multiple sports, football, UFC, tennis, basketball, and eSports, without system lag or fund transfer delays. In-play betting is fully optimized, and pre-match odds refresh automatically based on market shifts. Spartans also allows users to build cross-sport parlays quickly. Its live betslip calculates projected payouts in real time, and users can monitor stats and in-game changes right from the same interface. No additional apps, no clutter, and most importantly, no waiting for withdrawals. Every win can be cashed out instantly to the user’s wallet, regardless of bet size or sport. If you want a unified crypto platform where high-speed sports betting is combined with instant withdrawals and data-backed odds, Spartans is the frontrunner in 2025. 2. Stake.com: Reliable Markets, Moderate Payout Delays Stake.com continues to be a recognizable force in crypto betting. With expansive coverage across football, MMA, tennis, and digital events, it remains a strong option for variety. The interface is sleek and easy to use, and frequent promotions keep players engaged. That said, its position among the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms is affected by slower withdrawal times. Players dealing with higher-value wins often experience manual processing and payout delays. For crypto users who expect instant access to funds after a match or parlay, this creates a noticeable speed gap. Stake still delivers quality overall, but players seeking real-time payout precision may find faster alternatives. 3. Bet365: Unmatched Coverage, But Crypto Still Lags Bet365 offers arguably the widest selection of markets on the planet, from Champions League and NFL to less mainstream sports like table tennis or Gaelic football. It’s long been a trusted name in betting, and its platform remains user-friendly and detailed. But in 2025, speed is everything, and Bet365’s crypto integration hasn’t caught up. Though Bitcoin support exists in select regions, withdrawals often involve third-party processors or fiat conversion layers. That can slow down multi-sport cashouts and disrupt users moving between markets throughout the day. Bet365 still has massive value in terms of coverage, but it ranks lower on the list of top multi-sport crypto betting platforms due to its legacy infrastructure. 4. Betano: Good Selection, Slower Crypto Flow Betano is known for strong regional offerings, especially in Latin America and Europe. It covers football, basketball, and even niche local sports, making it appealing to diverse users. Live odds are generally responsive, and event streaming is well-integrated into the interface. But crypto users will notice a few speed bumps. Betano’s wallet structure relies on traditional payment back-ends, even when crypto is used for deposits. Withdrawals, especially larger ones, often pass through verification gates and delay what would otherwise be a smooth experience. Among the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms, Betano is solid in content but less optimized for crypto-native betting agility. 5. BC.Game: Crypto Flexibility, Clunky Navigation BC.Game offers a high degree of flexibility in accepted cryptocurrencies, well over 50 coins and tokens are supported. It’s community-oriented, with chatrooms and giveaways that make it feel more interactive than the average sportsbook. However, its sportsbook design is not as clean or intuitive when switching between multiple live events. While betting options span across sports, navigation during live events can be disorganized. Real-time data displays are limited, and the interface sometimes struggles to keep pace with fast in-play decisions. BC.Game is certainly a contender in crypto access, but to compete as one of the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms, it will need to upgrade both interface fluidity and event-switching mechanics. 6. BetMGM: Mainstream Strength, Crypto Shortcomings BetMGM is a powerhouse in the U.S. market, with strong coverage in NFL, NBA, and MLB, plus growing support for international events. Its mobile platform is among the best in traditional sports betting, and its brand reputation is solid. Crypto functionality, however, is still emerging. Most users will be prompted to convert crypto to fiat to withdraw, which introduces both time and fee overhead. For those who value speed across sports bets placed in quick succession, this isn’t ideal. BetMGM ranks among the more established names in this space, but among the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms, its current crypto limitations hold it back. Final Word: Speed and Integration Define the Winners The betting scene in 2025 isn’t just about game availability; it’s about delivering fast, flexible, and crypto-native performance across multiple sports in one unified environment. Spartans leads the field by combining instant payouts, seamless in-play betting, and reliable crypto wallet integration in a way that rivals just haven’t matched. Stake.com and Bet365 provide excellent market coverage but struggle with real-time withdrawals. Betano, BC.Game, and BetMGM bring some useful features but fall short on the integration needed for fluid multi-sport crypto betting. For those ready to level up their crypto sports experience, Spartans stands as the clearest and most complete choice among all top multi-sport crypto betting platforms in 2025.

This represented an 18% increase year-over-year but a decline of 13% quarter-over-quarter, for the crypto exchange Adjusted EBITDA, however, plunged by 7% during the same period and reached $79.7 million from $85.5 million. Seasonal Weakness Total exchange volume rose 19% year-over-year to $186.8 billion, though activity slowed quarter-over-quarter amid market turbulence tied to US tariffs and broader macroeconomic uncertainties. Kraken noted that Q2 is typically a seasonally weaker period for trading across the industry. The exchange’s funded accounts grew 37% from a year earlier to 4.4 million, while assets on the platform rose 47% year-over-year to $43.2 billion. Kraken also revealed expanding its market share in spot trading, which was supported by ongoing product improvements. In fact, the company saw strong momentum in stablecoin-related trading, as its share of stable-fiat spot volumes climbed from 43% to 68% over the quarter. Kraken has announced a series of product expansions targeting both retail and institutional users. In Europe, the company launched what it describes as the region’s largest MiFID-regulated crypto futures suite, including 24/7 FX perpetual futures for EUR, GBP, AUD, JPY, and CHF trading pairs on Kraken Pro. In the United States, the platform introduced a regulated derivatives offering to allow users to access CME-listed crypto futures through its integrated platform. For institutional clients, the company debuted Kraken Prime, a brokerage service that combined trade execution, custody, and liquidity. The crypto exchange also expanded its custody business by adding support for Solana (SOL), XRP, and reward-bearing USDG, to target high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients seeking secure asset storage and staking solutions. Co-Founder Cleared by DOJ Amid these operational milestones, the company saw a separate legal issue concerning its former CEO reach a conclusion. The US Department of Justice recently closed its investigation into Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell, which stemmed from allegations unrelated to crypto. The probe focused on a governance dispute involving Verge Center for the Arts, a nonprofit Powell founded. He was accused of hacking accounts and blocking access. The FBI raided Powell’s home in 2023 and seized devices that have now been returned. Prosecutors informed Powell’s team in April that no charges would be filed. The founder called the raid “devastating” and plans civil action against Verge’s board. The decision comes as Kraken eyes a potential IPO in 2026. Powell remains on the company’s board after stepping down as CEO.

The image, shared by crypto influencer XRP Avenger (@XRP_Avengers), shows XRP at the top of the leaderboard with a valuation surpassing Bitcoin. It lists XRP at $2.38 with a market cap of over $238 billion. However, that figure reflects its fully diluted valuation (FDV), not its true circulating market cap at the time. XRP Avenger called on the community to watch XRP, as he expects the asset to surpass Bitcoin’s market cap and not just its FDV this time. While some dismissed the table as a relic of crypto history, others believe XRP can achieve this feat and see the chart as a reminder of the digital asset’s potential to disrupt the current market structure. Here is #XRP back in 2018 This could happen again You have been warned, All eyes on $XRP .. pic.twitter.com/PM3cLE1Di4 — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) August 3, 2025 Bitcoin remained dominant in 2018 and has remained the largest asset in the market since then, but the chart shows a brief point in history when XRP’s FDV briefly overtook both Bitcoin and Ethereum. That moment marked a psychological turning point for the XRP community and planted a vision that persists today of XRP leading the crypto market in both adoption and valuation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From FDV to Real Market Cap In March 2025, XRP shocked the crypto market again, surpassing Ethereum’s FDV. The asset’s FDV crossed $200 million for the first time since 2018 in late 2024, and its spectacular surge between then and early 2025 helped it surpass ETH in this key valuation . Analysts and supporters pointed to this achievement as further validation of XRP’s trajectory. However, the focus has shifted beyond FDV. What the XRP community is calling for now is real growth in the asset’s actual market cap. Notably, XRP was the second-largest in the crypto market in 2014 , and briefly in 2018 when it rose to its previous all-time high. Because it has surpassed Ethereum in the past, experts are confident that the asset can do it again . However, Bitcoin is a much harder challenge. Can XRP Overtake Bitcoin? Bitcoin currently holds a market cap of $2.39 trillion. With XRP’s circulating supply sitting at 59.3 billion tokens, matching Bitcoin’s market cap would require a price of over $40.3 per XRP. That is almost a 15x increase from XRP’s current trading levels, but it’s not unheard of in the context of cryptocurrency cycles. Analysts have also set targets far above $40 for the current cycle, and if XRP can match their expectations, it could become the largest asset in the crypto market.

49478396,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=778579,1754244266,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49478396.jpeg,"Wall Street braces for packed week of Fed talks, key data, and 120 S&P earnings",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-braces-for-packed-week/,"Wall Street has no breathing room this week as August kicks off with a flood of economic data, high-stakes Fed talk, and earnings reports from more than a hundred S&P 500 companies. This week’s calendar includes PMI prints, a bond auction, weekly labor figures, and speeches from five Federal Reserve officials; all stacked up in the same four-day stretch. And just as traders start unpacking that, names like Pfizer, AMD, Disney, and Eli Lilly are scheduled to drop their latest numbers. The madness begins Monday with July’s S&P Global Services PMI, followed by the ISM’s Non-Manufacturing PMI on Tuesday. Those reports will give a real-time look into whether the service side of the U.S. economy is still running hot. On Wednesday, the Treasury is auctioning 10-year notes, which will test demand for long-term debt. Thursday closes out the macro data cycle with the weekly jobless claims report, a key signal for how strong the labor market still is. Meanwhile, Fed officials will speak five separate times this week. That’s five different chances for them to either calm or spook investors with comments on inflation, rate cuts, or anything else markets aren’t prepared to hear. Earnings from 120 S&P 500 firms, including Pfizer, AMD, and Disney Roughly 120 companies in the S&P 500 will publish quarterly earnings in the days ahead, with Pfizer, AMD, Disney, Super Micro Computer, and Eli Lilly among the most watched. This comes after major names like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta released their reports last week. So far, two-thirds of the index has reported, with over 82% beating expectations, according to data from FactSet. Pfizer will post results before Tuesday’s opening bell, followed by an earnings call at 10 a.m. Last quarter, the company beat estimates while trimming costs. This quarter, analysts at LSEG expect a small drop in year-over-year profit. Investors are watching how Donald Trump’s effort to cut drug prices might weigh on future earnings. Bank of America’s Tim Anderson said the call will likely mention “RFK Jr and possible risks to vaccines; [and] obesity franchise aspirations and/or other early pipeline opportunities like PFE’s next-gen PCV vaccines.” Historically, Pfizer has topped earnings expectations 87% of the time, based on data from Bespoke Investment Group. Advanced Micro Devices reports Tuesday after market close, with its call set for 5 p.m. Last quarter, AMD posted solid earnings but warned about a $1.5 billion revenue loss tied to U.S. limits on chip sales to China. This time, LSEG’s analysts see profit dropping nearly 30% year-over-year, while revenue could climb over 25%. Super Micro Computer will also report earnings after Tuesday’s close, with a conference call scheduled for 5 p.m. Last quarter, the company issued weak guidance and pointed to economic uncertainty and tariff risks. LSEG data suggests this quarter could bring a steep decline in earnings. JPMorgan’s Samik Chatterjee put the company on “negative catalyst watch,” citing tight margins and rising competition. He said those two factors “drive downside to the premium valuation multiple SMCI shares are currently trading at.” Super Micro only beats estimates 64% of the time, but on average, the stock gains 2.3% when it releases earnings. Disney and Eli Lilly will test investor nerves midweek Disney is scheduled to report on Wednesday morning with an 8:30 a.m. earnings call. Last quarter, the company surprised analysts with stronger-than-expected growth in its streaming business. LSEG projects a 7% year-over-year rise in profit this time, but shares are under pressure. Disney stock has dropped more than 5% in the past month, even as the S&P 500 edged higher. Bespoke data shows Disney has beaten expectations in seven of its last eight quarters. Eli Lilly will publish earnings early Thursday, with a call at 8:30 a.m. The company posted a 45% jump in sales last quarter, fueled by demand for its obesity treatment Mounjaro. Analysts at LSEG expect 40% growth this time. Traders will want to hear updates on Mounjaro, especially after Lilly said it matched the heart health benefits of its diabetes drug Trulicity in a recent head-to-head trial. Lilly usually beats forecasts, 66% of the time, but its stock rarely benefits on earnings day. On average, it drops 0.2%.

Analysts Prefer This Altcoin After Defying Crypto Market Crash,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/is-dogecoin-doge-still-a-good-buy-in-2025-analysts-prefer-this-altcoin-after-defying-crypto-market-crash,"Dogecoin is back in the spotlight in 2025, but not for the usual reasons. While many tokens dropped hard during the recent crypto market downturn, Remittix (RTX) has gained investor attention after defying the selloff. RTX is quickly becoming a favorite among early buyers. Dogecoin Updates: Still Holding Its Ground? Dogecoin (DOGE) just slipped by 8%, now trading near $0.1958, with a 17% loss recorded over the past week. Despite this, traders are still hopeful. In fact, many are watching closely. Dogecoin updates from key analysts show that DOGE still trades inside a long-term ascending channel that dates back to 2014. This channel has served as strong support in past cycles. Analyst Tardigrade recently shared a chart showing that DOGE is once again near the bottom of this channel. Ali Martinez added that a falling wedge pattern is forming on the 1-hour chart, which could break out to $0.265 if bulls regain momentum. Key support sits at $0.215–$0.210, with upside resistance around $0.230. source: @ali_charts on X Adding to the bullish case, whales are buying the dip. Over 310 million DOGE has been scooped up by institutional wallets in recent weeks. Bit Origin also bought 40 million DOGE as part of a $500 million diversification move. Why Analysts Prefer Remittix (RTX) Over DOGE in 2025 While Dogecoin updates offer mixed signals, Remittix is delivering steady performance and growing hype. Designed to connect crypto directly to bank accounts across 30+ countries, Remittix stands out as a crypto with real utility . So far, it has raised over $18 million and is offering a 50% bonus to early participants. At just $0.0895 per token, it’s still in its early phase, and many investors believe it could be the best crypto to buy now. Here is what makes Remittix different: Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries Wallet launching in Q3 2025 with real-time FX conversion Audited by CertiK for safety and transparency 20% referral rewards for users who bring in others Support for 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies Traders are calling Remittix the ""next XRP"" because of its cross-border payment focus and global adoption potential. Unlike Dogecoin, RTX is building infrastructure with real-world impact. Final Verdict: Is DOGE Still A Good Buy? Yes, Dogecoin is still a good buy for those betting on history repeating itself. It has survived many crashes and still attracts attention from whales. But for those looking for faster gains and real-world utility, Remittix is the rising pick. It is solving real problems, attracting serious capital, and could easily lead the next wave of adoption.

Remittix,https://bitzo.com/2025/08/exploring-cryptocurrency-investments-in-2025-dogecoin-vs-remittix,"With the cryptocurrency market experiencing a rollercoaster ride in recent years, attention has shifted towards how different cryptocurrencies have adapted and performed. In 2025, the spotlight shines on Dogecoin for its resilience and on Remittix, a new player making notable strides. The Current State of Dogecoin Dogecoin recently saw a decline of approximately 8%, with its trading price hovering near $0.1958. Nevertheless, it maintains a place within a longstanding ascending channel established since 2014. This channel's historical reliability suggests potential for recovery. Recent analysis by Analyst Tardigrade suggests a potential uptick to $0.265 if current patterns hold, with significant buying noted among institutional wallets. Why Remittix Stands Out in 2025 Unlike Dogecoin, Remittix offers a stark contrast with its innovative approach, connecting cryptocurrencies directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. By targeting practical financial solutions with a focus on cross-border payments and a secure infrastructure, Remittix has quickly become the preferred choice for those seeking efficient and reliable crypto solutions. Comparative Analysis and Final Thoughts While Dogecoin continues to appeal due to its community and speculative potential, Remittix's directed approach towards utility in finance positions it as a formidable entity in the crypto space. The choice between the two depends largely on investment goals—whether one values the potential for quick financial returns or believes in long-term utility and stability.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) followed suit, wiping out more than half of its July gains. As these top altcoins struggle to regain footing, smart money investors are eyeing a new 100x crypto candidate with real-world use cases and sustained momentum. Which new crypto token launch is analysts’ top pick for best crypto investment in 2025? Let’s find out. Cardano’s Technical Breakdown Signals Deeper Correction Despite major upgrades, Cardano has broken below key $0.85 support, now trading near $0.69 with RSI at 37, indicating possible further downside. The drop comes as Cardano daily active addresses slide to 21,500, lowest since November 2024 and on the back of the market pullback in reaction to Trump’s new EU tariffs . Analysts are split: some see ADA rebounding if it reclaims $0.85, targeting $1.50 in a cycle similar to 2021 , while others warn of a deeper correction toward $0.70 or even $0.65. Cardano’s rigorous development model has yielded over 1,300 projects and $412M in Total Value Locked, but slower adoption and user experience challenges leave it lagging behind newer, more agile competitors . Shiba Inu Supply Faces Inflation Amidst Burn Rate Decline SHIB has tumbled 16% from July highs despite a one-day burn of 600M tokens, a 374,629% spike. Yet price performance remains disconnected from burn activity. Technicals show weakness: SHIB has dropped below its 50-day EMA, with RSI below 50 and falling volumes. While SHIB celebrates 5 years and 21,600,000% historical gains, reduced Shibarium usage and waning open interest suggest fading momentum and Shib Inu price may fall toward $0.0000094 if selling continues. Remittix: Extending 500% Growth Through Real-World Utility As ADA and Shiba Inu prices retrace, Remittix's mission to bank every individual is gaining steam. The top DeFi company is building a PayFi ecosystem to enable instant crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries, directly solving inefficiencies in the $190 Trillion cross-border payments market. Set for a Q3 2025 wallet beta launch, RTX combines real-world utility with strong tokenomics. Its multi-chain Pay API lets businesses accept 40+ cryptos while settling in fiat instantly, addressing true market demand without relying on hype or token burns alone.

Cardano, after achieving a July peak, saw a sharp 15% drop in value, negating significant gains from earlier in the year. Similarly, Shiba Inu's price plummeted, erasing a substantial portion of its recent rally. This downturn in both assets highlights the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency markets and investor sentiment influenced by broader economic events and internal ecosystem changes. The Emergence of Remittix In contrast to the struggles faced by Cardano and Shiba Inu, Remittix is gaining traction as a robust contender in the blockchain space. With a focus on creating a seamless PayFi ecosystem that facilitates instant crypto-to-bank transfers, Remittix addresses the inefficiencies plaguing the $190 trillion cross-border payments market. This innovative platform is not just a concept but a rapidly developing project aiming for a Q3 2025 wallet beta launch. Remittix is designed to integrate over 40 cryptocurrencies, facilitating real-time fiat settlements, which is a significant step forward in merging crypto economies with traditional financial systems. Technical Challenges and Market Responses While Remittix is on the rise, the technical indicators for Cardano and Shiba Inu show potential further declines. Cardano's active addresses have decreased, reaching a low not seen since November 2024, which could indicate a reducing user base or waning interest. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu, despite a significant token burn, has not seen a corresponding uplift in price, suggesting that market sentiment remains bearish. Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments Remittix is poised to redefine the standards for financial transactions across borders. By enabling crypto-to-bank transfers in seconds and supporting multi-chain functionality, Remittix promises low transaction costs and high efficiency, making it an attractive option for both businesses and individual users. Moreover, the platform's strategic initiatives, such as the $250,000 community giveaway, aim to bolster early adoption and create a robust user base ahead of its official launch. Join the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway As the crypto market continues to evolve, Remittix provides a compelling investment opportunity, especially considering the potential downturns facing more established cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Shiba Inu.

After peaking above $200, Solana Price is now slipping fast, with analysts warning of more downside in August. Meanwhile, traders aren’t waiting around. Many are already rotating into Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi crypto offering real-world utility. With SOL stalling, RTX is gaining attention as the smarter, safer play in an increasingly shaky altcoin environment. Solana Price Crashes Below $170 After Sharp Weekly Drop Solana’s bullish momentum has taken a sharp turn. After briefly crossing $205 in late July, the SOL Price has now dropped over 20%, sitting closer to $160. The pullback isn’t surprising given the overheated rally, but the sudden reversal has sparked concern among investors. The Solana Price today reflects growing caution, especially with Bitcoin dominance rising and altcoin strength fading. The Solana Price Prediction for August now leans bearish, with technicals showing declining RSI and a MACD that just flipped downward. Traders have noted SOL Price is struggling to hold above the $160 support. If it breaks, analysts say a slide toward $150 isn’t off the table. The SOL News cycle has also shifted focus—from meme coin hype to broader ecosystem development. That pivot may be good long-term, but in the short run, it’s left Solana exposed. Platforms like pump.fun aren’t pulling as much retail activity, and newer Layer 2 chains like Base are stealing the spotlight. Despite maintaining solid daily active address counts, the Solana Price has suffered from fading momentum and profit-taking pressure. Many traders are now diversifying into alternatives. Remittix (RTX), for example, has quietly attracted serious capital thanks to its PayFi focus and crypto-to-fiat utility. Compared to Solana News driven by speculation, Remittix offers something grounded—and it’s gaining traction quickly. Remittix Emerges As Top Pick Amid Solana Price Decline While Solana news shows growing weakness, a different project is quietly winning trader confidence. Remittix (RTX) has stepped into the spotlight as a more grounded bet—especially with SOL losing momentum and slipping below key levels. Rather than depending on hype, Remittix delivers what many in crypto talk about but rarely offer: real utility. Its PayFi model turns crypto into spendable fiat in seconds. No centralized exchanges. No long wait times. Just direct, usable money. While traders worry about the SOL Price Prediction in August, Remittix is pushing forward. It’s already raised over $18 million, sold more than 579 million tokens, and now gears up for its biggest product milestone yet—the Remittix Wallet beta on September 15. Remittix investors now enjoy: A working PayFi system designed for real-world crypto-to-fiat usage Growing support from analysts who favor utility over volatility Stable demand while meme coins and large caps dip Access to the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway during wallet launch rollout Remittix isn’t fighting the trend—it’s redefining it.

Analysts predict further reductions in its price come August. In contrast, the PayFi sector, led by innovations like Remittix (RTX), is experiencing a surge in investor interest due to its practical utility in real-world financial transactions. Solana's decline from over $200 to fluctuating prices around $160 has incited a broader conversation about the sustainability of certain cryptocurrencies under market pressures. The sharp downturn of Solana's valuation, despite reaching a high of $205, has led to heightened caution among investors and a pivot towards alternatives that offer more than speculative value. The Appeal of Remittix as a PayFi Solution In the wake of Solana's fluctuating market performance, traders and investors are increasingly turning their attention to Remittix , a platform that promises to seamlessly convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency. This utility is particularly appealing in an environment where many are looking for stability and real-world application. Remittix's approach to PayFi, which facilitates instant liquidity of digital assets, is drawing significant interest. This is evident from the platform's rapid growth and the traction it's gaining amidst the current market volatility. Technical Analysis and Market Predictions for Solana The technical analysis for Solana shows a bearish trend with key indicators like the RSI and MACD reflecting a potential further drop. Market experts suggest that if Solana breaks below the $160 support level, it could see prices as low as $150 in the near future. This instability is prompting traders to diversify their portfolios, with many looking towards more secure and utility-based cryptocurrencies like RTX. The rapid pivot from hype-driven investments like meme coins to platforms that offer tangible financial solutions is reshaping investor strategies. Remittix is emblematic of this shift, with its PayFi model providing immediate crypto-to-fiat conversions without the need for traditional banking infrastructure. Future Prospects and Developments Looking ahead, Remittix is not just weathering the current crypto storm but thriving within it. With plans to launch the Remittix Wallet beta soon, the platform is setting the stage for significant growth in the PayFi domain. This positions RTX as a practical and promising investment amidst the broader crypto market's volatility. Moreover, the upcoming $250,000 Remittix Giveaway to celebrate the wallet launch underscores the platform's commitment to growing its user base and enhancing its visibility in the fintech sector.

As Pepe Coin looms over headlines with the possibility of reaching a $50 billion market cap, various analysts speculate that low-cap gems like Remittix (RTX) have much higher potential for upside. With an actual product under production and a live presale already generating hype, Remittix is quickly becoming a utility-based altcoin that may be overshadowing the hype. Let's see the key stats and why it could beat the hype-driven big boys. Pepe Coin and Troll (SOL): Prices, Market Caps, and Volume Trends Pepe Coin is quoted at around $0.00001009, down 4.3%, with a market cap of around $4.29 billion and a daily volume of $712 million, down nearly 27%. Troll (SOL), a low-cap meme token listed on Solana, is currently trading at $0.062–$0.063 today, up over 20%, with a market cap of roughly $62 million and volume of roughly $14–15 million, though that amount dipped by 27% recently. These numbers show how fast meme tokens can pump—or bleed. But none of them address a real problem in the crypto space. Why Low‑Cap Crypto Gems Attract Analyst Attention Meme coins are constructed on hype on the internet. But now, experts think low-cap projects that actually address real-life issues will make the biggest profits. Pepe Coin has brand power, and Troll (SOL) has timing—but both are sentiment and speculation-driven. Investors looking for the next 100x crypto are gravitating toward crypto that has actual utility and low gas fee crypto alternatives. And that's where an underdog challenger enters the picture. Hello Remittix: A Utility‑Driven Player in the Cryptosphere Remittix (RTX) is causing a buzz with its price of just $0.0895 per token , having sold over 579 million tokens and raising $18 million. There is still a 50% bonus available in its ongoing presale. The Remittix Wallet—which is coming in Q3 2025—will enable crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, supporting 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. It boasts real-time FX conversion, low gas fees, and mobile-first UX optimized for international consumers like freelancers, expats, and small businesses. Why Remittix Can Be the Real Winner Among Low-Caps Utility-first approach: Serves global payment inefficiencies Presale traction: $18 Million+ raised, 579Million+ tokens sold Beta wallet on the horizon: Launches Q3 2025 Big bonus: 50% extra tokens for early adopters $250,000 giveaway: Offers extra incentive for new users With real tech behind it and real use cases driving it, Remittix is being seen as the best crypto presale 2025. It's not here to win the meme war—it's here to win crypto's next utility race. Pepe Coin could easily go to a $50 billion market cap, and Troll (SOL) could have some additional waves. But it's initiatives like Remittix that bring value—and that is what experts hold drives sustainable 100x growth.

However, the spotlight is now shifting to lesser-known, low-cap coins such as Remittix (RTX) , which are poised for significant growth. Remittix, in particular, is creating buzz with its ongoing presale and the development of a utility-driven product that aims to streamline financial transactions across borders. This shift in focus from high-cap, hype-driven coins to utility-based low-cap gems could redefine investment strategies in the crypto space. The Appeal of Low-Cap Cryptocurrencies Low-cap cryptocurrencies like Remittix offer a unique appeal due to their potential for rapid appreciation. Their smaller market caps mean they can experience significant price movements from relatively modest investments, attracting both retail and experienced investors seeking high returns. Remittix: A Closer Look at its Market Potential Remittix stands out not just for its promising financial technology but also for its strategic market positioning. With a live presale that has already captivated a considerable audience, Remittix is paving the way for substantial growth in the fintech sector. Remittix's upcoming product, the Remittix Wallet, is slated for release in Q3 2025. It promises to support crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries, accommodating a wide range of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. This innovation is particularly aimed at freelancers, expatriates, and small businesses who require efficient, cost-effective international payment solutions. Why Investors are Turning to Remittix The current financial landscape demands more than just digital assets; it requires solutions that resolve actual economic and transactional challenges. Remittix addresses these needs head-on, distinguishing itself from other meme-driven cryptocurrencies, including the more popular Pepe Coin and Troll (SOL). While Pepe Coin might boast a robust market cap and Troll (SOL) shows occasional price spikes, their growth is largely fueled by market sentiment rather than underlying utility. Remittix's approach, which combines a strong technological foundation with practical financial solutions, presents a more sustainable growth trajectory. As the crypto market evolves, the focus is gradually shifting from speculative investments towards those that offer real-world applications. This pivot could see projects like Remittix not just succeeding but potentially dominating the PayFi sector.

These tokens combine community spirit, quirky stories, and growth potential, appealing to investors beyond traditional assets. Three coins stand out: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , SPX6900 (SPX), and Test Coin (TST). Here’s a closer look at what’s driving their traction and why they deserve a place on your radar. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Surpasses $13 Million in Presale Funds Little Pepe’s presale journey has been a steady climb rather than a sudden burst. A phased pricing model rewards early participants by gradually increasing token prices at each stage, encouraging timely entry and sustainable growth over sudden spikes. Currently in Stage 8, Little Pepe tokens are priced at $0.0017, and nearly 98% of the allocation for this stage has been claimed. The presale distributed over 8.9 billion tokens, raising over $13 million. Steady support highlights a strong community that values transparency and a community-focused approach. One of LILPEPE’s key strengths is its underlying technology. LILPEPE is built on Ethereum Layer 2, providing faster transactions with lower fees. As LILPEPE’s presale Stage 8 nears completion, excitement grows for Stage 9, which will further raise the token price. This prepares the meme coin for a solid foundation for future growth, institutional partnerships, and ecosystem expansion. LILPEPE’s presale performance, combined with its growing community and technical backbone, positions it as one of the meme coins with promising staying power in 2025. The LILPEPE team is also hosting a giveaway worth $770,000, with 10 lucky wallets each winning $77,000. This move is attracting both traders and crypto enthusiasts alike to partake in the meme coin’s presale. For those seeking exposure to a meme token that balances enthusiasm with real utility potential, Little Pepe is one to watch closely this month. SPX6900 (SPX) Hits New Highs Amid Technical Signals SPX6900 has quietly been making moves lately, hitting an all-time high of $2.21 and marking its fourth consecutive day of gains. The price action suggests that it has entered a discovery phase where buyers remain interested despite already strong performance. Technical analysis shows SPX targeting the 1.272 Fibonacci level near $3.07, based on earlier swings. MACD indicates bullish strength with a rising green histogram. RSI at 71 overbought signals caution. SPX’s recent gains and technical backdrop make it an intriguing meme coin for those who closely monitor charts. It’s a token riding the wave of momentum, but also reminding investors to manage risk carefully as it approaches critical resistance levels. Test Coin (TST): The Meme That Refused to Fade Test Coin has a unique story in the meme coin scene. It started as a joke, launched on a developer network with low expectations. Despite this, the community embraced it, turning it into a decentralized governance experiment and meme culture symbol. With over $4.5 million in trading volume and a DAO voting on quirky updates, Test Coin is known for unpredictability and humor. Last week’s stunt replaced the website with a QR code linking to a Nicolas Cage meme, which coincidentally caused a price rise. Despite—or perhaps because of—its lack of conventional utility, Test Coin has become one of the most talked-about memecoins of 2025. Enthusiasts affectionately call it “the coin with no utility that outperformed half of Solana,” underscoring its viral momentum. Final Thoughts As August 2025 begins, the meme coin scene continues to buzz with activity. Little Pepe combines community, tech, and transparent presale for long-term growth. The SPX6900 remains bullish but risks becoming overbought. Test Coin surprises with unique memes and decentralized choices. Observing these projects may reveal future winners.

Yet while it’s still soaring in the portfolios of investors, the focus is shifting toward newer coins with more growth and actual usability. One such dark horse is gaining steam under the radar — and it’s still trading higher than $0.10. And with a successful presale and beta product already under its belt, this new crypto called Remittix (RTX) is poised to jump over many of the industry leaders. Cardano vs Litecoin – Which Legacy Alt Will Survive? Cardano (ADA) is at $0.7115, making steady but unimpressive gains. The blockchain features a peer-reviewed development process, but with that cautious strategy have come delays and missed chances in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Although maintaining a market capitalization of more than $25 billion, ADA’s expansion has decelerated. Recent updates like Hydra and Mithril have improved performance but the ecosystem still does not feel mass adoption of dApps and DeFi protocols similar to other networks. Litecoin (LTC), on the other hand, remains a solid contender because of its fast transactions and low fees. It is trading for $108.00 and has seen a 2.17% 24-hour gain. Its market capitalization stands at approximately $8.22 billion, and its volume is climbing gradually, aided by its reputation as a testing ground for Bitcoin. But even ADA and LTC have not been the ones to innovate in the area of utility. As the industry keeps moving towards utility-based use cases like crypto-to-fiat payments, remittance, and low gas fee crypto use cases, the two projects are now starting to look like legacy tech. The Real Challenger: Remittix (RTX) One project is filling this gap with a solution for an urgent real-world problem: sending and spending crypto as fiat. Remittix, currently priced at $0.0895 , is building a cross-chain wallet that facilitates real-time crypto-to-fiat transactions to bank accounts in more than 30 countries. As Cardano makes further progress towards real-world applications, Remittix already has raised more than $18 million in its current presale, with 579 million RTX tokens sold. It’s now firmly established that the Remittix Wallet Beta will launch live in Q3 2025, with Solana, Dogecoin, and other leading tokens supported.

With BTC dipping under $115,000, some view it as a signal of cooling momentum—but for others, it’s the calm before another major run. One question keeps surfacing: if Bitcoin still has room to 10x long-term, what other cryptocurrency is poised to outperform before the next wave starts? That question is drawing attention to a growing DeFi project that’s still under the radar— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.035, it offers a rare opportunity to enter early with clear utility, real yield potential, and a strong roadmap. But before diving into that, let’s address Bitcoin’s current position and why its long-term outlook still drives optimism. Bitcoin (BTC) Dips, Long-Term Vision Holds Bitcoin’s recent slide below $115K may look alarming on the surface, but market analysts aren’t rattled. The pullback came amid renewed global trade uncertainty, short-term profit-taking, and thinner summer market activity. Still, BTC has held above its critical $110K support, and many believe this is just a pause within a broader bullish structure. Firms such as ARK Invest and Cantor Fitzgerald continue to support a strong long-term outlook for Bitcoin. Both expect the asset to reach $1 million by the end of the decade. This forecast is rooted in growing institutional demand, shrinking available supply, and Bitcoin’s built-in scarcity model. Notably, Cantor analysts cite capital reallocation by public companies and sovereign wealth strategies as key factors pushing the price beyond current highs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. It’s not just another token trying to ride the wave—Mutuum is building a decentralized infrastructure around real, scalable utility. Currently in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035, with over 14,700 holders already on board and more than $13.8 million raised to date. That level of early traction is notable for a project still in its pre-launch phase. Anyone getting in now is already locking in a short-term gain, with the listing price set at $0.06—a clear step up from the current entry point. But what’s driving attention even more is the potential for continued momentum once MUTM starts trading on major centralized exchanges. Considering the project’s utility, growing community, and post-launch roadmap, many believe the price won’t stop at $0.06. By locking in at $0.035 today, investors could see their entry appreciate by 200–300% over the coming months, especially as exchange listings, the platform’s beta release, and the buy-and-redistribute mechanism start to build momentum. Unlike projects that rely purely on hype, MUTM is backed by real DeFi features like lending, borrowing, and an overcollateralized stablecoin—giving it fundamentals that support long-term value, not just short-term speculation. This combination of early-stage pricing, token utility, and a clear rollout plan makes Mutuum Finance one of the best crypto projects to watch before the next market leg up. Why It’s Gaining Attention The protocol allows users to lend and borrow digital assets using smart contract-based pools, removing the need for centralized intermediaries. What sets it apart is how it balances both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending models, giving users flexibility based on their strategy and risk tolerance. Another standout feature is the introduction of an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted only when a borrower locks up sufficient assets. This stablecoin isn’t backed by a separate pool—it’s generated on demand and burned upon repayment. That makes it more efficient and resilient than many existing models. Holders who deposit assets into the system receive mtTokens, which automatically accumulate value from interest. These tokens represent the user’s share in the protocol and can be staked to earn passive rewards. And here’s where it gets even more interesting—the revenue from borrowing activity is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. It’s a self-contained yield engine that grows with platform activity. And with Layer 2 optimization in development, the team is pushing to reduce gas fees and scale usage further—key for any DeFi platform aiming to onboard more users. While Bitcoin’s path to $1 million is still unfolding, the question for many isn’t if BTC will rise again—it’s where to look while it consolidates. For those searching for the next big cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance offers a mix of timing, utility, and upside that few other tokens can match at this stage. With a fixed listing price of $0.06, a utility-driven ecosystem, and a token model designed for long-term sustainability, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the most compelling investments of the year—especially before the broader market turns bullish again.

It’s trading above its historical growth path, but far from overheating. Long-time holders remain mostly inactive, while the bulk of trading activity is coming from fresh faces in the market. Related Reading: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst Bitcoin Growth Remains On Track Based on reports by Arab Chain using CryptoQuant data, Bitcoin’s price is tracking a Power Law trend that suggests a smooth, logarithmic rise over time. That model creates a curved path rather than sudden spikes. Right now, BTC sits above the expected growth line but well below the upper “red zone” that signals overheating. The divergence indicator is positive, yet far from levels seen in past bubbles. This pattern hints at natural growth or perhaps the early stages of renewed betting. Divergence Keeps Room For Upside Analysts note that staying below the top watch zone leaves room for more gains before panic sets in. In prior cycles, prices shot through that red zone and then collapsed. Today, Bitcoin is about $50,000 under its most recent peak level. That gap suggests buyers still have breathing room if they choose to push prices higher. On-chain data from Glassnode shows short-term holders (STHs) are behind most of the action. Around 86% of Bitcoin’s spent volume over the last 24 hours came from wallets active less than 155 days, totaling $18 billion. Long-term holders (LTHs) accounted for only 14.5% of spent volume, or $3.10 billion. That split means newer entrants are driving swings, while veteran holders stay largely on the sidelines. Long-Term Holders Show Conviction That dichotomy between STHs and LTHs tends to indicate intense conviction among core believers. When long-term owners remain in place, price drops tend to be more subtle. Buyers who have hung on for years or months typically view dips as opportunity to add rather than times to sell. Bitcoin was trading around $114,113 at press time following a pullback from recent highs of about $118K. The daily Relative Strength Index had fallen to 43, indicating a loss of bullish momentum without going into oversold levels. On-Balance Volume has been declining in the past week, indicating weakening buying pressure.

Despite the bearish momentum, the cryptocurrency has now reached a key support zone, expected to hold in the short term. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart After a prolonged consolidation within the $116K–$123K range, BTC encountered heavy selling pressure, driven by escalating concerns over the Russia–US nuclear conflict. This led to a breakdown below the critical $114K support, sparking fear and uncertainty in the market. However, BTC has now approached a major support zone between $111K and $112K, an area defined by the lower boundary of a multi-month ascending channel and a key previous swing high. This confluence of technical support is likely to attract patient buyers, potentially initiating a bullish consolidation phase. Still, if the price fails to hold above this region, a rapid decline toward the psychological $100K level could follow. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin’s breakdown from the bullish flag pattern marks a bearish technical signal, confirming the pattern’s failure. The sharp rejection from the flag’s upper boundary triggered a steep decline, bringing the price to a critical support near the $112K zone, which also aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This particular one often acts as a magnet for short-term bullish reactions. As long as the price holds above this range, a corrective bounce is likely. However, if bearish momentum persists, another sell-off targeting a sweep below $111K–$112K may occur. Until then, short-term consolidation remains the most probable outcome. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Exchange Netflow indicator shows that 16,417 BTC flowed into exchanges yesterday, the highest daily net inflow since mid-July. This suggests a significant number of holders are moving their Bitcoin to exchanges, typically a precursor to selling activity. At the same time, the Exchange Whale Ratio surged above 0.70, indicating that the majority of these deposits came from large holders (whales). Historically, when whale-dominated inflows coincide with elevated exchange activity, the market often faces increased selling pressure and price declines. If this trend continues and whales persist in depositing BTC at this pace, further downside risk could follow. Such activity may reflect profit-taking, preparation for a correction, or strategic reallocation in anticipation of near-term volatility.

As both the USDT and BTC pairs are now showing signs of bearish momentum, investors are cautiously looking to see if the available support levels can hold and prevent a full-on reversal. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the XRP/USDT pair, Ripple’s token has been rising since early July, before sweeping the liquidity above the $3.40 high and reversing to the downside. The market is currently pulling back toward both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are located near the $2.50 mark, and have just created a bullish crossover. As things stand, the $3.00 level is lost, and if a quick recovery back above this level does not occur, the mentioned moving averages will be the next targets. While the convergence of these moving averages creates a potentially strong support, if it gets broken to the downside, a much deeper drop toward the $1.60 area would be probable. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair is going through a similar pullback, following a swift rejection from the 3,200 SAT resistance zone. The price is currently testing the 200-day moving average and the higher boundary of the broken descending channel around the 2,500 SAT mark. The RSI has also dropped from deeply overbought levels to just below 50, showing a clear shift in momentum. If the 2,500 SAT support zone gets broken to the downside, the price will drop back into the channel, and would likely pull toward the 2,000 SAT area. This scenario would potentially result in a lengthy consolidation and reset the current bullish trend.

The Satoshi Nakamoto statue in Parco Ciani has vanished. Satoshigallery , the group behind the global statue initiative, confirms the theft. The work stood proud since October 25, 2024, debuting at the Plan ₿ Forum, a joint push by the city and Tether to boost crypto adoption. Where is Satoshi? We are offering 0.1 btc to whoever will help us recovering the Statue of Satoshi Nakamoto that was stolen yesterday in Lugano. You can steal our symbol but you will never be able to steal our souls. Thank you all for the nice messages. We are all in this… https://t.co/cAGCqg4CuP pic.twitter.com/iGrBOdVYhe — Satoshigallery (@satoshigallery) August 3, 2025 Last night, someone stole and smashed the bronze likeness. Early reports say the vandal left broken pieces behind, and hours later locals spotted fragments floating in the lake. Police cordoned off the scene and launched a thorough probe,no suspects have been named. Satoshigallery offered a 0.1 BTC reward (≈ $11,900) for tips leading to its recovery, stating, “You can steal our symbol, but you will never be able to steal our souls.” At today’s price of $118,995 per BTC, that bounty stands firm. Not everyone agreed it was a calculated theft. X user @Grittoshi claimed that during Swiss National Day on August 1, intoxicated revelers near the Aur Café simply overturned the statue,welded by just two points,into Lake Lugano as a prank, insisting “cameras are everywhere” and “no way they could cart it off.” Fragments lay scattered, a sad symbol of celebratory excess. Story Update On Satoshi Nakamoto Statue Municipal divers and recovery teams have now retrieved the statue,broken but intact,from Lake Lugano. Satoshigallery publicly thanked the city of Lugano for their swift action, confirming the sculpture is back in their care for restoration. We want to thank the Municipality of Lugano @luganomycity for helping us to recover the statue that was thrown into the lake. https://t.co/UyKhyBvt1m pic.twitter.com/qaHFWXIHRs — Satoshigallery (@satoshigallery) August 3, 2025 Local businesses report that tourist foot traffic dipped since the incident; city officials have pledged support for restoration and will tighten security at Parco Ciani and future crypto-themed exhibitions. Meanwhile, Satoshigallery remains undeterred: plans to cast and install Satoshi statues in 21 cities worldwide are still on track. This episode proves a cautionary tale: public crypto art can galvanize communities but also requires robust protection. Through broken bronze, ripples in the lake, and now a successful recovery, the Satoshi saga continues,an emblem of blockchain’s resilience and the enduring spirit of its community.

In the companies’ latest earnings calls, executives from Visa and Mastercard – which handle $13.2 trillion and $8 trillion in payments globally per year, respectively – signaled that the giants were ready to embrace rather than fight stablecoins. Says Visa CEO Ryan McInerney, “…Stablecoins could enable us to have faster cross-border transactions. By the way, that’s true for consumers or for businesses. And we’ve been testing that out and having some good results. We’ve been testing a series of corridors and putting stablecoins to work directly versus the fiat currency money movement options that we’re able to deliver to our clients and their users today… I do think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that there is real product market fit for stablecoins in remittances for certain corridors. And as the largest money movement platform around the world, we’re going to be an early adopter of a lot of those things on behalf of our clients and their end users.” And in Mastercard’s Q2 earnings call , CEO Michael Miebach also suggested that stablecoins weren’t so much of a threat to the company, but an asset to augment its services. “And as to stablecoins, we see this as another currency. We also see it as additive to the network with opportunities for us to provide the on and off ramps from fiat to stablecoin to partner with [ advice ] and wallets to bring interoperability, bring relevant services, bring global reach and trust to the specific use cases.

He says that while Bitcoin (BTC) is still doing well, the rest of the crypto market is not keeping up with other big assets like stocks, gold, and government bonds. He said that Bitcoin and the U.S. Treasury bonds could become two of the best-performing investments this year, especially during tough economic times. Crypto Returns Match Stocks But With Higher Risk McGlone pointed to lower investor demand and high interest rates as reasons why many digital coins are under pressure . So far in 2025, the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) has gained 7%. This matches the year-to-date return of the S&P 500, the main stock market index in the United States. However, McGlone warns that this comparison is misleading. Although he acknowledged that the crypto market is maturing, high volatility makes it more risky. According to McGlone, crypto gives the same return as the S&P 500 but with four times the volatility. He highlighted that investors are taking on much more risk for the same level of profit. At the same time, the Bloomberg Dollar Index has fallen by 7.5% this year. A weaker dollar usually helps push up asset prices, including crypto. Even with this drop, most cryptocurrencies are still not doing well. This adds to McGlone’s argument that the market is not as strong as it appears. Bitcoin May Still Lead, But the Rest May Struggle While McGlone sees problems in the wider crypto market, he still expects the flagship crypto to do well. In his view, Bitcoin and U.S. Treasury bonds are the most likely to perform well this year. This may seem like a contradiction, but McGlone sees long-term value in Bitcoin, calling it a digital form of gold because of its limited supply and adoption rate. However, he also warns that Bitcoin’s success may depend on how the stock market behaves. Furthermore, McGlone also predicts that the stock market will fall sharply. His warning followed a 1.6% fall in the S&P 500 last Friday. This drop caused weaker-than-expected jobs data, which raised concerns about the strength of the economy. Bitcoin Drops After July High In July 2025, Bitcoin hit a record high of $122,838, but since then, its price has dropped to about $112,113. Other cryptocurrencies have fallen even more. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $113,789, up 0.93% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Analyst Mike McGlone once said Bitcoin could fall as low as $10,000. Although this has not happened yet, he still stands by his warning. Even though some people disagree with him , McGlone still believes the crypto market could see a big drop.

Betsson has just made a move into Brazil, building a customized platform aligned with local rules. DraftKings continues to grow in the U.S. with stronger live betting features and new lottery integrations. While these efforts push both forward, crypto-first users still face gaps in speed, transparency, and global access. That’s where Spartans steps ahead. It offers 5,963 games, a 300% welcome bonus with clearly outlined terms, and fast crypto withdrawals. With sportsbook access across top leagues, it brings unmatched convenience and value. DraftKings: Advanced Tech, Traditional Limits DraftKings holds strong brand recognition in digital sports betting. Its public NASDAQ listing and recent analyst projections, like Bernstein’s $46 price target, reflect confidence in its growth, largely due to its in-game betting systems. The acquisition of SimpleBet boosted its pricing tech, making real-time bets more accurate and widespread. It also added Jackpocket to expand into digital lottery, allowing cross-promotion between sports betting and lottery players. Users can choose from slots, blackjack, roulette, sportsbook access, and fantasy sports. Yet, some drawbacks remain. DraftKings is mainly built for fiat users, with slow withdrawals and restricted access based on region. Bonus offers differ by location and are often buried in fine print. For those seeking faster crypto use and global flexibility, DraftKings may fall short of being the best pick. Betsson: Building Trust in Regional Markets Betsson is focusing on regulated growth in emerging areas. Its Brazil launch, through a local partnership, adds to its presence in Colombia and Argentina. The company’s approach prioritizes legal compliance and tailored platforms offering sports betting, casino games, and virtual sports. Betsson also launched a responsible gambling campaign in Brazil, supporting safer play with education and awareness tools. This effort has earned praise from industry watchers as a responsible way to grow in new markets. Still, crypto-friendly users may find the platform lacking. Withdrawal speeds are slower, bonuses lack transparency upfront, and there’s limited public access to fairness metrics like RTP. While Betsson continues to grow in localized spaces, it doesn’t yet fully meet the expectations of speed or crypto accessibility. Spartans: Fast Crypto, Clear Bonuses, and 5,963 Games That Work Smoothly Spartans wasn’t made to follow outdated designs; it was built to fix their weak points. That’s why crypto users are turning to it. With 5,963 casino titles, an all-in-one sportsbook from soccer to MMA, and instant crypto payout systems, Spartans delivers on clarity, speed, and utility. The 300% welcome bonus comes with upfront rules, users know the 35x playthrough, 7-day window, and max cashout before depositing. These terms remain stable across all regions, which is a rare advantage over DraftKings and Betsson. What also makes a difference is how quickly users get their funds. Whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT, withdrawals are handled instantly. Game fairness is backed by published RTP and provably fair systems. Whether playing roulette, blackjack, or live bets, the performance remains smooth. Spartans also stands out with features others skip: mobile access with no need for an app, a fully disclosed affiliate setup (CPA, Rev Share, Hybrid), and a Lamborghini prize draw for top members. For those evaluating the best betting sites based on features that matter, Spartans delivers results where others still fall behind. Final Thoughts DraftKings is leaning into live betting and lottery tools. Betsson is growing with a regulation-focused model in Latin America. But both still leave major gaps, especially for those who want fast cashouts, upfront bonuses, and global crypto options. Spartans answers those needs directly. With over 5,900 games, worldwide sportsbook access, and bonus terms that are clearly stated, Spartans shows that the best betting site isn’t defined by name recognition, it’s about delivery. With instant crypto withdrawals and fair play built in, Spartans isn’t just a challenger, it’s a better choice.

Makhlouf warns that the country could be in a bad situation if the government pushes its agenda to boost spending excessively. This statement comes two weeks after the government’s October annual budget proposals were released. The plans comprised a 6.4% increase in spending that everyone needed to adhere to. Meanwhile, this increase in spending, according to analysis from sources, is lower compared to the past budgets set, which ranged between 8% to 9%. Makhlouf raises concerns over the government’s recently released budget plan During an interview, Makhlouf explained that additional stimulus in the sector is unnecessary when an economy is fully employed . Therefore, based on his argument, the government should reconsider its budget plan. The Irish central bank’s governor also pointed out that the country’s economy was in a bad state, urging that the government’s plan could further worsen the situation. On the other hand, in an earlier announcement, the government had mentioned making changes in tax cuts and spending. Following these changes, the agency vowed to reduce the suggested 9.4 billion euro tax cuts and higher expenditure in 2026, if Trump increases the tariff rates above the 10% currently set. Coincidentally, after the agency made public its budget plans in the Summer Economic Statement, the US struck a trade deal with the EU, which resulted in a 15% import tariff on goods from the EU. Concerning the budget plan in the Summer Economic Statement, Makhlouf expressed that he hoped the government would consider changing this plan and make a final one. He concluded, “By then, the government will have thought again about what the trade situation is showing us.” Ireland’s infrastructure lags behind compared to its economic rivals Last month, Prime Minister Micheal Martin announced plans to raise Ireland’s spending on infrastructure by 30%. This increment in spending came after Apple made a €14 billion, or $16 billion , tax payment to the country. Apart from the tax payment, funds raised from selling bank shares also contributed to this significant change. This followed warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that Ireland had fallen behind its economic rivals in terms of infrastructure. The report also reported that the country has not utilized tax revenue from the multinationals for years to improve its ailing energy sector, water systems, and housing supply. To address these challenges, the agency has revealed that it intends to shift its focus towards enhancing the energy sector with significant capital investment plans and diversifying energy sources, improving its infrastructure, starting with public transport like roads, and boosting water services in the country to improve housing availability. However, to successfully improve housing availability, Ireland’s national water utility stated that it would require significant funds to supply water services adequately. With its revenue challenges, the government finds it hard to achieve these goals, especially improving housing availability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Not just buying low and selling high, but entering before the wave begins. From Bitcoin’s earliest days at under $1 to Ethereum’s quiet beginnings at $0.30, the biggest winners were not those with the most capital—but those with the most foresight. Fast forward to 2025, and the opportunity hasn’t disappeared. If anything, it’s evolved. Now, smart investors are hunting for tokens that offer asymmetric upside—projects with strong narratives, emerging communities, and clear signals of momentum before mainstream exposure kicks in. This approach is what turns $500 into $50,000, and helps level the playing field between retail traders and institutions. Today’s profit strategies go beyond holding Bitcoin or earning yield through DeFi. While those approaches offer stability, the fastest gains still come from early entry into under-the-radar altcoins —especially those with viral branding, limited access windows, and traction that mirrors early crypto giants. But identifying the right project requires more than hype. With tools like on-chain analysis, Telegram activity trackers, and social volume aggregators, today’s investor has sharper insight than ever before into what’s building beneath the surface. Why Early-Stage Tokens Still Offer the Best ROI Most projects don’t go 100x. But those that do usually share a few common traits—and they all rewarded those who recognized the patterns early. In recent months, one particular token has been making waves for just that reason. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention across platforms like X and Telegram not simply for its meme appeal, but for the velocity of its adoption. Crypto research groups tracking social metrics say its early trajectory mirrors the rise of Ethereum Classic, two tokens that generated major returns for initial adopters. But unlike older assets that are now deep into their market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early growth curve . The project’s viral branding, combined with a limited-access phase, has created a rush among early participants. Every round has seen rapid sellouts, and the project’s social growth has already rivaled meme giants like Dogecoin in their infancy. Analysts now forecast that its current pricing window may be one of the last remaining chances for sharp asymmetric entry before broader exchange access resets the opportunity. How to Spot High-Upside Tokens Before the Crowd Spotting altcoins before they explode isn’t about luck—it’s about pattern recognition. Historically, the biggest crypto winners showed early signs long before their names hit mainstream headlines. These included subtle metrics like surging social media growth, increasing wallet holders, and high engagement rates on social channels like X and Telegram . They also tended to feature emotionally resonant branding, whether political, cultural, or comedic—something that hooks communities and sustains hype across weeks or months. Another key factor? Scarcity of access. The earliest-stage tokens that go on to make 10x–100x moves are often available only for a limited time through exclusive, time-sensitive windows. Once listed on major exchanges, these assets usually price in their potential, leaving little room for exponential gains . The most strategic investors understand this—they track momentum, measure community velocity, and look for entry points when the crowd is still on the sidelines. Final Thoughts: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Act Early The best way to make money in crypto has always been clear— get in before everyone else realizes what’s happening . Whether it’s through identifying social trends, spotting wallet inflows, or analyzing price structure before breakout, timing and conviction are the real tools of the trade. In today’s cycle, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum precisely because they offer that rare mix: powerful community traction, viral positioning, and limited access. And as history has shown, when these elements align, the results can be game-changing .

The bond, denominated in U.S. dollars with a size capped at $300 million and a three-year maturity, is the first digitally native bond from a Chinese brokerage to be offered to the public. The offering was carried out through HSBC Orion, a distributed ledger-based digital assets platform, with GTJAI serving as both lead joint coordinator and issuer. @MichaelLINY, a crypto educator on X, revealed that the digital bond was minted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The digital bond uses blockchain infrastructure to enhance transparency, streamline issuance, and reduce settlement inefficiencies common in traditional finance. The company says this move aligns with its broader push for innovation in financial services, particularly through technologies that support programmable and secure instruments. GTJAI stated that it will use this issuance as an opportunity to explore cross-border digital asset issuance and other innovative finance applications.

Notably, HSBC and Ripple-owned Metaco entered into a partnership in late 2023 to launch tokenized securities custody solutions, a move that firmly aligns the bank with Ripple’s blockchain ambitions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The XRPL is recognized for its efficiency in settling tokenized assets and other fixed-income products, such as bonds and treasury bills . Although it was not directly referenced in the GTJAI deal, its technological compatibility and Ripple’s growing institutional presence are increasingly relevant as firms like HSBC expand custody and issuance infrastructure for digital bonds. The involvement of Ripple-linked entities in key layers of infrastructure hints at the possibility of XRP or XRPL-related rails used in future capital market deployments, especially as the tokenization market grows . Institutional Leaders Embrace Blockchain Technology Zhang Xueming, GTJAI’s Chief Financial Officer, described the issuance as both a proof of technological leadership and a demonstration of the firm’s commitment to next-generation financial services. HSBC’s John O’Neill, who leads the bank’s digital assets division, commented that the partnership allows HSBC Orion to support “a broader range of digital bonds and issuers.” With the bank already embedding custody infrastructure through Ripple’s Metaco, HSBC’s role in bridging traditional finance and tokenized instruments continues to deepen.

Some accounts are spreading rumors that China has banned cryptocurrencies again, without any evidence. These claims lack any official statement or legal text. They rely solely on hearsay. According to Bitcoin Junkies, China has not made any recent announcements regarding crypto regulations. China imposed its last major restrictions in September 2021, targeting mining and exchange activities. That policy remains unchanged. No fresh edicts or directives have emerged from Beijing in 2025. WARNING: False reports are circulating claiming that China has issued a new ban on cryptocurrency. China has not made any recent announcements regarding crypto regulations. China banned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies back in 2021, and that policy remains unchanged. pic.twitter.com/6jiasBWEea — Bitcoin Junkies (@BTCjunkies) August 3, 2025 Bitcoin trades at $114,071 USD, with a live market cap of $2.27 trillion. It sees $53.98 billion in 24-hour volume and holds the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. This positions Bitcoin as the leading digital asset, far ahead of competitors in liquidity and adoption. The four key facts you need to know: Hong Kong as a pilot zone embraces crypto. Hong Kong has launched initiatives to attract exchanges and token issuers. Its regulators have rolled out a licensing regime for spot trading platforms. China never banned individual crypto transactions. Private peer-to-peer transfers remain legal. Only institutional participants, banks, payment firms, and funds are prohibited from offering crypto services. Bitcoin mining still occurs in China. Many miners displaced in 2021 shifted abroad, but some resumed operations in regions with looser enforcement. Estimates suggest China still accounts for around 15% of global hash rate. Stablecoins and RWAs gain traction among officials. Chinese authorities explore tokenized real-world assets and regulated stablecoins for on-chain use cases. Pilot programs in Guangdong and Shanghai test asset-backed instruments. What Beijing’s 2021 Ban Covered Exchange closures. All domestic crypto trading platforms were ordered to cease operations. Mining shut-down. Major mining provinces rescinded power allocations for crypto-heavy users. Financial institutions barred. Banks and payment providers were forbidden from clearing crypto transactions. That framework persists today. No new clauses have been introduced. No new fines have been announced. Hong Kong SAR operates under a separate legal system. It launched its new crypto licensing regime in June 2024. The Securities and Futures Commission now issues licenses to spot exchanges and custodians. This makes Hong Kong one of Asia’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Its pilot zone model aims to draw talent, capital, and blockchain projects away from Silicon Valley and Dubai. On-chain Reality Shows China’s Strong Belief Despite official bans, Chinese nationals still hold and transact crypto. Peer-to-peer OTC desks thrive on messaging apps. VPN-enabled access to foreign exchanges remains common. On-chain data shows persistent activity. Bitcoin’s on-chain transfer volume averages over $20 billion daily, with a sizeable share originating from IPs linked to China. Further Considerations China continues to explore digital currency with its central bank digital currency (e-CNY). That project does not equate to an outright ban on all private crypto. Instead, it reflects a desire to maintain monetary sovereignty and clamp down on illicit finance. As regulators study tokenized stocks, bonds, and commodities, China may issue further guidelines on real-world assets (RWAs) and stablecoins. These moves will shape the next phase of blockchain adoption on the mainland. In sum, the rumor of a fresh China crypto ban is just that, a rumor. China’s 2021 restrictions remain in force. No new prohibitions have been introduced. Meanwhile, Hong Kong forges ahead with open-market policies, and private transactions continue on Chinese-controlled networks. The crypto community can rest easy: nothing new has changed in Beijing’s rulebook. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

49480184,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=29463,1754247900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png,Bitcoin Crashes Below $115K as Trump Sparks Nuclear Tensions and Fed Turmoil,https://btc-pulse.com/bitcoin-crashes-below-115k-as-trump-sparks-nuclear/,"Bitcoin plummeted to $113,164 on Friday, losing nearly 8% within hours and triggering over $200 million in liquidations. The downturn coincides with former President Donald Trump’s aggressive political maneuvering and amid rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Russia. The market’s dramatic downturn reflects growing investor anxiety as Trump reenters the political landscape with incendiary foreign policy statements and attacks on U.S. economic institutions. Trump Orders Sub Repositioning Amid Russia Standoff Trump’s latest posts on Truth Social revealed a major military action: he ordered two nuclear submarines to reposition amid threats from Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. Medvedev had dismissed Trump’s demand to stop the war in Ukraine within ten days as a “step towards war.” Trump responded, stating that there were now “unintended consequences” with military assets being moved. Markets quickly reacted to the escalation, with Bitcoin leading the retreat. Risk assets faltered as the prospect of renewed nuclear tension rattled global investors. Trump Blasts Fed and Jobs Figures Ahead of Election In a separate series of posts, Trump accused Labor Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of fudging job numbers to boost Vice President Kamala Harris’s chances in the 2024 election. He demanded that she be fired and referred to the numbers as “fake.”. Trump also criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him “a stubborn MORON” and demanding now rate cuts. He urged the Federal Reserve Board to work around Powell’s control, an unprecedented suggestion that breaks with decades of central bank independence. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler Resigns, Opening Trump Path Amidst growing political pressure, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler resigned Friday. Though she gave no definite reason, Kugler’s early departure leaves a key vacancy at the central bank—one Trump would be in a position to fill. Kugler, a Biden appointee and vocal supporter of rate stability, had sat out this week’s policy vote. Her resignation adds to the uncertainty at a time when institutional credibility is under assault from the top offices. Bitcoin in the Crosshairs of Political and Market Uncertainty Bitcoin’s steep drop reflects the market’s flight from risk amid global uncertainty. It now trades 7% beneath its all-time high of $123,182, which was reached a few weeks ago. Analysts point to tightening futures premiums and decreased leveraged activity as signs of momentum that is fading. Against expectations that Bitcoin would serve as a haven during political conflict, the asset has instead followed tech stocks, contradicting the safe-haven narrative. Investors are now shifting to short-term bonds and cash positions. Gold has also held firm at around $3,350, but even it has not been able to offer much comfort. Dalio Reassesses Bitcoin Amid U.S. Debt Fears Amidst the turmoil, some long-term investors are giving Bitcoin’s prospects a second thought. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, now recommends allocating as much as 15% of portfolios to Bitcoin or gold as a hedge against inflation and debt. “The U.S. is beginning a debt doom loop,” Dalio warned, referring to a $12 trillion Treasury forecast. While cautious about Bitcoin’s volatility, he acknowledged its evolving character as a store-of-value asset. Conclusion Bitcoin’s fall below $115,000 is more than a matter of price volatility—it is an indicator of a broader investor flight driven by political uncertainty and economic doubt. As Trump reshapes the narrative on nuclear policy and economic rectitude, Bitcoin’s future trajectory will be determined not just by charts but by politics.",Blockchain|Bitcoin|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-08-03 19:05:00

According to the company's data, the price of BTC fell by 4% in a short period of time, from $118,920 to below $114,000. This move occurred immediately after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs. During the drop, over $195 million worth of long positions in futures were liquidated. At the same time, a total of 21,400 BTC belonging to short-term investors were transferred to exchanges at a loss. CryptoQuant noted that this behavior has been observed in similar price drops before. For example: July 15, 2025: 50,134 BTC moved to exchanges July 25, 2025: 39,105 BTC sent to exchanges Related News: A New Claim About Satoshi Nakamoto's Identity Has Been Made: Could It Be That He Has Been Right in Front of Us All Along? This move has brought Bitcoin to the edge of a critical on-chain support cluster, according to the firm's analysis. CryptoQuant noted that this level is defined as a “gap” below which there is weak liquidity and weak support. According to the analysis firm, the critical areas to watch for the BTC price are as follows: Onchain support: $111,600 Technical support (previous ATH): $112,000 Traders' Realized Price: $105,500 *This is not investment advice.

Arkham pointed out that the address that moved the $ETH already bought another $800M previously for SharpLink Gaming, with the latest transaction of $108.6M going to Galaxy Digital OTC. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve places SharpLink Gaming second on the list of companies with the largest $ETH reserves, with 438.2K tokens. Bitmine Immersion Tech occupies the first spot with 625K $ETH, while the third place belongs to The Ether Machine with 334.8K coins. According to the same data, 2.26% of the total $ETH supply is spread out between 63 strategic reserves, amounting to 2.73M coins with a value of $9.39B. Institutional Interest for $ETH is Going Up as Bitmine’s Tom Lee Predicts a $60,000 $ETH The data shows that public institutions show an increased interest in Ethereum, with some entities exhibiting aggressive buying strategies. The Ether Machine is one such case, after adding 15,000 $ETH to their treasury recently at an average price of $3,809.97 for a total investment of $56.9M. Moreover, the company also announced that they plan an additional $407M investment , which, if it goes through, would more than double Bitmine’s current $ETH reserves of 625K. As the company put it in their X post, this investment strategy isn’t about profit hunting: ‘We are just getting started. Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term – not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy.’ Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, also pointed out that Ethereum ETFs are experiencing a price surge , with massive inflows hitting the market. Ethereum’s ETF inflows are currently outperforming Bitcoin, up 13% to Bitcoin’s 8% loss over the past two months. This pro-ETH context, with Wall Street becoming increasingly more interested in the asset, drove Tom Lee, chairman of Bitmine, to put $ETH’s Estimated Value Potential (EVP) at $60,000+ . He also thinks that the ETH/BTC ratio is off right now and that it’s likely to match 2024’s numbers soon, which would force $ETH up to $5,707 in the near future. With $ETH booming in charts and a bull run waiting to happen, ERC-20 projects like Best Wallet ($BEST) are likely to catch steam first. How $BEST Fuels One of the Best Non-Custodial Wallet Ecosystems $BEST is the official token of the Best Wallet ecosystem, a non-custodial, KYC-free service that’s perfect for novice and experienced traders alike. Best Wallet’s non-custodial profile translates to higher security, as you control the private key and, thus, the funds. The wallet also offers access to a variety of features, including the Token Launchpad, which grants exclusive access to upcoming tokens, allowing you to invest early. The Market Insights feature is another useful addition, feeding you real-time updates on hot projects, market sentiment, and chart trends. This allows you to make more informed decisions before investing. $BEST is currently in presale with over $14.4M already in the bank. This makes $BEST one of the most successful presales of 2025 and one that sets Best Wallet on the road to success. Based on Best Wallet’s features, public appeal, top security, and the fact that it’s free to use, we expect $BEST to experience a chart boom post launch. $BEST’s growth will further feed the Best Wallet ecosystem, pushing it closer to its underlying goal: to capture over 40% of the crypto wallet market share by 2026 . You can buy $BEST at its presale price of $0.025425 by visiting the official presale page. Will We See Another $ETH ATH in 2025? Given the rising investor interest in $ETH, we may see another Ethereum rally soon, pushing the asset to the psychological threshold of $4,000. We may not get Tom Lee’s $60K Ethereum in 2025, but a goal of $5,700 isn’t impossible, once $ETH clears the $4,000 resistance point. When that happens, projects like Best Wallet ($BEST) will be among the first to see the benefits. This isn’t financial advice.

The community sentiment is also pushing into the bear zone as the Fear and Greed Index retreats to neutral. Despite the looming trend, one Bitfinex whale decided this is the right time to invest and started gobbling up Bitcoins at a rate of 300 per day. Blockstream CEO, Adam Back, is the one who pointed it out , while also reminding the community that the same whale was acquiring $BTC at a rate of 1,000 per day back in February. This type of investment in a crypto market has ‘buy the dip’ written all over it, in preparation of an even bigger bull. The Market Goes Down as Eric Trump Pushes ‘Buy the Dip’ Message Eric Trump joins the ‘buy the dip’ crowd by sending the message loud and clear on X . Eric posted the message just as Bitcoin was sinking to $112,724, displaying his undying confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to bounce back. This was expected, given that Eric Trump’s Bitcoin stake is about to get $367M fatter. This would be the direct result of the merger between American Bitcoin Corp. and Gryphon Digital Mining, which would give Eric Trump access to over 367M shares, each valued at $1. The deal is set to undergo stockholder approval on August 27, 2025, and 10 AM ET. The merger, announced on July 29 , would make Eric Trump one of the wealthiest individuals in the crypto sphere, which would rush in a new era for Bitcoin and, by extension, the entire crypto market. But why is the crypto market backpedalling? The most obvious reason is Trump’s tariff suspension ending on Friday , which puts pressure on the global economic system once more. On the bright side, the trade agreement saw tariffs go down for US’s trading partners, especially for countries like the UK, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the EU. Despite that, the feeling of economic uncertainty and turmoil lingers, which, ultimately, benefits the crypto market. This means that we should expect a crypto resurgence once Bitcoin bounces back, at which point projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) will become top gainers thanks to their blockchain utility. Why Snorter Token ($SNORT) is Perfect for Opportunistic Investors Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the perfect ecosystem for opportunistic investors thanks to Snorter Bot, the trader’s best sniper friend. Snorter Bot is the ideal solution to manual coin hunting, which is typically ineffective and exposes you to scams like honeypots and rug pulls. The Bot circumvents these problems by: Instituting real-time alerts to protect against suspicious projects Sniping hot tokens in milliseconds after liquidity appears; so, no lost opportunity Operating in its Telegram chat-only, eliminating the need for multiple wallets, plug-ins, and browser extensions The Copy Trading perk is also great for replicating proven strategies to increase your chance of success. All these advantages recommend Snorter Token ($SNORT) as the best choice for opportunistic traders who lack the time or know-how to engage with the market actively. With Snorter Token, you just tailor the Aardvark Bot according to your needs, give it the sniper rifle, and set it loose. $SNORT is still in presale now with a cash pool of $2.7M and growing and a token price of $0.1001. So, if you want to join the project, you should do it while $SNORT is still at its presale price. Given the project’s utility and following post-launch mainstream adoption, $SNORT could experience a massive chart boost in 2025. You can buy your $SNORT by going to the presale page today. When Will the Crypto Market Recover? With Bitcoin already back above the $114K threshold and a 24-hour growth rate of 0.55%, it’s safe to say that the market is already pushing back. While it’s too early to say whether this is a small bump or the sign of a sustained climb, one thing is certain: Bitcoin will bounce back. And when it does, we should expect a new ATH, following July’s $123,153.22, which will drag the entire market along for the ride. That’s when utility-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) could also see an investor surge. This isn’t financial advice.

In a new video update on YouTube, Gromen says investors are currently reacting to a large-scale financial bubble that has been “kicked upstairs” through the stock, banking, and housing markets before finally being pushed into the Treasury market. Gromen notes that the only way for the US government to maintain the bubble – rather than face a default or a severe depression to get its fiscal situation back in order – is to devalue its debt via inflation. Now that such a reality is becoming clear to market participants, Gromen says it makes perfect sense that many corporate entities are creating shareholder value by taking advantage of BTC’s strict supply cap. “In my opinion, it’s critical to remember how we got here. We had an equity bubble, it popped, we kicked the problem upstairs to the banking sector and the housing sector, it created a housing bubble, it popped, we kicked the problem upstairs to the Treasury market by backstopping virtually everything… Now the credit risk is at the Treasury market level, except, Treasuries have no credit risk. The government can always just print the money to make interest payments and avoid default. So there’s no credit risk in Treasuries, only inflation risk. So in my opinion, what we’re seeing in Bitcoin treasury companies in particular is logical, in light of this primrose path we’ve followed over the past 25 years. As more and more people begin to realize the only way out of this is severe devaluation of US debt, of US sovereign debt, of Western sovereign debt. In that case, I would expect credit spreads to remain relatively low, because all else equal, I’d rather own an Apple bond or a Microsoft bond than a US Treasury bond.” At time of writing, the US government’s national debt is about $37 trillion.

That’s why all eyes are now on the meme coin sector, where legacy players like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are starting to show signs of exhaustion. SHIB, despite its iconic run, has stalled in recent weeks, leaving some holders to explore fresher, lower-cap alternatives. These moves often happen before the crowd notices, and this time, one particular token is drawing that attention. Analysts now predict a potential 27x return from MAGACOIN FINANCE if current adoption patterns hold. Why SHIB Momentum May Be Peaking After peaking in early 2021, SHIB’s community remained one of the strongest in crypto. But in 2025, price action has been relatively flat. As market-wide liquidity picks up, especially in the meme sector, investors are beginning to rotate funds from older assets into tokens that have yet to experience exponential gains . Blockchain data already shows capital migration toward emerging tokens with meme power, tight supply curves, and high virality. For SHIB holders seeking the next wave, the challenge lies in identifying early-stage projects before listings drive prices up . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Quiet Giant Before the Roar One such project now gaining momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With politically charged branding, a fast-expanding online community, and explosive early-stage engagement, it’s emerging as a major contender. According to recent projections, a 27x price explosion might be on the table if current trajectory and adoption patterns continue. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE unique is its combination of viral market appeal and early access scarcity. Market researchers now compare its adoption velocity to the early days of SHIB itself – a coin that also saw explosive early growth due to community intensity and narrative pull. MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently in a limited-access stage, and as new investors pile in, the window for strategic entry narrows with each passing day. Analysts and early traders are calling this moment one of the final chances to participate before it hits broader exchanges. Conclusion As the meme coin cycle enters a new phase, projects with strong branding and active communities are dominating social charts. While SHIB’s role in the meme ecosystem remains foundational, capital tends to flow toward asymmetrical opportunities. That dynamic shift is now favoring tokens still in their early momentum phase. Meme coin cycles reward timing. SHIB had its moment, but new tokens are attracting both retail attention and analyst optimism. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 27x upside now circulating among researchers and trading desks, many believe it may be the next to explode. Whether it surpasses SHIB remains to be seen—but the clock for early access is ticking .

According to analysis by Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential recently flashed a sell signal on the three-day chart, prompting a notable price pullback below the $3 mark, he noted in an X post on August 3. The warning signal came after XRP reached highs above $3.60, with the bearish cue suggesting that the latest rally could be running out of steam. The 9-count TD Sequential signal, known for predicting trend exhaustion, appeared just as XRP approached a resistance zone between $3.60 and $4. Since then, prices have been sliding steadily, and the token is now approaching a key short-term support level. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, on-chain data shows that past accumulation behavior points to $2.80 as a temporary buffer for XRP, but real support begins below $2.48. To this end, Martinez identified $2.40 as the critical zone to watch. If XRP continues to bleed lower, this level could act as a final line of defense for bulls to regroup. A failure to hold above $2.40 may open the door for deeper losses, possibly revisiting the $2.00 region. XRP URPD price chart.

Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA at $1.875269 reflects a long-term upward trend.

This follows on-chain sleuth ZachXBT’s calls for stricter penalties against SIM swapping and social engineering fraudsters. Suspect’s Sentence ZachXBT revealed via a July 29 X post that Cameron Redman had been convicted and ordered to pay compensation following his involvement in a $37 million Bitcoin theft and a related X hacking case that the investigator had uncovered. Court documents show that Redman has been sentenced to 12 months and 1 day, followed by a three-year supervised release term for each count, with all sentences to be served concurrently. He has also been ordered to pay a $400 special assessment, $248,257.07 in restitution, and a $60,000 fine. On February 22, 2020, the Canadian teenager used a SIM swap attack to take control of crypto investor Josh Jones’s mobile number, allowing him to bypass two-factor authentication and access his wallets. He then stole 1,547 BTC and 60,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), valued at around $37 million at the time. Following the theft, Redman began laundering the stolen assets through hundreds of small transactions. These tokens were eventually funneled through centralized exchanges in an attempt to hide the trail. The perpetrator was later linked to phishing scams and the hacking of several NFT profiles on X. According to ZachXBT, in June 2022, Redman offered access to an internal X panel for sale on the platform SWAPD. This was then sold for 250 ETH and led to the compromise of over 10 accounts and the theft of millions through phishing scams. The detective added that the Canadian youth initially used fake identity documents on SWAPD before submitting his real information, withdrew the sale proceeds through Tornado Cash, and then deposited the funds into a Stake account. On-chain data linked the wallet he used to the compromised X accounts. The investigation identified victims, including Beeple, DeeKay, Zeneca, Nouns DAO, and JRNY Club. Calls for Tougher Rules The suspect was formally charged on November 17, 2021, by Hamilton Police in Ontario. Authorities recovered $5.4 million in crypto, but the remaining $31.5 million is still missing. At the time of his arrest, Redman was still legally underage, which meant his name remained sealed and his photo was not released. ZachXBT has previously highlighted how this kind of secrecy is part of the problem, saying the convicted criminal’s identity should have been revealed earlier on to prevent further unlawful conduct. Such cases are on the rise, with research from Keepnet Labs showing a 1,055% increase in SIM swap incidents in the UK in 2024. Elliptic’s State of Crypto Scams 2025 analysis also highlighted phishing as a key method used by cybercriminals like North Korea’s Lazarus, with attackers increasingly automating campaigns using AI tools. Meanwhile, ZachXBT previously reported that between November and December last year, a single hacker breached over 15 X accounts, stealing more than $500,000.

This $47 million purchase of crypto-related stocks came on Friday, August 1, following the dip in the US equities market due to weak economic data and newly adjusted tariff policies. Ark Invest Renews Interest In Coinbase Stock With $30-M Purchase According to the firm’s latest trading disclosure , Ark Invest added a total of 94,678 shares (worth about $29.8 million) of Coinbase (COIN) across three of its funds, including the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). Interestingly, Cathie Wood-led asset manager seized the opportunity to “buy the dip” after the price of Coinbase’s stock fell by more than 16% on Friday. The price of COIN closed at $314.69 on the day, representing one of the stock’s worst single-day performances ever. Moreover, this strategic acquisition looks like a complete reversal of Ark Invest’s recent trend of dumping the Coinbase stocks. On Monday, July 28, ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) sold 18,204 shares of COIN (equivalent to about $7 million based on the day’s closing price of $379.49). Ark Invest also increased its holdings of BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), acquiring 540,712 shares (worth about $17 million) across the aforementioned three funds on the same day. This purchase came on the back of BMNR’s price decline of over 8% to close at $31.68. However, unlike Coinbase’s stock, Ark Invest has been steadily adding BitMine’s shares to its portfolio over the past few weeks. On Monday, the asset management firm bought more than $20 million worth of BNMR shares across the ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF funds. More notably, Ark Invest increased its position in the BitMine company through an estimated $182 million stock purchase in the previous week. This increased interest from Ark Invest comes amidst BitMine’s strong rotation into Ether, becoming the largest ETH treasury firm with 625,000 tokens in holdings. COIN Price Overview As of the close of trading hours on Friday, the price of Coinbase stock stood at around $314.69, reflecting a 16.7% decline on the day. While the past week’s performance (almost a 20% drop) might have put a dampener on the mood of investors, it is worth noting that the COIN price is up by more than 50% in the past 3 months. The positive performance of the Coinbase stock can be associated with the improving climate of the crypto market. Meanwhile, the COIN stock is up by 22% so far this year.",Crypto News|ARK Invest|Bitminer|BMNR|coin|coinbase,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC|LINK,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-03 20:00:28

The chart features candlestick data extending into mid-2025 and shows that XRP recently climbed to a high above the $3.50 level before a small retracement. Red arrows are marked at prior points of price peaks, suggesting a repeated pattern where these signals coincided with market pullbacks. The chart also shows that the recent upswing in XRP followed a period of sideways price consolidation, culminating in a large green candlestick that propelled the token past the $3 mark. The pattern appears consistent with previous movements where price rallies were accompanied by elevated stochastic relative strength index readings. Should we ignore this #XRP sell signal? pic.twitter.com/qBXPbBGWfo — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 2, 2025 Stochastic RSI Readings and Interpretation In the lower panel of the chart, the stochastic RSI is plotted with two lines colored blue and orange, displaying current readings of approximately 77.65 and 85.77. Historically, each red arrow was placed when the stochastic RSI reached or exceeded similar levels, which often preceded corrective price activity. The analyst appears to be emphasizing that the current stochastic RSI is again in the higher range. While the stochastic RSI can be an indicator of overbought conditions, it is not definitive evidence of an imminent reversal without considering broader market context and price structure. The attached commentary suggests that the analyst is urging caution among traders who rely on technical signals for short-term positioning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses to the Observation Several users on platform X provided their perspectives on the analysis. An account named X Finance Bull commented , stating that momentum looks stretched but that structural factors are more important to their strategy. This response indicates a preference for prioritizing longer-term support and resistance zones over momentum oscillators alone. Another user, MJS, contributed a perspective suggesting that different investors interpret these signals based on their objectives. MJS noted that if individuals are involved with XRP due to expectations about its role in the future financial system, they should maintain a longer time horizon and not react impulsively to individual technical readings. The statement closed with a remark implying that not all market participants will endure volatility successfully. Considerations for Traders and Investors The chart and commentary illustrate an ongoing debate between technical trading disciplines and broader investment theses. While the stochastic RSI is elevated, suggesting a possible overextension in short-term momentum, other considerations such as overall market structure, adoption trends, and sentiment toward XRP’s long-term utility may influence decisions. The historical examples marked on the chart show that similar stochastic RSI conditions coincided with price pullbacks. However, whether this pattern will repeat depends on factors including liquidity conditions, macroeconomic trends, and developments specific to XRP’s ecosystem. As with any trading decision, participants are encouraged to consider multiple timeframes and to remain aware of the inherent risks in digital asset markets.

According to Adler, external risks such as weak employment data and rising trade tariffs have reduced risk appetite in markets, leading to sharp corrections in Bitcoin. According to Adler's analysis, weak nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data released in the US, the Fed's fifth consecutive interest rate cut, and a wave of new tariffs have driven investors to safe havens. Stocks have sold off during this period, and Bitcoin's price has fallen from $119,000 to $112,000. Bitcoin's 30-day momentum has fallen from 8.6% to 3%. Despite increasing short-term market pressure, Adler notes that major companies, particularly Coinbase, Tether, and institutional strategy funds, have made approximately 30,000 BTC worth of new purchases. Coin outflows from exchanges also continue. Related News: Bitcoin Miners' Profit Margin Reaches Highest Level in Recent Times - What Does This Mean? According to Adler, the $119,000 level remains a key resistance level, while the $112,000 level is currently a critical support area. A break above this level could lead to the price testing $110,000, while $108,000 acts as psychological support. A decline in 30-day momentum to 3% indicates a significant weakening of the uptrend, according to Adler. A rebound above 8–10% could indicate buyers are re-entering the market. The Maximum Loss price, which is the level at which the highest loss will occur in the Bitcoin options market, is at $118,000 for the expiration date of August 8, 2025. The sharp decline in option selling volume at levels above $110,000 suggests that bearish positions are weakening, according to Adler. Adler also outlined bull and bear scenarios for the BTC price: Bullish scenario: If the $118,000 level holds and call volume continues to increase, the price could test the $122,500–$125,000 range. A break above this level could bring targets of $130,000 and above to the forefront. Bearish scenario: If the $118,000 level is broken and the put option volume in the $112,500–$115,000 range exceeds $1 million, the price may pull back to the $110,000–$112,500 range. *This is not investment advice.
