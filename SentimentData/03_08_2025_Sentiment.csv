The move followed Anthropic’s finding that OpenAI had violated its terms by accessing Anthropic’s tools in prohibited ways. Christopher Nulty, a spokesperson for Anthropic, said in a statement to WIRED , “Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5. Unfortunately, this is a direct violation of our terms of service.” Under Anthropic’s commercial terms, customers may not develop another product or service, create their own AI models using Anthropic’s platform, or attempt to dissect or replicate its technology . This adjustment to Claude availability coincides with OpenAI’s internal preparations for GPT-5 , the forthcoming model touted for enhanced coding capabilities. OpenAI allegedly used custom APIs for Claude access According to insiders, OpenAI integrated Claude into its proprietary toolchain via custom APIs rather than the usual chat portal. This arrangement enabled OpenAI to assess Claude’s performance on programming and writing tasks, and to evaluate its responses to safety-related queries regarding areas such as CSAM, self-harm, and defamatory content. The findings were then used to compare Claude against OpenAI’s in-house models and to fine-tune OpenAI’s systems accordingly. In response, OpenAI’s chief communications officer, Hannah Wong, said “It’s industry standard to evaluate other AI systems to benchmark progress and improve safety. While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.” Nulty also mentioned that granting API access for purposes like benchmarking and safety reviews remains part of standard industry practice. The company has not clarified how the current restriction on Claude access might affect OpenAI’s ongoing evaluations. API restrictions have long been wielded as leverage in the tech sector. For instance, Facebook previously cut off Vine (owned by Twitter), and more recently, Salesforce imposed constraints on rival Slack integrations. Anthropic enacted a comparable measure against the AI code startup Windsurf amid speculation of an OpenAI takeover, but the deal never happened. Anthropic’s chief science officer, Jared Kaplan, told TechCrunch, “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.” Anthropic to enforce weekly usage caps on Claude code Anthropic recently revealed plans to introduce weekly caps on Claude Code to reduce continuous background consumption by users. The company said in an email and on X that the new limits will start on August 28. These restrictions will affect users on the $20 Pro tier as well as those on the $100 and $200 Max tiers. Existing five-hourly usage quotas will remain unchanged. Moreover, the update includes two separate weekly quotas: a general usage cap and a model-specific allowance for Claude Opus 4. Max-tier subscribers will have the option to purchase additional capacity at Anthropic’s standard API pricing once they exceed the weekly thresholds. This adjustment builds on a subdued deployment of usage ceilings for Claude Code implemented earlier this summer. Claude Code is popular with developers, but Anthropic has had trouble keeping up with demand. Its service had seven major or partial outages last month, likely caused by heavy use from a small group of users. Get seen where it counts.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|VET|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 22:55:00

One of the strongest new entrants is Remittix (RTX) — a new crypto project committed to solving the cross-border payment problem at scale, and it’s building quietly before launching its wallet later in Q3. With its easy-to-use crypto-to-fiat capabilities, Remittix is causing a splash among investors as a legitimate PayFi contender — one that jumps past speculation hype to offer actual-world adoption. TRON remains steadfast, but Remittix picks up pace in utility-based adoption TRON (TRX) currently is priced at $0.3256, with a minor drop of 0.5%. Its market capitalization is around $30.81 Billion, whereas its daily trading volume has increased by over 47.52% to $1.58 Billion. With some experts’ opinion, TRX is likely to attempt to move towards the level of $0.50 — especially given its strong Layer 1 base and development ecosystem. Yet, a new generation of PayFi cryptos is in the making, which promises not only transaction speed, but also utility — and that is where Remittix excels. Contrasted to a lot of DeFi, which is aimed towards speculation or staking-only models, Remittix is building an actual product: end-to-end crypto-to-bank transfer infrastructure supporting over 40 various cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. You can send BTC, ETH, XRP, and more directly to country-located bank accounts in 30+ countries. Add on live FX conversion, and you have a usable solution to one of crypto’s longest-running problems — cheap remittance. Remittix presale figures and wallet release fuel expansion Remittix (RTX) tokens are valued at $0.0895 as its live presale. The project has raised over $17.9 Million, with more than 578 Million tokens sold to preliminary backers. There is still a 50% token bonus active for a limited period, providing significant potential upside for early adopters. The latest news? The forthcoming Q3 2025 beta wallet release, which will bring retail users and businesses low gas fees, fast on-chain processing, and a clean, intuitive interface. The wallet will also offer support for cryptocurrency staking and API integration for cross-border application. Remitix key highlights: $17.9Million+ presale amount raised with 578Million+ tokens sold $0.0895 token price currently with 50% bonus ongoing Beta wallet in Q3 2025 with minimal fees and rapid transfers 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies supported for worldwide use Built with actual utility, not speculation Remittix is gaining pace for all the correct reasons — and causing some conventional players concern. TRX faces new threat from use-case driven crypto TRON remains a highly viable blockchain project with enormous market cap and a good Layer 1 solution. But the new world of DeFi and crypto payments is now appreciating utility over mere infrastructure — and Remittix is the personification of that next generation. With a wallet release in the works and a presale closing in on the $18 Million soft cap, Remittix is shaping up to be one of the top crypto presale 2025 contenders. If TRON is the past and present of speedy DeFi rails, Remittix may be the future of international crypto remittances.

Focused on transforming subscription payments through blockchain, SUBBD is gaining early traction for its unique pitch. But bold ideas are only half the equation. On the other side, BlockDAG is turning heads for a different reason, it’s delivering. Instead of riding on speculation, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing live results, real tech, and active users. With its GLOBAL LAUNCH release fast approaching and key features already in play, the contrast between vision and execution has never been clearer. While SUBBD builds toward its goals, BlockDAG is already building with them. In a market that often rewards action over ambition, the difference matters. SUBBD Token: A Promising Pitch Still Waiting on Delivery SUBBD’s presale is starting to make waves as its model for subscription payments taps into a sector ready for disruption. Its strategy revolves around giving users and businesses more control, cutting out intermediaries, and using smart contracts to manage subscriptions. Market watchers are speculating on the SUBBD token’s price trajectory, encouraged by the platform’s ambitious narrative. Still, the project sits at an early stage. There’s a whitepaper, projections, and conceptual groundwork, but no listings yet. SUBBD is clearly leaning on future potential rather than current results. It’s a presale aimed at those open to risk in exchange for possible high upside, and that balance is attracting attention. For many, the pitch is enough to stay interested. But turning interest into adoption means proving functionality, not just outlining it. Until SUBBD moves from roadmap to real-world use, its pricing remains speculative. The coming months will be key to show if the project can build beyond promise. BlockDAG Powers Forward with Beat Vesting and August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH Release While some projects are still polishing their whitepapers, BlockDAG is already building in public. Its popular BEAT VESTING PASS has made a return, giving buyers until August 4 to access full liquidity at launch, an edge that sets it apart in today’s presale climate. With $359 million raised and 24.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG isn’t just ahead, it’s dominating. The tech is real. Demos for both the X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware are live, giving users firsthand experience with the platform’s mining setup. These tools make entry easy, combining simplicity with function through a one-tap mining model. The X1 App already has 2.5 million users mining from their phones, proving there’s real traction behind the numbers. What separates BlockDAG further is the transparency baked into its rollout. The smart contract-powered vesting, ongoing user growth, and planned exchange listings add up to a well-rounded launch strategy. And it all leads to one moment: the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. This isn’t just about raising funds. BlockDAG is showing how to deliver tech and access together. It’s not a presale that asks for patience, it’s one offering visibility, liquidity, and working features right now. SUBBD and BlockDAG: Execution Makes All the Difference SUBBD may have a vision, but BlockDAG has proof. While the SUBBD token price discussion continues in speculative circles, the project still needs to hit basic milestones before it’s taken seriously. It’s early, and that’s not a criticism, but early means unproven. In contrast, BlockDAG has already hit critical benchmarks. The BEAT VESTING PASS runs through August 4, followed by a GLOBAL LAUNCH release just a week later. The platform isn’t waiting for attention, it’s earning it through product rollouts and high engagement numbers. Demo access, live miners, and an expanding user base all build BlockDAG’s case. For SUBBD, the journey is just beginning. It still needs to prove product readiness, secure listings, and deliver real-world utility. Those are big steps. The takeaway is clear. If SUBBD delivers, it may join the list of successful disruptors. But right now, BlockDAG is already functioning like one. For those focused on certainty and launch-readiness, the difference between these projects is more than timing, it’s substance. Why BlockDAG’s Final Presale Window Shouldn’t Be Missed In crypto, waiting often means missing. SUBBD might rise in the future, and the SUBBD token price could reflect that if execution aligns with vision. But BlockDAG is in its moment now. The BEAT VESTING PASS is back until August 4, offering immediate liquidity. The coin is priced at $0.0016, with a confirmed launch value of $0.05, giving a potential 3,025% return for current participants. That kind of upside, paired with functional products, is rare in presale territory. With 24.6 billion coins sold and the final launch set for August 11, BlockDAG is closing in on full-scale release. It’s not just another project, it’s one delivering across the board.

Alongside this, Dogwifhat shows signs of potentially mirroring this upward trend. This article delves into whether these coins are set for notable growth, providing an insightful analysis for those looking to capitalize on the next big move in the crypto market. Dogecoin's Price Trends and Market Dynamics Dogecoin saw a 19.41% rise in value over the past month, but the coin also faced a significant weekly decrease of 14.53%, indicating notable market volatility. In the last six months, Dogecoin suffered a 24.14% decline, showcasing a struggling trend. The recent monthly increase hints at moments of bullish activity, yet the prevailing downward trend over a half-year calls for caution among traders. Currently, Dogecoin trades between $0.15 and $0.28, with immediate support at $0.09 and resistance at $0.35. A secondary resistance level exists at $0.48. Key indicators show an RSI of 43.25, suggesting the coin is not in overbought territory. The Awesome Oscillator sits at 0.006, while the momentum indicator is at -0.036, which indicates uncertainty. There is no clear trend, leading traders to consider short-term strategies, aiming for breakouts above $0.35 or testing support at $0.09 for potential bearish trades. Upward Potential Amid Uncertainty in Dogwifhat WIF price movement over the last month and six months displays modest downward pressure, with a one-month change of -1.96% and a half-year decline of -5.82%. The coin experienced a notable short-term dip with a one-week decrease of -16.63%, yet its trading range remained between $0.6878 and $1.2326 during recent sessions. Trading activity has been constrained within these bounds, hinting at subdued investor enthusiasm. Price oscillation within this range reflects market hesitation and cautious sentiment, revealing a market seeking directional clarity while digesting broader economic and crypto-specific factors. Current price action revolves around a trading band with a support level at $0.4613 and resistance near $1.55, with a second resistance identified around $2.0957. Indicators suggest slight bearish dominance, highlighted by a negative momentum indicator at -0.2681 and a below-neutral relative strength index of 41.943. Oscillators show a partial positive signal, but the moving average recommendation of -0.6666 indicates sellers dominate in the midterm. Trading strategies could focus on accumulating near the support level while monitoring for a breakout above $1.55 as a sign of resumed bullish drive, although caution remains important given the lack of a clear trend. Conclusion DOGE is positioned to rise from its key support level. Its movement can create positive momentum for WIF . Similar patterns in both coins suggest potential growth. Investors should watch for any significant breakout. This could offer opportunities in the market. Further monitoring of these trends is advisable.

Not just buying low and selling high, but entering before the wave begins. From Bitcoin’s earliest days at under $1 to Ethereum’s quiet beginnings at $0.30, the biggest winners were not those with the most capital—but those with the most foresight. Fast forward to 2025, and the opportunity hasn’t disappeared. If anything, it’s evolved. Now, smart investors are hunting for tokens that offer asymmetric upside—projects with strong narratives, emerging communities, and clear signals of momentum before mainstream exposure kicks in. This approach is what turns $500 into $50,000, and helps level the playing field between retail traders and institutions. Today’s profit strategies go beyond holding Bitcoin or earning yield through DeFi. While those approaches offer stability, the fastest gains still come from early entry into under-the-radar altcoins —especially those with viral branding, limited access windows, and traction that mirrors early crypto giants. But identifying the right project requires more than hype. With tools like on-chain analysis, Telegram activity trackers, and social volume aggregators, today’s investor has sharper insight than ever before into what’s building beneath the surface. Why Early-Stage Tokens Still Offer the Best ROI Most projects don’t go 100x. But those that do usually share a few common traits—and they all rewarded those who recognized the patterns early. In recent months, one particular token has been making waves for just that reason. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention across platforms like X and Telegram not simply for its meme appeal, but for the velocity of its adoption. Crypto research groups tracking social metrics say its early trajectory mirrors the rise of Ethereum Classic, two tokens that generated major returns for initial adopters. But unlike older assets that are now deep into their market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early growth curve . The project’s viral branding, combined with a limited-access phase, has created a rush among early participants. Every round has seen rapid sellouts, and the project’s social growth has already rivaled meme giants like Dogecoin in their infancy. Analysts now forecast that its current pricing window may be one of the last remaining chances for sharp asymmetric entry before broader exchange access resets the opportunity. How to Spot High-Upside Tokens Before the Crowd Spotting altcoins before they explode isn’t about luck—it’s about pattern recognition. Historically, the biggest crypto winners showed early signs long before their names hit mainstream headlines. These included subtle metrics like surging social media growth, increasing wallet holders, and high engagement rates on social channels like X and Telegram . They also tended to feature emotionally resonant branding, whether political, cultural, or comedic—something that hooks communities and sustains hype across weeks or months. Another key factor? Scarcity of access. The earliest-stage tokens that go on to make 10x–100x moves are often available only for a limited time through exclusive, time-sensitive windows. Once listed on major exchanges, these assets usually price in their potential, leaving little room for exponential gains . The most strategic investors understand this—they track momentum, measure community velocity, and look for entry points when the crowd is still on the sidelines. Final Thoughts: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Act Early The best way to make money in crypto has always been clear— get in before everyone else realizes what’s happening . Whether it’s through identifying social trends, spotting wallet inflows, or analyzing price structure before breakout, timing and conviction are the real tools of the trade. In today’s cycle, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum precisely because they offer that rare mix: powerful community traction, viral positioning, and limited access. And as history has shown, when these elements align, the results can be game-changing .

Considering the supposed significance of this price mark, there have been questions about how much headroom the price of Bitcoin still has. The latest on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin bull run might not be over just yet. BTC Long-Term Holders Start Distributing In an August 1st post on X, crypto analyst Joao Wedson reported that the Bitcoin cycle for the long-term holders seems to be coming to an end. Related Reading: Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Just Turned Red For The First Time Since May — What This Means Wedson emphasized that, regardless of the ongoing excitement around ETFs, on-chain data shows a clear market shift. This shift signals that the cryptocurrency’s long-term holders are beginning to sell their coins, and, in large volumes, too. According to the analyst, about 50% of the amount of Bitcoin held in exchange-traded funds has been sold by the LTHs. Regardless of this situation, however, Wedson expects the BTC bull market to go on for “at least 2 more months” and the altcoins’ bull cycle for three months. Key Metrics Flash Warnings – But ‘Final Top’ Not Yet Seen Wedson backed his claim with four on-chain indicators, starting with the Coin Days Destroyed Terminal Adjusted Metric, which shows aged coins moving after being dormant for a long period of time. The analyst explained that there has been a significant movement of old BTC over the past two years. This, Wedson emphasized, triggered three major warning signs that coincide with a local top. Wedson also referenced the Reserve Risk Indicators to gauge current LTH conviction. This metric, from analysis, has entered a warning zone, as there is increased selling activity and hand exchanges. Next, the online pundit quoted results from the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal. The SOPR measures whether coins (in this case, Bitcoin) are moved at a profit or loss. Wedson pointed out that this indicator recently flashed a bearish signal, which implies increased profit-taking in the market. Referring to it as ‘the most accurate metric in the world’ used to identify Bitcoin’s macro tops, the Bitcoin Cycle Market Top Prediction: Max Intersect SMA Model was put out last. Wedson highlighted that this metric is yet to flash any bearish signal. Using the chart below, the analyst explained that until the blue line reaches the $69,000 level, the final top is yet to arrive. Ultimately, the analyst preached caution against panicking, as historical cycle patterns suggest that the final market top has yet to arrive. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $113,052, reflecting a 1.2% price decline in the past 24 hours.

At the time, those coins were worth about $3.5 billion. Today, they’d fetch roughly $14.5 billion, making this the biggest crypto heist ever recorded. No one at LuBian, nor the group behind the intrusion, has publicly confirmed the breach. Blockchain investigator Arkham first revealed the scale of the loss. BREAKING: ARKHAM UNCOVERS $3.5B HEIST – THE LARGEST EVER LuBian was a Chinese mining pool with facilities in China & Iran. Based on analysis of on-chain data, it appears that 127,426 BTC was stolen from LuBian in December 2020, worth $3.5 billion at the time and now worth… pic.twitter.com/PnIOKgMt0i — Arkham (@arkham) August 2, 2025 In mid-2020, LuBian ranked among the top pools, handling nearly 6% of Bitcoin’s total computing power as of May. Its operations spanned China and Iran. On December 28, 2020, attackers emptied over 90 percent of LuBian’s holdings. The next day, roughly $6 million more which was split between Bitcoin and USDT, vanished from a Lubian address on the Omni protocol. By December 31, LuBian shunted its remaining balance into secured recovery wallets. Soon after, each hacker’s address received an embedded OP\_RETURN note, begging for the return of stolen funds. Sending those messages cost LuBian 1.4 BTC over 1,516 transactions, a sign the appeals likely came from the real pool operators and not a copycat looking to exploit compromised keys. Security analysis points to a flaw in LuBian’s key-generation method. It seems their algorithm was weak against brute-force attacks, offering a gateway for the breach. Despite the attack, LuBian managed to keep 11,886 BTC, today worth about $1.35 billion, which remains untouched. The hacker has also left the stolen coins, except for moving them into one wallet in July 2024. Because Bitcoin’s price has climbed since 2020, the stolen coins now amount to $14.5 billion. On Arkham’s records, that stash places the culprit as the 13th-largest BTC holder, even ahead of the Mt. Gox hacker. For perspective, Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined over 22,000 blocks before disappearing in 2011. Those early rewards translate to more than one million BTC, all but a handful never spent, making Nakamoto a billionaire many times over. LuBian hack surpasses Bybit’s $1.5 billion theft LuBian’s loss shattered the previous record, set by Bybit in February 2025, when hackers stole $1.5 billion , according to Cryptopolitan. About $1.46 billion worth of mETH and stETH streamed out to four Ethereum addresses, with parts swapped immediately on decentralized marketplaces. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT spotted the suspicious outflow, and firm Cyvers flagged odd activity from the exchange’s wallets. Bybit had earlier confronted an unrelated “address poisoning” attack. Most of the stolen tokens were swapped for ETH on decentralized exchanges and then run through mixers to hide them. It was one of the first big exchange hacks of 2025. Bybit said the incident was a routine fund transfer between cold and hot wallets, but that hackers subverted the destination address. No internal breach of systems occurred, according to the company. Investigators had pinpointed five wallets involved in the attack. ZachXBT warned that all other exchanges and services should blacklist these addresses to prevent further losses.

As interest in XRP among institutional investors continues to grow, discussions around its long-term potential are intensifying. Several organizations, including Trident Digital, Webus, and VivoPower , have already announced plans to include XRP in their treasury holdings, suggesting growing confidence in the asset’s utility and future performance. Amid this increasing institutional activity, the question arises: What would happen if global retirement funds, which manage massive pools of capital, were to allocate even a modest 1% of their assets to XRP? The Magnitude of Global Pension Funds Estimates place the total value of retirement fund assets worldwide at roughly $50 trillion. These funds, comprising both private and public pensions, traditionally prioritize stable investments such as government bonds, equities, and real estate. However, the evolving investment landscape and rising recognition of digital assets have led to a reconsideration of cryptocurrency as a viable long-term allocation. A 1% investment from global retirement funds into XRP would amount to approximately $500 billion. This figure represents a substantial influx compared to XRP’s current market capitalization, and such a move could significantly reshape the token’s valuation. Price Implications Under a Linear Projection At present, XRP trades around $2.88 , with about 59.3 billion tokens in circulation. This puts its current market capitalization near $165 billion. If $500 billion were injected into XRP, and we assume a linear correlation between capital inflow and market capitalization growth, XRP’s market cap could rise to $665 billion. In that case, the projected price per token would increase to roughly $11.28. However, this straightforward estimation does not account for real-world market mechanics. In practice, large capital inflows often create disproportionately larger price movements due to liquidity gaps and investor reactions. In cryptocurrency markets, the multiplier effect refers to the amplification of price movements caused by limited liquidity and increased demand. When substantial buy pressure enters the market, it can cause prices to escalate rapidly, especially if sell orders are sparse at higher levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Applying a conservative multiplier of 1.5x to 3x on the linear estimate of $11.28, XRP’s price could realistically reach between $17 and $34 per token. This wide range reflects the volatility and reactive nature of crypto markets when faced with institutional-scale investments. Policy Shifts Supporting Crypto in Retirement Portfolios One major barrier to retirement funds adopting XRP has historically been regulatory caution. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance warning against crypto exposure in retirement plans due to risks related to volatility, storage, and speculation. However, by May 2025, the Department rescinded that guidance and adopted a neutral stance on crypto assets in retirement portfolios. This regulatory shift, alongside similar changes by agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the FDIC , has created a more accommodating environment for institutional crypto participation. A modest allocation of 1% from global retirement funds into XRP has the potential to significantly influence the asset’s price and standing within the broader financial ecosystem. Beyond price growth, such participation would represent a strong signal of legitimacy, potentially encouraging further adoption among both institutions and individual investors. As regulatory barriers continue to ease and the infrastructure around crypto investment matures, the likelihood of such developments appears increasingly plausible.

Altcoin interest is surging again, and one project in particular—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is beginning to draw serious attention from traders looking for stronger momentum plays. XRP Fails to Break Key Levels XRP has held steady around the $3 mark for weeks, showing resilience but little upside action. Even as large wallets continue to accumulate and network usage grows, the lack of a breakout is leaving short-term traders frustrated. While long-term prospects remain intact, there’s growing demand for tokens with faster growth potential and more immediate returns. Early Investors Are Targeting the Next Big Opportunity That appetite for action has triggered a rush toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new player that recently saw its presale round close faster than expected. Now entering its next funding wave, the project is generating FOMO across crypto channels. Analysts are pointing to a potential 5,000% return , noting that even a small investment could grow into a fortune. The hype isn’t just talk—community numbers are growing, and early backers are comparing this moment to the breakout phases of past meme coin legends. Traders Grow Restless as XRP Lacks Catalysts Back on the XRP front, hopes are still pinned on regulatory clarity and a potential ETF listing—but timelines are uncertain. Some are holding, but others are clearly moving funds into faster-developing projects. Despite its strong fundamentals, XRP isn’t delivering the action many traders are chasing right now, and attention is drifting. Conclusion XRP may still see its moment, but right now, capital is flowing to altcoins with stronger short-term upside. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid presale and 5,000% ROI prediction, it’s clear which way momentum is shifting. For investors who don’t want to miss the next breakout, early positioning is everything.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 23:55:00

49448197,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76613,1754179212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst Predicts $3,380 XRP Using This Model",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-3380-xrp-using-this-model/,"A recent valuation model presented by a prominent XRP analyst suggests that a holding of just 5,000 XRP could potentially be worth up to $16.9 million. The prediction is based on the assumption that the XRP Ledger will become a dominant infrastructure in global finance , handling volumes across various markets and institutions. High-Stakes Price Projection The forecast originates from an analyst known online as “Future XRP,” who shared his findings via a post that has gained traction within the XRP community. His valuation model estimates XRP’s future price at $3,380, a figure that would require an increase of more than 1,500 times its current market price of approximately $3.00. According to his projection, XRP’s existing network, with a circulating supply of around 60 billion tokens and a transaction velocity of 10, can already support an annual volume of about $1.3 trillion. However, if the XRP Ledger is adopted widely across financial sectors, he anticipates the annual transaction volume could grow substantially, potentially ranging between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion. Several developments have fueled speculation about XRP’s future utility. In recent public remarks, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed optimism about XRP capturing a significant portion of SWIFT’s transaction volume within the next five years, up to 14% according to his projection. At its current price of $2.20, 60 Billion in Circulating Supply, and an annual velocity of 10, $XRP can handle about $1.3 Trillion in annual flow on chain today. You're not ready for the rest of this post…Lock in… 1700 NDAs, at least 14% of Swift, Derivatives, FX Market,… — Future XRP (@the5blairs) June 28, 2025 Additionally, Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road in April 2025, a firm with connections to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), has intensified speculation. The DTCC processes more than $11 trillion daily, adding weight to the idea that XRP could play a role in high-value settlements. Future XRP argues that if the token maintains its supply and transaction velocity, it would need a price point in the $3,380 range to effectively facilitate such a massive flow of value. Potential Gains for XRP Holders In the scenario described, XRP holders could see extraordinary returns. A wallet holding 5,000 XRP would reach a value of $16.9 million. Other hypothetical cases include 1,000 XRP being valued at $3.38 million, and 50,000 XRP reaching $169 million. While the analyst emphasizes that these outcomes are tied to very specific market shifts, he presents them as theoretically possible under the right conditions. Not all observers agree with the methodology or conclusions of the model. Some critics argue that the estimated transaction velocity of 10 is too low compared to traditional financial systems like SWIFT , where turnover can reach up to 200 times annually. Under such conditions, XRP could potentially support the same financial throughput with a much lower price, possibly around $166. Others question whether XRP could dominate financial infrastructure on its own, considering competition from alternative networks such as Stellar, Ethereum-based stablecoins, and centralized financial solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 AI Commentary on the Projection To validate his assumptions, Future XRP asked the Grok 3 AI model to analyze the data. The AI provided a summary of the analyst’s reasoning and acknowledged the potential for XRP to become a key neutral settlement mechanism in a shifting global financial system. While Grok considered a $3,380 price to be an outlier scenario, it deemed a range between $200 and $1,000 plausible, particularly if the world transitions further away from dollar-denominated reserves. However, the AI also noted that extreme price targets would likely require significant global disruptions, such as a breakdown of fiat systems or a major realignment of global financial infrastructure. The projection that 5,000 XRP could be worth nearly $17 million is based on a model that assumes XRP becomes central to global finance. While intriguing, the prediction has generated mixed reactions. Supporters view it as a realistic long-term scenario tied to Ripple’s expansion efforts, while critics caution that the assumptions may not reflect how financial markets operate.

With Bitcoin continuing to dictate overall market direction, the analyst mentioned plans to monitor LTC’s intraday chart for a potential quick scalp opportunity. LTCBTC Shows Early Bullish Signs Despite Caution In his analysis, Cryptowzrd observed that both Litecoin (LTC) and LTCBTC closed the day with indecisive daily candles, reflecting market hesitation. Despite this uncertainty, LTCBTC managed to close slightly in the green, which could be an early sign of shifting momentum. However, the analyst stressed the need for stronger and more consistent daily candles from this level to confirm a sustainable move. Related Reading: Litecoin Sharp Pullback: Scalping Opportunities Emerge While LTCBTC Seeks Stability A critical resistance level to watch is 0.0010 BTC for LTCBTC. Cryptowzrd highlighted that a clean breakout above this barrier could trigger an impulsive rally, given the pair’s extremely oversold condition. Such a breakout would likely push Litecoin sharply higher, with $140 identified as the major upside target. On the support side, Litecoin’s key daily level sits at $96. Cryptowzrd cautioned that this support could be tested only if Bitcoin experiences a sharp drop towards the $110,000 region, driven by panic selling. In such a case, LTC would likely follow BTC’s lead and retrace to test lower support levels. Cryptowzrd highlighted that his attention will be on lower time frames in the near term, looking for short-term chart patterns to exploit quick trading opportunities. However, broader market sentiment, especially Bitcoin’s price action, will remain the dominant factor influencing Litecoin’s direction. Litecoin Intraday Volatility Limits Clear Setup Formation In his final remarks, Cryptowzrd noted that Litecoin’s intraday chart showed increased volatility throughout the day, making short-term trading conditions less favorable. He emphasized the need for a clearer and more structured chart formation before considering any immediate entries. Related Reading: Litecoin Is On Fire: $120–$125 Range In Bullish Crosshairs A key level to watch is the $114.50 intraday resistance. According to Cryptowzrd, a move above this level would be a bullish signal and could invite further buying pressure. Additionally, a breakout above the intraday lower high trendline would likely accelerate upward momentum, potentially setting the stage for a stronger rally. Despite these technical signals, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin’s price action remains the primary driving force in the market. As such, any decision to enter a trade will depend on the development of a mature and well-defined setup, ideally supported by Bitcoin’s broader trend. For now, patience is key while waiting for the right conditions to align.

XRP and Cardano (ADA) are once again making headlines, thanks to growing institutional momentum and network developments that could reignite major rallies. While many are focusing on established names, early movers are also quietly building positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE—a fast-rising project already breaking records in its presale phase. XRP Eyes Breakout on ETF Buzz XRP remains one of the most talked-about altcoins heading into the next market leg. Priced around $3.15, it still sits just below its all-time high of $3.84, and the hype surrounding a potential XRP ETF approval is only growing. A green light from regulators could send the token surging, especially with Ripple’s established connections in the global banking sector. Trading volumes remain strong, and whale accumulation hints at rising confidence from large investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Gains Speed In the middle of all this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum at an astonishing pace. Its latest presale round has already outperformed the last round’s numbers, signaling massive demand . Some experts are praising the project to be a game-changer for the crypto industry, forecasting their explosive price movements. With a high ROI projection, limited token access , and exchange listings on the horizon, it’s no surprise that strategic investors are racing to get in before the broader market catches on. ADA’s Hidden Strength and Airdrop Fuel Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is showing real potential for a breakout of its own. At just $0.78, it remains far from its all-time high of $3.10, giving it plenty of room to run. But what’s driving excitement now is the long-awaited Midnight airdrop, expected to be one of the largest in Cardano’s history. The distribution will benefit ADA holders—and even XRP holders, boosting cross-community engagement. This upcoming event could help trigger the momentum ADA lacked in previous cycles. Final Thoughts XRP’s ETF speculation, Midnight’s upcoming airdrop, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale performance are giving crypto investors several promising paths for potential gains . As demand accelerates and catalysts stack up, these three projects are worth watching closely.

BlockDAG’s Final Presale Surge Could Be Your Biggest Missed Opportunity,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-buy-right-now-blockdags-final-presale-surge-could-be-your-biggest-missed-opportunity/,"In the ever-shifting world of digital assets, identifying the top crypto to buy right now is no easy feat. From DeFi tokens to Layer 1 giants, the market is saturated with options, but few stand out with the same blend of fundamentals, community backing, and growth potential as BlockDAG. While popular tokens like Cosmos (ATOM), Polygon (MATIC/POL), and Cronos (CRO) each show flashes of momentum, BlockDAG’s final presale window is grabbing serious attention. It’s raised over $359 million, sold 24.3 billion coins, and is currently priced at just $0.0016, despite a confirmed listing price of $0.05. That creates a staggering 3,025% ROI opportunity. What’s more, BlockDAG isn’t a concept. It’s a functioning Layer 1 ecosystem with live miners, active developers, and a clearly mapped global launch. In this article, we’ll compare the current market movers and reveal why BlockDAG may be the top crypto to buy right now. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG is quickly emerging as the top crypto to buy right now, and its momentum is data-driven, not just hype. With more than $359 million raised and over 24.3 billion BDAG coins already sold, this Layer 1 project is nearing the end of one of the most successful presales in recent memory. Currently priced at just $0.0016, BDAG offers a rare 3,025% potential return based on its confirmed $0.05 listing price. But it’s not only the numbers that impress. BlockDAG has built a working ecosystem before launch, with over 2 million users mining daily via the X1 mobile app and 18,000 X10 hardware miners sold. A live testnet is already active, and over 4,500 developers are working on more than 300 dApps. Add in a GLOBAL LAUNCH release scheduled for August 11 and a limited-time NO VESTING PASS that gives buyers 100% of their tokens at launch, and it’s clear why traders are rushing in. This isn’t speculation, it’s strategic accumulation. With fundamentals already delivered and community traction accelerating, BlockDAG makes a strong case as the top crypto to buy right now. Cosmos (ATOM) Analysis Cosmos (ATOM) has struggled to maintain upward momentum recently, shedding nearly 6% over the past 24 hours. The token is hovering near $4.63, after being rejected at $4.87 and slipping below key short-term EMAs. The RSI currently sits around 31, signaling oversold conditions, but also caution. Unless ATOM can bounce convincingly from the $4.62–$4.65 support zone, the downside risk toward $4.46 remains in play. Technical setups show weakening conviction, and trading volumes have dried up across major exchanges. While long-term potential still exists, the current conditions place ATOM in a “wait and see” category for those seeking the top crypto to buy right now. Without a strong catalyst or visible ecosystem acceleration, short-term holders may want to stay cautious. Polygon (MATIC / POL) Analysis Polygon is currently priced at around $0.2166, having gained roughly 2.6% in the past 24 hours. Despite muted trading volume, technical indicators are painting a more optimistic picture. A double-bottom base around $0.40–$0.42 has held, and the token is now targeting a breakout toward $0.55–$0.60. A sustained move could push MATIC as high as $0.70. On-chain stablecoin activity has also surged, with USDC transfers up by 141%, hinting at growing utility and capital inflow. Polygon’s continued focus on Ethereum scaling, particularly with zkEVM rollouts, positions it well long-term. However, given the current price action and modest engagement levels, MATIC may not be the immediate top crypto to buy right now unless momentum picks up further. Cronos (CRO) Analysis Cronos (CRO) is enjoying a resurgence ahead of its POS Chain v6 upgrade, scheduled for July 28. The update includes improved IBC compatibility, new circuit breaker modules, and stronger interoperability, elements that enhance its long-term utility. In the past week, CRO has rallied about 12%, now trading near $0.137. Bullish patterns such as a Golden Cross and a bullish engulfing candle support the rally, alongside investor excitement over a possible 5% allocation in a proposed Trump Media ETF. Technical indicators suggest strength above $0.121 support, with near-term upside targeting $0.133 and beyond. While CRO has catalysts in motion, whether it becomes the top crypto to buy right now depends on how effectively it capitalizes on these upgrades and ETF narratives in the coming weeks. Conclusion In a market filled with short-term noise and speculative pops, identifying the top crypto to buy right now comes down to three pillars: real-world traction, strategic timing, and provable delivery. Cosmos and Polygon show technical promise, and Cronos is riding an upgrade wave, but none currently match the scale or clarity of execution seen in BlockDAG. With a fully operational testnet, millions of miners, over 4,500 developers building real dApps, and $359 million already raised, BlockDAG is not just preparing to launch; it’s accelerating toward it. The current presale price of $0.0016 offers a rare chance at 3,025% returns when the $0.05 listing hits later this year at launch. Add the limited-time NO VESTING PASS, and the window becomes even more urgent. For traders searching for the top crypto to buy right now, BlockDAG may be the standout candidate of the year.

Sometimes, it’s a viral tweet. Other times, it’s an irresistible narrative baked into a hilarious token name. But more often than not, it’s a combination of utility, hype, and raw community power. Meme coins have gone from jokes to market juggernauts, flipping expectations and turning small investments into life-changing bags. Arctic Pablo Coin , Banana for Scale, Pudgy Penguins, Cat in Dog’s World, Popcat, Bonk, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Memecoin, and Fartboy—these are the names driving the next crypto craze. From penguin NFTs to feline defiance, each one rides the meme energy of the internet with unique vibes. But among them, Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now, and here’s why. While many of these projects hinge on nostalgia, community memes, or animal cuteness, Arctic Pablo Coin fuses meme culture with robust tokenomics and competitive community rewards. It’s built not just to ride waves—but to cause them. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin: Turning Crypto Hype into Cold, Hard Returns What sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart isn’t just its name or meme worthiness—it’s the snowballing power of its ecosystem. One standout feature? The Community Competitions. Participants can compete in meme contests, viral challenges, and creative stunts—and get rewarded in either APC tokens or real USD. That’s not just engagement; that’s real incentive-driven momentum. How often does a meme coin pay its users for hype generation? Arctic Pablo Coin is more than a coin—it’s a movement. With an NFT-ready roadmap, transparent burns (over 11 billion APCs already vaporized), and a quirky yet strategic marketing campaign, Arctic Pablo is doing what Dogecoin once did—but smarter, faster, and with more explicit purpose. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now because it’s already building a culture of rewards and exclusivity before even listing. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Update: Cold Opportunity, Hot ROI Arctic Pablo Coin is now in Stage 34 (Chilly Citadel) of its explosive meme coin presale , priced at just $0.00062. With over $3.17 million raised, early buyers are eyeing a 1190.32% return to listing—and a staggering 16,029.03% ROI if it hits analysts’ $0.1 target. This window won’t stay open long. Those paying attention already know: Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now. The presale is roaring ahead, currently in Stage 34—aptly named Chilly Citadel . Early adopters have seen gains up to 4,033.33%. A $1,000 investment today fetches 1,612,900 APC tokens, which could be worth $12,903.20 when the listing hits $0.008—and even more if the predicted $0.1 target hits. This isn’t just a presale. It’s a ticking clock on one of 2025’s most exciting ROI windows. Miss this, and the only thing colder than Pablo’s ice is the regret. The clock is melting—act fast or stay frozen out. 2. Banana for Scale: Precision Meme Mechanics Meet Hilarious Utility Banana for Scale rides the absurdist meme era, where comparison measurements turned into running jokes. But behind the laughs is an ecosystem designed to scale in both user rewards and staking flexibility. The token integrates NFT utilities that allow holders to “measure” influence across partnered communities. Banana for Scale isn’t just humorous—it’s scalable by design. That’s what earns its spot among 2025’s standout meme coins. 3. Pudgy Penguins: From NFT Fame to Meme Coin Fame Once famous as an adorable NFT collection, Pudgy Penguins has now leapt into the meme coin space with the same cozy charisma. This token doubles as a cultural badge of crypto literacy and a direct gateway into an expanding metaverse. It maintains strong utility through community voting rights and in-world Penguin perks. Its evolution from NFT to coin is strategic—not accidental. That’s why it’s on this list. 4. Cat in Dog’s World: Rebel Energy in the Meme Market Cat in Dog’s World flips the canine-dominated meme space with pure rebel flair. In a space filled with Doges and Shibas, this token channels underdog—or undercat—energy. It’s got an aggressive token burn strategy and a strong staking model that rewards early adopters. The project’s branding is unapologetically sassy, giving it a unique edge that resonates with contrarian traders. That’s its purr-suasive advantage. 5. Popcat: Viral Speed, Feline Flex Remember that viral image of the cat rapidly chomping? That’s Popcat’s origin story, and it carries that chaotic meme energy into a real crypto token. Popcat leverages engagement contests that spike social volume—and its recent surge proves it’s more than a flash in the pan. With plans to integrate with meme NFT auctions, Popcat is turning taps into tokens. That agility earns it a place on the radar. 6. Bonk: Solana’s Barking Success Story Bonk was Solana’s first community token, and it barks loud for a reason. With lightning-fast transaction speeds and zero congestion, Bonk’s scalability is among the best in the meme coin world. It has become a darling of decentralized exchanges, and its recent partnerships within the Solana ecosystem only make it stronger. Bonk didn’t just bark its way into this list—it howled through the door. 7. Neiro: Meme Coin Meets AI Utility Neiro isn’t just riding the meme train; it’s combining meme culture with real-world AI utility. This token allows holders to stake for access to mini AI tools and services, making it both fun and functional. It’s targeting the productivity-meme crossover niche, a clever intersection that few others are exploring. Its dual purpose puts it ahead of the curve. 8. Dogwifhat: Whimsical Yet Wildly Effective What started as a hilarious meme turned into a cultural phenomenon. Dogwifhat is now gaining serious traction thanks to its low supply, loyal holders, and solid liquidity strategy. With meme vibes as strong as Shiba Inu but without the overinflated supply, Dogwifhat is proving that quirk can still conquer. It’s hats off to this quirky contender. 9. Memecoin: The OG Joke Turned Market Mainstay Memecoin embraces the very essence of meme investing—self-aware, deflationary, and hilariously meta. It’s designed to poke fun at crypto’s speculative nature while offering decent staking rewards and strong community incentives. Sometimes, the best way to survive a volatile market is to laugh your way through it. That’s why Memecoin remains a top pick. 10. Fartboy: Offensive, Ridiculous—and Profitable Fartboy is as crude as it sounds—but somehow, it works. What started as a toilet humor token now has its cult following, complete with themed games, NFT unlockables, and weekly “gas drop” events. It thrives on being outrageous, and that very outrageousness creates stickiness in an oversaturated market. That’s the gassy formula that earned it a spot. Final Verdict: Arctic Pablo Shines as the Best Meme Coin to Buy Now Based on the latest research, the best meme coins to buy now are: Arctic Pablo Coin, Banana for Scale, Pudgy Penguins, Cat in Dog’s World, Popcat, Bonk, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Memecoin, and Fartboy. But Arctic Pablo Coin stands at the summit—fueled by a deflationary supply, high-stakes competitions, and a ridiculously high ROI window. The timing is critical. With the current presale stage offering 1190.32% upside and analyst projections pushing that to 16,029.03%, this isn’t a casual opportunity. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now because it’s delivering on both community firepower and financial firepower. Blink—and that ROI could vanish like a snowflake on lava.

Currently priced at $0.00001288, the token has seen mixed reactions from traders, with some cautious over the decline – but others eyeing a bullish setup. That said, growing chatter in crypto circles suggests another project might be the next big narrative: MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising altcoin that is starting to attract serious capital during its presale phases. SHIB Bulls Maintain $0.000081 Target Despite the current downtrend, technical analysts remain optimistic. Prominent trader Javon Marks shared his updated chart projecting a 500%+ upside for SHIB if it breaks above key resistance. The target remains at $0.000081, with bullish patterns forming a structure similar to past breakout rallies. As past cycles show, SHIB has a history of sharp reversals when least expected—and this setup might be no different. New Challenger Enters the Arena While SHIB holds its place in the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building serious momentum behind the scenes. Its latest presale round is already outpacing the previous one, and investor demand shows no signs of slowing. Analysts expect fast traction and a more utility-driven ecosystem. Major returns are also expected, according to early projections based on presale metrics and anticipated listings. Strategic buyers are rushing in now, before the token becomes widely accessible. SHIB’s Technical Setup Signals Breakout Potential As for SHIB’s future, the current pattern suggests that once it clears its resistance, a steep run could follow. Marks’ chart highlights an “Accumulation-Bullish Zone” and prior reversal points that echo 2021’s run-up. If history repeats , SHIB could climb back into price discovery – fueled by whales re-entering and fresh retail enthusiasm. Conclusion: Shiba Inu still leads the memecoin space in market cap and recognition, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly closing in as a serious competitor. With analysts projecting breakout moves for both tokens, the smart money could be in riding the SHIB rebound—while also securing early exposure to MAGACOIN’s explosive presale momentum.

According to Bloomberg data, traders are nearly unanimous in predicting the cut, even as inflation recently clocked its fastest pace in 17 months. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) appears to be prioritizing recessionary risks over price pressures—unlike the US Federal Reserve, which left rates unchanged again this week. BOE weighs growth risks against inflation The BOE’s dovish stance comes on the back of two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction and a marked decline in hiring activity. Reacting to the Labour government’s first budget, employers have dialed back workforce expansion after being hit with a £26 billion ($34.5 billion) payroll tax hike and a sharp minimum wage increase. BOE Governor Andrew Bailey has repeatedly signaled a preference for gradual easing, maintaining that the inflation surge is likely temporary. Still, Thursday’s meeting will coincide with the release of a fresh set of quarterly forecasts—updated from May, when officials underestimated price momentum. “We think the central bank will be cautious about signaling more rate cuts are in the offing – inflation has surprised to the upside and price expectations are elevated,” said Dan Hanson, Chief UK Economist at Bloomberg Economics. Markets will be watching closely for any cues on the BOE’s bond portfolio plans. With the next quantitative tightening (QT) decision due in September, speculation is growing that the central bank might scale back active gilt sales amid recent volatility in long-dated UK bond yields. Global central banks diverge on rates as trade pressures mount The BOE isn’t the only central bank in action this week. Mexico’s Banxico is expected to deliver its ninth consecutive rate cut, bringing its benchmark rate to 7.75%, despite newly extended US tariffs. On the other hand, Lesotho’s central bank is forecast to reduce its rate to 6.75%, responding to severe export losses under the Trump administration’s trade policy. In contrast, the Czech Republic, Serbia, and Romania are holding steady rates in light of mixed inflation and fiscal signals. In the US, fresh trade data on Tuesday is expected to show a narrowing goods-and-services deficit for June, after months of import declines. Services PMI from ISM will also give insight into the strength of the largest segment of the American economy. The July jobs report disappointed markets, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell held rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty. With Fed Governor Adriana Kugler announcing her early resignation, attention is now turning to who the White House might tap to replace her—and potentially succeed Powell in May. Global markets react as trade tensions and inflation data drive rate decisions Across Asia, a flurry of economic reports will shed light on how the region is coping with Trump’s Aug. 1 tariff escalation. Inflation updates from South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand are expected to show mostly contained pressures, giving room for more rate cuts. The second-quarter GDP from Indonesia and the Philippines will be closely watched, while export data from Vietnam, Australia, and China may reflect pre-tariff acceleration. A key chip exporter, Taiwan, will cap the week with fresh trade figures. In Europe, industrial and trade reports from Germany, France, Italy, and Spain could lead to revisions in GDP. Eurostat confirmed 0.1% quarterly growth for the eurozone in Q2. Meanwhile, Switzerland faces fallout from Trump’s 39% tariff, and inflation is expected to remain at 0.1%. Swedish inflation is forecast to surge past 3% on the CPIF measure, likely delaying further monetary easing. In Turkey, inflation may ease to 34% annually despite new price hikes, while the central bank remains on track to cut rates in September. Mexico’s central bank is poised for a 25bps cut in Latin America, its ninth straight, amid slowing inflation. Brazil, by contrast, is expected to remain on hold at 15%, with easing not likely before 2026. Colombia, facing fiscal strain and sticky inflation, will release its quarterly inflation report and central bank minutes. At the same time, CPI data from Chile and Mexico will help shape the region’s policy outlook. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The token could reach as high as $62.54 in 2028. By 2031, DCR is expected to trade at a maximum price of $192.64. Decred (DCR) is making waves in the crypto world, focusing on security and scalability and giving its community a real say in decisions. In recent times, it rolled out updates like improved privacy features and upgrades to its decentralized exchange, DCRDEX, which caught the attention of many. Thanks to its unique mix of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, Decred has built a reputation as a solid and innovative project. Let’s examine how its latest moves and market trends might impact its price in the future. Overview Cryptocurrency Decred Token DCR Price $15.83 Market Cap $268.31M Trading Volume $3.85M Circulating Supply 16.93M DCR All-time High $250.02 (Apr 16, 2021) All-time Low $0.3948 Dec 28, 2016 24-h High $16.59 24-h Low $15.12 Decred price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 16.22 (2.74%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.60% 50-day SMA $ 15.68 14-Day RSI 46.50 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days $ 13.59 Decred price analysis: DCR shows signs of consolidation with a tight range between support and resistance range-bound movement DCR is stuck between $15.66 and $16.09, showing indecision and lack of clear momentum. Strong resistance at $16.09 multiple failed attempts to break $16.09 confirm strong seller presence. Support holding at $15.66 price consistently bounces from $15.66, signaling buyer interest at lower levels. August 2, 2025, Decred (DCR) is trading at $15.76, showing a 0.88% decline over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is currently moving sideways, caught between a strong resistance at $16.09 and support at $15.66. With no clear breakout, the price remains stable within this range. DCR is still down 93.68% from its all-time high of $250.02, reached on April 17, 2021, but it is up 3902.82% from its all-time low of $0.3948 set on December 28, 2016. Decred 1-day timeframe: DCR struggles to break resistance as consolidation continues The daily chart for Decred shows a tight trading band with no breakout in sight. The price ranges between $15.66 and $16.09, reflecting a clear lack of directional bias. Attempts to breach $16.09 have failed multiple times, indicating heavy resistance at that level. This level has become a short-term ceiling that bulls have yet to reclaim. DCR/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 50, showing no signs of bullish or bearish divergence. The MACD is flat, suggesting a pause in the trend. Unless volume and volatility pick up, DCR is likely to remain trapped in this range. A breakout or breakdown from this channel will likely dictate the direction of the short-term trend. Decred 4-hour timeframe: DCR price compression points to imminent move On the 4-hour chart, DCR is trading near the lower boundary of the range, with several failed wicks above $16.00 highlighting weak bullish momentum. Price has tested the resistance area multiple times but lacks the volume to sustain upward moves. DCR/USDT Chart: TradingView Support at $15.66 remains active, absorbing repeated sell-offs and forming a base. Price is compressing between lower highs and horizontal support, a pattern that often precedes a breakout. Market participants are likely awaiting a volume spike before committing to positions Decred technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 14.86 BUY SMA 5 $ 15.87 SELL SMA 10 $ 16.40 SELL SMA 21 $ 16.64 SELL SMA 50 $ 15.68 BUY SMA 100 $ 15.11 BUY SMA 200 $ 13.59 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 16.39 SELL EMA 5 $ 15.94 SELL EMA 10 $ 15.05 BUY EMA 21 $ 13.89 BUY EMA 50 $ 13.03 BUY EMA 100 $ 13.12 BUY EMA 200 $ 13.65 BUY What to expect from Decred Decred (DCR) remains range-bound, trading between $15.66 support and $16.09 resistance, with no strong directional bias in the short term. The tight consolidation on both the daily and 4-hour charts suggests that a breakout or breakdown is likely in the near future. Price compression and repeated tests of both support and resistance levels indicate that momentum is building behind the scenes. If buyers manage to push DCR above the $16.09 resistance, the next short-term target could extend toward $16.50–$17.00. However, failure to break this level and a drop below $15.66 could open the door to downside moves, possibly toward $15.20 or lower. For now, traders should watch for increased volume and volatility as signals for the next decisive move. Is Decred a good investment? Decred (DCR) is a project known for its hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake governance model, offering strong community involvement and decentralized decision-making. While the current price action shows limited short-term momentum, the long-term fundamentals remain intact, particularly for investors who value on-chain governance and sustainability in blockchain protocols. That said, with DCR still down over 93% from its all-time high, the token remains in a prolonged bear phase. Short-term traders may find opportunities in volatility, mainly if a breakout above $16.09 occurs. However, for long-term investors, whether DCR is a good investment depends heavily on one’s belief in the project’s technical direction, governance structure, and real-world utility within the evolving crypto ecosystem. In summary, Decred offers strong fundamentals but weak near-term price action. Caution is advised, and potential investors should consider broader market conditions and risk tolerance before entering. Recent News Alchemy Pay has partnered with Decred to make the $DCR token easily accessible to users in over 173 countries through traditional payment methods like Visa, Mastercard, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. This strategic integration aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and Web3 by allowing seamless fiat-to-crypto conversions, significantly lowering entry barriers for mainstream users. Known for its hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus and strong community governance, Decred is now positioned for broader adoption beyond the crypto-native audience. The move underscores Alchemy Pay’s commitment to expanding its ecosystem and driving global crypto adoption by supporting a growing array of digital assets. Will Decred reach $50? Yes, Decred is projected to reach $50. By 2028, forecasts predict a minimum price of $51.27, showing that DCR can potentially exceed $50 during its growth trajectory. Will Decred reach $100? Yes, Decred is anticipated to reach $100. According to predictions for 2030, the cryptocurrency could minimum at $111.21, indicating a strong possibility of surpassing the $100 mark. Does Decred have a good long-term future? Decred (DCR) has a promising long-term future due to its strong fundamentals, including an innovative hybrid consensus mechanism that combines proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) for enhanced security and decentralization.

Recent market monitoring indicates BTC dipped below $112,000, trading at $111,964.01 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden downward movement sparks questions about the digital asset landscape’s immediate future. For both seasoned traders and new entrants, understanding these dynamics is crucial. What drives this downturn, and what might it signify for your portfolio? Let’s delve in. What Does the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for Investors? A Bitcoin price drop immediately ripples across the broader crypto ecosystem. As the largest digital asset, Bitcoin’s movements often dictate altcoin direction. When BTC declines, it typically pulls others down, leading to widespread portfolio adjustments and increased market anxiety. For investors, this means unrealized losses, especially for those who entered at higher prices. However, it also presents opportunities for strategic accumulation for long-term perspectives. Bitcoin is currently trading around $111,964.01. This level is a critical psychological and technical support. A sustained break below could signal further downward momentum, while a quick recovery indicates strong buying interest. The market is in flux, where every tick influences sentiment. Metric Value (Approx.) Significance Current Price $111,964.01 Recent trading level on Binance USDT. Previous Support Level $112,000 Key psychological and technical threshold. Market Sentiment Cautious/Bearish Driven by current downward price action. What Factors Contribute to a Bitcoin Price Drop? Several factors can trigger a significant Bitcoin price drop . Understanding these is essential for navigating crypto markets. It’s rarely a single cause, but a confluence of events. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global instability, inflation, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions lead investors to de-risk, selling speculative assets like crypto for safer havens. Regulatory Scrutiny: News of stricter regulations, bans, or increased tax pressures creates uncertainty and panic selling. Governments’ evolving stances significantly affect sentiment. Whale Movements: Large Bitcoin holders (“whales”) influence the market. A sudden large sale floods the market, causing rapid price decline. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: When key support levels break or bearish patterns emerge, trading systems and human traders sell, exacerbating downward pressure. The $112,000 level is a critical technical point. Negative News or FUD: “Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt” spreads rapidly. Reports of exchange hacks, project failures, or misinformation erode confidence and trigger sell-offs. How Have Past Bitcoin Price Drops Recovered? History provides context for a current Bitcoin price drop . Bitcoin has experienced numerous significant corrections and bear markets, only to recover and reach new all-time highs. These past cycles show the asset’s resilience and long-term adoption trends. For example, Bitcoin endured a massive bear market in 2018, falling from nearly $20,000 to around $3,000. In May 2021, it saw a substantial correction from its then-all-time high of over $60,000. In both instances, after consolidation, Bitcoin eventually regained upward momentum. This historical pattern suggests that while current dips are alarming, they are often part of Bitcoin’s volatile but generally upward long-term trajectory. Investors must differentiate between temporary corrections and fundamental market shifts. What Are Actionable Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Drop? Navigating a Bitcoin price drop requires a calm, strategic approach. Panic selling often leads to regret. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. This averages your purchase price, reducing volatility risk. Rebalance Your Portfolio: A downturn can be an opportune time to re-evaluate asset allocation. Adjust holdings to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. Conduct Thorough Research: Use this period to deepen understanding of your investments. Revisit whitepapers, assess development, and evaluate underlying technology. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders for active trading. For long-term investors, simply holding (“HODLing”) can be viable if conviction remains strong. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Follow reputable sources, but avoid constant market chatter. Focus on factual updates and long-term trends. What Does the Future Hold After This Bitcoin Price Drop? Predicting Bitcoin’s exact trajectory after a Bitcoin price drop is challenging, given the multitude of influencing factors. However, increasing institutional interest and broader adoption suggest underlying support even during volatility. Analysts will watch key metrics: trading volume, funding rates on perpetual futures, and macro indicators like inflation reports. A quick bounce back above $112,000 could indicate a false breakdown, while prolonged trading below this level might suggest further downside. Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains tied to its scarcity, decentralization, and increasing utility. The recent Bitcoin price drop serves as a potent reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. While unsettling, such dips are a normal part of asset cycles. For investors, the key is to approach these periods with a clear strategy, informed decisions, and a focus on long-term goals. By understanding causes, learning from history, and implementing sound risk management, one can navigate challenging times effectively and potentially position for future growth. The crypto journey is a rollercoaster; knowledge is your best seatbelt. The recent Bitcoin price drop is a common occurrence in crypto markets. Bitcoin Price Drop: Understanding the Recent Market Shock Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Price Drops Q1: Is this Bitcoin price drop a sign of a bear market? A: A single price drop doesn’t automatically signal a long-term bear market. It could be a short-term correction. A bear market is sustained downward trends over months. Q2: What should I do if my Bitcoin investment is losing value? A: Actions should align with your strategy. Options include holding, dollar-cost averaging, or rebalancing. Avoid emotional decisions. Q3: How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? A: Duration varies. Some corrections last days/weeks, others months. Historical data shows recoveries happen, but timelines are unpredictable. Q4: Can regulatory news cause a significant Bitcoin price drop? A: Yes, regulatory news is a major catalyst. New regulations, bans, or increased scrutiny can create uncertainty and fear, leading to rapid sell-offs and a notable Bitcoin price drop . Q5: Is it a good time to buy Bitcoin after a price drop? A: Many view a Bitcoin price drop as a “buy the dip” opportunity. However, it depends on your financial situation, risk appetite, and long-term outlook. Do your own research.

On Spartans.com, every user has access to a transparent activity log that covers both casino games and sportsbook wagers. It includes everything, settled bets, total winnings and losses, and crypto wallet transactions, all displayed in one easy-to-use dashboard. Whether you want to look back at your slot results or study your recent sports bets, Spartans gives you the tools to bet smarter. This step-by-step guide explains how to find and use your betting history and shows where to check if you’re eligible and ready to claim betting bonus rewards. Step 1: Log In & Head to Your Dashboard Start by logging into your Spartans account using your email and password. Once you’re in, go to your main dashboard. This is where you’ll manage your profile, crypto balance, and gameplay. Look for the betting history section, often labeled “History” or “My Activity.” Unlike sites that bury this info or require downloads, Spartans keeps it in one place. If you’re wondering how to claim betting bonus rewards, this section also shows your past deposits and wagers, key details in meeting bonus terms. Step 2: Use Filters to View Casino or Sportsbook Bets Inside your history page, Spartans lets you switch between casino and sportsbook logs. This is useful if you prefer one or want to review them separately. Casino history will show game names, amounts wagered, and individual outcomes. Sports history includes matches bet on, odds, stakes, and results. The option to view each type on its own helps you see where you’re winning, or losing. And for anyone checking how to claim betting bonus offers, these filters make it easier to find bets that qualify for promotions, like slots-only bonuses or sports bets with minimum odds. Step 3: Review Your Win & Loss Stats Spartans makes it easy to track your total wins and losses. Instead of manually calculating, your dashboard gives you a quick summary showing how much you’ve wagered and what your results are. This feature is perfect for managing risk and staying within your limits. It’s also a great tool if you’re following how to claim betting bonus guidelines that require you to reach a wagering goal, like a 10x playthrough. Seeing your progress in real time helps you stay focused. Step 4: Check Settled & Active Sports Bets If you bet on sports, Spartans splits your bets into two groups, settled and ongoing. Settled bets show the final result, payout, and odds. Ongoing bets update in real time as the event happens. This layout helps you stay on top of multiple wagers, especially if you’re betting live or managing parlays. And since some betting bonus offers are based on whether a bet is complete or not, this view helps you keep track of what qualifies and what’s still pending. Step 5: Track Crypto Activity & Wallet Movements Beyond bets, Spartans also records all wallet actions, deposits, withdrawals, bonuses, and deductions. Each transaction has a timestamp and wallet address (if relevant), so you know exactly what’s happening. If you’ve activated a bonus, like a welcome package or daily reward, checking how to claim betting bonus benefits depends on seeing when and how much was added. You’ll also find progress toward wagering requirements, which can help unlock withdrawals. Step 6: Use Your History to Adjust Your Strategy This tool isn’t just about tracking, it’s about improvement. For casino fans, it helps highlight which games are delivering the best returns. For sports bettors, it reveals what types of bets, sports, or leagues are paying off. Since every bet is time-stamped, you can analyze your results over different time frames, such as days, weeks, or months. If you’re serious about betting and bonuses, the betting history page supports both smart play and finding the best ways to claim betting bonus perks effectively. Wrapping Up Spartans.com gives you full access to your play history, from casino spins and sportsbook bets to all crypto wallet activity. With one clean, organized dashboard, players can manage their betting strategy and bonus rewards in one place. You can review trends, make better choices, and stay updated on promotion progress without switching screens or requesting reports. For players who want to stay in control and get the most out of every session, especially those looking into how to claim betting bonus offers, using the Spartans history tool is a must. On Spartans, transparency isn’t optional, it’s built in.

According to analysis from Perplexity AI, ADA could reach a value that would represent a 39x return from its current price of $0.7744—a move that would push the token well past its previous all-time high of $3.10. For traders seeking early exposure before the broader public catches on, this projection has sparked fresh optimism. At the time of writing, Cardano holds a market cap of $27.42 billion, ranking it as the 10th-largest crypto. While the token dipped nearly 6.7% over the past week, the bigger picture looks increasingly bullish as development ramps up and major events like the Midnight airdrop bring new attention to the ecosystem. A new altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has also started appearing on people’s radars for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward entries. Positioned as a politically-charged alternative to traditional memecoins, MAGACOIN is riding strong community momentum. With multiple presale rounds selling out in record time, analysts are now pointing to the project’s potential to deliver over 12,000% ROI . As the presale approaches its final stage, early buyers are rushing to secure a stake before the token lists on major exchanges. Why Analysts Are Still Bullish on ADA Despite recent dips, ADA has retained solid network growth and development activity. The upcoming upgrades in governance, scalability, and interoperability remain a central part of its roadmap. Combine that with rising speculation around potential U.S. ETF listings, and Cardano could be in the early stages of a new long-term accumulation phase. If ADA follows even a fraction of the AI model’s upper-bound forecast, a $5,000 position today could hypothetically reach nearly $195,000 by 2026 . Of course, those gains are far from guaranteed—but long-term holders are clearly betting on more than just hype. Conclusion Perplexity AI’s projection for Cardano reinforces growing confidence in its long-term potential . And as alternative tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE capture investor excitement with bold ROI targets and strong presale performance, the race for next-cycle gains is heating up.

33767162,[object Object],1754182851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Exchange Gate Debuts Trading Services In US As Regulatory Shift Bears Fruit,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-gate-debuts-spot-trading-services/,"In a recent announcement, cryptocurrency exchange Gate disclosed its intentions to roll out spot trading services in the United States. The trading platform , which was established in 2013, will now be opening its doors to US customers for the first time ever. Gate Joins Crypto Firms’ Influx Into The US In a media release dated August 1, Gate revealed that it has officially launched in the United States. The cryptocurrency firm claimed that it has tailored its spot trading services to meet US customers’ needs through a wide range of popular digital assets. This move to the US by Gate doesn’t seem random, especially considering the efforts of the US authorities to clarify and introduce new regulations within the digital asset landscape. In one such move, United States President Donald Trump signed the first crypto bill, the GENIUS Act, into law. Lin Han, founder of Gate, said about the move: The launch of Gate US marks a significant milestone in our global compliance and localized service strategy. We firmly believe the future of the crypto industry lies in deep integration with local markets. Gate Group remains committed to building a trusted global crypto service network—driven by technology and centered on the user. Interestingly, Gate is not the only digital asset firm to enter (or reenter) the US market in recent months. As reported by Bitcoinist , crypto exchange OKX reentered the United States after reaching a $505 million settlement deal with the US Department of Justice. The cryptocurrency firm is reportedly considering an initial public offering in the US. According to data from CoinGecko, Gate’s trading volume has taken a significant hit in the past 24 hours, falling by over 11% to around $5.82 billion. This decline in trading volume can be correlated with reduced investor activity due to the falling asset prices in the market. US To ‘Reshore’ Firms That Left: SEC Chair As seen with the recent influx or reentry of entities, the introduction of new, clear regulations seems to be having the expected positive results on the US digital asset landscape. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, in a recent interview, asked that the US “reshore the crypto businesses that fled” the country during the period of unclear regulations. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the US has entered a “golden age of crypto” as the Trump-led administration looks to unlock the potential of blockchain technology. “Start your companies here. Launch your protocols here. And hire your workers here,” Bessent called out on X.",Crypto Exchange|crypto exchange|crypto news|Gate|OKX|SEC|US President Donald Trump,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC|LINK,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-03 01:00:51

However, this almost-certain event took a different turn after the price of ETH suddenly succumbed to severe bearish pressure. On Friday, August 1, the Ethereum price suffered a significant downturn, briefly falling below the $3,500 mark. While this has cast doubts on the likelihood of ETH returning above the psychological $4,000 level and perhaps reaching a new all-time high, recent on-chain indicators suggest that the “king of altcoins” might not be done just yet. ETH MVRV Ratio In 7-Year Downtrend In a Friday post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci said that the Ethereum price might still have something in the tank despite its struggles going into the weekend. This evaluation is based on the MVRV ratio, which measures the ratio between an asset’s market capitalization and realized capitalization.

According to on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, an overvalued asset usually has an MVRV ratio greater than 3.7 while a ratio below 1 indicates undervaluation. Kesmeci explained in his post that the ETH MVRV has been in a downtrend since 2018 and may be close to breaking it. However, as shown in the chart, Ether’s MVRV recently suffered rejection at a long-term resistance level — which explains the level of profit-taking seen in the past few days. Nonetheless, Kesmeci still expects Ethereum to still break this seven-year resistance level, considering the institutional interest being enjoyed by ETH at the moment. For instance, as the on-chain analyst duly noted, the US-based spot ETH ETFs have seen a record amount of capital inflows in the past few weeks. As for the altcoin’s movement, Kesmeci expects the Ethereum price to resume its upward trend as long as the MVRV ratio stays above the 365-day simple moving average (white). If this remains the case, a return above $4,000 for the second-largest cryptocurrency might then come sooner rather than later. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $3,523, reflecting a 5% decline in the past 24 hours.
