The move followed Anthropic’s finding that OpenAI had violated its terms by accessing Anthropic’s tools in prohibited ways. Christopher Nulty, a spokesperson for Anthropic, said in a statement to WIRED , “Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5. Unfortunately, this is a direct violation of our terms of service.” Under Anthropic’s commercial terms, customers may not develop another product or service, create their own AI models using Anthropic’s platform, or attempt to dissect or replicate its technology . This adjustment to Claude availability coincides with OpenAI’s internal preparations for GPT-5 , the forthcoming model touted for enhanced coding capabilities. OpenAI allegedly used custom APIs for Claude access According to insiders, OpenAI integrated Claude into its proprietary toolchain via custom APIs rather than the usual chat portal. This arrangement enabled OpenAI to assess Claude’s performance on programming and writing tasks, and to evaluate its responses to safety-related queries regarding areas such as CSAM, self-harm, and defamatory content. The findings were then used to compare Claude against OpenAI’s in-house models and to fine-tune OpenAI’s systems accordingly. In response, OpenAI’s chief communications officer, Hannah Wong, said “It’s industry standard to evaluate other AI systems to benchmark progress and improve safety. While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.” Nulty also mentioned that granting API access for purposes like benchmarking and safety reviews remains part of standard industry practice. The company has not clarified how the current restriction on Claude access might affect OpenAI’s ongoing evaluations. API restrictions have long been wielded as leverage in the tech sector. For instance, Facebook previously cut off Vine (owned by Twitter), and more recently, Salesforce imposed constraints on rival Slack integrations. Anthropic enacted a comparable measure against the AI code startup Windsurf amid speculation of an OpenAI takeover, but the deal never happened. Anthropic’s chief science officer, Jared Kaplan, told TechCrunch, “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.” Anthropic to enforce weekly usage caps on Claude code Anthropic recently revealed plans to introduce weekly caps on Claude Code to reduce continuous background consumption by users. The company said in an email and on X that the new limits will start on August 28. These restrictions will affect users on the $20 Pro tier as well as those on the $100 and $200 Max tiers. Existing five-hourly usage quotas will remain unchanged. Moreover, the update includes two separate weekly quotas: a general usage cap and a model-specific allowance for Claude Opus 4. Max-tier subscribers will have the option to purchase additional capacity at Anthropic’s standard API pricing once they exceed the weekly thresholds. This adjustment builds on a subdued deployment of usage ceilings for Claude Code implemented earlier this summer. Claude Code is popular with developers, but Anthropic has had trouble keeping up with demand. Its service had seven major or partial outages last month, likely caused by heavy use from a small group of users. Get seen where it counts.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|VET|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 22:55:00

One of the strongest new entrants is Remittix (RTX) — a new crypto project committed to solving the cross-border payment problem at scale, and it’s building quietly before launching its wallet later in Q3. With its easy-to-use crypto-to-fiat capabilities, Remittix is causing a splash among investors as a legitimate PayFi contender — one that jumps past speculation hype to offer actual-world adoption. TRON remains steadfast, but Remittix picks up pace in utility-based adoption TRON (TRX) currently is priced at $0.3256, with a minor drop of 0.5%. Its market capitalization is around $30.81 Billion, whereas its daily trading volume has increased by over 47.52% to $1.58 Billion. With some experts’ opinion, TRX is likely to attempt to move towards the level of $0.50 — especially given its strong Layer 1 base and development ecosystem. Yet, a new generation of PayFi cryptos is in the making, which promises not only transaction speed, but also utility — and that is where Remittix excels. Contrasted to a lot of DeFi, which is aimed towards speculation or staking-only models, Remittix is building an actual product: end-to-end crypto-to-bank transfer infrastructure supporting over 40 various cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. You can send BTC, ETH, XRP, and more directly to country-located bank accounts in 30+ countries. Add on live FX conversion, and you have a usable solution to one of crypto’s longest-running problems — cheap remittance. Remittix presale figures and wallet release fuel expansion Remittix (RTX) tokens are valued at $0.0895 as its live presale. The project has raised over $17.9 Million, with more than 578 Million tokens sold to preliminary backers. There is still a 50% token bonus active for a limited period, providing significant potential upside for early adopters. The latest news? The forthcoming Q3 2025 beta wallet release, which will bring retail users and businesses low gas fees, fast on-chain processing, and a clean, intuitive interface. The wallet will also offer support for cryptocurrency staking and API integration for cross-border application. Remitix key highlights: $17.9Million+ presale amount raised with 578Million+ tokens sold $0.0895 token price currently with 50% bonus ongoing Beta wallet in Q3 2025 with minimal fees and rapid transfers 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies supported for worldwide use Built with actual utility, not speculation Remittix is gaining pace for all the correct reasons — and causing some conventional players concern. TRX faces new threat from use-case driven crypto TRON remains a highly viable blockchain project with enormous market cap and a good Layer 1 solution. But the new world of DeFi and crypto payments is now appreciating utility over mere infrastructure — and Remittix is the personification of that next generation. With a wallet release in the works and a presale closing in on the $18 Million soft cap, Remittix is shaping up to be one of the top crypto presale 2025 contenders. If TRON is the past and present of speedy DeFi rails, Remittix may be the future of international crypto remittances.

Focused on transforming subscription payments through blockchain, SUBBD is gaining early traction for its unique pitch. But bold ideas are only half the equation. On the other side, BlockDAG is turning heads for a different reason, it’s delivering. Instead of riding on speculation, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing live results, real tech, and active users. With its GLOBAL LAUNCH release fast approaching and key features already in play, the contrast between vision and execution has never been clearer. While SUBBD builds toward its goals, BlockDAG is already building with them. In a market that often rewards action over ambition, the difference matters. SUBBD Token: A Promising Pitch Still Waiting on Delivery SUBBD’s presale is starting to make waves as its model for subscription payments taps into a sector ready for disruption. Its strategy revolves around giving users and businesses more control, cutting out intermediaries, and using smart contracts to manage subscriptions. Market watchers are speculating on the SUBBD token’s price trajectory, encouraged by the platform’s ambitious narrative. Still, the project sits at an early stage. There’s a whitepaper, projections, and conceptual groundwork, but no listings yet. SUBBD is clearly leaning on future potential rather than current results. It’s a presale aimed at those open to risk in exchange for possible high upside, and that balance is attracting attention. For many, the pitch is enough to stay interested. But turning interest into adoption means proving functionality, not just outlining it. Until SUBBD moves from roadmap to real-world use, its pricing remains speculative. The coming months will be key to show if the project can build beyond promise. BlockDAG Powers Forward with Beat Vesting and August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH Release While some projects are still polishing their whitepapers, BlockDAG is already building in public. Its popular BEAT VESTING PASS has made a return, giving buyers until August 4 to access full liquidity at launch, an edge that sets it apart in today’s presale climate. With $359 million raised and 24.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG isn’t just ahead, it’s dominating. The tech is real. Demos for both the X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware are live, giving users firsthand experience with the platform’s mining setup. These tools make entry easy, combining simplicity with function through a one-tap mining model. The X1 App already has 2.5 million users mining from their phones, proving there’s real traction behind the numbers. What separates BlockDAG further is the transparency baked into its rollout. The smart contract-powered vesting, ongoing user growth, and planned exchange listings add up to a well-rounded launch strategy. And it all leads to one moment: the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. This isn’t just about raising funds. BlockDAG is showing how to deliver tech and access together. It’s not a presale that asks for patience, it’s one offering visibility, liquidity, and working features right now. SUBBD and BlockDAG: Execution Makes All the Difference SUBBD may have a vision, but BlockDAG has proof. While the SUBBD token price discussion continues in speculative circles, the project still needs to hit basic milestones before it’s taken seriously. It’s early, and that’s not a criticism, but early means unproven. In contrast, BlockDAG has already hit critical benchmarks. The BEAT VESTING PASS runs through August 4, followed by a GLOBAL LAUNCH release just a week later. The platform isn’t waiting for attention, it’s earning it through product rollouts and high engagement numbers. Demo access, live miners, and an expanding user base all build BlockDAG’s case. For SUBBD, the journey is just beginning. It still needs to prove product readiness, secure listings, and deliver real-world utility. Those are big steps. The takeaway is clear. If SUBBD delivers, it may join the list of successful disruptors. But right now, BlockDAG is already functioning like one. For those focused on certainty and launch-readiness, the difference between these projects is more than timing, it’s substance. Why BlockDAG’s Final Presale Window Shouldn’t Be Missed In crypto, waiting often means missing. SUBBD might rise in the future, and the SUBBD token price could reflect that if execution aligns with vision. But BlockDAG is in its moment now. The BEAT VESTING PASS is back until August 4, offering immediate liquidity. The coin is priced at $0.0016, with a confirmed launch value of $0.05, giving a potential 3,025% return for current participants. That kind of upside, paired with functional products, is rare in presale territory. With 24.6 billion coins sold and the final launch set for August 11, BlockDAG is closing in on full-scale release. It’s not just another project, it’s one delivering across the board.

Alongside this, Dogwifhat shows signs of potentially mirroring this upward trend. This article delves into whether these coins are set for notable growth, providing an insightful analysis for those looking to capitalize on the next big move in the crypto market. Dogecoin's Price Trends and Market Dynamics Dogecoin saw a 19.41% rise in value over the past month, but the coin also faced a significant weekly decrease of 14.53%, indicating notable market volatility. In the last six months, Dogecoin suffered a 24.14% decline, showcasing a struggling trend. The recent monthly increase hints at moments of bullish activity, yet the prevailing downward trend over a half-year calls for caution among traders. Currently, Dogecoin trades between $0.15 and $0.28, with immediate support at $0.09 and resistance at $0.35. A secondary resistance level exists at $0.48. Key indicators show an RSI of 43.25, suggesting the coin is not in overbought territory. The Awesome Oscillator sits at 0.006, while the momentum indicator is at -0.036, which indicates uncertainty. There is no clear trend, leading traders to consider short-term strategies, aiming for breakouts above $0.35 or testing support at $0.09 for potential bearish trades. Upward Potential Amid Uncertainty in Dogwifhat WIF price movement over the last month and six months displays modest downward pressure, with a one-month change of -1.96% and a half-year decline of -5.82%. The coin experienced a notable short-term dip with a one-week decrease of -16.63%, yet its trading range remained between $0.6878 and $1.2326 during recent sessions. Trading activity has been constrained within these bounds, hinting at subdued investor enthusiasm. Price oscillation within this range reflects market hesitation and cautious sentiment, revealing a market seeking directional clarity while digesting broader economic and crypto-specific factors. Current price action revolves around a trading band with a support level at $0.4613 and resistance near $1.55, with a second resistance identified around $2.0957. Indicators suggest slight bearish dominance, highlighted by a negative momentum indicator at -0.2681 and a below-neutral relative strength index of 41.943. Oscillators show a partial positive signal, but the moving average recommendation of -0.6666 indicates sellers dominate in the midterm. Trading strategies could focus on accumulating near the support level while monitoring for a breakout above $1.55 as a sign of resumed bullish drive, although caution remains important given the lack of a clear trend. Conclusion DOGE is positioned to rise from its key support level. Its movement can create positive momentum for WIF . Similar patterns in both coins suggest potential growth. Investors should watch for any significant breakout. This could offer opportunities in the market. Further monitoring of these trends is advisable.

Not just buying low and selling high, but entering before the wave begins. From Bitcoin’s earliest days at under $1 to Ethereum’s quiet beginnings at $0.30, the biggest winners were not those with the most capital—but those with the most foresight. Fast forward to 2025, and the opportunity hasn’t disappeared. If anything, it’s evolved. Now, smart investors are hunting for tokens that offer asymmetric upside—projects with strong narratives, emerging communities, and clear signals of momentum before mainstream exposure kicks in. This approach is what turns $500 into $50,000, and helps level the playing field between retail traders and institutions. Today’s profit strategies go beyond holding Bitcoin or earning yield through DeFi. While those approaches offer stability, the fastest gains still come from early entry into under-the-radar altcoins —especially those with viral branding, limited access windows, and traction that mirrors early crypto giants. But identifying the right project requires more than hype. With tools like on-chain analysis, Telegram activity trackers, and social volume aggregators, today’s investor has sharper insight than ever before into what’s building beneath the surface. Why Early-Stage Tokens Still Offer the Best ROI Most projects don’t go 100x. But those that do usually share a few common traits—and they all rewarded those who recognized the patterns early. In recent months, one particular token has been making waves for just that reason. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention across platforms like X and Telegram not simply for its meme appeal, but for the velocity of its adoption. Crypto research groups tracking social metrics say its early trajectory mirrors the rise of Ethereum Classic, two tokens that generated major returns for initial adopters. But unlike older assets that are now deep into their market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early growth curve . The project’s viral branding, combined with a limited-access phase, has created a rush among early participants. Every round has seen rapid sellouts, and the project’s social growth has already rivaled meme giants like Dogecoin in their infancy. Analysts now forecast that its current pricing window may be one of the last remaining chances for sharp asymmetric entry before broader exchange access resets the opportunity. How to Spot High-Upside Tokens Before the Crowd Spotting altcoins before they explode isn’t about luck—it’s about pattern recognition. Historically, the biggest crypto winners showed early signs long before their names hit mainstream headlines. These included subtle metrics like surging social media growth, increasing wallet holders, and high engagement rates on social channels like X and Telegram . They also tended to feature emotionally resonant branding, whether political, cultural, or comedic—something that hooks communities and sustains hype across weeks or months. Another key factor? Scarcity of access. The earliest-stage tokens that go on to make 10x–100x moves are often available only for a limited time through exclusive, time-sensitive windows. Once listed on major exchanges, these assets usually price in their potential, leaving little room for exponential gains . The most strategic investors understand this—they track momentum, measure community velocity, and look for entry points when the crowd is still on the sidelines. Final Thoughts: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Act Early The best way to make money in crypto has always been clear— get in before everyone else realizes what’s happening . Whether it’s through identifying social trends, spotting wallet inflows, or analyzing price structure before breakout, timing and conviction are the real tools of the trade. In today’s cycle, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum precisely because they offer that rare mix: powerful community traction, viral positioning, and limited access. And as history has shown, when these elements align, the results can be game-changing .

Considering the supposed significance of this price mark, there have been questions about how much headroom the price of Bitcoin still has. The latest on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin bull run might not be over just yet. BTC Long-Term Holders Start Distributing In an August 1st post on X, crypto analyst Joao Wedson reported that the Bitcoin cycle for the long-term holders seems to be coming to an end. Related Reading: Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Just Turned Red For The First Time Since May — What This Means Wedson emphasized that, regardless of the ongoing excitement around ETFs, on-chain data shows a clear market shift. This shift signals that the cryptocurrency’s long-term holders are beginning to sell their coins, and, in large volumes, too. According to the analyst, about 50% of the amount of Bitcoin held in exchange-traded funds has been sold by the LTHs. Regardless of this situation, however, Wedson expects the BTC bull market to go on for “at least 2 more months” and the altcoins’ bull cycle for three months. Key Metrics Flash Warnings – But ‘Final Top’ Not Yet Seen Wedson backed his claim with four on-chain indicators, starting with the Coin Days Destroyed Terminal Adjusted Metric, which shows aged coins moving after being dormant for a long period of time. The analyst explained that there has been a significant movement of old BTC over the past two years. This, Wedson emphasized, triggered three major warning signs that coincide with a local top. Wedson also referenced the Reserve Risk Indicators to gauge current LTH conviction. This metric, from analysis, has entered a warning zone, as there is increased selling activity and hand exchanges. Next, the online pundit quoted results from the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal. The SOPR measures whether coins (in this case, Bitcoin) are moved at a profit or loss. Wedson pointed out that this indicator recently flashed a bearish signal, which implies increased profit-taking in the market. Referring to it as ‘the most accurate metric in the world’ used to identify Bitcoin’s macro tops, the Bitcoin Cycle Market Top Prediction: Max Intersect SMA Model was put out last. Wedson highlighted that this metric is yet to flash any bearish signal. Using the chart below, the analyst explained that until the blue line reaches the $69,000 level, the final top is yet to arrive. Ultimately, the analyst preached caution against panicking, as historical cycle patterns suggest that the final market top has yet to arrive. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $113,052, reflecting a 1.2% price decline in the past 24 hours.

At the time, those coins were worth about $3.5 billion. Today, they’d fetch roughly $14.5 billion, making this the biggest crypto heist ever recorded. No one at LuBian, nor the group behind the intrusion, has publicly confirmed the breach. Blockchain investigator Arkham first revealed the scale of the loss. BREAKING: ARKHAM UNCOVERS $3.5B HEIST – THE LARGEST EVER LuBian was a Chinese mining pool with facilities in China & Iran. Based on analysis of on-chain data, it appears that 127,426 BTC was stolen from LuBian in December 2020, worth $3.5 billion at the time and now worth… pic.twitter.com/PnIOKgMt0i — Arkham (@arkham) August 2, 2025 In mid-2020, LuBian ranked among the top pools, handling nearly 6% of Bitcoin’s total computing power as of May. Its operations spanned China and Iran. On December 28, 2020, attackers emptied over 90 percent of LuBian’s holdings. The next day, roughly $6 million more which was split between Bitcoin and USDT, vanished from a Lubian address on the Omni protocol. By December 31, LuBian shunted its remaining balance into secured recovery wallets. Soon after, each hacker’s address received an embedded OP\_RETURN note, begging for the return of stolen funds. Sending those messages cost LuBian 1.4 BTC over 1,516 transactions, a sign the appeals likely came from the real pool operators and not a copycat looking to exploit compromised keys. Security analysis points to a flaw in LuBian’s key-generation method. It seems their algorithm was weak against brute-force attacks, offering a gateway for the breach. Despite the attack, LuBian managed to keep 11,886 BTC, today worth about $1.35 billion, which remains untouched. The hacker has also left the stolen coins, except for moving them into one wallet in July 2024. Because Bitcoin’s price has climbed since 2020, the stolen coins now amount to $14.5 billion. On Arkham’s records, that stash places the culprit as the 13th-largest BTC holder, even ahead of the Mt. Gox hacker. For perspective, Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined over 22,000 blocks before disappearing in 2011. Those early rewards translate to more than one million BTC, all but a handful never spent, making Nakamoto a billionaire many times over. LuBian hack surpasses Bybit’s $1.5 billion theft LuBian’s loss shattered the previous record, set by Bybit in February 2025, when hackers stole $1.5 billion , according to Cryptopolitan. About $1.46 billion worth of mETH and stETH streamed out to four Ethereum addresses, with parts swapped immediately on decentralized marketplaces. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT spotted the suspicious outflow, and firm Cyvers flagged odd activity from the exchange’s wallets. Bybit had earlier confronted an unrelated “address poisoning” attack. Most of the stolen tokens were swapped for ETH on decentralized exchanges and then run through mixers to hide them. It was one of the first big exchange hacks of 2025. Bybit said the incident was a routine fund transfer between cold and hot wallets, but that hackers subverted the destination address. No internal breach of systems occurred, according to the company. Investigators had pinpointed five wallets involved in the attack. ZachXBT warned that all other exchanges and services should blacklist these addresses to prevent further losses.

As interest in XRP among institutional investors continues to grow, discussions around its long-term potential are intensifying. Several organizations, including Trident Digital, Webus, and VivoPower , have already announced plans to include XRP in their treasury holdings, suggesting growing confidence in the asset’s utility and future performance. Amid this increasing institutional activity, the question arises: What would happen if global retirement funds, which manage massive pools of capital, were to allocate even a modest 1% of their assets to XRP? The Magnitude of Global Pension Funds Estimates place the total value of retirement fund assets worldwide at roughly $50 trillion. These funds, comprising both private and public pensions, traditionally prioritize stable investments such as government bonds, equities, and real estate. However, the evolving investment landscape and rising recognition of digital assets have led to a reconsideration of cryptocurrency as a viable long-term allocation. A 1% investment from global retirement funds into XRP would amount to approximately $500 billion. This figure represents a substantial influx compared to XRP’s current market capitalization, and such a move could significantly reshape the token’s valuation. Price Implications Under a Linear Projection At present, XRP trades around $2.88 , with about 59.3 billion tokens in circulation. This puts its current market capitalization near $165 billion. If $500 billion were injected into XRP, and we assume a linear correlation between capital inflow and market capitalization growth, XRP’s market cap could rise to $665 billion. In that case, the projected price per token would increase to roughly $11.28. However, this straightforward estimation does not account for real-world market mechanics. In practice, large capital inflows often create disproportionately larger price movements due to liquidity gaps and investor reactions. In cryptocurrency markets, the multiplier effect refers to the amplification of price movements caused by limited liquidity and increased demand. When substantial buy pressure enters the market, it can cause prices to escalate rapidly, especially if sell orders are sparse at higher levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Applying a conservative multiplier of 1.5x to 3x on the linear estimate of $11.28, XRP’s price could realistically reach between $17 and $34 per token. This wide range reflects the volatility and reactive nature of crypto markets when faced with institutional-scale investments. Policy Shifts Supporting Crypto in Retirement Portfolios One major barrier to retirement funds adopting XRP has historically been regulatory caution. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance warning against crypto exposure in retirement plans due to risks related to volatility, storage, and speculation. However, by May 2025, the Department rescinded that guidance and adopted a neutral stance on crypto assets in retirement portfolios. This regulatory shift, alongside similar changes by agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the FDIC , has created a more accommodating environment for institutional crypto participation. A modest allocation of 1% from global retirement funds into XRP has the potential to significantly influence the asset’s price and standing within the broader financial ecosystem. Beyond price growth, such participation would represent a strong signal of legitimacy, potentially encouraging further adoption among both institutions and individual investors. As regulatory barriers continue to ease and the infrastructure around crypto investment matures, the likelihood of such developments appears increasingly plausible.

Altcoin interest is surging again, and one project in particular—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is beginning to draw serious attention from traders looking for stronger momentum plays. XRP Fails to Break Key Levels XRP has held steady around the $3 mark for weeks, showing resilience but little upside action. Even as large wallets continue to accumulate and network usage grows, the lack of a breakout is leaving short-term traders frustrated. While long-term prospects remain intact, there’s growing demand for tokens with faster growth potential and more immediate returns. Early Investors Are Targeting the Next Big Opportunity That appetite for action has triggered a rush toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new player that recently saw its presale round close faster than expected. Now entering its next funding wave, the project is generating FOMO across crypto channels. Analysts are pointing to a potential 5,000% return , noting that even a small investment could grow into a fortune. The hype isn’t just talk—community numbers are growing, and early backers are comparing this moment to the breakout phases of past meme coin legends. Traders Grow Restless as XRP Lacks Catalysts Back on the XRP front, hopes are still pinned on regulatory clarity and a potential ETF listing—but timelines are uncertain. Some are holding, but others are clearly moving funds into faster-developing projects. Despite its strong fundamentals, XRP isn’t delivering the action many traders are chasing right now, and attention is drifting. Conclusion XRP may still see its moment, but right now, capital is flowing to altcoins with stronger short-term upside. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid presale and 5,000% ROI prediction, it’s clear which way momentum is shifting. For investors who don’t want to miss the next breakout, early positioning is everything.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 23:55:00

49448197,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76613,1754179212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst Predicts $3,380 XRP Using This Model",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-3380-xrp-using-this-model/,"A recent valuation model presented by a prominent XRP analyst suggests that a holding of just 5,000 XRP could potentially be worth up to $16.9 million. The prediction is based on the assumption that the XRP Ledger will become a dominant infrastructure in global finance , handling volumes across various markets and institutions. High-Stakes Price Projection The forecast originates from an analyst known online as “Future XRP,” who shared his findings via a post that has gained traction within the XRP community. His valuation model estimates XRP’s future price at $3,380, a figure that would require an increase of more than 1,500 times its current market price of approximately $3.00. According to his projection, XRP’s existing network, with a circulating supply of around 60 billion tokens and a transaction velocity of 10, can already support an annual volume of about $1.3 trillion. However, if the XRP Ledger is adopted widely across financial sectors, he anticipates the annual transaction volume could grow substantially, potentially ranging between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion. Several developments have fueled speculation about XRP’s future utility. In recent public remarks, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed optimism about XRP capturing a significant portion of SWIFT’s transaction volume within the next five years, up to 14% according to his projection. At its current price of $2.20, 60 Billion in Circulating Supply, and an annual velocity of 10, $XRP can handle about $1.3 Trillion in annual flow on chain today. You're not ready for the rest of this post…Lock in… 1700 NDAs, at least 14% of Swift, Derivatives, FX Market,… — Future XRP (@the5blairs) June 28, 2025 Additionally, Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road in April 2025, a firm with connections to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), has intensified speculation. The DTCC processes more than $11 trillion daily, adding weight to the idea that XRP could play a role in high-value settlements. Future XRP argues that if the token maintains its supply and transaction velocity, it would need a price point in the $3,380 range to effectively facilitate such a massive flow of value. Potential Gains for XRP Holders In the scenario described, XRP holders could see extraordinary returns. A wallet holding 5,000 XRP would reach a value of $16.9 million. Other hypothetical cases include 1,000 XRP being valued at $3.38 million, and 50,000 XRP reaching $169 million. While the analyst emphasizes that these outcomes are tied to very specific market shifts, he presents them as theoretically possible under the right conditions. Not all observers agree with the methodology or conclusions of the model. Some critics argue that the estimated transaction velocity of 10 is too low compared to traditional financial systems like SWIFT , where turnover can reach up to 200 times annually. Under such conditions, XRP could potentially support the same financial throughput with a much lower price, possibly around $166. Others question whether XRP could dominate financial infrastructure on its own, considering competition from alternative networks such as Stellar, Ethereum-based stablecoins, and centralized financial solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 AI Commentary on the Projection To validate his assumptions, Future XRP asked the Grok 3 AI model to analyze the data. The AI provided a summary of the analyst’s reasoning and acknowledged the potential for XRP to become a key neutral settlement mechanism in a shifting global financial system. While Grok considered a $3,380 price to be an outlier scenario, it deemed a range between $200 and $1,000 plausible, particularly if the world transitions further away from dollar-denominated reserves. However, the AI also noted that extreme price targets would likely require significant global disruptions, such as a breakdown of fiat systems or a major realignment of global financial infrastructure. The projection that 5,000 XRP could be worth nearly $17 million is based on a model that assumes XRP becomes central to global finance. While intriguing, the prediction has generated mixed reactions. Supporters view it as a realistic long-term scenario tied to Ripple’s expansion efforts, while critics caution that the assumptions may not reflect how financial markets operate.

With Bitcoin continuing to dictate overall market direction, the analyst mentioned plans to monitor LTC’s intraday chart for a potential quick scalp opportunity. LTCBTC Shows Early Bullish Signs Despite Caution In his analysis, Cryptowzrd observed that both Litecoin (LTC) and LTCBTC closed the day with indecisive daily candles, reflecting market hesitation. Despite this uncertainty, LTCBTC managed to close slightly in the green, which could be an early sign of shifting momentum. However, the analyst stressed the need for stronger and more consistent daily candles from this level to confirm a sustainable move. Related Reading: Litecoin Sharp Pullback: Scalping Opportunities Emerge While LTCBTC Seeks Stability A critical resistance level to watch is 0.0010 BTC for LTCBTC. Cryptowzrd highlighted that a clean breakout above this barrier could trigger an impulsive rally, given the pair’s extremely oversold condition. Such a breakout would likely push Litecoin sharply higher, with $140 identified as the major upside target. On the support side, Litecoin’s key daily level sits at $96. Cryptowzrd cautioned that this support could be tested only if Bitcoin experiences a sharp drop towards the $110,000 region, driven by panic selling. In such a case, LTC would likely follow BTC’s lead and retrace to test lower support levels. Cryptowzrd highlighted that his attention will be on lower time frames in the near term, looking for short-term chart patterns to exploit quick trading opportunities. However, broader market sentiment, especially Bitcoin’s price action, will remain the dominant factor influencing Litecoin’s direction. Litecoin Intraday Volatility Limits Clear Setup Formation In his final remarks, Cryptowzrd noted that Litecoin’s intraday chart showed increased volatility throughout the day, making short-term trading conditions less favorable. He emphasized the need for a clearer and more structured chart formation before considering any immediate entries. Related Reading: Litecoin Is On Fire: $120–$125 Range In Bullish Crosshairs A key level to watch is the $114.50 intraday resistance. According to Cryptowzrd, a move above this level would be a bullish signal and could invite further buying pressure. Additionally, a breakout above the intraday lower high trendline would likely accelerate upward momentum, potentially setting the stage for a stronger rally. Despite these technical signals, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin’s price action remains the primary driving force in the market. As such, any decision to enter a trade will depend on the development of a mature and well-defined setup, ideally supported by Bitcoin’s broader trend. For now, patience is key while waiting for the right conditions to align.

XRP and Cardano (ADA) are once again making headlines, thanks to growing institutional momentum and network developments that could reignite major rallies. While many are focusing on established names, early movers are also quietly building positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE—a fast-rising project already breaking records in its presale phase. XRP Eyes Breakout on ETF Buzz XRP remains one of the most talked-about altcoins heading into the next market leg. Priced around $3.15, it still sits just below its all-time high of $3.84, and the hype surrounding a potential XRP ETF approval is only growing. A green light from regulators could send the token surging, especially with Ripple’s established connections in the global banking sector. Trading volumes remain strong, and whale accumulation hints at rising confidence from large investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Gains Speed In the middle of all this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum at an astonishing pace. Its latest presale round has already outperformed the last round’s numbers, signaling massive demand . Some experts are praising the project to be a game-changer for the crypto industry, forecasting their explosive price movements. With a high ROI projection, limited token access , and exchange listings on the horizon, it’s no surprise that strategic investors are racing to get in before the broader market catches on. ADA’s Hidden Strength and Airdrop Fuel Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is showing real potential for a breakout of its own. At just $0.78, it remains far from its all-time high of $3.10, giving it plenty of room to run. But what’s driving excitement now is the long-awaited Midnight airdrop, expected to be one of the largest in Cardano’s history. The distribution will benefit ADA holders—and even XRP holders, boosting cross-community engagement. This upcoming event could help trigger the momentum ADA lacked in previous cycles. Final Thoughts XRP’s ETF speculation, Midnight’s upcoming airdrop, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale performance are giving crypto investors several promising paths for potential gains . As demand accelerates and catalysts stack up, these three projects are worth watching closely.

BlockDAG’s Final Presale Surge Could Be Your Biggest Missed Opportunity,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-buy-right-now-blockdags-final-presale-surge-could-be-your-biggest-missed-opportunity/,"In the ever-shifting world of digital assets, identifying the top crypto to buy right now is no easy feat. From DeFi tokens to Layer 1 giants, the market is saturated with options, but few stand out with the same blend of fundamentals, community backing, and growth potential as BlockDAG. While popular tokens like Cosmos (ATOM), Polygon (MATIC/POL), and Cronos (CRO) each show flashes of momentum, BlockDAG’s final presale window is grabbing serious attention. It’s raised over $359 million, sold 24.3 billion coins, and is currently priced at just $0.0016, despite a confirmed listing price of $0.05. That creates a staggering 3,025% ROI opportunity. What’s more, BlockDAG isn’t a concept. It’s a functioning Layer 1 ecosystem with live miners, active developers, and a clearly mapped global launch. In this article, we’ll compare the current market movers and reveal why BlockDAG may be the top crypto to buy right now. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG is quickly emerging as the top crypto to buy right now, and its momentum is data-driven, not just hype. With more than $359 million raised and over 24.3 billion BDAG coins already sold, this Layer 1 project is nearing the end of one of the most successful presales in recent memory. Currently priced at just $0.0016, BDAG offers a rare 3,025% potential return based on its confirmed $0.05 listing price. But it’s not only the numbers that impress. BlockDAG has built a working ecosystem before launch, with over 2 million users mining daily via the X1 mobile app and 18,000 X10 hardware miners sold. A live testnet is already active, and over 4,500 developers are working on more than 300 dApps. Add in a GLOBAL LAUNCH release scheduled for August 11 and a limited-time NO VESTING PASS that gives buyers 100% of their tokens at launch, and it’s clear why traders are rushing in. This isn’t speculation, it’s strategic accumulation. With fundamentals already delivered and community traction accelerating, BlockDAG makes a strong case as the top crypto to buy right now. Cosmos (ATOM) Analysis Cosmos (ATOM) has struggled to maintain upward momentum recently, shedding nearly 6% over the past 24 hours. The token is hovering near $4.63, after being rejected at $4.87 and slipping below key short-term EMAs. The RSI currently sits around 31, signaling oversold conditions, but also caution. Unless ATOM can bounce convincingly from the $4.62–$4.65 support zone, the downside risk toward $4.46 remains in play. Technical setups show weakening conviction, and trading volumes have dried up across major exchanges. While long-term potential still exists, the current conditions place ATOM in a “wait and see” category for those seeking the top crypto to buy right now. Without a strong catalyst or visible ecosystem acceleration, short-term holders may want to stay cautious. Polygon (MATIC / POL) Analysis Polygon is currently priced at around $0.2166, having gained roughly 2.6% in the past 24 hours. Despite muted trading volume, technical indicators are painting a more optimistic picture. A double-bottom base around $0.40–$0.42 has held, and the token is now targeting a breakout toward $0.55–$0.60. A sustained move could push MATIC as high as $0.70. On-chain stablecoin activity has also surged, with USDC transfers up by 141%, hinting at growing utility and capital inflow. Polygon’s continued focus on Ethereum scaling, particularly with zkEVM rollouts, positions it well long-term. However, given the current price action and modest engagement levels, MATIC may not be the immediate top crypto to buy right now unless momentum picks up further. Cronos (CRO) Analysis Cronos (CRO) is enjoying a resurgence ahead of its POS Chain v6 upgrade, scheduled for July 28. The update includes improved IBC compatibility, new circuit breaker modules, and stronger interoperability, elements that enhance its long-term utility. In the past week, CRO has rallied about 12%, now trading near $0.137. Bullish patterns such as a Golden Cross and a bullish engulfing candle support the rally, alongside investor excitement over a possible 5% allocation in a proposed Trump Media ETF. Technical indicators suggest strength above $0.121 support, with near-term upside targeting $0.133 and beyond. While CRO has catalysts in motion, whether it becomes the top crypto to buy right now depends on how effectively it capitalizes on these upgrades and ETF narratives in the coming weeks. Conclusion In a market filled with short-term noise and speculative pops, identifying the top crypto to buy right now comes down to three pillars: real-world traction, strategic timing, and provable delivery. Cosmos and Polygon show technical promise, and Cronos is riding an upgrade wave, but none currently match the scale or clarity of execution seen in BlockDAG. With a fully operational testnet, millions of miners, over 4,500 developers building real dApps, and $359 million already raised, BlockDAG is not just preparing to launch; it’s accelerating toward it. The current presale price of $0.0016 offers a rare chance at 3,025% returns when the $0.05 listing hits later this year at launch. Add the limited-time NO VESTING PASS, and the window becomes even more urgent. For traders searching for the top crypto to buy right now, BlockDAG may be the standout candidate of the year.

Sometimes, it’s a viral tweet. Other times, it’s an irresistible narrative baked into a hilarious token name. But more often than not, it’s a combination of utility, hype, and raw community power. Meme coins have gone from jokes to market juggernauts, flipping expectations and turning small investments into life-changing bags. Arctic Pablo Coin , Banana for Scale, Pudgy Penguins, Cat in Dog’s World, Popcat, Bonk, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Memecoin, and Fartboy—these are the names driving the next crypto craze. From penguin NFTs to feline defiance, each one rides the meme energy of the internet with unique vibes. But among them, Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now, and here’s why. While many of these projects hinge on nostalgia, community memes, or animal cuteness, Arctic Pablo Coin fuses meme culture with robust tokenomics and competitive community rewards. It’s built not just to ride waves—but to cause them. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin: Turning Crypto Hype into Cold, Hard Returns What sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart isn’t just its name or meme worthiness—it’s the snowballing power of its ecosystem. One standout feature? The Community Competitions. Participants can compete in meme contests, viral challenges, and creative stunts—and get rewarded in either APC tokens or real USD. That’s not just engagement; that’s real incentive-driven momentum. How often does a meme coin pay its users for hype generation? Arctic Pablo Coin is more than a coin—it’s a movement. With an NFT-ready roadmap, transparent burns (over 11 billion APCs already vaporized), and a quirky yet strategic marketing campaign, Arctic Pablo is doing what Dogecoin once did—but smarter, faster, and with more explicit purpose. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now because it’s already building a culture of rewards and exclusivity before even listing. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Update: Cold Opportunity, Hot ROI Arctic Pablo Coin is now in Stage 34 (Chilly Citadel) of its explosive meme coin presale , priced at just $0.00062. With over $3.17 million raised, early buyers are eyeing a 1190.32% return to listing—and a staggering 16,029.03% ROI if it hits analysts’ $0.1 target. This window won’t stay open long. Those paying attention already know: Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now. The presale is roaring ahead, currently in Stage 34—aptly named Chilly Citadel . Early adopters have seen gains up to 4,033.33%. A $1,000 investment today fetches 1,612,900 APC tokens, which could be worth $12,903.20 when the listing hits $0.008—and even more if the predicted $0.1 target hits. This isn’t just a presale. It’s a ticking clock on one of 2025’s most exciting ROI windows. Miss this, and the only thing colder than Pablo’s ice is the regret. The clock is melting—act fast or stay frozen out. 2. Banana for Scale: Precision Meme Mechanics Meet Hilarious Utility Banana for Scale rides the absurdist meme era, where comparison measurements turned into running jokes. But behind the laughs is an ecosystem designed to scale in both user rewards and staking flexibility. The token integrates NFT utilities that allow holders to “measure” influence across partnered communities. Banana for Scale isn’t just humorous—it’s scalable by design. That’s what earns its spot among 2025’s standout meme coins. 3. Pudgy Penguins: From NFT Fame to Meme Coin Fame Once famous as an adorable NFT collection, Pudgy Penguins has now leapt into the meme coin space with the same cozy charisma. This token doubles as a cultural badge of crypto literacy and a direct gateway into an expanding metaverse. It maintains strong utility through community voting rights and in-world Penguin perks. Its evolution from NFT to coin is strategic—not accidental. That’s why it’s on this list. 4. Cat in Dog’s World: Rebel Energy in the Meme Market Cat in Dog’s World flips the canine-dominated meme space with pure rebel flair. In a space filled with Doges and Shibas, this token channels underdog—or undercat—energy. It’s got an aggressive token burn strategy and a strong staking model that rewards early adopters. The project’s branding is unapologetically sassy, giving it a unique edge that resonates with contrarian traders. That’s its purr-suasive advantage. 5. Popcat: Viral Speed, Feline Flex Remember that viral image of the cat rapidly chomping? That’s Popcat’s origin story, and it carries that chaotic meme energy into a real crypto token. Popcat leverages engagement contests that spike social volume—and its recent surge proves it’s more than a flash in the pan. With plans to integrate with meme NFT auctions, Popcat is turning taps into tokens. That agility earns it a place on the radar. 6. Bonk: Solana’s Barking Success Story Bonk was Solana’s first community token, and it barks loud for a reason. With lightning-fast transaction speeds and zero congestion, Bonk’s scalability is among the best in the meme coin world. It has become a darling of decentralized exchanges, and its recent partnerships within the Solana ecosystem only make it stronger. Bonk didn’t just bark its way into this list—it howled through the door. 7. Neiro: Meme Coin Meets AI Utility Neiro isn’t just riding the meme train; it’s combining meme culture with real-world AI utility. This token allows holders to stake for access to mini AI tools and services, making it both fun and functional. It’s targeting the productivity-meme crossover niche, a clever intersection that few others are exploring. Its dual purpose puts it ahead of the curve. 8. Dogwifhat: Whimsical Yet Wildly Effective What started as a hilarious meme turned into a cultural phenomenon. Dogwifhat is now gaining serious traction thanks to its low supply, loyal holders, and solid liquidity strategy. With meme vibes as strong as Shiba Inu but without the overinflated supply, Dogwifhat is proving that quirk can still conquer. It’s hats off to this quirky contender. 9. Memecoin: The OG Joke Turned Market Mainstay Memecoin embraces the very essence of meme investing—self-aware, deflationary, and hilariously meta. It’s designed to poke fun at crypto’s speculative nature while offering decent staking rewards and strong community incentives. Sometimes, the best way to survive a volatile market is to laugh your way through it. That’s why Memecoin remains a top pick. 10. Fartboy: Offensive, Ridiculous—and Profitable Fartboy is as crude as it sounds—but somehow, it works. What started as a toilet humor token now has its cult following, complete with themed games, NFT unlockables, and weekly “gas drop” events. It thrives on being outrageous, and that very outrageousness creates stickiness in an oversaturated market. That’s the gassy formula that earned it a spot. Final Verdict: Arctic Pablo Shines as the Best Meme Coin to Buy Now Based on the latest research, the best meme coins to buy now are: Arctic Pablo Coin, Banana for Scale, Pudgy Penguins, Cat in Dog’s World, Popcat, Bonk, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Memecoin, and Fartboy. But Arctic Pablo Coin stands at the summit—fueled by a deflationary supply, high-stakes competitions, and a ridiculously high ROI window. The timing is critical. With the current presale stage offering 1190.32% upside and analyst projections pushing that to 16,029.03%, this isn’t a casual opportunity. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy now because it’s delivering on both community firepower and financial firepower. Blink—and that ROI could vanish like a snowflake on lava.

Currently priced at $0.00001288, the token has seen mixed reactions from traders, with some cautious over the decline – but others eyeing a bullish setup. That said, growing chatter in crypto circles suggests another project might be the next big narrative: MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising altcoin that is starting to attract serious capital during its presale phases. SHIB Bulls Maintain $0.000081 Target Despite the current downtrend, technical analysts remain optimistic. Prominent trader Javon Marks shared his updated chart projecting a 500%+ upside for SHIB if it breaks above key resistance. The target remains at $0.000081, with bullish patterns forming a structure similar to past breakout rallies. As past cycles show, SHIB has a history of sharp reversals when least expected—and this setup might be no different. New Challenger Enters the Arena While SHIB holds its place in the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building serious momentum behind the scenes. Its latest presale round is already outpacing the previous one, and investor demand shows no signs of slowing. Analysts expect fast traction and a more utility-driven ecosystem. Major returns are also expected, according to early projections based on presale metrics and anticipated listings. Strategic buyers are rushing in now, before the token becomes widely accessible. SHIB’s Technical Setup Signals Breakout Potential As for SHIB’s future, the current pattern suggests that once it clears its resistance, a steep run could follow. Marks’ chart highlights an “Accumulation-Bullish Zone” and prior reversal points that echo 2021’s run-up. If history repeats , SHIB could climb back into price discovery – fueled by whales re-entering and fresh retail enthusiasm. Conclusion: Shiba Inu still leads the memecoin space in market cap and recognition, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly closing in as a serious competitor. With analysts projecting breakout moves for both tokens, the smart money could be in riding the SHIB rebound—while also securing early exposure to MAGACOIN’s explosive presale momentum.

According to Bloomberg data, traders are nearly unanimous in predicting the cut, even as inflation recently clocked its fastest pace in 17 months. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) appears to be prioritizing recessionary risks over price pressures—unlike the US Federal Reserve, which left rates unchanged again this week. BOE weighs growth risks against inflation The BOE’s dovish stance comes on the back of two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction and a marked decline in hiring activity. Reacting to the Labour government’s first budget, employers have dialed back workforce expansion after being hit with a £26 billion ($34.5 billion) payroll tax hike and a sharp minimum wage increase. BOE Governor Andrew Bailey has repeatedly signaled a preference for gradual easing, maintaining that the inflation surge is likely temporary. Still, Thursday’s meeting will coincide with the release of a fresh set of quarterly forecasts—updated from May, when officials underestimated price momentum. “We think the central bank will be cautious about signaling more rate cuts are in the offing – inflation has surprised to the upside and price expectations are elevated,” said Dan Hanson, Chief UK Economist at Bloomberg Economics. Markets will be watching closely for any cues on the BOE’s bond portfolio plans. With the next quantitative tightening (QT) decision due in September, speculation is growing that the central bank might scale back active gilt sales amid recent volatility in long-dated UK bond yields. Global central banks diverge on rates as trade pressures mount The BOE isn’t the only central bank in action this week. Mexico’s Banxico is expected to deliver its ninth consecutive rate cut, bringing its benchmark rate to 7.75%, despite newly extended US tariffs. On the other hand, Lesotho’s central bank is forecast to reduce its rate to 6.75%, responding to severe export losses under the Trump administration’s trade policy. In contrast, the Czech Republic, Serbia, and Romania are holding steady rates in light of mixed inflation and fiscal signals. In the US, fresh trade data on Tuesday is expected to show a narrowing goods-and-services deficit for June, after months of import declines. Services PMI from ISM will also give insight into the strength of the largest segment of the American economy. The July jobs report disappointed markets, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell held rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty. With Fed Governor Adriana Kugler announcing her early resignation, attention is now turning to who the White House might tap to replace her—and potentially succeed Powell in May. Global markets react as trade tensions and inflation data drive rate decisions Across Asia, a flurry of economic reports will shed light on how the region is coping with Trump’s Aug. 1 tariff escalation. Inflation updates from South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand are expected to show mostly contained pressures, giving room for more rate cuts. The second-quarter GDP from Indonesia and the Philippines will be closely watched, while export data from Vietnam, Australia, and China may reflect pre-tariff acceleration. A key chip exporter, Taiwan, will cap the week with fresh trade figures. In Europe, industrial and trade reports from Germany, France, Italy, and Spain could lead to revisions in GDP. Eurostat confirmed 0.1% quarterly growth for the eurozone in Q2. Meanwhile, Switzerland faces fallout from Trump’s 39% tariff, and inflation is expected to remain at 0.1%. Swedish inflation is forecast to surge past 3% on the CPIF measure, likely delaying further monetary easing. In Turkey, inflation may ease to 34% annually despite new price hikes, while the central bank remains on track to cut rates in September. Mexico’s central bank is poised for a 25bps cut in Latin America, its ninth straight, amid slowing inflation. Brazil, by contrast, is expected to remain on hold at 15%, with easing not likely before 2026. Colombia, facing fiscal strain and sticky inflation, will release its quarterly inflation report and central bank minutes. At the same time, CPI data from Chile and Mexico will help shape the region’s policy outlook.

The token could reach as high as $62.54 in 2028. By 2031, DCR is expected to trade at a maximum price of $192.64. Decred (DCR) is making waves in the crypto world, focusing on security and scalability and giving its community a real say in decisions. In recent times, it rolled out updates like improved privacy features and upgrades to its decentralized exchange, DCRDEX, which caught the attention of many. Thanks to its unique mix of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, Decred has built a reputation as a solid and innovative project. Let’s examine how its latest moves and market trends might impact its price in the future. Overview Cryptocurrency Decred Token DCR Price $15.83 Market Cap $268.31M Trading Volume $3.85M Circulating Supply 16.93M DCR All-time High $250.02 (Apr 16, 2021) All-time Low $0.3948 Dec 28, 2016 24-h High $16.59 24-h Low $15.12 Decred price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 16.22 (2.74%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.60% 50-day SMA $ 15.68 14-Day RSI 46.50 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days $ 13.59 Decred price analysis: DCR shows signs of consolidation with a tight range between support and resistance range-bound movement DCR is stuck between $15.66 and $16.09, showing indecision and lack of clear momentum. Strong resistance at $16.09 multiple failed attempts to break $16.09 confirm strong seller presence. Support holding at $15.66 price consistently bounces from $15.66, signaling buyer interest at lower levels. August 2, 2025, Decred (DCR) is trading at $15.76, showing a 0.88% decline over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is currently moving sideways, caught between a strong resistance at $16.09 and support at $15.66. With no clear breakout, the price remains stable within this range. DCR is still down 93.68% from its all-time high of $250.02, reached on April 17, 2021, but it is up 3902.82% from its all-time low of $0.3948 set on December 28, 2016. Decred 1-day timeframe: DCR struggles to break resistance as consolidation continues The daily chart for Decred shows a tight trading band with no breakout in sight. The price ranges between $15.66 and $16.09, reflecting a clear lack of directional bias. Attempts to breach $16.09 have failed multiple times, indicating heavy resistance at that level. This level has become a short-term ceiling that bulls have yet to reclaim. DCR/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 50, showing no signs of bullish or bearish divergence. The MACD is flat, suggesting a pause in the trend. Unless volume and volatility pick up, DCR is likely to remain trapped in this range. A breakout or breakdown from this channel will likely dictate the direction of the short-term trend. Decred 4-hour timeframe: DCR price compression points to imminent move On the 4-hour chart, DCR is trading near the lower boundary of the range, with several failed wicks above $16.00 highlighting weak bullish momentum. Price has tested the resistance area multiple times but lacks the volume to sustain upward moves. DCR/USDT Chart: TradingView Support at $15.66 remains active, absorbing repeated sell-offs and forming a base. Price is compressing between lower highs and horizontal support, a pattern that often precedes a breakout. Market participants are likely awaiting a volume spike before committing to positions Decred technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 14.86 BUY SMA 5 $ 15.87 SELL SMA 10 $ 16.40 SELL SMA 21 $ 16.64 SELL SMA 50 $ 15.68 BUY SMA 100 $ 15.11 BUY SMA 200 $ 13.59 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 16.39 SELL EMA 5 $ 15.94 SELL EMA 10 $ 15.05 BUY EMA 21 $ 13.89 BUY EMA 50 $ 13.03 BUY EMA 100 $ 13.12 BUY EMA 200 $ 13.65 BUY What to expect from Decred Decred (DCR) remains range-bound, trading between $15.66 support and $16.09 resistance, with no strong directional bias in the short term. The tight consolidation on both the daily and 4-hour charts suggests that a breakout or breakdown is likely in the near future. Price compression and repeated tests of both support and resistance levels indicate that momentum is building behind the scenes. If buyers manage to push DCR above the $16.09 resistance, the next short-term target could extend toward $16.50–$17.00. However, failure to break this level and a drop below $15.66 could open the door to downside moves, possibly toward $15.20 or lower. For now, traders should watch for increased volume and volatility as signals for the next decisive move. Is Decred a good investment? Decred (DCR) is a project known for its hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake governance model, offering strong community involvement and decentralized decision-making. While the current price action shows limited short-term momentum, the long-term fundamentals remain intact, particularly for investors who value on-chain governance and sustainability in blockchain protocols. That said, with DCR still down over 93% from its all-time high, the token remains in a prolonged bear phase. Short-term traders may find opportunities in volatility, mainly if a breakout above $16.09 occurs. However, for long-term investors, whether DCR is a good investment depends heavily on one’s belief in the project’s technical direction, governance structure, and real-world utility within the evolving crypto ecosystem. In summary, Decred offers strong fundamentals but weak near-term price action. Caution is advised, and potential investors should consider broader market conditions and risk tolerance before entering. Recent News Alchemy Pay has partnered with Decred to make the $DCR token easily accessible to users in over 173 countries through traditional payment methods like Visa, Mastercard, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. This strategic integration aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and Web3 by allowing seamless fiat-to-crypto conversions, significantly lowering entry barriers for mainstream users. Known for its hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus and strong community governance, Decred is now positioned for broader adoption beyond the crypto-native audience. The move underscores Alchemy Pay’s commitment to expanding its ecosystem and driving global crypto adoption by supporting a growing array of digital assets. Will Decred reach $50? Yes, Decred is projected to reach $50. By 2028, forecasts predict a minimum price of $51.27, showing that DCR can potentially exceed $50 during its growth trajectory. Will Decred reach $100? Yes, Decred is anticipated to reach $100. According to predictions for 2030, the cryptocurrency could minimum at $111.21, indicating a strong possibility of surpassing the $100 mark. Does Decred have a good long-term future? Decred (DCR) has a promising long-term future due to its strong fundamentals, including an innovative hybrid consensus mechanism that combines proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) for enhanced security and decentralization.

Recent market monitoring indicates BTC dipped below $112,000, trading at $111,964.01 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden downward movement sparks questions about the digital asset landscape’s immediate future. For both seasoned traders and new entrants, understanding these dynamics is crucial. What drives this downturn, and what might it signify for your portfolio? Let’s delve in. What Does the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for Investors? A Bitcoin price drop immediately ripples across the broader crypto ecosystem. As the largest digital asset, Bitcoin’s movements often dictate altcoin direction. When BTC declines, it typically pulls others down, leading to widespread portfolio adjustments and increased market anxiety. For investors, this means unrealized losses, especially for those who entered at higher prices. However, it also presents opportunities for strategic accumulation for long-term perspectives. Bitcoin is currently trading around $111,964.01. This level is a critical psychological and technical support. A sustained break below could signal further downward momentum, while a quick recovery indicates strong buying interest. The market is in flux, where every tick influences sentiment. Metric Value (Approx.) Significance Current Price $111,964.01 Recent trading level on Binance USDT. Previous Support Level $112,000 Key psychological and technical threshold. Market Sentiment Cautious/Bearish Driven by current downward price action. What Factors Contribute to a Bitcoin Price Drop? Several factors can trigger a significant Bitcoin price drop . Understanding these is essential for navigating crypto markets. It’s rarely a single cause, but a confluence of events. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global instability, inflation, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions lead investors to de-risk, selling speculative assets like crypto for safer havens. Regulatory Scrutiny: News of stricter regulations, bans, or increased tax pressures creates uncertainty and panic selling. Governments’ evolving stances significantly affect sentiment. Whale Movements: Large Bitcoin holders (“whales”) influence the market. A sudden large sale floods the market, causing rapid price decline. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: When key support levels break or bearish patterns emerge, trading systems and human traders sell, exacerbating downward pressure. The $112,000 level is a critical technical point. Negative News or FUD: “Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt” spreads rapidly. Reports of exchange hacks, project failures, or misinformation erode confidence and trigger sell-offs. How Have Past Bitcoin Price Drops Recovered? History provides context for a current Bitcoin price drop . Bitcoin has experienced numerous significant corrections and bear markets, only to recover and reach new all-time highs. These past cycles show the asset’s resilience and long-term adoption trends. For example, Bitcoin endured a massive bear market in 2018, falling from nearly $20,000 to around $3,000. In May 2021, it saw a substantial correction from its then-all-time high of over $60,000. In both instances, after consolidation, Bitcoin eventually regained upward momentum. This historical pattern suggests that while current dips are alarming, they are often part of Bitcoin’s volatile but generally upward long-term trajectory. Investors must differentiate between temporary corrections and fundamental market shifts. What Are Actionable Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Drop? Navigating a Bitcoin price drop requires a calm, strategic approach. Panic selling often leads to regret. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. This averages your purchase price, reducing volatility risk. Rebalance Your Portfolio: A downturn can be an opportune time to re-evaluate asset allocation. Adjust holdings to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. Conduct Thorough Research: Use this period to deepen understanding of your investments. Revisit whitepapers, assess development, and evaluate underlying technology. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders for active trading. For long-term investors, simply holding (“HODLing”) can be viable if conviction remains strong. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Follow reputable sources, but avoid constant market chatter. Focus on factual updates and long-term trends. What Does the Future Hold After This Bitcoin Price Drop? Predicting Bitcoin’s exact trajectory after a Bitcoin price drop is challenging, given the multitude of influencing factors. However, increasing institutional interest and broader adoption suggest underlying support even during volatility. Analysts will watch key metrics: trading volume, funding rates on perpetual futures, and macro indicators like inflation reports. A quick bounce back above $112,000 could indicate a false breakdown, while prolonged trading below this level might suggest further downside. Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains tied to its scarcity, decentralization, and increasing utility. The recent Bitcoin price drop serves as a potent reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. While unsettling, such dips are a normal part of asset cycles. For investors, the key is to approach these periods with a clear strategy, informed decisions, and a focus on long-term goals. By understanding causes, learning from history, and implementing sound risk management, one can navigate challenging times effectively and potentially position for future growth. The crypto journey is a rollercoaster; knowledge is your best seatbelt. The recent Bitcoin price drop is a common occurrence in crypto markets. Bitcoin Price Drop: Understanding the Recent Market Shock Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Price Drops Q1: Is this Bitcoin price drop a sign of a bear market? A: A single price drop doesn’t automatically signal a long-term bear market. It could be a short-term correction. A bear market is sustained downward trends over months. Q2: What should I do if my Bitcoin investment is losing value? A: Actions should align with your strategy. Options include holding, dollar-cost averaging, or rebalancing. Avoid emotional decisions. Q3: How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? A: Duration varies. Some corrections last days/weeks, others months. Historical data shows recoveries happen, but timelines are unpredictable. Q4: Can regulatory news cause a significant Bitcoin price drop? A: Yes, regulatory news is a major catalyst. New regulations, bans, or increased scrutiny can create uncertainty and fear, leading to rapid sell-offs and a notable Bitcoin price drop . Q5: Is it a good time to buy Bitcoin after a price drop? A: Many view a Bitcoin price drop as a “buy the dip” opportunity. However, it depends on your financial situation, risk appetite, and long-term outlook. Do your own research.

On Spartans.com, every user has access to a transparent activity log that covers both casino games and sportsbook wagers. It includes everything, settled bets, total winnings and losses, and crypto wallet transactions, all displayed in one easy-to-use dashboard. Whether you want to look back at your slot results or study your recent sports bets, Spartans gives you the tools to bet smarter. This step-by-step guide explains how to find and use your betting history and shows where to check if you’re eligible and ready to claim betting bonus rewards. Step 1: Log In & Head to Your Dashboard Start by logging into your Spartans account using your email and password. Once you’re in, go to your main dashboard. This is where you’ll manage your profile, crypto balance, and gameplay. Look for the betting history section, often labeled “History” or “My Activity.” Unlike sites that bury this info or require downloads, Spartans keeps it in one place. If you’re wondering how to claim betting bonus rewards, this section also shows your past deposits and wagers, key details in meeting bonus terms. Step 2: Use Filters to View Casino or Sportsbook Bets Inside your history page, Spartans lets you switch between casino and sportsbook logs. This is useful if you prefer one or want to review them separately. Casino history will show game names, amounts wagered, and individual outcomes. Sports history includes matches bet on, odds, stakes, and results. The option to view each type on its own helps you see where you’re winning, or losing. And for anyone checking how to claim betting bonus offers, these filters make it easier to find bets that qualify for promotions, like slots-only bonuses or sports bets with minimum odds. Step 3: Review Your Win & Loss Stats Spartans makes it easy to track your total wins and losses. Instead of manually calculating, your dashboard gives you a quick summary showing how much you’ve wagered and what your results are. This feature is perfect for managing risk and staying within your limits. It’s also a great tool if you’re following how to claim betting bonus guidelines that require you to reach a wagering goal, like a 10x playthrough. Seeing your progress in real time helps you stay focused. Step 4: Check Settled & Active Sports Bets If you bet on sports, Spartans splits your bets into two groups, settled and ongoing. Settled bets show the final result, payout, and odds. Ongoing bets update in real time as the event happens. This layout helps you stay on top of multiple wagers, especially if you’re betting live or managing parlays. And since some betting bonus offers are based on whether a bet is complete or not, this view helps you keep track of what qualifies and what’s still pending. Step 5: Track Crypto Activity & Wallet Movements Beyond bets, Spartans also records all wallet actions, deposits, withdrawals, bonuses, and deductions. Each transaction has a timestamp and wallet address (if relevant), so you know exactly what’s happening. If you’ve activated a bonus, like a welcome package or daily reward, checking how to claim betting bonus benefits depends on seeing when and how much was added. You’ll also find progress toward wagering requirements, which can help unlock withdrawals. Step 6: Use Your History to Adjust Your Strategy This tool isn’t just about tracking, it’s about improvement. For casino fans, it helps highlight which games are delivering the best returns. For sports bettors, it reveals what types of bets, sports, or leagues are paying off. Since every bet is time-stamped, you can analyze your results over different time frames, such as days, weeks, or months. If you’re serious about betting and bonuses, the betting history page supports both smart play and finding the best ways to claim betting bonus perks effectively. Wrapping Up Spartans.com gives you full access to your play history, from casino spins and sportsbook bets to all crypto wallet activity. With one clean, organized dashboard, players can manage their betting strategy and bonus rewards in one place. You can review trends, make better choices, and stay updated on promotion progress without switching screens or requesting reports. For players who want to stay in control and get the most out of every session, especially those looking into how to claim betting bonus offers, using the Spartans history tool is a must. On Spartans, transparency isn’t optional, it’s built in.

According to analysis from Perplexity AI, ADA could reach a value that would represent a 39x return from its current price of $0.7744—a move that would push the token well past its previous all-time high of $3.10. For traders seeking early exposure before the broader public catches on, this projection has sparked fresh optimism. At the time of writing, Cardano holds a market cap of $27.42 billion, ranking it as the 10th-largest crypto. While the token dipped nearly 6.7% over the past week, the bigger picture looks increasingly bullish as development ramps up and major events like the Midnight airdrop bring new attention to the ecosystem. A new altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has also started appearing on people’s radars for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward entries. Positioned as a politically-charged alternative to traditional memecoins, MAGACOIN is riding strong community momentum. With multiple presale rounds selling out in record time, analysts are now pointing to the project’s potential to deliver over 12,000% ROI . As the presale approaches its final stage, early buyers are rushing to secure a stake before the token lists on major exchanges. Why Analysts Are Still Bullish on ADA Despite recent dips, ADA has retained solid network growth and development activity. The upcoming upgrades in governance, scalability, and interoperability remain a central part of its roadmap. Combine that with rising speculation around potential U.S. ETF listings, and Cardano could be in the early stages of a new long-term accumulation phase. If ADA follows even a fraction of the AI model’s upper-bound forecast, a $5,000 position today could hypothetically reach nearly $195,000 by 2026 . Of course, those gains are far from guaranteed—but long-term holders are clearly betting on more than just hype. Conclusion Perplexity AI’s projection for Cardano reinforces growing confidence in its long-term potential . And as alternative tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE capture investor excitement with bold ROI targets and strong presale performance, the race for next-cycle gains is heating up.

33767162,[object Object],1754182851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Exchange Gate Debuts Trading Services In US As Regulatory Shift Bears Fruit,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-gate-debuts-spot-trading-services/,"In a recent announcement, cryptocurrency exchange Gate disclosed its intentions to roll out spot trading services in the United States. The trading platform , which was established in 2013, will now be opening its doors to US customers for the first time ever. Gate Joins Crypto Firms’ Influx Into The US In a media release dated August 1, Gate revealed that it has officially launched in the United States. The cryptocurrency firm claimed that it has tailored its spot trading services to meet US customers’ needs through a wide range of popular digital assets. This move to the US by Gate doesn’t seem random, especially considering the efforts of the US authorities to clarify and introduce new regulations within the digital asset landscape. In one such move, United States President Donald Trump signed the first crypto bill, the GENIUS Act, into law. Lin Han, founder of Gate, said about the move: The launch of Gate US marks a significant milestone in our global compliance and localized service strategy. We firmly believe the future of the crypto industry lies in deep integration with local markets. Gate Group remains committed to building a trusted global crypto service network—driven by technology and centered on the user. Interestingly, Gate is not the only digital asset firm to enter (or reenter) the US market in recent months. As reported by Bitcoinist , crypto exchange OKX reentered the United States after reaching a $505 million settlement deal with the US Department of Justice. The cryptocurrency firm is reportedly considering an initial public offering in the US. According to data from CoinGecko, Gate’s trading volume has taken a significant hit in the past 24 hours, falling by over 11% to around $5.82 billion. This decline in trading volume can be correlated with reduced investor activity due to the falling asset prices in the market. US To ‘Reshore’ Firms That Left: SEC Chair As seen with the recent influx or reentry of entities, the introduction of new, clear regulations seems to be having the expected positive results on the US digital asset landscape. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, in a recent interview, asked that the US “reshore the crypto businesses that fled” the country during the period of unclear regulations. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the US has entered a “golden age of crypto” as the Trump-led administration looks to unlock the potential of blockchain technology. “Start your companies here.

However, this almost-certain event took a different turn after the price of ETH suddenly succumbed to severe bearish pressure. On Friday, August 1, the Ethereum price suffered a significant downturn, briefly falling below the $3,500 mark. While this has cast doubts on the likelihood of ETH returning above the psychological $4,000 level and perhaps reaching a new all-time high, recent on-chain indicators suggest that the “king of altcoins” might not be done just yet. ETH MVRV Ratio In 7-Year Downtrend In a Friday post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci said that the Ethereum price might still have something in the tank despite its struggles going into the weekend. This evaluation is based on the MVRV ratio, which measures the ratio between an asset’s market capitalization and realized capitalization. Related Reading: XRP Is Set To Move Trillions — Banking CEO Drops Bombshell On Ripple’s Role In Tokenizing Finance The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, as the name suggests, is typically used to evaluate whether a cryptocurrency (ETH, in this case) is overvalued or not. According to on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, an overvalued asset usually has an MVRV ratio greater than 3.7 while a ratio below 1 indicates undervaluation. Kesmeci explained in his post that the ETH MVRV has been in a downtrend since 2018 and may be close to breaking it. However, as shown in the chart, Ether’s MVRV recently suffered rejection at a long-term resistance level — which explains the level of profit-taking seen in the past few days. Nonetheless, Kesmeci still expects Ethereum to still break this seven-year resistance level, considering the institutional interest being enjoyed by ETH at the moment. For instance, as the on-chain analyst duly noted, the US-based spot ETH ETFs have seen a record amount of capital inflows in the past few weeks. As for the altcoin’s movement, Kesmeci expects the Ethereum price to resume its upward trend as long as the MVRV ratio stays above the 365-day simple moving average (white). If this remains the case, a return above $4,000 for the second-largest cryptocurrency might then come sooner rather than later. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $3,523, reflecting a 5% decline in the past 24 hours.

This remarkable ascent, reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at an astonishing $113,000 on the Binance USDT market. Such a significant leap in the Bitcoin price has captured the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts globally, sparking discussions about the underlying forces driving this incredible rally and what it signifies for the future of digital assets. What’s Driving This Astounding Bitcoin Price Rally? When the Bitcoin price makes such a dramatic move, it’s rarely due to a single factor. Instead, a confluence of market dynamics, investor sentiment, and broader economic trends often contributes to such a powerful surge. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking to comprehend the cryptocurrency landscape. Several key drivers could be propelling the Bitcoin price to these historic levels: Increased Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds increasingly view Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Their entry into the market, often through large-scale purchases, injects substantial capital and lends credibility, significantly impacting the Bitcoin price . Macroeconomic Factors: In an environment of global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and quantitative easing, investors often seek alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, is increasingly seen as ‘digital gold,’ offering a hedge against traditional market volatility and currency devaluation. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s supply is inherently limited to 21 million coins. Periodic ‘halving’ events, which reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are minted, create a scarcity effect. This fundamental economic principle of limited supply meeting rising demand naturally puts upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Growing Retail Interest: While institutional money is significant, sustained retail investor interest also plays a vital role. Easier access to cryptocurrency exchanges, growing awareness, and the allure of potential gains can lead to widespread buying, contributing to the overall market momentum and lifting the Bitcoin price . Technological Advancements and Ecosystem Growth: Continuous improvements in Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as the Lightning Network for faster transactions, and the expansion of the broader crypto ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs) make Bitcoin more usable and integrated into the digital economy, enhancing its perceived value. Here’s a summary of potential drivers impacting the Bitcoin price : Driver Category Impact on Bitcoin Price Institutional Demand Significant capital inflow, legitimacy boost Inflation Hedge Increased demand as a safe-haven asset Supply Scarcity Reduced new supply meets rising demand Retail Participation Broadens market participation and buying pressure Technological Progress Enhances utility and long-term viability Is This Bitcoin Price Momentum Sustainable? While the current surge in Bitcoin price is exhilarating, a common question among investors is whether this momentum can be sustained. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and periods of rapid appreciation are often followed by corrections. However, the context of this particular rally might offer insights into its potential longevity. Consider these points regarding the sustainability of the current Bitcoin price trajectory: Market Maturity: The cryptocurrency market is far more mature now than in previous bull runs. There are more robust regulatory frameworks (in some regions), sophisticated trading instruments, and a deeper understanding of digital assets among traditional financial players. This maturity could lead to more stable growth patterns, though volatility remains inherent. Long-Term Hodlers: A significant portion of Bitcoin’s supply is held by long-term investors (known as ‘hodlers’) who are less likely to sell during price fluctuations. This strong holding behavior reduces selling pressure during dips and supports the long-term upward trend of the Bitcoin price . Potential for Profit-Taking: Naturally, as the Bitcoin price reaches new highs, some investors will choose to realize their gains. This profit-taking can lead to temporary pullbacks or corrections. These are normal market cycles and do not necessarily indicate an end to the bull run but rather a healthy consolidation. Global Economic Landscape: If global economic policies continue to favor asset inflation or if traditional markets face ongoing challenges, Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge could persist, providing a fundamental tailwind for its price. Innovation and Adoption: Continued innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem and broader real-world adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments, remittances, and other applications will reinforce its utility and intrinsic value, supporting its long-term growth. While short-term fluctuations are always possible, the underlying fundamentals and growing acceptance of Bitcoin suggest a strong foundation for its continued relevance and potential long-term appreciation. The journey of the Bitcoin price is a testament to its evolving role in the global financial system. Navigating the Bitcoin Price Landscape: Tips for Investors For those considering entering the market or expanding their existing portfolios, understanding how to navigate the volatile yet promising landscape of the Bitcoin price is crucial. Here are some actionable insights to help you make informed decisions: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing any capital, thoroughly research Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Understand its technology, use cases, risks, and market dynamics. Rely on credible sources and avoid making decisions based solely on social media hype. 2. Understand Volatility: The Bitcoin price is known for its significant price swings. Be prepared for substantial ups and downs. Invest only what you can afford to lose, as there is always a risk of capital depreciation. 3. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a large sum at once, consider investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the Bitcoin price . This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility and can lead to a lower average purchase price over time. 4. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a dominant force, it is wise to diversify your investment portfolio. This could include other cryptocurrencies, traditional assets like stocks or bonds, or real estate. Diversification helps spread risk and can protect your overall portfolio from significant losses if one asset class underperforms. 5. Secure Your Investments: Use reputable exchanges and strong, unique passwords. Consider using hardware wallets for larger holdings to enhance security. Be vigilant against phishing scams and other cybersecurity threats that target cryptocurrency holders. 6. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency market evolves rapidly. Keep up-to-date with market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Subscribing to reputable crypto news outlets and following expert analyses can provide valuable insights into the future of the Bitcoin price and the broader market. 7. Long-Term Perspective: Many successful Bitcoin investors adopt a long-term perspective. While short-term trading can be profitable for some, holding Bitcoin for several years often proves to be a more effective strategy for capital growth, allowing you to ride out market corrections and benefit from its overall upward trend. By adopting these principles, investors can approach the dynamic world of the Bitcoin price with greater confidence and a clearer strategy, aiming for sustainable engagement rather than reactive decisions. The astonishing rise of Bitcoin price to $113,000 marks a new chapter in crypto history. Bitcoin Price: Unveiling the Astounding Surge Above $113,000 The astonishing surge of the Bitcoin price above $113,000 is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of the growing mainstream acceptance and intrinsic value of digital assets. This milestone underscores Bitcoin’s resilience, its increasing role as a hedge against economic instability, and its potential to reshape the global financial landscape. While the journey of any asset, especially one as dynamic as Bitcoin, will always involve fluctuations, the current trajectory is a compelling testament to its enduring appeal and transformative power. As the world continues to embrace digital innovation, Bitcoin remains at the forefront, charting a course towards an exciting and potentially prosperous future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does it mean for the Bitcoin price to reach $113,000? Reaching $113,000 signifies a massive increase in the Bitcoin price , reflecting extremely strong market demand, increased investor confidence, and potentially a major shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. It represents a significant psychological and financial milestone. 2. What are the primary factors contributing to such a high Bitcoin price? Key factors include heightened institutional investment, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, its fixed and decreasing supply (due to halving events), growing retail interest, and continuous advancements in its underlying technology and ecosystem. 3. Is the current Bitcoin price sustainable, or should I expect a correction? While volatility is inherent in the crypto market, the current surge is supported by more mature market conditions and strong long-term holder sentiment. Short-term corrections are always possible as investors take profits, but the underlying fundamentals suggest potential for sustained growth in the Bitcoin price over the long term. 4. How can I invest in Bitcoin safely given its high price? To invest safely, conduct thorough research, understand the risks associated with volatility, consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate price swings, diversify your investment portfolio, and prioritize securing your assets using reputable exchanges and hardware wallets. 5. What role does institutional adoption play in the Bitcoin price? Institutional adoption plays a crucial role by bringing significant capital into the market and enhancing Bitcoin’s legitimacy. When large financial entities invest, it signals confidence, attracts more investors, and can lead to substantial upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Did you find this article insightful?

Despite periodic surges, the token remains shackled by the uncertainty surrounding its status, causing many traders to rethink their long-term strategies. As institutional and retail sentiment gravitates toward compliance-driven platforms offering genuine DeFi utility, a new contender is quietly gaining traction— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Defi Solution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance is emerging as a next-generation DeFi solution tailored for modern lending markets. At its core, it is a non-custodial protocol that enables users to lend blue-chip assets or borrow against them using overcollateralized smart contracts. For instance, a user locking $20,000 in ETH as collateral can instantly receive an overcollateralized loan in stablecoins, without any intermediaries. This setup offers borrowers immediate liquidity while preserving upside exposure to their held assets. What makes the ecosystem even more attractive is its automated interest rate structure. The borrowing costs and lending APYs dynamically shift based on the platform’s utilization rate. In the case of a P2C (Peer-to-Contract) setup, lenders providing USDT or DAI to the protocol are set to earn auto-adjusting APYs depending on liquidity demand. One clear example: a lender depositing $8,000 in USDT at 15% APY would earn $1,200 over 12 months, completely passively. Meanwhile, mtTokens—interest-bearing ERC-20 tokens issued 1:1 for each deposit—can be used or staked for additional rewards. As yields accrue automatically in these tokens, users benefit from uninterrupted compounding without needing to micromanage. Presale Entry at $0.035 Before Price Hikes and Major Catalysts Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at just $0.035, with 10% of the 170 million allocated tokens already claimed. The urgency to get in at this level is growing rapidly as the next price jump will raise it to $0.040—a clean 15% gain for early movers. With the listing price locked in at $0.06 and strong projections based on the protocol’s lending utility and passive yield generation, price appreciation toward $0.24 by Q1 2026 represents a 600% return for those entering now. Adding to its appeal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance plans to launch with beta functionality already integrated, ensuring immediate utility for participants. Unlike other tokens that debut with no product and delayed roadmaps, users are expected to engage with the protocol from day one—boosting both liquidity and demand. Security is a cornerstone of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. The platform is backed by a detailed CertiK audit featuring a Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. In parallel, a $50,000 bug bounty campaign remains active, encouraging ongoing scrutiny from white-hat developers and blockchain security experts. This level of transparency and preemptive security preparation is increasingly essential in the evolving regulatory climate. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance introduces an innovative buyback and dividend mechanism. Revenue generated by the protocol is earmarked for MUTM token buybacks, which will be redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens in the smart contracts. This aligns protocol success directly with user returns, reinforcing long-term commitment and minimizing token sell pressure. Layer-2 Integration The protocol’s upcoming Layer-2 integration is also expected to dramatically reduce gas fees while scaling throughput—critical components for sustaining long-term user growth and high-frequency lending transactions. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and growing community support, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already has over 12,000 followers on Twitter and continues to draw thousands of new eyes during this presale window. Traders looking for the next high-utility DeFi play with real product delivery, transparent risk management, and yield-generating mechanisms are increasingly rotating into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance. Given XRP’s continued regulatory ambiguity and its limited on-chain use case beyond remittances, MUTM’s multi-pronged DeFi model offers a clearer path to sustainable value. Analysts projecting a 10x to 14x return post-listing are basing their forecasts not on hype, but on utility adoption, platform usage, and an already-engaged investor base—over 14,700 holders and $13.7 million raised so far. With 90% of Phase 6 tokens still available and a $100,000 giveaway live—rewarding ten lucky users with $10,000 worth of MUTM each—the window for strategic positioning is still open, but not for long. Once Phase 7 begins, the price will rise, and the chance to ride the DeFi resurgence from the ground floor will shrink rapidly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token chasing trends—it’s a protocol being built for performance, resilience, and yield. For those seeking the next breakout star in decentralized finance, it’s time to shift the focus from courtroom drama to protocol-driven momentum.

As momentum builds across several emerging projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly entered the spotlight for savvy traders searching for high-upside plays before major exchange listings. XRP’s Legacy Sets the Standard XRP’s meteoric rise from pennies to multiple dollars set a precedent for what’s possible when institutional interest meets real-world utility. Despite legal battles and regulatory uncertainty, XRP remains one of the most recognized names in crypto. The token saw over 63,000% gains during its most explosive cycle—transforming modest holdings into life-changing fortunes . Many early XRP holders still credit that moment as their biggest crypto win. Now, speculation is growing that a new wave of utility-driven altcoins could follow a similar trajectory—and some analysts believe the next XRP-style story may already be unfolding. The Trending Project That is Gaining Traction Faster Than Expected One altcoin project drawing attention for its rapid acceleration is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which recently entered a high-demand presale phase. Investor models suggest major returns if current momentum continues—sparking comparisons to XRP entry points. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its community-fueled growth, combined with a real utility roadmap focused on expanding holder rewards and strategic integrations. The current presale round is almost fully subscribed, and multiple rounds have already sold out within hours , indicating massive demand from early adopters. Is It Really the “Next XRP”? While no project can perfectly replicate XRP’s path, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing some of the same early signs—explosive presale activity, community-driven hype, and market positioning that hints at potential listing on top-tier platforms. Crypto strategists point to these markers as typical precursors to major price runs. With presale prices still low , traders see this as a narrow window of opportunity before a broader launch inflates the entry cost.

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Algorand Symbol ALGO Current Algorand price $0.2261 Market cap $1.96B Trading volume $96.52M Circulating supply 8.69B All-time high $3.28 on Jun 21, 2019 All-time low $0.08761 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $0.2403 24-hour low $0.224 Algorand price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 18.25% 50-day SMA $0.2209 200-day SMA $0.1856 Sentiment Neutral Green days 17/30 (57%) Fear and Greed Index 55 (Greed) Algorand price analysis: ALGO faces resistance at $0.3 On Aug 2, ALGO’s price recovered by 23.18% in the last 30 days but dropped 4.57% in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume dropped by 26.43% in 24 hours to $96.18 M, signaling falling interest from traders. Algorand’s total value locked (TVL) dropped by 3.27% in 24 hours to $72.29M. Algorand 1-day chart analysis ALGOUSD chart by TradingView Algorand broke out upwards in July, a move that was accompanied by rising volatility. On July 15, it crossed into overbought territory. At its highest, it reached $0.34, a level last registered in February. The uptrend reversed into August as technicals pointed to profit-taking following a market overextension. ALGO faced rejection at $0.30 (near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.2959). The MACD histogram points to rising negative momentum. Algorand 4-hour chart analysis ALGOUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights ALGO’s rejection at $0.30. The level remains critical to whether it will continue with the earlier bull run. At current levels, the candles are short, typical of an indecisive market. Its volatility has also risen, but the momentum remains bearish.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO isneutral, with the fear and greed index showing a greed sentiment among investors. Price analysis shows a consolidating market after facing resistance at $0.3. Recent news Robinhood and Gemini exchanges recently launched tokenized stocks, sparking investor interest in this new type of asset. Against this backdrop, the blockchain chosen by issuers could become a fresh opportunity for investors. Right now, Algorand commands over 66% of the market share. However, the picture of market share in tokenized stocks could change if this trend keeps gaining momentum. Why is ALGO up? Algorand turned bullish last month as altcoins continued to outperform Bitcoin. Algorand, however, faced resistance at $30. Algorand’s rising RWA adoption also contributed to the rise. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.3313. The average price for the period will be $0.2500. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term.

Algorand historic price sentiment ALGO price chart by CoinGecko Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June. It crossed into August, trading at $0.22.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-03 01:55:00

However, a downward adjustment is expected on August 9, with projections pointing to a roughly 3% decrease, bringing difficulty down to 123.7 trillion, according to data from CoinWarz. Currently, the average block time sits at approximately 10 minutes and 20 seconds, slightly above the protocol’s 10-minute target. Difficulty adjustments help bring this time back in line by responding to changes in the total computing power, or hashrate, dedicated to mining. CryptoQuant data shows that mining difficulty declined throughout June, hitting a low of 116.9 trillion in early July. However, the trend reversed in late July, resuming the long-term upward trajectory tied to increased miner participation. Bitcoin’s soaring stock-to-flow ratio signals rising scarcity Bitcoin mining difficulty measures how hard it is for miners to find a valid hash for the next block. It adjusts every 2,016 blocks —roughly every two weeks—to maintain a steady block time of around 10 minutes, regardless of changes in network hashrate. When difficulty rises, mining becomes more expensive and less profitable unless BTC’s price also climbs. A drop in difficulty, on the other hand, offers miners short-term relief by making rewards easier to earn with the same equipment. Mining difficulty and network hashrate are critical not just for security but also for maintaining Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio —a key measure of scarcity. This ratio compares the existing supply of an asset to the rate of new supply entering the market. A high stock-to-flow ratio indicates that new production has a minimal impact on the overall supply, helping preserve price stability. BTC’s stock-to-flow ratio is currently higher than gold’s, making it “twice as scarce,” according to PlanB, the analyst who developed the stock-to-flow pricing model. With about 94% of its capped 21 million BTC already mined, Bitcoin boasts an estimated stock-to-flow ratio of 120, compared to gold’s 60. Silver, by contrast, was historically demonetized partly due to its much lower stock-to-flow ratio. When silver prices rise, more supply floods the market, pushing prices back down—a phenomenon Bitcoin is designed to resist. Bitcoin’s self-adjusting difficulty keeps block production steady and supply predictable Bitcoin’s protocol includes automatic difficulty adjustments roughly every two weeks. When more miners join the network and the hashrate rises, mining becomes harder, slowing down block production until the difficulty adjusts. The opposite happens when the hashrate drops—the difficulty is reduced to keep the average block interval close to 10 minutes. This mechanism ensures that BTC’s issuance remains predictable and avoids sudden supply shocks that could trigger market volatility. By adjusting the difficulty of matching available computing resources, the protocol maintains the assets’ inelasticity to production—one of the key attributes underpinning Bitcoin’s value proposition as “digital gold.” Bitcoin slips as Kimchi premium returns As mining difficulty prepares for a potential drop, Bitcoin’s price remains under pressure. Bitcoin slipped 3%, hitting an intraday low of $112,680, then bounced back. By 7:30 pm ET, BTC was at $113,375. South Korea was once again at a premium—$113,987, 0.84% higher than the global average—and the Kimchi premium was back after a nearly month-long absence. This premium often means rising domestic demand or region-specific regulatory issues. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin has a 61.4% market share.

BlockDAG is an exception. With $359 million raised, over 2.5 million users, and a presale approaching its final stage, BlockDAG has already attracted 4,500+ developers — and over 300 dApps are in progress. This early traction isn’t accidental. By offering EVM compatibility, a low-code contract builder, and live access to its testnet, BlockDAG has created an environment where developers can build now, rather than wait for post-launch tools. Combined with grants, hackathons, and upcoming DeFi infrastructure, the network is positioning itself as a serious builder-first ecosystem. Here’s why developers are choosing BlockDAG — even before its token, BDAG, is publicly traded. EVM Compatibility = Easy Onboarding BlockDAG is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) . That means smart contracts written in Solidity — the most widely used language in blockchain — can be ported directly to BlockDAG with little or no modification. For developers, this offers a zero-friction migration path . Tools like MetaMask, Remix, and Hardhat already work out of the box. Existing dApps, especially DeFi and NFT platforms, can deploy on BlockDAG and tap into higher transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Ethereum. This is key for adoption. Instead of competing with Ethereum, BlockDAG extends its ecosystem , giving developers familiar infrastructure with new performance capabilities . To further broaden participation, BlockDAG offers a low-code smart contract builder — a drag-and-drop interface for creating and deploying contracts without writing full code. This tool lowers the barrier for Web2 developers , entrepreneurs, and creators new to blockchain. With templates for token creation, staking, governance, and NFTs , BlockDAG enables fast prototyping and deployment. By reducing complexity, BlockDAG turns potential builders into active contributors , expanding the pool of dApp creators and driving faster ecosystem growth. Testnet Access and Early Builder Incentives BlockDAG’s live testnet allows developers to deploy and test smart contracts, validate transaction throughput, and explore node operations. The network processes up to 10 blocks per second , powered by a hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work model , delivering both scalability and security . To support builders, BlockDAG has rolled out developer grants and hackathons , with a goal to fund 1,000 dApps by 2026 . These incentives ensure that early developers are not only experimenting, but also funded to build at scale . Combined with a transparent six-week launch plan , developers know when tools will go live and how to integrate BDAG into their projects — from staking to DeFi. Beyond smart contracts, BlockDAG offers real infrastructure: Cold Wallet integration for secure token storage and dApp access X1 mobile miner app with 2.5M+ users for on-chain utility Demo Trading Platform with live BDAG purchases and demo sell features 20+ exchange listings confirmed post-launch This means dApps built on BlockDAG will launch into an ecosystem with real users , liquidity , and utility tools already active — not just promises. Developers Are Already Betting on BlockDAG BlockDAG is still in its presale phase, but for developers, it already offers the toolkit, audience, and incentives needed to build and scale. With 4,500+ developers onboard and growing, the ecosystem is taking shape before mainnet , ensuring a vibrant launch environment. In a space where many projects launch with empty chains, BlockDAG’s early focus on builder enablement may prove its most strategic move yet. For developers, the signal is clear: BlockDAG isn’t waiting — and neither are they.

With Bitcoin hovering below $116K and Ethereum settling after its ETF rally, many traders are rotating capital into high-potential plays. XRP is holding ground near $3.20, Solana just pushed above $200 following a network boost, and Dogecoin is aiming to reclaim $0.25 after a sharp correction. Yet, one standout doesn’t come from speculation; it comes from turning crypto use into daily value. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) isn’t just another storage tool. It gives users cashback for every action on-chain. Whether you’re holding, trading, or bridging, these are the best bullish cryptos of August worth watching. Each of them is gaining traction for a reason: utility, upgrades, or, in Cold Wallet’s case, delivering returns on what users already do every day. 1. Cold Wallet: Earn Every Time You Use Crypto In crypto, the cost of using your wallet can quickly add up. Gas fees, swaps, and transfers often feel like penalties. Cold Wallet flips this by rewarding users for every transaction. When you pay gas or swap tokens, you get cashback in CWT. The token is still in presale at just $0.00942, with a confirmed launch price of $0.35171 and future projections targeting $2. That combination of utility and upside is what puts Cold Wallet among the best bullish cryptos of August. The system is tier-based, holds more CWT, unlock better rewards. Bronze starts at 10% cashback, while Diamond users can earn up to 100% on gas. There’s no staking required and no token lockups. The presale includes 40% of the total 10 billion token supply, with a structured 150-stage rollout that increases the price at each stage. And since the wallet is already live and paying out USDT for referrals, this isn’t just theory; it’s working now. Cold Wallet is built to reward activity, not speculation, and that’s what makes it a smart, utility-driven pick this month. 2. Solana (SOL): Price Recovery & Network Growth Solana’s performance has turned heads. After consolidating under $180 for weeks, it surged to $197–$200+ following a 20% boost to block compute capacity through a recent upgrade. That improved throughput to 60 million compute units, making the network more attractive for large-scale applications. A $331 million purchase by Upexi, involving 1.8 million SOL, added fuel to the rally. Despite a 9.5% pullback on August 23 due to over $30 million in liquidations, SOL’s structure remains bullish. Chart patterns like the inverse head-and-shoulders and cup-and-handle formations are pointing to further movement, possibly toward $223 if support holds above $185. Analyst projections range from $400 to $700, with some even suggesting a $1,000 future target. Solana’s speed, ecosystem growth, and institutional appeal are keeping it firmly among the best bullish cryptos of August. 3. XRP: Price Support & ETF Expansion XRP has been making moves this month. After peaking near $3.57, it corrected to around $3.18, largely due to a $175 million transfer by Ripple’s co-founder that unsettled some investors. Still, technical support remains intact, with analysts targeting $5 to $6 before year-end. The ETF narrative is pushing XRP even further. A ProShares Ultra XRP ETF is now live, and U.S. regulatory updates are making institutional adoption more viable. Chart patterns are also showing strength. Bullish flags and SMA crossovers on the weekly chart suggest another breakout could be forming. Some analysts are pointing to a long-term target of $15. XRP stays on the list of best bullish cryptos of August for its clear fundamentals: liquidity, rising institutional engagement, and strong chart setups. It’s not just surviving the cycle, it’s building momentum with serious backing. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still Holding Momentum & Attention Dogecoin entered August strong, climbing from $0.255 to $0.271 before dipping back to the $0.24 range. That 11% drop hasn’t pushed it out of focus, especially as institutional players accumulated more than 1.08 billion DOGE, around $250 million worth. Volume also surged, confirming continued interest even during corrections. DOGE is now testing support at $0.23, but analysts are watching for a bounce to $0.25–$0.28. A move above $0.30 could shift sentiment quickly. ETF chatter is still speculative, but growing. Short-term forecasts range from $0.35 to $0.70, and some stretch to the $1 mark if market sentiment aligns. DOGE stays listed among the best bullish cryptos of August, not just for its meme status, but for its ability to capture liquidity, trading volume, and institutional flows when momentum returns. Choosing Among the Best Bullish Cryptos This month, altcoins are setting their own pace. XRP is building institutional pathways, Solana is scaling and performing technically, and Dogecoin is still drawing serious attention with high-volume moves. But Cold Wallet offers a different path. It doesn’t rely on speculation; it rewards your actions. With cashback already live, a presale entry at $0.00942, and a planned launch at $0.35171, the potential return is clear. The future $2 target adds even more incentive. If you’re exploring the best bullish cryptos of August, focus on tokens delivering real value. Cold Wallet pays you to use crypto. XRP is gaining strength through ETFs. Solana is scaling effectively, and DOGE still knows how to move the market.

With Bitcoin consolidating and sentiment shifting back toward high-growth assets, eyes are turning to mid-cap tokens that could explode in the coming weeks. Urgency is building—final slots in select presales and early positions are vanishing fast, as capital flows into projects that offer both upside and narrative strength. One of the tokens drawing quiet but growing interest is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to gain traction among early-stage investors. As crypto momentum builds, this lesser-known project is getting flagged for its huge potential . SUI’s Technicals Flash Oversold, Reversal Possible SUI, currently trading around $3.78, has retraced slightly after topping near $4.50 earlier this month. The 2-hour RSI shows readings near 31.62, suggesting short-term oversold conditions. This aligns with a pattern seen in prior rallies, where RSI dips below 35 have led to sharp price recoveries. Market cap remains solid at $13.08 billion, with daily trading volume over $1.38 billion, reflecting strong interest even during pullbacks. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Early-Stage Buzz While many traders are chasing already-pumped tokens, early entrants are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely. The project has seen presale engagement surge, with final slots expected to fill quickly. Backed by a politically energized community and a growing roadmap of utilities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining comparisons to the most successful projects in the space. Urgency grows as investors look to lock in allocations before listings hit major exchanges, potentially opening the door for massive ROI for early adopters . Toncoin Shows Strength After Breakout Toncoin, trading at $3.33, has quietly climbed over the past week with a 4.47% gain, outperforming broader altcoin indexes. Its RSI remains balanced around 57.34, showing healthy momentum without overbought signals. With a market cap now over $8 billion and rising interest following recent ecosystem updates, Toncoin is being positioned as one of the more stable bets in the current altcoin rotation. Continued bullish price action above $3.20 could reinforce its uptrend. Conclusion: This Altcoin Rotation May Be Just Getting Started With traders shifting out of stagnant tokens and into high-potential altcoins , the window for early gains is narrow. SUI’s oversold reading, TONcoin’s price strength, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapidly filling presale are flashing opportunity signals for those ready to act. As the market wakes up, the biggest returns may favor those who enter just before the next wave hits.

Altcoin season may be on the horizon, and historically, this is when early movers see the highest returns . One presale making waves right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has eclipsed all previous cycles in demand, drawing major attention from early-stage investors. 1. Stake and Earn While You Sleep Staking remains one of the most popular ways to generate passive income in crypto. Platforms like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) offer 4% to 8% annual yields for simply locking your tokens and helping secure their networks. With easy-to-use wallets like Daedalus and Phantom, even beginners can stake safely and watch their holdings grow over time. 2. Participate in Presales and IDOs Getting in early through presales and IDOs can offer 10x to 100x potential returns—if you choose wisely. Successful projects tend to have transparent tokenomics, a clear roadmap, and an active community. Launchpads like DAO Maker and CoinList are common places to discover these early opportunities before the tokens hit public markets. This Presale Is Breaking Records for Investor Demand In the current wave of altcoin opportunities, one presale is standing out from the pack. The ongoing round has already surpassed all previous cycles in participation, with investor interest hitting new highs. Community momentum continues to build, and some analysts are projecting that $2,100 invested today could potentially grow to $25,000 —a bold sign of what could come next if early demand sustains. 3. Hunt for Airdrops Crypto airdrops have proven time and time again to be incredibly lucrative. Users who interacted with platforms like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet were rewarded with thousands of dollars in free tokens. Staying active on Ethereum Layer 2s, bridging assets, and using emerging dApps are often key to qualifying for these giveaways. 4. Accumulate During Dips Volatility is a feature of crypto, not a bug. Many seasoned investors use dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to accumulate during downturns. This strategy helps reduce risk while steadily building positions—especially in altcoins that are down but not out. Timing the bottom isn’t necessary when you’re focused on the long game. Conclusion: Crypto is full of profit potential—but it rewards those who act early and think smart. Whether you’re staking, catching airdrops, or diving into presales, the real gains go to those who prepare before the hype hits. With MAGACOIN FINANCE smashing previous demand records , many believe it’s the most promising presale in the market right now—and potentially one of the best-positioned altcoins heading into the next bull run .

With Ethereum approaching the $4,000 mark and Solana hovering near $180, investors are comparing the two for leadership in the next bullish leg. But while these giants battle for dominance, another project—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is quietly drawing early-stage attention for those looking beyond the obvious names. Ethereum Shows Strength Into Q3 Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at $3,801, up 1.48% in the past 24 hours and 5.42% over the last week. The token’s momentum is being fueled by surging institutional interest, with over $5.4 billion in ETF inflows recorded this month. On-chain data also shows aggressive whale accumulation, with large holders scooping up more than $4 billion in ETH. The rally has been steady, supported by solid fundamentals and a favorable technical setup. RSI indicators remain balanced, showing room for growth without signaling overbought conditions. As a result, Ethereum is once again being positioned as the altcoin market’s pace-setter. Away from the headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own breakout story. The project’s current presale round has eclipsed all previous cycles in demand , with retail and strategic buyers moving in rapidly. Investors are already eyeing amazing returns if the growth curve mirrors early-stage altcoin cycles like SHIBA or PEPE. As major exchange listings loom, access is tightening fast, making early entry more urgent than ever. Solana Faces Pullback After Strong Rally Solana (SOL), now trading at $179.42, is down nearly 6% on the week, even as its long-term chart remains bullish. The RSI reading is slipping below 37, often a sign of oversold conditions, though no strong rebound has formed yet. SOL had previously pushed above $200 but has since retreated as traders rotated profits elsewhere. Despite its drop, Solana maintains a sizable market cap of $96.5 billion, keeping it firmly in the large-cap category. Still, in the current cycle, Solana is showing less resilience compared to Ethereum’s sustained strength. Conclusion In summary, Ethereum appears to be regaining its leadership role thanks to strong ETF inflows and growing institutional demand. Solana, while still relevant, is showing signs of cooling in the short term. But for those seeking explosive potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about presale opportunities this year —mirroring the kind of early interest that preceded some of crypto’s biggest success stories .

This Altcoin Could Deliver 34x Returns,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-to-10-this-altcoin-could-deliver-34x-returns/,"XRP is back in the spotlight after an explosive rally in July pushed the token above $3.10 for the first time in years. With renewed optimism surrounding the long-awaited ETF decision and legal clarity slowly emerging, investors are now wondering whether $10 is finally on the horizon. Some analysts believe it is. Major investment newsletters have started calling XRP one of the few legacy altcoins with enough liquidity and momentum to make a serious move in this cycle. While Bitcoin takes a breather, XRP is quietly building strength with growing whale activity and steady volume near $7 billion a day. This comes as MAGACOIN FINANCE begins attracting attention from savvy investors looking to diversify before the next big breakout . XRP’s Path to $10 The token’s latest breakout saw a vertical rise from under $2.00 to over $3.60 before settling near the $3.13 range. This performance has reignited talk of XRP reaching double digits—a feat that would require a 3x from current levels. With ETF speculation heating up and the token now a confirmed participant in the upcoming Midnight airdrop, the momentum could build quickly. Why This New Contender Is Gaining Traction While XRP commands headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building something big in the background. With 34x reward potential flagged by multiple top-tier newsletters, the token is becoming a standout in early-stage investing circles. What’s fueling the buzz is not just hype—it’s performance. The most recent presale round closed in record time, and analysts are pointing to the fastest growth curve since the early days of SHIBA INU. For investors who missed previous cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being framed as the comeback opportunity . Will XRP Sustain Its Momentum? Despite the strong rally, XRP still faces resistance around $3.60 and psychological pressure near the $5 mark. However, the technical structure remains bullish, and several macro catalysts—including regulatory announcements and institutional inflows—could tilt sentiment sharply. If the current pace holds, a $10 target by late Q4 2025 isn’t out of the question. Conclusion XRP has reentered the race with strong tailwinds, and investor optimism is rising. But for those chasing bigger upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its 34x return potential and explosive presale data. With early access windows closing fast, smart money is moving quickly to get in before the next leg up.

Both projects have seen a major technical rebound, supported by a surge in monthly RSI and strong community momentum. As crypto analysts highlight these top movers, investor attention is also turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising project gaining traction following a recent blockchain audit that ranked it among the safest plays in the altcoin space . Hedera Hashgraph Sees Technical Breakout Hedera (HBAR) has surged over 71% this month alone, breaking above $0.25 for the first time since its 2022 slump. Its long-term chart shows a strong reversal pattern, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has jumped to 61.91, suggesting bullish momentum may continue. Volume has been rising, reinforcing the view that HBAR may be setting up for a bigger rally. With a 304% return YTD, Hedera is quickly returning to the spotlight. New Contender Gets the Spotlight Following a successful blockchain audit that confirmed its code security and smart contract integrity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a top-tier safety play in the altcoin sector. The audit fueled a fresh wave of investor confidence, sparking one of the most active weeks of new wallet creation and presale participation to date. With strong momentum, expanding utility, and a fast-growing community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a high-reward option backed by strong fundamentals. Those securing a presale position now are getting in before the next wave of listings—where price discovery could push returns to record levels. Stellar’s Rebound Mirrors HBAR’s Rise Stellar (XLM) has also posted a massive recovery, jumping to $0.40 and clocking a 296% gain from its cycle lows. Its RSI is nearly identical to Hedera’s at 61.83, suggesting that bullish sentiment is not limited to one project. After years of quiet development, Stellar is now reclaiming investor attention as the network’s low fees and cross-border capabilities attract new use cases. Conclusion: The resurgence of HBAR and XLM is not just about past performance—it’s a sign that smart capital is flowing into high-utility projects with upside still ahead. As both coins gain steam, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a fresh entry with audit-backed trust and growing adoption, giving forward-looking investors another serious contender to watch.

This new product allows everyday users to participate in SHIB-linked rewards programs designed to shorten tenures and increase returns—especially as SHIB’s utility and adoption continue to expand globally. This development comes amid growing interest in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which has evolved from its initial meme coin into a broader decentralized platform with its own Layer 2 blockchain, NFT projects, and expanding payment integrations. By offering structured contracts centered around SHIB, DLMining aims to provide users with easier access to one of the most sought-after and accessible digital assets on the market. Learn more about Shiba Inu Coin Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, Shiba Inu Coin is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB has evolved from its humble beginnings as a meme coin into a decentralized ecosystem supported by a large and active community, the ShibArmy. SHIB consistently ranks among the highest-valued cryptocurrencies, with millions of holders worldwide. With this continued interest, DLMining ‘s newly launched SHIB-based contracts aim to provide users with a simplified way to participate in the asset’s short-term potential without having to navigate a complex trading environment. Broader Ecosystem Shiba Inu now forms the foundation of a broader ecosystem, including: LEASH: Originally a rebase token, LEASH has been repositioned as a store of value within the Shiba ecosystem. Its limited supply of 107,646 tokens has attracted significant investor interest. ShibaSwap: Launched in 2021, ShibaSwap allows users to stake SHIB, redeem it for cryptocurrencies, and earn passive rewards, helping to differentiate SHIB from other meme tokens. Shibarium: The team launched Shibarium in 2023, a Layer 2 blockchain designed to reduce gas fees and increase transaction speeds. The platform currently supports a growing number of DApps, NFTs, and DeFi integrations, enhancing the overall utility of SHIB. With these developments, SHIB’s use cases continue to expand. Platforms like DLMining are building this ecosystem by enabling contract-based participation that is closely tied to SHIB’s evolving role. Market Overview – July 2025 As of the end of July 2025, key SHIB metrics include: Price: $0.00001875 Market Cap: ~$7.5 billion 24-hour Trading Volume: ~$1.14 trillion Total Supply: 1 quadrillion (a significant portion has been burned) Market momentum remains stable in 2025, thanks to SHIB’s comprehensive coverage across major exchanges, wallet integrations, and POS platforms. The ecosystem’s expanding functionality, particularly related to Shibarium, supports long-term investor confidence. DLMining’s products for SHIB reflect this stability and offer users an option to gain investment opportunities over a shorter timeframe through structured contracts. Real-World Usage and Payment Integrations SHIB’s adoption as a payment method has significantly increased. Through integrations with platforms like BitPay, NOWPayments, and Shopping.io, SHIB is now accepted by a growing number of online merchants, retailers, and service providers, including those in the travel industry. This expansion highlights SHIB’s transformation from a speculative asset to a viable medium of exchange. This real-world utility has created a broader user base for SHIB—something DLMining seeks to support by making SHIB-related digital contracts accessible through mobile platforms. Development Roadmap and Future Initiatives Shibarium outlined several upcoming developments designed to enhance the ecosystem: SHIB: Metaverse: A virtual environment that allows users to build, trade, and socialize using SHIB tokens. NFT Expansion: Continued support for Shiboshis, SHIB’s NFT collection, and integration with the broader metaverse. Shibarium Growth: Onboarding more third-party DApps and projects. Token Burning: Ongoing deflationary mechanisms for SHIB, LEASH, and BONE tokens. The ecosystem’s evolution also informs the creation of new utility-focused products, such as DLMining’s short-term SHIB contracts, which allow users to explore SHIB’s growth potential without requiring deep technical knowledge. Participate through DLMining In line with SHIB’s growing influence, DLMining’s new SHIB-exclusive contracts are designed to facilitate limited-time participation in SHIB’s market dynamics. Building on the success of similar products based on Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin, these contracts aim to provide users with short-term investment opportunities with potential returns based on market trends. New users receive a $15 bonus upon registration. Continued Interest in SHIB in 2025 Investors continue to show interest in SHIB for the following reasons: Low Barrier to Entry: SHIB’s low price makes it accessible to a wide range of investors. Continuous Development: Unlike many meme tokens, Shiba Inu continues to evolve through new use cases and platform upgrades. Real-World Integration: Adoption in payments, DeFi, and the virtual world strengthens SHIB’s value proposition.

The decline was driven by heightened institutional selling pressure, with volumes during the heaviest selling window more than doubling the daily average. Price action suggests potential exhaustion near $2.75, though broader macro and liquidity risks remain elevated. What to Know XRP saw peak sell pressure between 14:00–18:00 on August 2, with volumes reaching 222.24 million—183% higher than the 24-hour average of 78.52 million. The asset bottomed at $2.75, forming short-term support on heavy volume. Recovery attempts stalled at $2.84, with the final hour of trading closing at $2.82, indicating consolidation below key resistance. Volume-weighted price activity suggests accumulation interest at sub-$2.80 levels, but confirmation is lacking. News Background The XRP drawdown came amid widening global trade tensions and renewed tariff uncertainty that shook risk markets across the board. Meanwhile, institutional portfolios appeared to rebalance as macro conditions prompted capital rotation away from altcoins and into more liquid assets. Analysts point to ongoing adjustments by central banks and heightened geopolitical risk as catalysts for the broader sell-off. Price Action Summary High: $3.02 Low: $2.75 Close: $2.82 24H Range: $0.27 (-8.91%) Technical Analysis A volume climax at $2.75 coincided with XRP’s most aggressive hourly decline, typically a signal of capitulation or local bottoming. The $2.75–$2.76 zone now serves as first-layer support, while upside attempts are capped near $2.84. Volume fell sharply in the final hour of trading to ~650,000/min, compared to 3.7 million/min at peak, implying buyer fatigue or neutral flows post-dump. What Traders Are Watching Can XRP hold above $2.75–$2.76 and build a base for recovery, or does failure to reclaim $2.85+ indicate further downside? Watch for institutional inflows or continued exchange outflows, which may validate accumulation narratives. Traders are also closely tracking CD20 Index volatility and macro headlines, including U.S.-China trade developments, for short-term cues.",Markets|XRP|News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-03 05:33:52

They’re quietly accumulating positions in a fresh batch of meme coins that could dominate headlines in the coming months. With sentiment heating up, four projects have stood out as the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to rising social buzz, strong communities, and unique narratives. While some of these coins are already riding market momentum, one is still in its early whitelist phase, attracting serious attention for offering early access perks. Let’s dive into the four picks that crypto whales are watching for massive upside potential. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Whitelist-Only Access to the Bulls’ Den There’s one project that hasn’t launched yet, and that’s exactly why it’s getting flagged by insiders. MoonBull is quickly emerging as one of the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to its whitelist-only access model and intense buildup ahead of launch. This Ethereum-based meme coin was made for degens chasing breakout gains. But unlike other tokens flooding the market, MoonBull isn’t offering a public presale. Only whitelisted users can join the launch, and here’s what makes that a big deal: Lowest possible entry price for early adopters Secret staking rewards reserved only for whitelisted wallets Bonus token allocations that aren’t publicly disclosed Private roadmap hints available exclusively to early community members In short, the project is keeping its cards close, and that exclusivity is creating serious momentum. The idea? Get whitelisted or miss your shot. The signup process is simple: users drop their email into the secure whitelist form and get a private alert ahead of Stage One. Why This Coin Made the List MoonBull’s structure is tailor-made for big moves. With limited access, a capped supply, and early-stage excitement building, it’s no wonder that crypto whales have started circling early. It’s not just another meme coin, it’s a ticket into a high-energy ecosystem that’s primed for an explosive start. 2. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): Solana’s Viral Tribute to a Fallen Hero Meme coins often reflect the culture of the moment, and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a perfect example. Launched on the Solana blockchain, this token is a tribute to a real-life squirrel named Peanut, whose story captured the internet’s attention and sparked a viral movement. What makes PNUT stand out isn’t just its narrative, but how it’s turned emotional resonance into community action. The project channels public sentiment into something tangible: a meme coin that doubles as a symbol of animal advocacy. Its performance on Solana has been steady, and its meme appeal continues to pull in new supporters. Forums, TikTok, and X have been keeping PNUT alive in the conversation as the broader market eyes new narratives. Why did this coin make it to this list? PNUT combines a powerful backstory with a growing user base, making it one of the best meme coins in 2025 for emotional engagement and long-term potential. 3. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): A Gospel of Memes and AI on Solana Next up is Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), a Solana meme coin that’s turning heads with its hilarious and chaotic “Goat Gospel” theme. Powered by a custom AI bot known as the Truth Terminal, GOAT delivers a daily dose of internet chaos, humor, and meme prophecy. This project leans fully into meme culture, embracing randomness and absurdity as a virtue. It doesn’t pretend to have traditional utility, its entire value proposition is entertainment, virality, and the strength of its community. GOAT has built a devoted cult following, and its unique approach is keeping it relevant in a sea of meme clones. Why did this coin make it to this list? GOAT is one of the best meme coins in 2025 for its commitment to pure meme energy and viral AI-generated storytelling, a combo that’s clearly working. 4. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana’s Cult Classic With Pink Hat Power Dogwifhat (WIF) might sound silly at first, and that’s exactly the point. Born from a Shiba Inu wearing a pink hat, WIF has grown into a cultural icon on Solana. It doesn’t offer staking or burning mechanisms, and it doesn’t claim to solve complex problems. What it does offer is a passionate community and consistent attention on social platforms. WIF has proven that even simple concepts can lead to big runs, as long as the community stays active and the memes keep flowing. It’s been one of Solana’s standout meme coins, and it’s still getting volume. Why did this coin make it to this list? WIF earns its spot among the best meme coins in 2025 by showing how meme strength and community loyalty can build lasting relevance without needing utility. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, the best meme coins in 2025 are MoonBull , Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), and Dogwifhat (WIF). While each has its own distinct personality, one stands out for offering early access perks that no other project can match. MoonBull is still in its whitelist phase, and that makes it uniquely positioned for high potential gains. With exclusive benefits, limited spots, and a stealth-mode rollout, MoonBull offers the kind of opportunity traders dream of, but only if they act fast. The clock’s ticking. The bulls are charging. Will you be there when MoonBull lifts off? For More Information: Website : https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram : https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter : https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs What makes MoonBull different from other meme coins? MoonBull offers whitelist-only access, meaning early users get in at the lowest price with exclusive staking rewards and bonus tokens before the public ever sees it. Why are analysts watching these meme coins in 2025? These coins combine strong community support, narrative appeal, and bullish momentum, three key ingredients analysts consider for potential moonshots. How can I join the MoonBull whitelist? Visit the project’s official site and submit your email using the secure whitelist form. Once confirmed, you’ll get a private alert before Stage One begins.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $110,621, beginning a bearish trend to $107,181. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as sellers triggered strong pressure toward $114K. The recent highs triggered strong selling demand among holders. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $812.25 million in net outflows on Friday, marking the second-largest single-day loss in the history of these products. Bitcoin price prediction August 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $123,000, making July its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction August 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-03 05:50:00

With institutional confidence returning and the U.S. regulatory climate turning more favorable, market participants are preparing for what could be another major rally. Early indicators point to a quiet accumulation phase—especially among crypto whales—focused on one emerging opportunity that’s quickly drawing attention. One of those projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has emerged as a clear standout. Its momentum is fueled by surging demand and early allocation phases that are closing faster than expected, signaling that whales aren’t waiting around for broader access. XRP Sees Renewed Momentum as Regulatory Fog Clears XRP has regained its footing after a turbulent year, with recent data showing a rise in both liquidity and trading volume. Whales in particular have resumed accumulation, suggesting renewed confidence in Ripple’s legal clarity and the potential for new financial products involving XRP. On the derivatives side, XRP perpetual futures have overtaken Solana on multiple exchanges—a key indicator of growing speculative interest. Spot prices have also surged in response to positive market sentiment tied to potential institutional partnerships and broader crypto-friendly U.S. policies. Analysts are watching for a decisive move above the $3.60 mark to confirm bullish continuation. While XRP attracts traders with strong fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where many early investors see explosive potential . With access windows closing rapidly, a growing number of whales are moving capital into the project before it reaches large-scale visibility. Momentum has grown to the point that allocation rounds are selling out faster than expected , leaving latecomers scrambling. This pattern of fast-paced participation resembles what was seen during the early surges of now-legendary tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s expanding community, fast-paced growth, and comparison to SHIBA INU’s early days make it a top candidate for high-yield speculation. According to multiple trend trackers, entry points available now are unlikely to last long— timing is critical . Whales Are Positioning Themselves Early With crypto markets heating up again, experienced players are combining stability bets like XRP with high-ROI bets like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This two-pronged strategy of risk-balanced investing is becoming increasingly common, particularly among large-scale holders looking to front-run retail inflows. Whale tracking wallets have shown that some of the same XRP addresses accumulating during the 2020–2021 cycle are now deploying capital into low-cap altcoins, signaling that the smart money is already positioning itself for the next breakout. Conclusion XRP’s resurgence amid a friendlier U.S. crypto climate is attracting both traders and long-term holders. However, it’s the parallel whale activity in MAGACOIN FINANCE that has drawn the most intrigue from market watchers. With entry phases closing rapidly and investor interest at all-time highs , this altcoin is shaping up to be a rare opportunity ahead of its full-scale debut.

While these dominant names attract attention, traders are now gravitating toward newer Layer 1 projects offering better utility and growth potential. One project gaining serious traction is BlockDAG. It stands apart from typical presales by showcasing a live testnet, 2 million+ active mobile miners, and over 4,500 developers building real dApps. Currently priced at only $0.0016, BDAG promises a staggering 3,025% ROI, with early buyers already witnessing a 2,660% surge since batch 1. This price holds until August 11th, adding urgency for buyers. BlockDAG’s ecosystem is already active and features a “NO VESTING PASS” offer, giving users full token access at launch. In this article, we’ll stack up Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and BlockDAG to see which ones stand among the top cryptos to buy today. BlockDAG (BDAG) Few projects have managed to turn heads the way BlockDAG (BDAG) has. With presale funding exceeding $359 million and over 24.6 billion coins sold, this project is gathering steam as it nears its global rollout. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0016, which stays active until August 11th, while the official listing price remains $0.05, a setup that offers a powerful 3,025% profit window. BDAG has already delivered 2,660% gains to early supporters since batch 1. The “NO VESTING PASS” sweetens the deal, allowing holders to unlock 100% of their coins immediately upon launch. But what truly separates BlockDAG is its existing infrastructure, a fully functioning testnet, over 2 million miners using the X1 app, and 18,000+ plug-and-play X10 miners sold. With more than 300 applications already in development from 4,500+ builders, BlockDAG’s traction speaks volumes. This isn’t just an idea, it’s a full-blown, ready-to-use ecosystem, making it one of the top cryptos to buy today based on current momentum, structure, and timing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto market and continues showing strong upward signs. The recent 3% rise over 24 hours brings ETH close to the $4,000 zone. What’s fueling this? A massive $1.59 billion in ETF inflows within a week, plus heightened interest from institutions. Following a low of $3,530 in late July, ETH has surged over 61% in the past month. The reduction in exchange balances, down more than 1 million ETH in 30 days, points to reduced sell pressure. Options traders are equally optimistic, with calls far outpacing puts and target ranges between $4,000 and $6,000. While it’s a strong performer, Ethereum’s maturity could limit fast gains. For those who want explosive growth potential rather than gradual returns, newer options like BlockDAG may currently offer better upside. Still, ETH retains its place among the top cryptos to buy today for reliability and long-term value. Polygon (MATIC / POL) MATIC is staying relevant in discussions about the top cryptos to buy today. With a trading price near $0.2166 and a modest 2.6% gain, Polygon remains in motion. A notable 141% jump in USDC transfers confirms its strong presence in stablecoin and scaling infrastructure. Polygon hasn’t made headlines this week, but its zkEVM development and continuing partnerships keep the momentum alive. Current trading volume stands around $280 million, and price charts show strong consolidation between $0.40 and $0.42, signaling potential breakout if metrics align. That said, while Polygon is steady, some might view newer presale-stage cryptos like BlockDAG as more attractive for short-term gains. MATIC remains part of the top cryptos to buy today, but buyers chasing higher ROI may look elsewhere. Avalanche (AVAX) AVAX has seen a strong 6% price jump in the last 24 hours, climbing to about $26.40 with daily trading volume over $1.1 billion. The push is largely linked to ETF rumors and the successful launch of the Octane upgrade, which cut C-Chain gas fees by 42.7% and enhanced performance. Avalanche is also prioritizing security and development. Octane Security, which is now active, brings AI-driven audits into the dev workflow, reducing bugs and deployment risks. This has made AVAX more attractive to builders. Meanwhile, derivatives markets show growing open interest, with $835 million currently locked in. Still, compared to BlockDAG’s early-stage price and live features, Avalanche might not deliver the same explosive ROI. While AVAX is dependable, those searching for top cryptos to buy today with higher upside potential may favor BDAG’s offering. Final Take! Choosing among the top cryptos to buy today depends on your appetite for stability versus speed. Ethereum continues to dominate headlines and institutional flows, Polygon offers scalable tech, and Avalanche is turning heads with its development stack. But BlockDAG combines key elements like adoption, working products, and one of the most appealing presale prices in the market. With batch 29 priced at $0.0016 until August 11th, and a 3,025% return window leading up to the $0.05 listing, the math is hard to ignore. Add in the “NO VESTING PASS,” and it’s clear why buyers are racing in. For anyone eyeing fast gains with an already active project, BlockDAG is shaping up as one of the top cryptos to buy today before the window narrows any further.

The announcement came via the company’s second quarter of 2025 earnings press release , which also mentioned $3.1 billion in total financial assets and its first-ever quarter of positive operating cash flow. The crypto holdings were first disclosed in a separate press release dated July 21. The company also said it has allocated $300 million toward an options-based strategy focused on bitcoin and bitcoin-related assets, signaling ongoing intent to expand its exposure. According to the July 21 release, this strategy could allow Trump Media to convert options into spot BTC “depending on market conditions,” and potentially use the resulting positions for revenue generation or further crypto accumulation. The $2 billion figure cited includes not only spot bitcoin but also bitcoin-related securities, such as bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bitcoin trusts, or derivatives that offer BTC exposure. These instruments allow institutional investors to gain indirect access to bitcoin price movements while avoiding direct custody or on-chain interaction. By combining these securities with spot bitcoin, Trump Media has constructed a hybrid crypto treasury intended to offer both liquidity and resilience. The second quarter also marked the company’s first quarter of positive operating cash flow, with $2.3 million generated through its media and technology operations. Total financial assets reached $3.1 billion, fueled primarily by the crypto treasury build-up and a recent private placement backed by 50 institutional investors. CEO Devin Nunes said that the liquidity and “financial freedom” afforded by this capital will help Trump Media pursue a range of product expansions, including a Truth+ streaming bundle, AI integrations, and a planned utility token for payments within the Truth Social ecosystem. The company also reiterated its goal of launching multiple crypto-focused ETFs and managed investment products. Trump Media shares (DJT) closed at $16.92 on Friday, down 3.81% on the day and 50.26% lower year-to-date, according to Google Finance data.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|Donald Trump|btc|News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|SPONSORED|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-03 06:10:09

As seasoned investors look for high-upside entry points, one fast-growing project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has caught attention for its explosive growth metrics and expanding user base. Ethereum’s Rebound Hasn’t Hit Its Ceiling Yet Ethereum (ETH) remains one of the most fundamentally sound assets in crypto, yet it’s still undervalued relative to its potential. Currently priced at $3,740, ETH is trading more than 20% below its all-time high of $4,720. Meanwhile, corporate holdings of Ethereum have surpassed $10 billion, and ETF inflows remain steady. Despite that bullish backdrop, technical momentum remains neutral, with an RSI of ~31, suggesting room for upward movement once buy-side volume picks up. A clean breakout above $4,000 could trigger rapid continuation. One New Project Is Quickly Escaping Hidden Gem Status Among altcoins seeing fast-tracked growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking out of obscurity. According to on-chain metrics, MAGACOIN has recently crossed multiple internal benchmarks for user acquisition, transaction volume, and community engagement. A newly completed third-party blockchain audit has also positioned the project as a top-tier safety pick —a factor that has drawn attention from cautious but ROI-focused investors. $2,500 deployed here could turn into $50,000 , based on similar market cap trajectories seen in early-stage coins that achieved wide exchange listings. Cardano’s Discount May Not Last Long Cardano (ADA) is another altcoin hovering well below its peak, currently priced at just $0.75—a far cry from its former all-time high of $3.01. Despite recent bearish action bringing ADA down to around $0.743, RSI levels near 30.27 indicate heavy overselling. Historically, similar RSI readings have preceded major recoveries for ADA. Its strong developer activity and continued expansion into smart contracts make it a serious contender for long-term gains if it can reclaim investor confidence. Conclusion Ethereum and Cardano remain undervalued giants with significant recovery potential. But the real momentum may be forming around MAGACOIN FINANCE, now gaining recognition as one of the safest and most promising new altcoin investments . For investors hunting undervalued assets with strong growth curves, these three should be on the radar right now.

The FCA had previously barred retail access to crypto ETNs in 2021, citing investor protection concerns. However, with the market maturing and some crypto investment products now better understood, the regulator said it will allow access, provided the ETNs are listed on recognized, FCA-approved U.K.-based exchanges. Products must follow financial promotion rules to prevent misleading advertising and inappropriate incentives. The FCA’s Consumer Duty rules, which require firms to avoid causing foreseeable harm, will apply. The FCA warned, however, that there won’t be coverage under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for these products.

Houston resident Sharon Schoolcraft says she lost $13,000 after receiving a call from someone claiming to be working at Wells Fargo, reports FOX 26. Schoolcraft says the caller alerted her to possible fraudulent charges made to her account, a facade made believable by the fact that the scammer knew about recent charges she had legitimately made. The scammer subsequently told Schoolcraft that someone would come to her home to cut up or collect her cut-up Wells Fargo debit card. Similar scams have affected other Wells Fargo customers. Recent reports suggest a trend of scammers convincing the bank’s customers that their accounts are at risk, tricking them into giving up their PINs, cutting up their bank cards and then meeting someone in person to hand over the cut-up cards so the thieves can either withdraw funds or transfer money out of the accounts. In previous instances, when requesting a refund from the bank, the victims were denied by Wells Fargo. However, the bank’s decision changed when the media investigated the matter. Similarly, Wells Fargo only agreed to refund Schoolcraft her stolen $13,000 after the media got involved. Says Schoolcraft, “I’m so super stoked, it’s going to mean a lot to me. I can pay back the person I had to borrow money from. I can get my bills back on track.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.537 (-0.5%) Market Cap $413.34 Million Trading Volume $11.92 Million Circulating Supply 787.63 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 (Mar 08, 2024) All-time Low $0.4954 (Apr 09, 2025) 24-hour high $0.55 24-hour low $0.52 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 0.537154 Price Prediction $ 0.404436 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.64% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.578797 200-Day SMA $ 0.71533 14-Day RSI 39.88 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faced a buying demand toward $ TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced a buying demand toward $ Resistance for dYdX is at $0.6081 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.5036 The dYdX price analysis for 3 August confirms that dYdX faced a drop as it attempted a move below $0.54. Currently, buyers are accumulating heavily, resulting in a consolidation. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price declines toward $0.54 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced buying pressure after the price attempted to maintain momentum above $0.66. As a result, buyers are now holding dYdX price around resistance lines, preparing for further upward push. The 24-hour volume surged to $5.07 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.539, declining by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades around 38, hinting that sellers are dominating. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price below the EMA trend lines. Currently, sellers are holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.18, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.684049 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.670481 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.653003 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.655128 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.578797 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.613287 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.71533 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.602108 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.592156 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.589295 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.602966 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.663086 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.804666 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.024835 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6081, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6621. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5036, beginning a bearish trend to $0.4396. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers lost confidence in pushing the price above Fib levels. As a result, sellers are now approaching the $0.54 level to initiate a stronger bearish rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.5 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX, the leading decentralized trading platform, announced its partnership with Crypto.com’s Onchain app. It is Crypto.com’s non-custodial digital asset wallet, enabling quick access to advanced trading features directly within mobile phone. dYdX price prediction August 2025 July was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain its buying momentum. As a result, dYdX recorded over 3% decline in July. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.9 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $1.2, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction August 2025 $0.45 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history: CoinStats dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June. By the end of June, dYdX had declined toward $0.41. In July, the token surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain buying demand and dropped below $0.6.",Crypto Price Predictions|dYDX,EN,0,0,TRADING|DYDX|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|WLD|ALTCOIN|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-03 07:10:00

The move came as risk sentiment deteriorated globally, triggering institutional outflows across volatile crypto assets, particularly meme coins. What to Know DOGE traded in a volatile $0.01 range (7.14%) during the session, declining from $0.20 to $0.19 before staging a mild bounce. Volume surged to 918.53M at 06:00 and 502.81M at 14:00, both exceeding the 24H average of 385.67M, signaling high-conviction exits. Support formed around $0.188–$0.190, where volume spiked to 667.44M, enabling a brief recovery to $0.194. Resistance held at $0.202–$0.203, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. News Background DOGE's decline came amid renewed global trade tensions following the expiration of a reciprocal tariff framework, which has left 92 countries facing elevated trade barriers. The Federal Reserve held rates steady this week, opting to monitor trade data, which has reduced market odds of a September rate cut and weighed heavily on high-beta assets. Price Action Summary High: $0.203 Low: $0.188 Close: $0.195 24H Range: $0.015 (7.14%) Technical Analysis DOGE encountered aggressive resistance at the $0.202–$0.203 zone, rejecting multiple rallies. The $0.188–$0.190 region absorbed peak selling pressure, with high-volume prints suggesting bottom-fishing or accumulation interest. The final 60-minute session (03:55–04:54) saw a measured 0.53% drop from $0.196 to $0.195, with intra-candle resistance at $0.1963 and support near $0.1952. Volumes normalized late in the session, but remain above baseline, indicating potential for continued volatility. What Traders Are Watching Whether DOGE can hold $0.19 support or break down further amid broader altcoin weakness.

According to Cosmo, both entities are quietly aligning operations, timelines, and personnel to build a tokenized infrastructure that affects not just financial instruments, but also identity, medical data, and global market architecture. The claims, supported by multiple references to known partnerships and developments, attempt to demonstrate a systemic realignment of the digital asset space led by Ripple and BlackRock. Cosmo opens the thread by stating that BlackRock and Ripple have “just been exposed,” and suggests they are using tokenization as a vehicle to control financial markets. The tweet asserts that the same assets are being targeted, within the same timeframe, and involving the same key players behind both initiatives. The central argument is that this coordinated effort is being largely overlooked despite its significant implications for crypto holders and the broader financial ecosystem. Ripple’s Role in Tokenizing Traditional Assets Cosmo traces the beginning of this effort to Ripple’s early work in tokenizing U.S. Treasury bonds using the XRP Ledger . This was done through the OUSG fund, which is accessible in tokenized form on-chain 24/7. According to Cosmo, this marks a fundamental shift in how traditional securities are accessed and transferred. He further notes that BlackRock has allocated capital into this very fund, highlighting their indirect participation in the XRPL tokenization effort . 1^ ✰ BlackRock and Ripple are acting in sync – quietly but on a massive scale ✰ They are launching tokenization to rewrite the financial system ✰ Same assets – same timeline – same people – and no one is asking questions pic.twitter.com/OqcdS41fhA — Cosmo (@0xcosmobtc) July 31, 2025 Ondo Finance is identified as the intermediary platform responsible for launching the OUSG token. Cosmo describes Ondo as a fintech project led by former Goldman Sachs executives. The role breakdown, as Cosmo explains, places Ripple as the provider of the blockchain infrastructure, Ondo as the issuer of the tokenized instruments, and BlackRock as the source of capital liquidity. He also notes that Ripple’s legal clarity following its partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023 was a strategic milestone that enabled this expansion into institutional partnerships. New Developments Involving Bio-Identification and the XRP Ledger A point of coincidence emphasized by Cosmo is the ticker symbol $XDNA. BlackRock currently has a genetics ETF trading under this ticker. Meanwhile, on July 4, 2025, a token with the same ticker, $XDNA, is set to launch on the XRP Ledger. Cosmo states that this new token is being issued by DNA Protocol and is centered on biometric identity infrastructure, medical data access, and genomics, rather than trading. He states that the XRPL will serve as the foundational blockchain for this infrastructure, further demonstrating Ripple’s reach into areas beyond finance. This development, according to Cosmo, represents the convergence of healthcare data, biometric identification, and tokenized infrastructure within a single blockchain environment. He notes that this should not be viewed in isolation but rather as an extension of Ripple’s broader role in building systems for the next era of digital infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock’s Expanding Blockchain Integration Cosmo also refers to the ISO 20022 messaging standard , currently being implemented by FedWire, SWIFT, and global banks. He points out that Ripple’s systems have been compatible with ISO 20022 from inception. In contrast, BlackRock’s Aladdin software, which manages over $20 trillion in assets, is now testing blockchain networks for settlement and transaction tracking. Cosmos states that XRPL supports ISO 20022 and operates without interruption, positioning it as a viable base layer for next-generation financial systems. According to Cosmo, the two firms are dividing responsibilities across multiple verticals. Ripple is focusing on the tokenization of government bonds, central bank digital currencies, land, and carbon markets. BlackRock is focusing on tokenizing equities, U.S. treasuries, real estate, and digital identity. Cosmo interprets this as a dual effort to reboot the global financial system from the ground up, operating in unison but through separate domains. Effect on the Broader Crypto Market In the final portion of the thread, Cosmo argues that the implications of this transformation affect all crypto holders. He says that anyone holding assets like Ethereum or Solana is already part of this evolving structure, regardless of whether they are aware. Cosmo warns that the shift is not about adopting a new market, but rather transitioning the current system into a more centralized form under different management. He ends the thread with a caution that this transformation is not optional. According to his view, tokenization led by Ripple and BlackRock is already in motion, and retail participants are being absorbed into an institutional framework without a clear understanding of the broader design.

The image, described as one of the most comprehensive and clear visualizations of XRP’s total supply, reiterates the essential breakdown of XRP holdings, including those in escrow, in active circulation, and under Ripple’s control. The data visualization provides insight into how XRP is distributed across different categories, emphasizing the constraints on Ripple’s ability to liquidate large portions of the asset. Still the best infographic about total #XRP circulation, updated. (SBI Holdings fiscal year end report) ~36b left in escrow.. pic.twitter.com/GniV4tFO3P — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) August 1, 2025 XRP Market Circulation and Total Supply The maximum supply of XRP remains capped at 100 billion tokens. According to the infographic, approximately 59.24 billion XRP are in active circulation within the market. At the time of reporting, this portion of XRP carries a market capitalization of approximately 28.6 trillion Japanese yen, based on pricing data from July 28. This figure reflects a substantial segment of the total supply and constitutes the portion that is freely tradable across exchanges and platforms. Ripple’s Non-Circulating Holdings As of the end of March 2025, Ripple held a significant volume of XRP that had not entered the market. These holdings are categorized as being outside of current market circulation and are valued at approximately 13.4 trillion yen. By July 20, 2025, the infographic reports that Ripple’s non-circulating holdings are equivalent to 19.7 trillion yen, which suggests that the valuation is based on a revised XRP price as of July 28. These tokens represent a portion of the supply Ripple retains direct control over, yet has not introduced into active trading markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Under Escrow and Burned Supply A prominent feature of the report is the quantification of XRP held under escrow . Roughly 35.9 billion XRP remain locked under the escrow mechanism. The infographic explains that XRP placed in escrow on the XRP Ledger is restricted from use or destruction until specific conditions are met. The escrow system was established to promote predictability and ensure responsible token release over time. Based on ledger data available as of July 20, 2025, the report confirms that nearly 40% of the total XRP supply is still under escrow, and thus, Ripple is not at liberty to sell or distribute these tokens at will. In addition to circulating and escrowed tokens, the infographic indicates that approximately 10 million XRP have been permanently removed from the total supply through transaction fees. These burned tokens represent a fraction of the total but reflect the deflationary nature of the transaction cost model built into the XRP Ledger. Summary of Data Presentation and Source The quantities shown in the infographic are derived from XRP Ledger data as of July 20, 2025, and the monetary valuations are calculated using XRP’s market price as of July 28. WrathofKahneman referred to the updated image as “still the best infographic about total XRP circulation,” highlighting its clarity and the credibility of its source, which is SBI Holdings. The visual report illustrates the current landscape of XRP distribution in quantifiable detail and offers transparency on Ripple’s available and restricted holdings.

In a chart posted on August 2, trader and crypto analyst Xoom (@Mr_Xoom) outlined a potential bullish reversal zone as XRP trades around the $2.93 mark. The chart indicates a classic five-wave Elliott Wave pattern , where wave 5 is projected to finalize around $2.8. The chart highlights a series of lower highs and lower lows from late July into early August. After completing Waves 1 to 5, the chart outlines the potential endpoint, which falls around the $2.8 zone that Xoom previously set as the XRP’s lowest point for this cycle. XRP Ltf wave 5 coming to an end. I repeat- $6-$8 XRP in August highly likely. https://t.co/whkoyP1vM5 pic.twitter.com/2lPXPs5ybR — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 2, 2025 Support Zone Under Scrutiny XRP recently experienced a notable decline, falling below the crucial $3 support zone . It has failed to reclaim this level, causing some concern among market participants. Xoom outlined this level on the chart, as it held up XRP in July after the asset retraced from its all-time high . Although XRP has broken through this support, Xoom is confident in the technical structure and anticipates a recovery. Despite the recent decline, XRP has remained above the highlighted support at $2.8, and the current forecast implies that once wave 5 concludes, a larger reversal could follow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bearish Momentum is Slowing Down Elliott Wave theory, the analytical framework used in the chart, typically identifies patterns of investor behavior. A completed five-wave downtrend often precedes a corrective rally or a new impulsive move in the opposite direction. In this case, Xoom appears to anticipate the latter, which would imply a significant upside breakout if the projected reversal plays out. At the time of Xoom’s analysis, XRP sat slightly above the $2.8 support, trading around $2.93. The bearish sequence, while still active, appears to be losing momentum, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Outlook for August Remains Bullish Despite the short-term bearish structure, the forecast remains optimistic over the coming weeks. Xoom reiterated his previous target, stating that XRP reaching $6 to $8 in August is highly likely . The projected target range represents a more than 2x increase from current levels at the minimum. While that may seem ambitious, the underlying structure of the wave analysis supports the case for a trend shift if the $2.80 support holds firm.

This correction has sparked a divide among analysts and investors, with some viewing it as a healthy retracement that could set the stage for a continuation of the broader uptrend. Others, however, warn that this move might signal the beginning of a more extended bearish phase if key support levels fail to hold. Related Reading: Ethereum New Addresses Surge To Nearly 257K In A Day, Matching 2017 And 2021 Bull Markets Adding to the market’s uncertainty, top analyst Darkfost highlighted a significant shift in exchange activity. Data reveals that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have been steadily rising since early July, reversing a prolonged downtrend that had been in place since March. Given Binance’s position as the largest global crypto exchange by volume, this uptick in inflows is a crucial indicator of shifting investor behavior. Whether this trend signals an upcoming wave of selling or simply reflects portfolio rebalancing remains to be seen. The coming days will be pivotal as Bitcoin tests its lower demand zones and market sentiment reacts to this new data. Binance Bitcoin Inflows Signal Shift in Market Mood Darkfost shared critical data showing that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have steadily increased, rising from approximately 5,300 BTC daily in early July to 7,000 BTC today. While this uptick is not abrupt, it marks a significant reversal of a prolonged downtrend that had persisted since March. This change suggests that investor behavior is shifting, potentially signaling adjustments in market strategies as traders and institutions respond to evolving market dynamics. Binance, as the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally by trading volume, serves as a critical barometer for overall market sentiment. With over 250 million users and billions of dollars in daily transactions, fluctuations in Bitcoin inflows on this platform often mirror broader structural moves within the crypto market. Historically, rising inflows have been associated with increased trading activity, whether due to profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or anticipation of market volatility. Some analysts interpret this emerging trend of accelerating inflows as an early sign of preparation for heightened market volatility or impending macroeconomic shifts. It could indicate that traders are positioning funds on exchanges to either capitalize on price swings or hedge against potential downside risks. While the magnitude of inflows isn’t alarmingly high yet, the consistency of this rise demands attention. The market is watching closely to see whether this signals a temporary adjustment or the start of a broader trend. With Bitcoin’s price currently testing lower support zones after breaking below $115K, the behavior of these inflows will be pivotal in determining short-term price action.

Key Support At Risk Amid Increased Selling Pressure Bitcoin is trading at $112,477 after breaking down from its two-week consolidation range. The price lost the crucial $115,724 support, which now flips into immediate resistance. This breakdown marks a significant shift in momentum, with BTC testing the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $114,944, which failed to hold. The next key support zone lies near the 200-day SMA at $110,348, a level that could become pivotal for bulls attempting to regain control. Volume has surged during this decline, indicating strong selling pressure as BTC approaches the $112,000 level. If the price fails to hold above this zone, a further drop towards the psychological $110K level seems likely, with potential for a deeper correction targeting previous accumulation ranges from early July.

Until then, market sentiment remains cautious as investors watch for signs of demand absorption or further liquidation-driven declines.

In a note to clients seen by Reuters , Goldman Sachs says hedge funds took profits on their tech positions just as the S&P 500 index hit all-time highs. The bank says tech stocks were sold off by hedge funds in the US and Europe more than any other sector last week, and was the largest exodus from the field since July 2024. Goldman also notes that every type of tech stock was sold, including semiconductor chip companies, software firms and IT service providers. While tech stocks sold off, the bank says hedge funds began shifting their capital to consumer staples, or goods that consumers purchase regularly regardless of the economic climate. Goldman says the big winners included companies that sell food and beverages, and personal care products. Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, tells Reuters that yields on long bonds may determine US equities’ next move, but they haven’t yet flashed any clear signals. “US equities valuations (such as price earnings ratios) are now 30% higher than their recent decade average, while 10-year yields remain stubbornly high and volatile. The future path of equities may depend partly on a decline in long-term rates; however, we do not seem to be there yet.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-relax-friends-this-dip-is-almost-over-heres-why/,"XRP’s recent decline has unsettled parts of the crypto community, especially after the asset reached a peak of $3.65 in July. Since then, the bullish momentum has cooled considerably. The asset is trading at $2.82, a 5.43% drop from yesterday, having fallen below the psychologically significant $3 support level recently. Despite the sharp downturn, not all analysts are signaling alarm. In a post on X, well-known trader and market analyst CryptoBull shared a 4-hour chart suggesting that XRP may be approaching the tail end of its current corrective move. According to CryptoBull, “this XRP dip is almost over.” Relax friends, this #XRP dip is almost over. pic.twitter.com/l6wdmoo6Jx — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 2, 2025 A Falling Wedge Forms on the 4-Hour Chart The chart, which covers price action from mid-July to early August, displays a falling wedge formation , a classic technical pattern that often precedes a bullish breakout. The narrowing price action is marked by descending resistance and support lines converging toward the current price. The pattern is visible across multiple lower highs and lower lows, with the recent price action testing the wedge’s lower boundary below $2.8. This setup indicates weakening selling pressure, even as prices decline. Volume analysis within the chart also shows a tapering pattern, consistent with a potential exhaustion of downward momentum. XRP Support Levels Suggest Bearish Exhaustion Although XRP has seen a notable decline from its recent peak , the current chart positioning implies it may be nearing a technical support level. The downward sloping wedge has not yet broken to the upside, but such patterns often act as precursors to bullish reversals once a breakout occurs with conviction and volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Still, the absence of a confirmed breakout means traders should remain cautious. If XRP fails to hold the lower trendline around $2.7, the price could continue to slide, testing deeper levels of support. On the other hand, if buying pressure increases and XRP breaks above the upper resistance line currently just below $3, it may signal a return of upward momentum. Is An XRP Reversal Coming? CryptoBull’s chart interpretation comes at a moment of uncertainty for XRP holders. While the recent price action has been bearish, the structure shown on the 4-hour chart provides a technical basis for optimism. Other analysts have expressed confidence that XRP’s recovery is imminent , and the next few sessions could prove critical in confirming whether this dip is indeed near its end or if further downside awaits.

Meanwhile, Ripple Labs continues to expand its business as corporations and even the US government move to add XRP to their digital asset portfolios to balance out their treasuries. Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, DC has done a complete 180-degree about-face since Trump’s reelection. The SEC has shifted from an aggressively and relentlessly hostile stance toward Ripple Labs to one that is cooperative and helpful. In addition to that, the company is making enormous strides forward in Q3 2025 to expand its borderless payments business for large transactions between big institutions. XRP Outshines US Stocks in July It’s a very bullish forward view for XRP prices as August begins, especially compared to returns from US stocks, like the benchmark S&P 500 Index. July was a big month for the US stock market, which grew to a historic record high level again on Monday, along with the Nasdaq Composite. That’s despite worries over Trump’s tax reforms and global tariff policies. But XRP holders made significantly greater gains than US stock shareholders in July. The S&P 500 Index delivered +2.67% gains for the 30 days ending Tuesday, July 29. Meanwhile, XRP’s price flew up on crypto exchanges by over +42%, from $2.20 on Jun. 30 to $3.13 on Jul. 29. It’s worth noting, though, that both asset classes slashed some of the gains as July ended and on Autva e gust 1 due to political concerns and economic uncertainty. During most of its history since launching in 1957, S&P 500 Index stocks would typically take four years to deliver those kinds of gains that XRP delivered in 30 consecutive days this summer. That’s not the first time Ripple’s token has given such an incredibly positive performance. Its average trading price performed similarly this past January, last November, and during the Bitcoin bull markets in 2021 and 2017. Here are five key factors analysts are weighing, who say XRP is going as high as $5 in the next five months. 1. Altcoin Analyst Predicts $5 XRP By 2026 Altcoin Daily co-founder Aaron Arnold, in an update posted on July 25, explained that he believes XRP is going to $5 and beyond because it’s not merely a currency, but crucially important digital infrastructure for global payments. He said that Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in December 2024, will be a primary driver of XRP’s market gains for the rest of this crypto cycle. Unpopular opinion: Ripple’s RLUSD might be the most underrated stablecoin of 2025 – Went from the #36 stablecoin to #17 ranking in 6 months -604% growth (2nd fastest YTD) – $348M in inflows Even more suprising is that of ~83% RLUSD is on Ethereum, not on Ripple. pic.twitter.com/E1qUMjeedc — J.Hackworth (@jphackworth42) June 19, 2025 Every time there’s a transaction on XRP Ledger, some of the XRP is burned to increase scarcity and create price support for the currency. “Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD is the key,” Arnold said. That’s because XRP is a relatively scarce, supply-limited token, and the growth of RLUSD increases the demand for XRP while leaving it in shorter supply. RLUSD has already captured a market cap well north of half a billion dollars in July. All other factors equalized, the Ripple stablecoin’s rapid adoption is good business and economics for XRP valuations to continue rising in 2025. 2. XRP Corporate Treasury Race Begins Meanwhile, as online traders use more XRP to move stablecoins around the blockchain, at least one corporate finance department is raising $20 million in funds to pile up an XRP treasury. Nature’s Miracle Holdings is a California-based farm tech firm that provides equipment for indoor, greenhouse, and vertical farming operations. They’re publicly traded in the United States on OTC Markets, with a very small market cap of less than $2 million. The company announced on 7/23 that it is raising $20 million in an equity finance deal approved by the SEC to stash a corporate XRP treasury. Moreover, that would make it the first non-financial public company to buy a big tranche of XRP. Nature’s Miracle CEO James Li said you can blame the company’s big strategic pivot on Trump and Congress for creating more regulatory clarity around blockchain with the GENIUS Act. “We see the huge potential of XRP as it improves the speed and reduces the cost of cross-border payments,” Li said. 3. Ripple Pump Incoming From US Stockpile BIG: White House to unveil national crypto stockpile report this Wednesday! $XRP rumored to be on the list alongside BTC & ETH. Is XRP becoming a strategic U.S. digital asset? pic.twitter.com/sOywwGNF5S — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) July 27, 2025 In addition to corporate treasury interest in XRP stockpiles, the US federal government wants its hands on Ripple tokens. In fact, President Trump has specifically named XRP as one of the assets the White House wants to hold in trust for Americans. The White House’s crypto report on blockchain and the national digital assets stockpile, released on July 30, provides solid support for XRP price levels. Meanwhile, Americans applying for federal housing loans are now permitted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to list crypto like XRP as financial assets while holding them, without selling them for cash instead. So the US government is shaping up to be a massive bull factor in XRP prices for the remainder of 2025, as well as going forward up to 2030 and beyond. 4. Ripple New US Patent: A Threat to SWIFT? JUST IN: Ripple secures U.S. patent for trust-based, instant cross-border payments—no full network confirmation needed. $XRP might slowly replace SWIFT, offering a faster and more efficient alternative. pic.twitter.com/op8Yn1sfQy — Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) July 27, 2025 RippleNet and XRP Ledger are global, borderless, automated payment and financial networks. Across the pond from the US, Ripple is expanding its business in Europe as well. In July, a representative from Ripple told journalists the company is applying for a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe for regulatory compliance. Consequently, the company will find it easier to expand its operations in the Eurozone. Moreover, Ripple got US Patent No. 11,998,003 approved in July for an international payments network that settles much faster than the world’s most popular cross-border payments rails, based out of Belgium, SWIFT. Running the math on it, if XRP payments using RippleNet and XRP Ledger capture 14% of SWIFT’s market share for daily transaction services, XRP’s price could go to Mars and Jupiter. 5. Bitcoin Bull Run to $150K-200K In 2025 Finally, if Bitcoin’s price rises to $175,000 or $200,000, as many professional market analysts believe it will, it could be an easy ride up for XRP tokens from $3 a token to $5 XRP in 2025. In fact, XRP’s price gained 518% in just 77 days, the last time Bitcoin rallied 50% from last Nov. 4 to Jan. 20. If it did that again from the current price level, XRP could skyrocket to $19.30.

According to reports, the community approved Input Output Engineering’s (IOE) protocol roadmap for treasury funding with about 74% of voters supporting the initiative. In the press release , the platform notes that the initiative is expected to be the first community-authorized core development funding for the blockchain network. The press statement notes that the approval is expected to birth not just a set of technical upgrades, but also a shared vision for the future of Cardano, which is grounded in transparency, accountability, and momentum. The approved roadmap was designed in alignment with community priorities and approved earlier this year, revealing one of the most ambitious development phases in the Chain’s history. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson mentioned at the time that the new approach is expected to introduce agile engineering teams to achieve a faster execution of the platform’s goals. Cardano community greenlights funding to support network upgrades The approved funding is expected to go to major upgrades, focusing on scalability, developer experience, and interoperability. The key developments will include Ouroboros Leios for increased throughput, Hydra for fast and cheap transactions, Mithril improvements for reduced bootstrap times, and Project Acropolis for modular node architecture, which will enable greater flexibility and easier onboarding of new core developers. In addition, there are also plans for performance optimization, which is expected to improve sync times and reduce RAM usage, and nested transactions, which will provide a technical foundation for more advanced smart contracts and seamless interoperability. According to Tim Harrison, the EVP Community & Ecosystem at Input Output, this development is a milestone for the platform. Harrison noted that for the first time, major protocol developments will be funded directly by the community. He noted that the move empowers the firm with the needed confidence to move forward, adding that they need to show “full transparency, shared responsibility, and a renewed commitment to building an open, resilient ecosystem.” New updates will lay the groundwork for better performance These upgrades are expected to lay the groundwork for a more scalable, accessible Cardano with better performance, unlocking new capabilities for builders and users. Aside from delivering on its promises, Cardano is also expected to support wider participation by onboarding external vendors, with most of them expected to join from the Cardano Developer Ecosystem Coalition (CDEC). According to its press statement, Cardano expects to build capacity, transfer knowledge, and help contributors stand as independent proposers in future funding rounds, strengthening decentralization over time. The funding structure is expected to integrate milestone-based payments administered by Intersect, with releases based on verified delivery. IOE will provide monthly updates, engineering timesheets, and quarterly budget reports that will be checked by the community. “Securing this funding is just the start,” said Ricky Rand, General Manager, Input | Output Engineering. “This is a vote of confidence in Cardano’s future—and a model for how decentralized funding and delivery can work at scale. The real work begins now—delivering with integrity, reporting with transparency, and building with and for the community.” Reacting to the update, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, took to blogging platform X to show his support for the development. He thanks the crypto community for their unwavering support, urging them to let them get it done. Meanwhile, crypto community members have also supported the move, with a user noting that the future of the chain is now in the hands of ADA holders, which is a good thing for the project and a vote of confidence for Hoskinson.

Onchain data reveals the approval transaction was signed on April 30, 2024 — but the theft occurred much later, on August 2, 2025. This incident marks yet another alarming breach in the crypto space. The attack began with an ERC-20 approval transaction, likely embedded in a fake airdrop or a spoofed legitimate-looking website. The victim unknowingly signed the transaction, granting the scammer access to their funds. Scammer strikes 458 days later as dormant wallet springs to life The scammer’s wallet had a disreputable pink-drainer.eth address, “0x67E5Ae”, where the stolen $908,551 worth of USDC stablecoin was received. The attack was carried out on August 2 at 4:57 AM UTC, according to Scam Sniffer’s X post . This was 458 days, just after the victim accidentally approved a transaction that appeared to be legit on April 30, 2024. The unexpected attack has raised security concerns among crypto users. To address this, Scam Sniffer, a firm that keenly monitors malicious activities in the crypto space, called for the urgency of digital asset users taking caution before approving the transactions. According to the firm, users should check their approvals often. For the old ones, they should cancel them to avoid exposing their funds to scammers, emphasizing the importance of their wallet security. In the highlighted case, the compromised wallet had only seen minimal, low-value transactions up until a month before the theft, making it unlikely to attract immediate attention from scammers. The user decided to move $762,397 into a wallet with the address 0x6c0eB6 from a MetaMask wallet on July 2 at 8:41 PM UTC. Ten minutes later, the user transferred another $146,154 in USDC to the same wallet from a Kraken account. At this time, the scammer was monitoring the movement of the funds, waiting for the right time to attack while giving the user more time to see if she or he could add more funds to the wallet. The attack took place on August 2. Crypto fraud attack raises tension among investors Investigators noted that the scammer used tactics typical of a phishing approval attack , closely monitoring the victim’s transactions before executing the theft. Following such attacks, crypto authorities included stricter measures users should take while approving transactions. For example, they have introduced Etherscan’s Token Approval checker for Ethereum users, enabling them to review and cancel any token approval that is not needed. However, each cancellation process is charged a gas fee. Meanwhile, research from sources reveals that in July alone, the total stolen funds amounted to more than $142 million in the crypto ecosystem. This involves at least 17 attacks, with crypto exchange CoinDCX suffering the highest losses. Still, crypto users are worried about the security of their funds. Some have highlighted that this scammer has not been identified and arrested, which makes them even more worried. Others have called for more security measures to be effected.

The comments came during an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session hosted by XRPL Commons and were shared on X by crypto commentator Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba), who posted a clip highlighting the exchange. Despite XRPL’s longstanding performance and reliability , Schwartz did not shy away from identifying architectural inefficiencies. “It’s kind of annoying that you have a monolith that has the consensus engine, the transaction engine, and client queries all monolithically,” he said. Schwartz, who is one of the architects of the XRPL , explained that the tightly coupled components have made it difficult to implement enhancements or enable interoperability with alternative implementations. Decisions are being made today. If restarting the #XRP ledger from scratch, Ripple CTO David Schwartz discusses using ""Rust"" is definitely talked about. Proposals from an outside company are currently being considered for a possible modular revamp of pieces. (Rust is a… pic.twitter.com/DzEpY3gQNv — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) August 2, 2025 Moving Toward a More Modular Architecture One solution under consideration is modularization of the transaction engine, possibly enabling it to run within a virtual machine. That shift could separate the core logic from the client-facing overlay and database components, free to evolve independently. Rust has emerged as a candidate for such a reimplementation. When asked why the ledger wasn’t already being rebuilt in Rust, Schwartz noted that discussions about doing exactly that are happening. He emphasized that the difficulty lies in untangling the existing architecture, especially the payment engine. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz explained that parts of the payment engine are difficult to define clearly, which makes rebuilding or re-implementing them challenging. Some behaviors depend on the order of operations in ways that aren’t consistently documented. To address this, he suggested rewriting those components with clearer, more predictable logic and possibly introducing formal definitions to guide future implementations. A cleaner, more consistent version would make the system easier to maintain and could help future improvements, enhancing XRP’s appeal in the global financial ecosystem . Proposals Under Review Ripple is currently reviewing external proposals to undertake parts of this effort, and Schwartz mentioned that decisions are being made about the feasibility and prioritization of such initiatives. He pointed to Aanchal Malhotra, board member and head of research at RippleX, as someone leading aspects of that process. XRP is already highly appealing to institutions , and upgrading its functionality through a modern programming language like Rust could increase institutional confidence in the asset and potentially raise adoption rates.

The layers of disappearing stripes were only empty ground where the illusion of Satoshi, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, fading into code stood since late 2024. It was unveiled on October 25, 2024, at Plan B’s Bitcoin forum, as Swiss‑Tether and Lugano raced to brand the city a global Bitcoin hub The theft was first reported by X user @Grittoshi , who suspected it had been thrown in a lake beside the sculpture. On X, Satoshigallery, the artistic project run by Picozzi, offered a reward of 0.1 BTC to anyone that could help find the statue. “We are offering 0.1 btc to whoever will help us recovering the Statue of Satoshi Nakamoto that was stolen yesterday in Lugano,” the X post said. “You can steal our symbol but you will never be able to steal our souls. We are all in this together and committed to place the statue in 21 places round the world.” The apparent theft just over a week after Satoshi Gallery unveiled its third Satoshi Nakamoto statue in Tokyo, Japan.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ASIA|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-03 09:03:42

According to the disclosures, Ripple has applied for a license to establish a limited-purpose national trust bank. According to the application, this new structure aims to hold Ripple's RLUSD (Ripple USD) reserves and establish a regulated infrastructure for tokenized financial products. It also raises the possibility of direct access to the Fed in the future. According to WrathofKahneman, this initiative isn't targeting individual users. According to the Banking Comprehensive Revision Act (CRA), the regulation doesn't apply to banks that don't provide loans or take deposits and only offer trust-based services. This suggests Ripple's new structure will focus solely on business (B2B) services. Related News: Market Prophet Tom Lee Shares His Bullish Prediction on Ethereum (ETH) Price Ripple's Application Doesn't Provide Any XRP Details Another notable detail is that the application doesn't directly mention XRP. Analysts note that Ripple is attempting to clearly separate XRP from its banking license, aiming to avoid regulatory confusion. However, there's no indication that future XRP integrations are completely ruled out. The application details that Ripple Labs would own the bank, issue special shares to its executives, and that much of the application was kept confidential. This secrecy was interpreted as a sign of a potential initial public offering (IPO) plan. As a result, Ripple is aiming for a national bank license to create a regulated subsidiary to manage its tokenization infrastructure. *This is not investment advice.

In an interview on the Excess Returns YouTube channel, Liz Ann Sonders says investors prefer a calm and steady Fed, even amid pressure from President Trump to cut rates, as inflation remains elevated. Sonders also notes that the Fed’s current pause is perfectly in line with its mandate of low inflation and maximum employment. “I think part of the reason why the market is doing well is because the Fed is not cutting. A combination of because they’re not bowing to political pressure, and oh and by the way, neither side of their dual mandate suggests that they should be cutting. Financial conditions are easy. The unemployment rate is steady, actually has been coming down. Inflation is still above their target. So the conditions just don’t suggest that they should be easing.” The investor points out that a Fed rate cut at this stage could backfire by tightening financial conditions and triggering a market drop. She explains that borrowing costs are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, a rate determined by market forces and not directly set by the Fed. The Charles Schwab executive warns that a cut could push yields higher, making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow. “And there’s a distinct possibility that if the market feels the Fed is prematurely lowering rates, doesn’t have the incentive to do that based on their mandate, that you could have a repeat of what happened as recently as last fall – when the Fed cut by a 100 basis points and the Fed funds rate and the 10-year yield over the same exact span of time went up by a 100 basis points. So this idea that if we just get the Fed to cut rates, that that eases borrowing costs for companies and brings mortgage rates down, suggests a misunderstanding of what rate it is that is tied to borrowing rates for corporations, for individuals. I think part of the reason why the market has done well is because the Fed doesn’t have the conditions that suggest easing.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Arkham has revealed an undisclosed 2020 hack of 127,426 BTC from Chinese mining pool LuBian. The attack exploited weaknesses in LuBian’s private key system, with over 90% of its BTC drained in a single day. LuBian attempted to contact the hacker via Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN feature. On Saturday, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence reported that 127,426 BTC, valued at around $3.5 billion at the time and nearly $14.5 billion today, was stolen from Chinese mining pool LuBian in December 2020. LuBian rose quickly in early 2020, becoming the sixth-largest mining pool on the Bitcoin network by mid-year. Its website promoted it as “the safest high yielding mining pool in the world.” LuBian Vanished in 2021, Sparking Speculation of Shutdown By February 2021, LuBian had disappeared without explanation, fueling speculation that it was either shut down by authorities or quietly converted into a private pool. Arkham’s investigation points to a more dramatic exit: a hack that drained the pool’s holdings. “They appear to have been first hacked on December 28th, 2020 for over 90% of their BTC,” Arkham wrote. The following day, attackers siphoned off another $6 million in BTC and USDT from a LuBian-linked address on the Bitcoin Omni layer. The firm believes the Bitcoin theft stemmed from vulnerabilities in LuBian’s private key generation system, which may have allowed brute-force attacks. While 11,886 BTC, worth roughly $1.35 billion, remains untouched in LuBian’s wallet, none of the stolen coins have moved since July 2024. Interestingly, LuBian attempted to communicate with the attacker using Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN feature. BREAKING: ARKHAM UNCOVERS $3.5B HEIST – THE LARGEST EVER LuBian was a Chinese mining pool with facilities in China & Iran. Based on analysis of on-chain data, it appears that 127,426 BTC was stolen from LuBian in December 2020, worth $3.5 billion at the time and now worth… pic.twitter.com/PnIOKgMt0i — Arkham (@arkham) August 2, 2025 In two transactions, the team wrote: “To the whitehat who is saving our asset, you can contact us… to discuss the return of asset and your reward.” The message included an email address, but it’s unclear if the hacker ever replied. While the Mt. Gox collapse involved more BTC, the LuBian breach is the largest confirmed crypto theft by value at the time of the incident. Bitcoin Hacks, Theft Cost Investors $2.2B in H1 2025: CertiK Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year’s losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion. Without these, losses align more closely with previous years at around $690 million. Ethereum remained the primary target, suffering over $1.6 billion in losses across 175 events. The report also pointed to rising sophistication of phishing schemes and ongoing risks from social engineering, urging crypto users to verify links, avoid suspicious sites, and use hardware wallets.

Bitcoin dropped below $113,000, while Ethereum dipped under $3,500. Several altcoins also saw notable declines, and overall trading volumes spiked as prices moved sharply. Key Stats and Events More than 114,000 traders saw positions closed due to liquidations, totaling over $368 million in value. The majority of these were long positions, as prices dropped quickly across the board. The largest single liquidation was on Binance, where a $2.58 million Solana position was closed automatically. New U.S. tariffs and uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy contributed to a cautious trading environment, encouraging some investors to reduce risk. The release of additional tokens from projects like SUI and Ethena also increased selling pressure. Industry and Community Response BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sold more than $13 million worth of digital assets, including ETH, ENA, and PEPE, and commented that further correction is possible under current economic conditions. On the other hand, Eric Trump took to social media, encouraging investors to consider whether current prices may be an opportunity to buy.

The prominent altcoin now trades around $2.81 with no indication of a potential pause in selling momentum. While this crisis persists, popular X analyst with the username Egrag Crypto has helped identify the currently crucial support and resistance levels for the market bulls. Related Reading: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst Hold $2.65 Or Risk Collapse, Break $3.12 And Set For Rally In an X post on August 2, Egrag Crypto shares an interesting technical insight on the XRP market currently undergoing an intense correction wave. According to the renowned analyst, macro analysis indicates the altcoin retains a bullish structure; however, the present price correction can only be terminated via two pathways. Firstly, micro price analysis suggests that XRP must achieve a daily price close above $3.12 to signal a market bottom entry. In doing so, the cryptocurrency reclaims a pivotal resistance level, paving the way for a potential rise to higher levels such as $3.60. On the other hand, the immediate major support level lies around $2.65. Egrag Crypto explains that a continuous price decline to successfully retest this price floor may ignite a rally, pushing XRP to its current all-time high of $3.84. However, any decisive price break below $2.65 could create a rather dire situation, pointing to potential lows around $2.19. Related Reading: Exchanges Receive 21,400 Bitcoin At A Loss From Short-Term Holders – Retail Capitulation? XRP Surge To $17 Remains On The Cards In other news, Egrag Crypto’s analysis also reveals that XRP remains in a macro, long-term cyclical pattern that shows a multi-year bullish cycle, with recurring structural traits. The key elements in this pattern include bullish pennant formation, which suggests a continuation pattern, the 21 EMA (Green dotted line) that historically aligns with significant trend shifts, the Support Arc (Red line), and the Market Cycle Top (blue line). Notably, XRP has since emerged from the bull pennant signaling intentions to maintain its current uptrend. However, the altcoin faces an insurmountable resistance around $3.84, which aligns with an intersection between the mid-cycle top and the 21 EMA line. If XRP can successfully break past this price barrier, investors should anticipate a direct rally to the projected cycle top $17, representing a potential 525% gain on present market prices. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.81, reflecting a 5.32% decline in the past day as earlier stated. This recent price fall underscores a turbulent trading period for the altcoin, which lost over 11.38% of its market value in the last week. However, a monthly price gain of 22.18% indicates a significant number of investors remain in profit despite these corrections.

Many altcoins continue to trade indecisively, with ETH dropping further away from $3,500 and SOL close to breaking below $160. BTC Bounces Off $112K Bitcoin’s business week began on a relatively familiar note as it jumped toward $120,000 after it erased the losses charted at the end of the previous one. However, as it happened during the last few attempts to take down that resistance, the bears quickly reemerged and didn’t allow BTC to challenge its all-time high, set in mid-July. Within the next few days, the cryptocurrency traded sideways between $117,000 and $119,000 before it dipped slightly on Wednesday evening to $116,000 after the US Fed refused to lower the key interest rates. Although it bounced back to its upper boundary on Thursday morning, the worst was yet to come. Amid political turmoil and global economic uncertainty, BTC’s price went into a correction mode and dropped to $115,000 on Thursday and Friday and below $112,000 on Saturday evening, which became a three-week low. It reacted well to the last price dump and has added over $1,500 since then. Its market cap remains stable on a daily scale at $2.260 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins is above 60%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XRP Joins the Pack Ripple’s native token took yesterday’s correction relatively well , as it remained sideways around the crucial $3 support, while most other alts were deep in the red. However, XRP has joined the adverse party, by losing that coveted support level and dumping roughly 4% to under $2.9 as of press time. Ethereum has extended its gap to $3,500 after another minor daily decline, while SOL and DOGE have dropped by around 1%. The rest of the larger-cap alts are with insignificant losses and gains. Pi Network’s token has bounced off its latest ATL registered yesterday and now sits around 4-5% above it at $0.36. The total crypto market cap stands at essentially the same spot as yesterday at $3.750 trillion, having dropped by almost $250 billion since Thursday morning. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

This Token’s Chart Has Analysts Buzzing for Some Solid Reasons,https://timestabloid.com/from-0-035-to-4-in-under-2-years-this-tokens-chart-has-analysts/,"“This is the kind of chart that makes you stop and pay attention. It has the trajectory of a 100x gem — not because of hype, but because of structure.” That’s how one analyst recently described Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi player that’s quietly gaining momentum while the broader market recalibrates. As mainstream cryptocurrencies waver and retail volume shifts to the sidelines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily climbing — not in silence, but with a rhythm that long-term investors are beginning to recognize. So what exactly is fueling the analyst buzz? It’s not just the chart. It’s the combination of real-world DeFi application, institutional-grade auditing, and well-timed tokenomics. While so many projects rely on narrative alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a system that already looks like it belongs in a top-tier protocol category — with a fast-moving presale and sharp community engagement to back it up. Presale Growth Meets Utility-Driven Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently progressing through Phase 6 of its presale with strong traction. More than 10% of the 170 million MUTM tokens allocated to this phase have already been sold at $0.035. Over 14,800 holders have participated, helping raise over $13.9 million. With the next price jump scheduled at $0.040 — a 15% increase — early buyers stand to benefit from attractive entry points before the token hits its planned listing rate of $0.06. And there’s no shortage of reasons why demand is growing. The platform has already undergone a thorough security review by CertiK, one of the most trusted names in smart contract auditing. The audit scored an impressive 95.00 on Token Scan and a solid 78.00 on the Skynet threat intelligence system. Alongside this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $50,000 bug bounty, signaling its commitment to proactive, community-driven security validation. But security is only one part of the formula. What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more than just another altcoin are its mechanics — purpose-built systems that serve long-term DeFi users. The protocol is preparing to launch on a Layer-2 blockchain, ensuring transactions are faster and far cheaper than typical Ethereum-based platforms. This gives it a clear scalability advantage as user activity begins to surge following its full platform launch. mtToken Yields and a Lending Engine That Pays At the center of the Mutuum ecosystem are mtTokens — smart contract-based tokens that represent user deposits in stablecoins or blue-chip assets. These tokens automatically accrue interest as long as they’re held in the protocol’s lending pools. And when staked in designated smart contracts, they enable users to earn MUTM rewards through a buyback-based dividend system. Revenue generated from the platform’s operations is used to buy MUTM from the open market, which is then distributed to these stakers — effectively creating a supply squeeze over time. The ecosystem is also expected to drive demand through its unique Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending model. In this system, users deposit assets into liquidity pools and receive yield based on pool utilization. Higher utilization leads to increased APYs for lenders. On the borrowing side, users can unlock loans by depositing overcollateralized assets such as ETH, BTC, or stablecoins, with Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios set to ensure systemic stability. For example, a borrower might receive $7,000 in stablecoin liquidity by locking $10,000 worth of Ethereum at a 70% LTV. Alongside this sits the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) module, where borrowers and lenders can directly negotiate loan terms, typically for more exotic or volatile assets. While riskier, this system allows for broader market participation and opens the door to more customized lending opportunities. Stablecoin What’s next on the roadmap only strengthens the long-term outlook. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch its own fully overcollateralized stablecoin — designed to maintain a strict $1 peg by tying minting and burning to borrowing and repayment cycles. Unlike algorithmic models that have historically failed, Mutuum’s system will cap issuance by locking real collateral and using protocol-level interest mechanisms to maintain peg equilibrium. Analyst projections for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaching $4 in the next two years are not just speculative dreams — they are based on fundamental design. From protocol revenue and Layer-2 scaling to security audits CEX listing and a reward model, everything is built for upward pressure. The price is still $0.035, but not for long. Once Phase 6 closes, the price increases to $0.040, and the pathway to $0.06 — and well beyond — will begin accelerating. For those watching the charts, this is not the time to hesitate. It’s the moment to recognize the rare combination of timing, tech, and tokenomics that could make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a dominant force in DeFi.

49461965,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76629,1754215505,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Predicts XRP Price for August 31, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-xrp-price-for-august-31-2025/,"XRP is currently trading at $2.78, down 7.41% from yesterday, as traders weigh market uncertainty and the asset’s potential trajectory. To better understand what may lie ahead for XRP this month, we consulted Google’s Gemini AI, asking it to assess the token’s likely price on August 31. The response was based on technical structure, macroeconomic signals, and Ripple-related factors. Gemini’s analysis suggests that while XRP may not yet be in a breakout phase, the groundwork for a higher valuation is forming, particularly as key macro and crypto market shifts continue to develop in the background. Macro Factors Remain Incomplete One of the most significant inputs in the forecast is U.S. monetary policy. While the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting interest rates later in 2025 , those changes may arrive after August, limiting their near-term impact. As Gemini noted, “economic slowdown concerns may lead to hesitant inflows in Q3,” which could keep crypto investors cautious through the end of the quarter. Additionally, Bitcoin’s expected consolidation during this period plays a role. Gemini suggests that BTC has completed its run and will likely be in a cooling phase by late August. Gemini expects the market to shift toward altcoins as alt season begins , but also anticipates this growth to happen after August. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Positive Signals and Potential Targets Gemini also considered asset-specific trends. The AI acknowledges the potential impact of Ripple’s expanding involvement in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) , alongside Ripple’s increasing global partnerships. The excitement surrounding these developments may be enough to push XRP past key resistance zones in the short term. After evaluating all key drivers, Gemini expects XRP to trade between $3.6 and $5.2 on August 31. The AI model identified $4.45 as the most likely price, marking a new all-time high for the digital asset. Assuming no extreme legal, regulatory, or institutional news emerges beforehand, XRP could smash through multiple resistance zones to cross $4 for the first time in its history. Gemini stated that a move above $6 is unlikely in Q3 without a shock catalyst. Despite recent uncertainty due to a price decline , the outlook for August is optimistic. While short-term headwinds persist, the combination of technical recovery and long-term adoption potential, and positive market factors keeps the asset in a favorable position.

However, this peak is expected to be temporary. According to data from CoinWarz, the next difficulty adjustment—scheduled for August 9—is projected to bring the figure down by approximately 3%, to around 123.7 trillion. Currently, the average block time stands at 10 minutes and 20 seconds, slightly above the protocol’s ideal of 10 minutes. Difficulty adjustments are programmed into the Bitcoin protocol every 2,016 blocks (roughly two weeks), ensuring that the rate of block creation remains steady, even as mining power fluctuates. After a noticeable drop in June and the first half of July, when the mining difficulty slipped to 116.9 trillion , the second half of July saw a strong rebound, reflecting increased computational power from miners. Stock-to-Flow and Its Role in Bitcoin Scarcity Mining difficulty is closely tied to Bitcoin’s hashrate—the total computing power used to validate transactions and secure the network. This dynamic also plays a critical role in preserving Bitcoin’s scarcity through its stock-to-flow (S2F) ratio. The S2F model compares the existing supply of an asset to its rate of new production. A higher S2F ratio generally indicates stronger price stability and resistance to inflation through oversupply. Bitcoin’s S2F ratio is currently higher than that of gold. With about 94% of its maximum 21 million coin supply already mined, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly scarce . Gold, by comparison, has an S2F ratio of around 60 and an annual inflation rate of roughly 2%, while Bitcoin boasts a scarcity ratio of about 120, according to PlanB, the pseudonymous creator of the stock-to-flow pricing model. This makes Bitcoin nearly twice as scarce as gold, underlining its appeal as a deflationary store of value. Mining Difficulty Adjustments Keep Market Stable The mechanism of difficulty adjustment ensures that Bitcoin’s issuance remains steady regardless of sudden surges or declines in mining power. If more miners join the network, the difficulty rises to maintain the 10-minute block interval. Conversely, if miners exit due to lower profitability, the difficulty drops to stabilize block creation. This self-regulating system guards against overproduction, which could otherwise flood the market with new BTC and trigger downward price pressure. As such, the upcoming decrease in mining difficulty is part of the protocol’s built-in resilience—preserving the integrity and long-term value of the Bitcoin network.

According to Master Ananda , Bitcoin’s corrective phase is evident in its nearly 10% decline from mid-July record highs, with the price now testing key support near the previous all-time high. In an August 2 TradingView analysis , Ananda noted that despite the current bearishness, Bitcoin remains within a healthy bullish cycle, characterized by recurring upward momentum followed by expected pullbacks. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Therefore, the current correction appears to be part of a broader pattern of price fluctuations that historically set the stage for new highs. If past trends hold, this consolidation could pave the way for a renewed rally toward fresh all-time highs. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch The analyst highlighted strong support between $110,000 and $100,000, with $100,000 acting as a key technical and psychological level. Additional pullback zones are marked by Fibonacci retracement levels, with the 0.382 level around $106,000 and the 0.5 level near $102,000. As long as Bitcoin stays above $100,000, the long-term bullish trend remains intact. A weekly or monthly close below that level would prompt a reassessment. Past cycles suggest a period of sideways consolidation before a renewed uptrend. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin took a hit alongside the equities market as investors were rattled by disappointing July jobs data and uncertainty stemming from sweeping U.S. trade tariffs. Meanwhile, according to another cryptocurrency analyst, Ali Martinez, in an August 2 X post , Bitcoin is finding strong support at $107,160, where over 111,000 BTC have been accumulated, based on Glassnode data. This level marks the largest buy zone below the current price, reinforcing it as a critical floor. Martinez also noted that resistance is building at $117,400, where 88,000 BTC were purchased. $107,160 continues to emerge as a crucial support level for Bitcoin $BTC ! pic.twitter.com/izOejLbagA — Ali (@ali_charts) August 2, 2025 Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $113,651, having posted a modest gain of less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, however, the leading digital asset is down over 4%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.
