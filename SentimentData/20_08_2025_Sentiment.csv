50357095,https://cryptonews.com/?p=411008,1755643320,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50357095.jpeg,$OKB Jumps Over 6% After 65M Token Burn and ‘X Layer’ Launch,https://cryptonews.com/news/okb-soars-177-after-65m-token-burn-and-x-layer-launch/,"$OKB has continued its bullish run, rising 6% this week to surpass $127 in a historic rally that’s left traders stunned. This isn’t just another pump—we’re witnessing one of crypto’s most dramatic supply shocks unfold in real time. This rally is a direct result of the protocol’s measures and major platform upgrades that have fundamentally transformed the token’s value proposition. The real question isn’t just what drove the explosion but whether $OKB can maintain this new altitude. How a Historic Token Burn and L2 Announcement Ignited $OKB Rally The OKB token, with a market capitalization of approximately $2.66 billion, was designed as the core utility token for the OKX ecosystem. Its value is derived from providing holders with benefits, including trading fee discounts, staking rewards, and governance rights. August has been a productive month for the token and its native platform. Earlier this month, $OKB saw its role evolve beyond exchange perks to now function as the native gas token for X Layer, OKX’s zkEVM-powered Ethereum Layer‑2 , delivering around 5,000 TPS, near-zero fees, and full Ethereum compatibility. Thereafter, the exchange executed a major token burn , permanently removing approximately 65.26 million OKB from its reserves, removing them from circulation. This event formally established a hard, immutable supply cap of 21 million tokens. OKX announced a strategic upgrade to X Layer and will permanently burn 65,256,712.097 OKB from historical buybacks and reserves. The OKB smart contract will be upgraded to remove minting and manual burns, fixing total supply at 21 million. OKTChain will be phased out, with OKT… pic.twitter.com/HM4dcXLcdU — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 13, 2025 A subsequent smart contract upgrade disabled any future minting or burning capabilities, cementing the token’s scarcity model. These changes spurred a surge of 160–170%, with OKB briefly reaching highs above $130. According to Etherscan, the on-chain ecosystem has roughly 17,900 holders , with the top 10 addresses controlling about 67% of the supply. Additionally, OKX began phasing out OKTChain, stopping OKT trading as of August 13, initiating automatic conversions of OKT to OKB based on the July 13–August 12 average price, and planning full decommissioning by January 1, 2026. OKB Faces Rejection at $130, Consolidates Above High-Volume Support Following the price rally, $OKB is now consolidating. This pause is important as it helps the market absorb its new price level and build a stronger base for its next potential move. After setting a historic high last week, the $OKB token encountered firm resistance near $130. Observing the order flow dynamics and volume activity, one could see the clear shift, particularly visible on the 1-hour chart. Buy-side interest was initially strong, as reflected in several large footprint clusters just above $126. One of the breakout candles showed over 100K in total volume, though it closed with a negative delta of -21.41K, indicating that profit-taking emerged to meet the buying pressure at this new high. Prior to that, volume bars leading up to the rejection were also filled with aggressive buying, but began showing signs of exhaustion as selling pressure absorbed the momentum. The delta footprint steadily tilted red, confirming that a period of consolidation had begun. While OKB briefly lost its upward momentum after pushing into the $128–$130 region, the broader market structure still leans bullish. The rejection from the top of the breakout range has so far led to a measured pullback, not a collapse. The asset’s price continues to trade above all major moving averages on the 1-hour chart, including the 20, 50, and 100-period SMAs, which continue to trend upward. The 20-SMA near $122 is particularly key, as it now aligns with the high-volume support area where recent consolidations have taken place. At press time, OKB is holding just above the $123 mark, hovering near the upper boundary of a high-volume liquidity band centered around $120–$122. This area has repeatedly absorbed selling pressure in recent sessions, suggesting that it remains a key battleground between buyers and sellers. Yet price action alone won’t be enough going forward. To regain directional control, bulls must show renewed initiative, ideally marked by a pick-up in aggressive buying and a shift in cumulative delta favoring demand. Given the powerful fundamental tailwinds from the token burn and X Layer launch, this key support zone is likely to be fiercely defended by long-term believers.

Among the hardest-hit names was Galaxy Digital, the crypto financial services firm that cratered by 10%. Coinbase, now part of the S&P 500, gave up over 5%, while eToro fell even further, sliding more than 6%. Other platforms like Robinhood and Bullish were also dragged down, both dropping above 6%. The risk-off mood didn’t spare the newer corners of the crypto industry either. Treasury-focused crypto firms get hammered Inside the growing niche of crypto treasury operations, red flashed across the board. Strategy, a firm that’s been rising fast in the background, tumbled 7%. SharpLink Gaming, which blends crypto tools with the online sports world, lost 8%. Bitmine Immersion, tied to mining infrastructure, sank 9%. But DeFi Development took the crown for biggest loser of the day, sliding a brutal 13%. Stablecoins, often considered the calmer end of the crypto space, didn’t escape the damage. Circle, the issuer of USDC and one of the most closely watched firms in the space following its IPO, dropped 4.5%. That decline hit just days after Circle had basked in regulatory support under the GENIUS Act, which established new rules for stablecoins in the United States. The pain wasn’t limited to equities. Bitcoin fell nearly 3%, retreating to just over $113,000, while Ether shed more than 5%, falling back to around $4,100, based on data from Coin Metrics. That was a big change from last week, when Bitcoin touched an all-time intraday high near $125,000, driven by speculative enthusiasm. Powell uncertainty triggers tech retreat Tech names were broadly under pressure across Wall Street. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.46%, ending the session at 21,314.95. The S&P 500 slid 0.59% to 6,411.37. Nvidia lost 3.5%, while other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom were down 5.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Palantir, one of the top performing software names in the last quarter, plunged more than 9%, ending as the S&P’s worst performer of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average avoided the full bloodbath, adding a weak 10.45 points to finish at 44,922.27, but that move came thanks to a lift from Home Depot, which pushed the 30-stock index to a new intraday record during the session. At the heart of the chaos was rising caution ahead of Powell’s appearance at the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole summit. Traders were nervous, pulling out of growth names, and crypto, with its speculative nature, was an easy first exit. “With Powell speaking at Jackson Hole, we typically see profit-taking ahead of his remarks,” said Satraj Bambra, CEO of Rails, a hybrid crypto exchange. “Any time there’s communication uncertainty from the Fed, you can generally expect some profit-taking as traders de-risk their positions.” In the last few months, crypto stocks had benefited from a string of bullish headlines. Coinbase’s entry into the S&P 500 gave it institutional exposure. Circle’s IPO added legitimacy to stablecoins. The GENIUS Act, which became law, created new clarity around digital tokens. But the mood has changed in August, as investors brace for more clarity or confusion out of the Fed.

Why BlockDAG Is the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/over-376m-raised-why-blockdag-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-in-2025/,"In 2025’s blockchain space, BlockDAG has become the clear frontrunner. The presale has already secured over $376 million, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, positioning it well ahead of rivals. Its ambitious $600 million target, paired with a rapidly expanding ecosystem, is why many consider it the best crypto to buy right now. Unlike projects that lose steam after early hype, BlockDAG’s momentum is still climbing. Large investors continue to accelerate batch sales, bringing it past the halfway mark toward its funding goal. Its hybrid consensus model, combining Proof-of-Work with Directed Acyclic Graph technology, enables speeds of 10 blocks per second while keeping mining open to both hardware and mobile users. With over 200,000 holders, 19,000 ASIC miners sold, and 2.5 million X1 mobile miners, BlockDAG is showing real adoption before exchange listings—a rare achievement in presale history. Why Buying in Presale Is a Strategic Move Developer traction remains one of the strongest signals of a blockchain’s future, and BlockDAG is excelling here. More than 4,500 developers are building 300+ dApps on the network, aided by EVM compatibility that allows seamless migration of Ethereum projects. This pre-launch activity highlights strong confidence in the protocol and adds weight to why it’s seen as the best crypto to buy. For buyers, entry at $0.0276 in Batch 29 locks in immediate upside. The confirmed listing price of $0.05 guarantees an 81% gain, while analyst projections pointing to $1 post-listing imply a possible 36x return. The batch pricing model ensures early allocations remain fixed, shielding participants from sudden spikes as later buyers enter at higher rates. With momentum and developer commitment accelerating, BlockDAG offers both near-term ROI and long-term ecosystem value, making it a strategic presale entry. Early Access Products Driving FOMO BlockDAG isn’t just raising capital it’s rolling out products ahead of launch. The Demo Trading Dashboard simulates a live exchange, complete with instant execution and visible order books, introducing thousands to BDAG trading before listing. Alongside this, the X1 mobile miner allows users to mine BDAG directly from their phones, building an engaged user base. These utilities strengthen its case as the best crypto to buy for those seeking early adoption and real-world integration. With over half of its $600 million target reached, each sold-out batch pushes prices higher. Late-stage presales typically attract a surge of buyers chasing remaining allocations, but early participants secure lower entry points. By locking in now, buyers gain exposure to one of the few projects delivering adoption, developer activity, and mining infrastructure well before launch. Final Word BlockDAG’s mix of rapid adoption, developer engagement, and technical scalability sets it apart in 2025. With $376 million already raised and Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, it’s not just another presale it’s the best crypto to buy this year. For early movers, the potential is striking. A listing at $0.05 already provides strong upside, but forecasts of $1 hint at far greater gains. In a market filled with promises, BlockDAG stands out as one of the only projects delivering before listing. That’s why it continues to be recognized as the best crypto to buy in 2025’s presale landscape.

Still, rising spot trading volumes offer a glimmer of hope that BTC may now be entering an accumulation phase. Is Bitcoin In The Accumulation Phase? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Binance’s BTC spot trading volume surpassed $6 billion on August 18 – one of the most significant spikes this month. Taha noted that such sudden spikes typically signal increased participation from institutional investors and large traders, along with some retail activity looking to capitalize on heightened volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Below $115,000 As Binance Buying Power Ratio Collapses It’s worth noting that the surge in Binance spot volume coincided with BTC’s drop below $115,000 – a movement that can serve as a leading indicator of a potential reversal in price momentum. Historical data suggests that strong spot buying during price dips often reflects traders stepping in to accumulate BTC at discounted prices. This dynamic can ease selling pressure and lay the foundation for a rebound if demand persists. Taha also highlighted that the increase in Binance spot volume occurred alongside a decline in the Binance Whale-to-Exchange Flow, which fell from $6.4 billion to $5 billion – a $1.4 billion drop in whale transfers to Binance over the past week. This reduction in whale deposits suggests fewer large holders are sending BTC to exchanges for potential selling, a trend generally considered bullish. Taha concluded: Bringing these elements together – a surge in Binance spot volume, rising demand during a price dip, and a decline in whale deposits – the market is showing early signs of stabilization. If accumulation continues at current levels, Bitcoin has a solid chance to recover and retest higher resistance levels in the near term. From a technical perspective, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that BTC is still following its weekly trendline. If the trend holds, BTC could target $130,000 in the coming weeks. Warning Signs For September While Taha suggests BTC may currently be in an accumulation phase with the possibility of a trend reversal in the coming months, other analysts remain cautious. Crypto analyst Josh Olszewics warned that BTC must survive a “brutal September” before any meaningful rebound can occur in Q4 2025. Related Reading: Bearish Case For Bitcoin: Analyst Warns Macro Top Is In Similarly, CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest cautioned that the next 1–2 weeks may bring heightened selling pressure for the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

50360001,560075,1755644452,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50360001.jpeg,Dogecoin Comes Under Attack From Same Group That Orchestrated Monero’s 51% Takeover,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-comes-under-attack/,"The Qubic community is now targeting Dogecoin (DOGE) following its recent and controversial attack on Monero (XMR) . After executing a 51% takeover and claiming majority control over Monero’s hashrate, the group is now shifting focus toward the world’s largest meme coin, signaling what could become one of the most ambitious challenges yet against a major Proof of Work (PoW) network . Qubic Targets Dogecoin After Monero Domination The Dogecoin network has become the latest declared target of Qubic, the project that recently claimed to have orchestrated a successful 51% attack on Monero. Sergey Ivancheglo, known on X social media as ‘Come-from-Beyond’ and the founder of Qubic, confirmed the move after a community vote on Discord placed Dogecoin as the overwhelming choice over competitors such as Kaspa and Zcash. The decision underscores a significant escalation in Qubic’s ambitions, shifting focus from privacy-focused networks to one of the largest and most recognizable meme coins in existence. Qubic’s founder highlighted that the previous Monero operation served as a demonstration of what coordinated control over hashrate can achieve. By pooling resources, the project reportedly captured over 77.54% of Monero’s power, effectively proving that 51% attacks are not merely theoretical vulnerabilities but real threats that could paralyze entire ecosystems. Ivancheglo also described the attack as a wake-up call, claiming that it helped Monero developers accelerate their work on defensive measures. Notably, crypto analysts have voiced concern that Qubic’s current focus on Dogecoin could represent a new frontier in network dominance. The Qubic pool previously boasted 4.29 GH/s of computational power that crushed Monero’s defenses , but Dogecoin’s scale presents a much more formidable challenge. Still, community insiders are not backing down, with many supporting the founder’s plan to dominate Dogecoin. The Challenge Of Taking On Dogecoin’s Network While Monero fell victim to Qubic’s calculated push, Dogecoin’s defense rests on an entirely different foundation. A Qubic Ambassador identified as the ‘QubicChurch’ on X explains that, unlike Monero’s CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant RandomX algorithm, Dogecoin relies on the Scrypt algorithm and is merge-mined with Litecoin. This means that the majority of Litecoin’s massive mining infrastructure also secures Dogecoin, creating a combined shield of unprecedented scale. As of August 18, 2025, Dogecoin’s hashrate stands at roughly 3.47 PH/s, while Litecoin adds 2.78 PH/s. Together, their combined network strength dwarfs Monero by over a million times. The Qubic Ambassador acknowledged this staggering gap, pointing out that preparation for such an attack on Dogecoin would require months of development. Notably, the scale difference between Monero and Dogecoin also redefines the potential outcome. The QubicChurch noted that if the project were to capture even 0.1% of the Dogecoin-Litecoin network , it would represent more computational power than the entire Monero network by a factor of over a thousand. At 1%, the leverage becomes astronomical, exceeding Monero’s power more than eleven thousand times over. For Qubic, such control would not only serve as proof of dominance but could also funnel massive cash flows into its ecosystem.",Dogecoin|asic|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin-Litecoin Network|dogeusd|dogeusdt|litecoin|monero|Qubic|QubicChurch|Sergey Ivancheglo,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|XMR|LTC|MINING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-19 23:00:52

Projects like Worldcoin and Pi Network are attracting attention through price setups and user growth, yet their value still depends heavily on what may come next. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) takes a different approach by proving its utility during the presale itself. Users can already access the app, carry out transactions, and receive USDT rewards, experiencing features that most projects only reveal after launch. This immediate usability, combined with early-stage availability, makes Cold Wallet stand out. It offers credibility and traction now, while others are still building anticipation. Worldcoin’s Triangle Setup Signals Imminent Breakout Worldcoin is tightening within a symmetrical triangle, with its price repeatedly testing support and resistance. This technical formation is known to precede sharp moves, and traders are now eyeing $2.70 as a key upside target. The recent bounce from lower support reflects strong buying pressure, adding weight to the bullish case. As the range compresses, volatility is likely to return with force. A confirmed push above the upper trendline on high volume could trigger rapid gains. The setup suggests Worldcoin may not remain at current levels for long once momentum builds. Pi Network Advances as Unlock Approaches Pi Network is preparing for a 276 million token unlock, equal to 3.5% of its circulating supply. Instead of sparking caution, this event is driving attention as more than 13 million users have migrated to the Open Mainnet. The Pi network price has already risen 10%, signaling that confidence is outpacing concerns. Behind the move is a surge in real network activity, with more nodes going live and user participation expanding daily. This growth is unfolding even before major exchange listings, pointing to a foundation being built in real time as momentum steadily accelerates. Cold Wallet Redefines Presale Standards With Live Utility Cold Wallet is challenging traditional crypto norms by delivering a fully functional product while its token is still in presale. Instead of waiting for a post-launch release, users can already download the wallet, execute transactions, and receive cashback rewards in USDT. This approach offers a level of utility that is rarely available at such an early stage. What makes this launch notable is the transparency and credibility it provides. Many projects raise funds with promises of future development, leaving users waiting months or even years to see results. Cold Wallet has reversed that trend by creating immediate value. The ability to interact with a working product before the token goes live adds a crucial layer of trust. This dual-track model of live functionality and presale participation positions Cold Wallet as a project with both vision and delivery. By letting users test and benefit from real features while the presale continues, it bridges the gap between early adoption and long-term engagement. This creates a stronger relationship between the platform and its community. Currently in Stage 17, Cold Wallet has raised more than $6.3 million, selling over 737 million tokens for $0.00998. With a listing price of $0.3517, the project presents a compelling case for those seeking the next top crypto to buy, combining proven utility with strong upside potential. Quick Rundown Early-access opportunities hold weight only when backed by real proof. While projects like Worldcoin and Pi Network are building anticipation through technical setups and growing communities, Cold Wallet delivers something more tangible. It is not just preparing for adoption; it is already active and rewarding users. With live transactions, cashback in USDT, and a functioning app available during presale, Cold Wallet blends usability with early pricing access. This ability to engage before listing creates a rare edge, making it a stronger choice for those who value trust and utility from the start.

Pepeto, Little Pepe or Bitcoin Hyper",https://timestabloid.com/which-one-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-and-the-next-shiba-pepeto/,"Looking for the best crypto to buy now as markets base and money rotates into presales? Memecoins are back on desks, and three live tickets keep popping up on scanners: Pepeto (PEPETO), Little Pepe, and Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER). Each is drawing fast community flow, pulling in fresh wallets, and grabbing headlines as traders try to lock early entries ahead of Tier-1 listings and deeper liquidity. This review stacks them on momentum, brand strength, tokenomics, and near-term catalysts so you can spot the best memecoin presale for outsized upside. If you want a clean read on which name screens best for risk-reward today, from presale pricing to adoption potential, does Pepeto, Little Pepe, or Bitcoin Hyper deserve your first allocation? Pepeto (PEPETO): Memecoin With Live Utility and Brand Muscle Pepeto (PEPETO), riffs on the PEPE meme by adding “T O” to the familiar P-E-P-E, turning viral recognition into a distinct identity of its own. Under the meme is value: zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap, a native cross-chain bridge, and current staking rewards around 242% APY. The presale is live at $0.000000147 with $6.2M+ raised, the code is audited by SolidProof and Coinsult, and the community has topped 100,000. A demo exchange is already up, supply is 420T like PEPE, and Tier-1 listing chatter is building as whales take early tranches. For anyone screening the best crypto to buy now and invest in, Pepeto pairs brand pull with working toolspositioning the token for real usage and stronger tokenomics into listings. JOIN PEPETO’S PRESALE NOW Little Pepe: Layer-2 Meme Play With Community Heat Little Pepe is gathering pace in the meme lane, leaning on the Pepe the Frog story and a busy social crowd. Its appeal is community energy, buzz that can drive liquidity and trigger sharp bursts. But it lacks the unique, durable utility Pepeto ships on Ethereum mainnet, so Little Pepe suits traders who want to bet on memecoin hype rather than build a long-term position. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): ZK Rollups on BTC, With Adoption Questions Hyper Bitcoin (HYPER) pitches a Bitcoin Layer-2 using ZK-rollups and the Solana Virtual Machine to bring fast transactions and smart contracts to BTC. A canonical bridge lets users wrap BTC onto the Hyper chain to stake, trade, and use low-fee dApps, though many analysts still doubt a Bitcoin L2 will gain broad, real-world adoption this cycle. Verdict: Today’s Best Buy in This Presale Trio Pepeto (PEPETO) checks the boxes as the cleaner, smarter pick right now, and the one best placed to chase the next 100x and SHIBA like memecoin. It sits on Ethereum with a sharp meme brand, real rails that move volume, zero-fee swaps on PepetoSwap, a native cross-chain bridge, current staking rewards near 242% APY, plus a live demo; more than $6.2M is in and the community already exceeds 100,000. Little Pepe leans on a Layer-2 angle many teams now copy; the edge is thin without a unique mainnet venue or live bridge, which makes it feel like a short-term swing rather than a long-term hold.

Bitcoin dropped 3.2% in the past 24 hours to slip below $114,000, while ether fell 5.3% to under $4,200. XRP tumbled 6.2%, Cardano's ADA slid 8% and the broader crypto market was down 3.2%. Shares of crypto-related companies, such as bitcoin miners, crypto exchanges and digital asset treasury firms, suffered even bigger losses, with MARA, COIN and MSTR closing today's regular session down 5.7%, 5.8% and 7.4%, respectively. By contrast, in general, U.S. equities suffered less: the Dow ended flat, the S&P 500 fell 0.59%, and the Nasdaq slid about 1.5%. The disparity underscores how digital assets, which rely heavily on cheap liquidity, are more exposed to shifts in rate expectations than traditional stocks. Investors now face a pivotal macro catalyst-heavy week. On Aug. 20 at 2 p.m. ET, the Fed will release minutes from the FOMC meeting held July 29–30, offering insight into policymakers’ tariff and inflation debates. From Aug. 21–23, central bankers gather for the Jackson Hole symposium, with Powell’s keynote set for Aug. 22 at 10 a.m. ET. Together, the minutes and Powell’s speech could define market expectations for the September policy meeting. Here are some top macro highlights traders will likely watch this week to gauge how the Fed will react during next month's meeting. Tariffs’ delayed bite Many companies have absorbed tariff costs to protect market share, but analysts warn they cannot do so indefinitely. Once passed on to consumers, these costs could drive prices higher and force the Fed to wait before cutting. Sticky inflation data Despite some cooling, inflation gauges remain elevated. The producer price index, a key wholesale measure, has been hotter than forecast, suggesting persistent pressures that complicate any case for aggressive easing. Corporate limits U.S. executives have signaled they will eventually be forced to shift tariff costs downstream. If that happens, consumer inflation could accelerate in the coming months, making a September cut seem premature. Mixed economic signals The U.S. economy shows both slowing job growth and resilient consumer demand. This uneven picture could encourage Powell to argue for patience until the Fed has clearer evidence that growth can withstand tariff-driven costs. Policy uncertainty Tariffs intersect with fiscal and trade policies in unpredictable ways. That complexity increases the risk of missteps, making a hawkish tone at Jackson Hole more likely. Lessons from history The tariff shocks of 2018–2019 produced delayed but meaningful inflation, prompting Fed caution. Powell may draw on that precedent to justify holding back this time. Forward-looking indicators The upcoming release of fresh economic data, including Thursday’s release of preliminary August data on manufacturing and services activity, could show tariff-related cost pressures building. Powell could point to these as another reason for prudence. Internal divisions Minutes from the July FOMC meeting may reveal a split inside the Fed. With hawks focused on inflation and doves emphasizing jobs, Powell may stress the need for consensus, which often favors waiting. For crypto, the stakes are clear. Higher-for-longer rates curb the liquidity that fuels speculative rallies, raising financing costs for miners and weighing on exchange activity. If Powell signals caution, the sell-off in tokens and crypto-linked equities could deepen. A dovish surprise, however, might offer the spark for a rebound.",Markets|Stocks|Crypto|The Fed|Jackson Hole|FOMC|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-19 23:13:13

But at what cost?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bank-of-japan-no-choice-but-to-hike-rates/,"Japan is staring down the barrel of an economic mess, and the Bank of Japan can’t stall any longer. The central bank has no real option left but to raise interest rates—again. The weak yen has wiped out purchasing power across the country, driven up living costs, and left millions struggling to keep up. That’s the brutal backdrop veteran ruling party lawmaker Taro Kono laid out on Tuesday, according to Reuters , as he demanded both tighter monetary policy and fiscal discipline to stop the damage. The BOJ had already pulled the plug on its decade-long stimulus experiment last year and bumped short-term interest rates up to 0.5% in January. But Kono, who’s gunning for the top job himself, says it hasn’t been enough. He warned that Japan can’t afford to let real borrowing costs—already negative thanks to high inflation—linger in the red. “I think it’s better to start early,” Kono said , pressing for more rate hikes. He added that the BOJ needs to “send out a message that Japan will pull out of a situation where real interest rates are negative.” When asked if a hike could come before year-end, he kept it vague but blunt: “I feel like [rate hikes] have already come too late.” Weak yen keeps crushing Japanese households Consumer prices in Japan have stayed above the 2% mark for over three years straight. But Governor Kazuo Ueda is still dragging his feet on raising rates further, citing pressure on the economy from U.S. tariffs—coming from Washington under President Donald Trump’s new administration. While the BOJ continues to hesitate, critics say the damage is already deep. Kono argued that the BOJ’s delay has weakened the yen and blown up import costs, creating a wave of inflation that’s hitting pensioners and businesses hard. What used to help exporters is now wrecking bottom lines. The cheap yen that once gave Japan’s export-heavy economy an edge has turned into a liability. Kono called it the “root cause of crippling inflation,” adding that it’s “eroding corporate margins and hurting pensioners.” With domestic production costs rising and imported goods draining company budgets, he said it’s time to move past the old economic playbook. That means ditching Abenomics—the blend of ultra-loose policy and big government spending introduced by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe back in 2013 to fight off deflation. “The BOJ should gradually raise interest rates, while the government should restore fiscal health under a new accord that replaces ‘Abenomics’,” Kono said. BOJ and government face pressure from business and inside the party Business leaders aren’t sitting quiet either. Takeshi Niinami, who chairs the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said the central bank is dangerously close to falling behind the curve. “I understand that the BOJ is in a very difficult position,” Niinami said last month, “but the bank should know that it will fall too much behind the curve if it doesn’t make a move.” His solution? Strengthen the yen. “The best step to combat rising living costs would be to reverse the weak yen and seek a somewhat stronger yen,” he said. Across Japan, the political pressure is rising too. While Kono failed in his 2024 bid to lead the Liberal Democratic Party, the party’s brutal loss in last month’s upper house election has reignited talk of a leadership shake-up. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who beat Kono last year, is now facing calls from within the party to step down. Senior LDP members are already pushing for a new leadership vote, adding more heat to an already volatile situation. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

But businesses could feel positive effects of digital ruble by 2029. The digital ruble will boost Russia’s economy to the tune of $3.2 billion per year, the country’s credit ratings agency says. The Russian media outlet RBC and the state-run news agency TASS reported that the claims come from the National Rating Agency (NRA). The credit rating agency is based in Moscow. It is authorized by the Central Bank and provides ratings for finance industry firms and government organs. Digital Ruble Will Bring Benefits by 2029, Says NRA The NRA has published a comprehensive report on the estimated impact of the Russian central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Central Bank’s St. Petersburg offices. (Source: Vityavo [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The digital RUB is set to roll out nationwide next year, with a phased adoption plan that will see the country’s biggest lenders start offering services with the CBDC in fall next year. Smaller firms will be given until 2027 or 2028 to start accepting the coin. But the government wants to use the CBDC to make welfare payments such as child benefits and pensions . The NRA conceded that the adoption plan would likely incur costs from both the private and public sector at first. But it said that the digital ruble project will quickly turn profitable. The agency said the CBDC would pump up to 260 billion rubles ($3.2 billion) per year into the Russian economy by 2031. The coin will also make the banking sector “up to 50 billion rubles ($619 million)” annually. Banking officials have previously expressed skepticism about the CBDC, claiming they cannot see why Moscow needs to issue the coin. ‘Big Businesses May Make up to $619M from Russian CBDC’ At the end of July, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that sets out a comprehensive roadmap for digital ruble adoption, starting from September 1, 2026. Donald Trump urged Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy to show some “flexibility” as the US president accelerates his efforts to end the war in Ukraine https://t.co/S7n9A3Iq3T — Bloomberg (@business) August 19, 2025 The agency said that companies and the government could begin to feel the benefits of the coin “between 2029 and 2031.” In the first years of adoptions, bigger businesses can expect to make 30-50 billion rubles ($371 million-$619 million) per year from the coin, the NRA said. Credit institutions, meanwhile, can expect to make up to 8 billion rubles ($99 million), NRA analysts added. War or peace?

The digital ruble launch could see banks lose clients to “new services” that cut them out of the picture, the agency said. This could see net profits drop by 8-10%, the experts calculated. But these initial losses will transform into later gains for banks, the agency said. After the project is fully rolled out, banks will be able to receive up to 61 billion rubles ($755 million) a year in “additional income” from smart contract -powered business, interbank transactions, and corporate liquidity management services. ‘No Advantages to CBDC Rollout’ In July this year, the Sberbank Chairman German Gref said that he does not “see any real advantages” for citizens, banks, or businesses . A branch of Sberbank. (Source: Artem Svetlov [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Gref said that experiments with digital fiats have not yet justified themselves. He added that all financial transactions are all already digitalized in Russia, meaning the CBDC would solves a problem that does not even exist. However, the Ministry of Finance wants to use the CBDC in government contract issuances. It thinks this will help eliminate corruption and boost transparency. Moscow is also thought to be keen on doing CBDC-powered business with its BRICS partners. Many BRICS members, particularly China, have made considerable progress with their own digital fiats. Cross-border CBDC solutions, BRICS members believe, will help render states immune to US-led sanctions packages. Moscow officials have long spoken about their desire to de-dollarize the Russian trade sector , and think that crypto or CBDC-powered solutions will let them do precisely that.

50358883,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79256,1755646205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Two Big Decisions to Change Everything for Ripple and XRP In October,https://timestabloid.com/two-big-decisions-to-change-everything-for-ripple-and-xrp-in-october/,"Legal and regulatory developments could place both Ripple and XRP in the spotlight this October. Attorney Bill Morgan, a well-known figure in the XRP community, recently outlined two significant decisions expected to take place around the same time, each with the potential to impact the token’s trajectory and Ripple’s long-term positioning in the financial sector. SEC’s Extended Review of Spot XRP ETFs The first development concerns the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ongoing evaluation of proposed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On August 18, the regulator announced that it would defer rulings on several pending applications, including those submitted by CoinShares, Grayscale, and 21Shares. These postponements moved the final decision deadlines into late October 2025. This marks the second delay by the SEC on spot XRP ETFs, but the upcoming deadline represents the final review period allowed under federal securities law. The agency must either approve or reject the proposals by that date. Approval would allow regulated investment products directly tied to XRP’s spot market to trade on U.S. exchanges, potentially opening the asset to a broader class of institutional and retail investors. Market analysts suggest that approval could strengthen XRP’s liquidity and credibility, while rejection would maintain the status quo but could dampen short-term sentiment. Ripple’s National Bank Charter Application The second major decision relates to Ripple’s application for a U.S. national banking charter. On July 2, Ripple formally submitted its request to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). According to federal regulations, the OCC is required to issue a decision within 120 days of receiving a complete application, unless an extension is formally granted. This timeline places a potential ruling around late October. If approved, the charter would permit Ripple to operate as a nationally recognized bank, providing it with the ability to expand its financial services beyond payments technology and into regulated banking activities. This development could also elevate Ripple into the ranks of significant U.S. financial institutions, particularly if the company maintains a large portion of its XRP holdings on its balance sheet. While the OCC could finalize its review before October, the agency also retains the discretion to extend the decision period if additional examination is deemed necessary. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Market Impact Commenting on the combined significance of these events, Bill Morgan noted that October could prove to be a decisive month for Ripple and XRP. The simultaneous timing of the SEC’s final ETF deadline and the OCC’s charter decision underscores how regulatory clarity could shape the future outlook for both the company and its token. Financial commentator Zach Rector has also weighed in on the potential effects of an ETF approval. Rector argued that anticipation for these investment products could drive short-term upward momentum in XRP’s price. However, he cautioned that some early investors might sell once approvals are confirmed, leading to a temporary pullback. In his view, long-term inflows into XRP ETFs would likely sustain demand and could support a rally toward double-digit price levels. With both the SEC and OCC expected to issue decisions in October, Ripple and XRP could soon face pivotal outcomes. ETF approval would broaden market access, while a successful bank charter application would significantly enhance Ripple’s institutional standing. Taken together, these developments could mark a turning point for XRP’s role in the global digital asset ecosystem.

50360004,560230,1755648002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50360004.jpeg,$92-Million Bitcoin Transfer: Bhutan Shuffles 800 BTC Amid Price Drop,https://bitcoinist.com/92-million-bitcoin-transfer-bhutan-shuffles-800-btc-amid-price-drop/,"The Royal Government of Bhutan has once again moved a large batch of Bitcoin, sparking talk across the crypto market. Nearly 800 BTC , valued at about $92 million, was shifted on August 18, 2025, into two new wallets. The move added to a series of transactions made earlier this month and has fueled speculation about whether the Himalayan kingdom is preparing to sell. Third Transaction This Month This is not the first time Bhutan has drawn attention in August. On August 5, the government transferred 517 BTC to an unknown address. Just two days later, on August 7, another batch was tracked to a Cobo Hot Wallet at an average price of $116,557. The Royal Government of Bhutan has transferred 799.69 $BTC , worth $92.06M, into 2 new wallets, likely for deposit into a CEX ( #Binance ). https://t.co/q4dW3qJBT5 pic.twitter.com/bRvm3o90UI — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) August 18, 2025 Reports confirmed that those coins were headed for sale, with Cobo acting as custodian of Bhutan’s Bitcoin holdings. In its latest update, blockchain analytics firm Arkham confirmed the 799.69 BTC move and highlighted that this was the third major transaction from Bhutan this month. Bitcoin’s Price Pressure The timing comes as Bitcoin struggles to hold onto recent highs. The token reached a record $124,500 on August 14, 2025, before sliding back to $115,300. Data shows it was down 2.30% in 24 hours and nearly 5% over the week. Platforms like Onchain Lens suggested that Bhutan’s most recent transfer may be linked to Binance, though no official word has come from Bhutanese authorities. Market watchers say such transfers often hint at a possible sale, but they can also be part of wallet restructuring or custody changes. Bhutan’s Place Among Top Holders Even with these movements, Bhutan remains one of the biggest nation-state holders of Bitcoin. Current estimates put its reserves at around 9,969 BTC, worth about $1.15 billion. That kind of figure makes Bhutan the sixth-largest holder worldwide, behind the US with 198,000 BTC, China with 190,000 BTC, the UK with 61,240 BTC, Ukraine with 46,350 BTC, and North Korea with 13,560 BTC. Unlike other countries that built their stacks mostly from seizures, Bhutan’s holdings trace back to mining . For now, the repeated transfers leave the market guessing. Some traders see it as a sign of profit-taking after Bitcoin’s latest peak. Others say it may just be about custody adjustments. Without confirmation from Bhutan, the reason behind the moves remains uncertain.

Although this feature was originally introduced to prevent network spam rather than to influence valuation, its long-term effect on supply has increasingly drawn attention. At present, XRP’s circulating supply is 99,985,821,508 tokens, slightly lower than the initial 100 billion created at launch . This small reduction is the result of ongoing token burns that permanently destroy a fraction of XRP. Annual Burn Rate on the XRP Ledger On average, the ledger removes approximately 2,700 XRP daily. However, this figure occasionally rises during periods of increased network use. This results in roughly 985,500 XRP permanently eliminated each year. If the current rate continues unchanged, the cumulative burn by the end of 2050 would total around 25 million tokens. That decline would lower the supply from 99.985 billion to about 99.960 billion, a reduction of only 0.025%. While the mathematical impact on supply appears minor, the perception of continuous scarcity has the potential to shape investor behaviour and, indirectly, market pricing. Modeling Potential Price Outcomes by 2050 To explore how both adoption and supply reduction could influence value, three possible scenarios for XRP’s price trajectory were outlined, starting from its trading level of $3.01 Scenario One: Gradual Institutional Adoption If banks, fintech firms, and remittance companies steadily incorporate XRP into their operations, a compound annual growth rate of 6–8% over the next 25 years could result in prices ranging between $18 and $25 by 2050 , even without factoring in supply burns. When the effect of ongoing token destruction is included, the projected range increases slightly to $20–$28. In this case, the burn contributes more as a psychological reinforcement of scarcity than as a mathematical driver. Scenario Two: Expanding Role in Global Liquidity A more aggressive growth trajectory envisions XRP becoming central to cross-border settlements, tokenized assets, and central bank digital currency infrastructure. Under this model, with adoption growing at 12–15% annually, XRP’s price could rise to $150–$250 by 2050 . Higher transaction volumes in this scenario would also accelerate the burn rate, potentially removing between 500 million and 1 billion XRP over 25 years, or about 1% of the total supply. This additional reduction could push valuations into the $180–$300 range . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Scenario Three: Global Reserve Settlement Asset In the most expansive evaluation, XRP functions as a neutral global reserve settlement tool supporting trillions in daily financial flows. Without considering the burn, this scenario points to valuations between $1,000 and $2,500. However, with large transaction volumes, the network could destroy 5–10 billion tokens over the same period, cutting the total supply by 5–10%. This meaningful reduction would support an even higher price range of $1,200 to $3,500. Although XRP’s burn mechanism was never intended to drive its price, its effect on long-term supply cannot be ignored. The impact of these burns, however, will depend largely on how extensively XRP is adopted across financial systems. By 2050, the combined influence of market demand, institutional integration, and sustained token burn could determine whether XRP remains moderately valued or rises into significantly higher ranges.

After weeks of strong momentum and multi-year highs, bulls are now struggling to defend support zones. The loss of this level raises concerns about a potential deeper correction, though fundamentals remain firmly bullish. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,350 Liquidity Pool: Can Demand Hold? Institutional adoption continues to provide strong tailwinds, with major firms increasing exposure to Ethereum through ETFs, treasury strategies, and on-chain accumulation. This steady demand reflects growing confidence in ETH’s long-term role within the digital asset ecosystem. At the same time, Open Interest has been rising sharply, highlighting a surge in speculation and leveraged positioning across derivatives markets. While this can amplify moves in both directions, it underscores the intense battle between bulls and bears at current levels. Market participants now see the coming days as critical for Ethereum’s short-term trajectory. Holding above nearby support could pave the way for a rebound and renewed attempts to challenge the $4,500–$4,800 resistance zone. Ethereum Faces Record Short Position Pressure Ethereum is entering one of its most decisive moments yet, with unprecedented short positioning building up in the market. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, we’re witnessing the biggest leveraged short position on ETH ever recorded. Net leveraged shorts have climbed to 18,438 contracts, marking the biggest bearish bet in Ethereum’s history. This surge in positioning reflects a market bracing for volatility, as traders place aggressive downside bets following Ethereum’s retrace from the $4,790 level. However, Pillows emphasizes that this dynamic could create the perfect storm for a short squeeze. If Ethereum manages to rally from current levels, these bearish positions could quickly unwind, forcing shorts to cover at higher prices and accelerating the rally. Historically, such imbalances have led to explosive upside moves in a short timeframe, catching bears off guard and rewarding bulls with rapid gains. While short-term volatility remains elevated, strong fundamentals — including declining exchange supply, institutional accumulation, and broader adoption trends — continue to support the long-term bullish thesis. For now, all eyes remain on whether the record-short positioning turns into the catalyst for Ethereum’s next breakout. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Grows As ETFs Break Records With $2.85B Weekly Inflow ETH Technical Details: Testing Demand Level Ethereum is currently trading at $4,284, showing signs of volatility after its recent decline from the $4,800 region. The 4-hour chart highlights how ETH has struggled to reclaim momentum, with price now testing a key support zone around the $4,200–$4,250 range. This level is crucial because it aligns with the 100-day moving average (green line), which has acted as dynamic support during previous pullbacks in this rally. The price structure shows that bulls remain active but are under pressure. After weeks of consistent gains, Ethereum is now experiencing heavier selling volume, as visible in the recent red bars on the chart. However, the broader trend remains bullish as long as ETH holds above the 200-day moving average (red line), currently sitting below $3,920.

Recent events indicate a continued slide, primarily influenced by anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. This downturn highlights the digital asset space’s sensitivity to macroeconomic factors, especially interest rate expectations. Why is the Crypto Market Feeling the Heat? Investors are closely watching for signals from the Federal Reserve, particularly the release of the July meeting minutes and upcoming remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole. These events often provide crucial insights into the Fed’s stance on interest rates, which directly impacts market liquidity and investor sentiment. July Meeting Minutes: These minutes reveal the detailed discussions and rationale behind the Fed’s latest policy decisions. Jackson Hole Symposium: Fed Chair Powell’s speeches here are highly anticipated for clues about future monetary policy direction. The prevailing sentiment is that the Fed might maintain a “higher-for-longer” stance on interest rates. This approach aims to curb inflation but can have a dampening effect on risk assets like cryptocurrencies, impacting the entire crypto market . How Are Key Digital Assets and Stocks Reacting in the Crypto Market? The impact of this economic uncertainty is evident across the board. Major cryptocurrencies have experienced notable declines, while crypto-linked stocks have seen even steeper losses, signaling broader market apprehension. Bitcoin (BTC): The flagship cryptocurrency recently dipped below the $113,000 mark, a significant move that often sets the tone for the broader crypto market . Ethereum (ETH) and XRP: These prominent altcoins also followed Bitcoin’s downward trend, reflecting a general risk-off sentiment. Crypto-Linked Stocks: Companies heavily invested in or operating within the crypto space, such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, posted more substantial losses. This suggests that traditional equity markets are also factoring in the potential for reduced crypto activity or profitability. This widespread decline underscores the interconnectedness of digital assets with broader financial markets, especially when economic policy shifts are on the horizon. The Critical Link: Cheap Liquidity and the Crypto Market Why does the Fed’s interest rate policy weigh so heavily on digital assets? The answer lies in crypto’s historical dependence on readily available, cheap liquidity. When interest rates are low, borrowing is inexpensive, encouraging investment in higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a “higher-for-longer” interest rate environment means: Higher Cost of Capital: It becomes more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow, reducing the flow of new money into speculative assets. Attractive Traditional Investments: Higher interest rates make safer investments, like bonds and savings accounts, more appealing, potentially drawing capital away from the volatile crypto market . Reduced Risk Appetite: Investors become more cautious, prioritizing capital preservation over aggressive growth strategies. This dynamic makes the crypto market particularly vulnerable to shifts in monetary policy compared to traditional equities, which often have established revenue streams and less reliance on speculative inflows. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Insights from Powell All eyes are now on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s upcoming remarks. While a “pause” in rate hikes is a likely outcome, the market will be dissecting every word for nuances. A subtle shift towards a more dovish stance — indicating a less aggressive approach to rate hikes or even potential cuts in the future — could provide the much-needed lift for the crypto market . However, if Powell reiterates a firm commitment to battling inflation with restrictive policies, the pressure on digital assets could persist. The market craves clarity, and any ambiguity often translates into volatility. Understanding these macro drivers is crucial for navigating the current landscape. While the short-term outlook remains sensitive to Fed announcements, the long-term potential of digital assets continues to be a subject of intense debate and innovation. In summary, the recent downturn in the crypto market is a direct reflection of heightened anxiety surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. As investors await key announcements from Fed officials, the sensitivity of digital assets to interest rate fluctuations is clear. A hawkish stance could prolong the current slump, while any hint of a dovish pivot might ignite a much-anticipated recovery. Staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts is paramount for anyone involved in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why are cryptocurrencies so sensitive to Federal Reserve decisions? A1: Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and altcoins, are often considered risk assets. Their value can be significantly influenced by the availability of cheap liquidity. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it makes borrowing more expensive and reduces the overall money supply, which tends to reduce investor appetite for riskier assets like those in the crypto market . Q2: What does “higher-for-longer” mean for interest rates? A2: “Higher-for-longer” refers to the Federal Reserve’s potential strategy of keeping interest rates elevated for an extended period to ensure inflation is fully under control, rather than cutting rates prematurely. This policy generally tightens financial conditions and can negatively impact growth-oriented and speculative assets. Q3: How do Fed announcements affect Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP specifically? A3: As leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP often serve as bellwethers for the broader crypto market . When the Fed signals hawkish policies, investors tend to reduce their exposure to these assets, leading to price drops. Conversely, dovish signals can spur buying interest. Q4: What is the Jackson Hole Symposium? A4: The Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium is an annual conference organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Central bankers, finance ministers, academics, and financial market participants from around the world attend. It’s often a venue where major policy signals are communicated, particularly by the Fed Chair. Q5: Are crypto-linked stocks impacted differently than cryptocurrencies themselves? A5: While both are affected, crypto-linked stocks (like Coinbase or MicroStrategy) can sometimes experience even steeper losses during downturns. This is because they face both the general market risk associated with equities and the specific volatility of the underlying crypto assets, potentially magnifying their losses during periods of uncertainty in the crypto market .

Recently, South Korea’s central bank issued a significant warning regarding U.S. dollar stablecoins , urging tighter regulations. This move highlights growing concerns among nations about the potential impact of these digital assets on traditional financial systems and monetary sovereignty. Why Are U.S. Dollar Stablecoins a Concern for South Korea? The Bank of Korea (BOK) has voiced serious reservations. According to a Yonhap News report, the central bank believes the increasing popularity of U.S. dollar stablecoins poses a direct threat to the nation’s monetary sovereignty. This concern stems from the potential for these digital assets to facilitate the evasion of existing foreign-exchange controls. In essence, if citizens extensively use stablecoins for transactions, it could bypass traditional banking channels and currency regulations. The BOK conveyed these sentiments in a written response to People Power Party (PPP) lawmaker Park Sung-hoon on August 20. They emphasized the urgency of addressing this issue, stating that growing use could enable illicit capital flows. How Do U.S. Dollar Stablecoins Impact Monetary Policy? Beyond foreign-exchange evasion, the BOK identified broader implications. They warned that widespread adoption of U.S. dollar stablecoins could significantly erode the effectiveness of the country’s monetary policy. Consider this: central banks manage inflation and economic stability primarily through controlling the money supply and interest rates. If a substantial portion of transactions occurs via stablecoins, the central bank’s tools become less potent. This situation could lead to: Undermined Monetary Sovereignty: The ability of the BOK to control its own currency and financial system diminishes. Increased Currency Market Volatility: Capital outflows could become more frequent and harder to track, leading to instability in the Korean Won’s value. Therefore, the central bank is advocating for prompt revisions to the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. This legislative update aims to equip regulators with the necessary powers to oversee these digital assets effectively and manage risks associated with U.S. dollar stablecoins . What’s Next for U.S. Dollar Stablecoins in South Korea? The BOK’s clear stance signals a growing global trend among financial regulators. They are increasingly scrutinizing the impact of cryptocurrencies, especially those pegged to fiat currencies like U.S. dollar stablecoins . For lawmakers in South Korea, the call to action is clear: swift legislative amendments are necessary. This will ensure the nation’s financial stability remains robust in the face of evolving digital financial instruments. The debate over digital asset regulation is far from over. However, South Korea’s proactive approach sets a precedent for how nations might tackle the challenges posed by stablecoins to their economic frameworks. The future of U.S. dollar stablecoins in the region will undoubtedly be shaped by these ongoing discussions. South Korea’s central bank has sounded a crucial alarm regarding U.S. dollar stablecoins . Their concerns about monetary sovereignty, foreign exchange control evasion, and policy effectiveness highlight the complex interplay between traditional finance and emerging digital assets. As the digital economy expands, robust regulatory frameworks become paramount for national economic stability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. dollar stablecoins? U.S. dollar stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged, typically 1:1, to the U.S. dollar. They aim to combine the stability of fiat currencies with the flexibility of digital assets. Why is South Korea’s central bank concerned about U.S. dollar stablecoins? The Bank of Korea (BOK) is concerned that the growing use of U.S. dollar stablecoins could threaten the country’s monetary sovereignty, enable evasion of foreign-exchange controls, and undermine the effectiveness of its monetary policy. How could stablecoins impact South Korea’s monetary policy? If stablecoins become widely adopted, the BOK fears it could reduce their ability to control the national money supply and interest rates, thereby weakening their influence over inflation and economic stability. What action is the Bank of Korea recommending? The BOK is calling for swift revisions to the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act to tighten oversight and establish clearer regulations for U.S. dollar stablecoins and other digital assets. Is South Korea the only country concerned about stablecoin regulation? No, many countries and central banks worldwide are actively discussing and developing regulations for stablecoins, recognizing their potential impact on financial stability and monetary systems.

Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely watched indicator, took a significant dip. As of August 20, this vital index now stands at 44, a notable 12-point drop from the previous day. This shift pushes the market squarely into the ‘Fear’ zone, marking its lowest point in approximately two months since June 22, when it registered 42. What does this mean for investors, and how should we interpret this signal? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drop The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a clear snapshot of market emotions. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. This tool helps gauge whether market participants are feeling overly anxious or excessively optimistic. A score of 44 clearly places us in the ‘Fear’ category, suggesting that investors are currently more cautious or even worried about the market’s immediate future. This recent drop reflects a weakening sentiment across the crypto landscape. Historically, periods of ‘Fear’ can precede either further declines or, conversely, present potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to enter when others are hesitant. The shift from ‘Greed’ to ‘Fear’ is a significant change, signaling a re-evaluation of risk by many market participants. What Influences the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not based on a single metric. Instead, it aggregates data from six different factors to provide a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Each factor carries a specific weighting to ensure a balanced assessment: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with average values. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values over 30 and 90 days. Social Media (15%): Looks at the volume and sentiment of crypto-related hashtags on social media platforms. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: Currently, this factor is paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s market share. A rising dominance often indicates fear, as investors move to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search query trends for crypto-related terms to gauge public interest and sentiment. These diverse inputs collectively paint a picture of the prevailing mood, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a robust indicator. Navigating Market Sentiment: What Does ‘Fear’ Mean? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters the ‘Fear’ zone, it often indicates that investors are panicking or selling off their assets due to negative news or market downturns. This widespread apprehension can lead to market undervaluation, as assets might be trading below their intrinsic value due to emotional selling. For contrarian investors, periods of extreme fear can be seen as opportune moments. However, it is crucial to remember that ‘Fear’ does not automatically guarantee a market rebound. It simply suggests that many participants are feeling pessimistic. Smart investors use this signal as one piece of their analytical puzzle, combining it with fundamental and technical analysis before making any decisions. It serves as a psychological barometer, highlighting when emotions might be overriding rational judgment in the market. Actionable Insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index How can you use the current reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to your advantage? While it is not a direct buy or sell signal, it offers valuable context: Extreme Fear (0-24): This often signals that the market is oversold. Historically, these periods have presented strong buying opportunities for long-term investors who are comfortable with risk. Fear (25-49): As we are currently experiencing, this suggests caution but can also be a time to consider dollar-cost averaging into positions if your long-term outlook remains positive. Greed (50-74): Indicates a bullish market. Investors might be getting overly enthusiastic, which could precede a correction. Extreme Greed (75-100): This is a warning sign. The market might be overbought, and a correction could be imminent. It’s often a time for profit-taking or increased caution. Always remember to conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) and align any investment decisions with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. The index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. Conclusion The recent fall of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 44, pushing it into the ‘Fear’ zone, is a significant development for the crypto market. It highlights a prevailing sense of caution among investors, reflecting recent market dynamics and a re-evaluation of risk. While fear can feel unsettling, understanding this index empowers you to make more informed decisions, rather than reacting purely to emotion. By combining this sentiment indicator with sound research, you can navigate the volatile world of cryptocurrency with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), helping investors understand if the market is overly fearful or overly optimistic. Q2: Why did the Crypto Fear & Greed Index drop to 44? The index dropped to 44 due to a weakening market sentiment, influenced by factors such as increased volatility, changes in market momentum and volume, social media trends, Bitcoin dominance shifts, and Google search trends, all indicating a move towards caution among investors. Q3: What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six main factors: market volatility, market momentum/volume, social media sentiment, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive sentiment score. Q4: How can investors use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Investors can use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a psychological barometer. Periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ might suggest buying opportunities, while ‘Extreme Greed’ could signal a need for caution or profit-taking. It should always be used in conjunction with other research methods. Q5: Is a ‘Fear’ zone always bad for investors? Not necessarily.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7925 Market cap $836.39M Trading volume (24-hour) $27.62M Circulating supply 1.055B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.8321 24-hour low $0.786 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.94% 50-day SMA $0.7638 14-Day RSI 51.42 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 56 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.6514 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is trading below all major moving averages with a clear downtrend structure intact. The breakdown below $0.8169 support creates overhead resistance for any bounce attempts. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart The daily Tezos chart for August 19 shows that the asset has formed a clear downtrend from its peak around $0.92, with price consistently making lower highs and lower lows while failing to reclaim the declining trendline resistance. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands show price trading below the middle band around $0.8169, a critical support level that now acts as overhead resistance and could cap any recovery attempts. The MACD remains in negative territory with bearish divergence, while the OBV suggests declining buying interest despite some accumulation phases earlier in the trend. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour timeframe reinforces the bearish outlook as Tezos trades at $0.7896, showing minimal recovery from session lows around $0.7846. The descending trendline from the $0.86 highs continues to cap rallies, creating a clear pattern of rejection at higher levels. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume remains subdued at 3.07M, indicating a lack of conviction in any bounce attempts, while the Money Flow Index has plunged to 22.21, signaling extreme oversold conditions that haven’t yet triggered meaningful buying interest. The 21-period SMA at $0.8309 acts as dynamic resistance, sitting well above current price action and confirming the downtrend remains intact across multiple timeframes. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7705 BUY SMA 5 $0.8182 SELL SMA 10 $0.8414 SELL SMA 21 $0.8229 SELL SMA 50 $0.7638 BUY SMA 100 $0.6836 BUY SMA 200 $0.6514 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8118 SELL EMA 5 $0.7701 BUY EMA 10 $0.7074 BUY EMA 21 $0.6719 BUY EMA 50 $0.7077 BUY EMA 100 $0.8036 SELL EMA 200 $0.8762 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos appears positioned for continued weakness with downside targets around $0.72-$0.74 representing the next major support cluster. Any recovery attempts will likely face strong resistance at $0.81-$0.83, making sustained upside moves difficult without significant volume expansion and momentum shift. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos unveiled Teslink, a modular interoperability layer connecting Tezos with EVM-compatible chains like Ethlink.

Understanding these shifts is vital for any crypto enthusiast. Currently, the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index sits at 45, indicating that the market is firmly in what’s known as Bitcoin Season. This reading, reported on August 20 at 00:29 UTC, shows a slight increase from the previous day, yet it still signals Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to most altcoins. But what exactly does this index mean for you and your crypto holdings? What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable metric that helps investors gauge the broader market sentiment and performance. It tracks how well the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have performed against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This index provides a clear snapshot of whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin or if Bitcoin is leading the charge. The score ranges from 1 to 100, offering a straightforward interpretation of market dynamics. Altcoin Season: This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. A high index score, typically above 75, suggests this environment. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. An index score below 25 often signifies a strong Bitcoin Season. With the index at 45, it indicates that while some altcoins might be performing, the overall trend leans towards Bitcoin’s dominance, making it a Bitcoin Season. Why Are We Experiencing Bitcoin Season? Bitcoin Season often emerges during periods of market consolidation or when major narratives begin to take shape. Bitcoin, as the pioneer cryptocurrency, often acts as a safe haven or the primary beneficiary of new capital entering the space. Investors frequently move into Bitcoin first, anticipating its price appreciation before capital eventually trickles down into altcoins. This trend highlights Bitcoin’s role as the market’s bellwether. Factors contributing to a Bitcoin Season can include: Macroeconomic uncertainties driving investors to less volatile (relatively) assets. Anticipation of significant Bitcoin-specific events, such as halving cycles or institutional adoption news. A period of profit-taking from previous altcoin rallies, with funds flowing back into Bitcoin. Understanding these underlying reasons provides a more comprehensive view of the current market state as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: Crucial Strategies When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season, it calls for a thoughtful approach to your portfolio. This period presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. Here are some actionable insights: Focus on Bitcoin: Consider accumulating Bitcoin if you believe in its long-term potential. Its dominance often suggests it will be the primary mover. Cautious Altcoin Accumulation: If you are interested in altcoins, research projects with strong fundamentals and innovative technology. Prices may be more attractive for long-term accumulation. Risk Management: Always employ robust risk management strategies. Volatility can be high, and not all altcoins will survive a prolonged Bitcoin Season. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin might be leading, a diversified portfolio can still include a select few altcoins that you believe have strong future prospects. Remember, market cycles are fluid. Staying informed and adapting your strategy is key to success in the dynamic crypto space. When Will Altcoin Season Return? The shift from Bitcoin Season back to Altcoin Season is a cyclical event, not a fixed date. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes a period where altcoins then catch up and even outperform Bitcoin significantly. Look for these indicators that might signal a return of Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Price Stability: After a major rally, if Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or consolidates, capital may start flowing into altcoins. Falling Bitcoin Dominance: A decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance chart often suggests that altcoins are gaining market share. Emergence of New Narratives: New technologies or trends (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions) can ignite specific altcoin sectors. Patience is a virtue in crypto investing. The market will undoubtedly shift again, and understanding the Altcoin Season Index helps you anticipate these changes. In conclusion, the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 45 clearly indicates that we are in a Bitcoin Season. This metric from CoinMarketCap provides crucial insights into the performance dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins. While Bitcoin leads the charge, understanding these cycles allows investors to make informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and position themselves for future opportunities. The crypto market is ever-evolving, and staying updated with such indicators is paramount for navigating its complexities successfully.

Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Bought Over 20,000 BTC In This Dip In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how some of Bitcoin’s key investors have been reacting to the latest volatility in the cryptocurrency’s price. Related Reading: Ethereum Plunges 10% After Smashing Into This Historical Barrier The holders in question are those carrying a wallet balance in the range of 10 to 10,000 BTC. At the current exchange rate of the asset, the former bound converts to $1.1 million and the latter one to $1.1 billion. Thus, the only addresses that would qualify for the range would be the ones owned by the large investors. Such entities can carry some influence in the market due to the size of their holdings, which can make their behavior worth keeping an eye on. These key holders are generally divided into two cohorts: sharks and whales. The whales are much larger than the other, so they hold the most power on the network. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the combined supply of these Bitcoin groups over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the sharks and whales saw a decline in July, suggesting some of the key investors sold at price levels near the all-time high (ATH). After bottoming a few days ago when BTC set its new ATH above $124,000, however, the metric has found a reversal, suggesting that the sharks and whales have been buying during the price drawdown that has followed. In total, investors falling inside this range have loaded up on 20,061 BTC (worth $2.3 billion) since August 13th. On a long-term scale, the two cohorts have bought a combined 225,320 BTC ($26.1 billion) since March 22nd. “There has been notable correlation between this group’s holdings and the direction of future price movement for the majority of the past five years,” explains the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen whether the same would hold true this time as well, with the shark and whale accumulation potentially leading to another price surge.

50362184,560042,1755651635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50362184.jpeg,Bitcoin Apparent Demand Weakens: Expansion Slows To 30K BTC,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-apparent-demand-weakens-expansion-slows-btc/,"Bitcoin is once again under pressure after failing to sustain momentum above the $120,000 mark and now struggling to hold support near $115,000. The recent rejection from the $125,000 level has triggered heightened volatility, with selling pressure weighing on short-term market sentiment. Despite printing new all-time highs last week, BTC has quickly retraced, moving into a consolidation phase between key support and resistance levels. Bulls remain cautious as momentum shows signs of fading, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to further downside if demand weakens. Data from CryptoQuant highlights this shift clearly: at current price levels, demand is softening while momentum indicators suggest exhaustion after months of strong gains. This cooling effect is particularly concerning given the backdrop of heavy resistance above $120,000, where many short-term holders may be tempted to take profits. A successful defense of the $115,000 zone could provide the foundation for a renewed push toward highs, but a breakdown risks triggering a deeper correction. With volatility returning and confidence being tested, all eyes are on BTC’s ability to maintain support and stabilize before making its next major move. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Shows Fading Momentum According to top analyst Axel Adler, one of the most telling on-chain signals right now is Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand . This metric tracks the net change of young investors holding coins less than one year old that have been actively moving. Positive values indicate expansion of circulation, suggesting new demand and activity from younger market participants. Negative values, in contrast, reflect coins aging into longer-term holding, signaling reduced demand from new entrants. Currently, the metric remains in positive territory, sitting around 30,000 BTC. This confirms that expanded demand still exists, but momentum has been clearly fading in recent weeks. The decline from higher levels shows that while Bitcoin continues to attract inflows, the intensity of new participation is weakening. If this value trends toward zero, it would signal cooling demand from new investors, a possible warning that fresh capital inflows are drying up. Adler notes that the market structure remains supportive of long-term strength, as older coins continue to migrate into strong hands. However, the slowdown in young investor activity at a time when Bitcoin struggles to hold support below all-time highs adds weight to the current consolidation. Traders are closely monitoring this indicator, as further decline could signal short-term vulnerability before the next major move. BTC Consolidates Below Key Level Bitcoin continues to face mounting volatility, with the 4-hour chart showing clear signs of weakness as the price hovers around $115,573. After multiple failed attempts to reclaim the $123,217 resistance level, BTC has entered a short-term downtrend, slipping below its key moving averages. The 50-day SMA has already crossed below the 100-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA looms overhead as a stronger resistance barrier, highlighting bearish momentum in the near term. The rejection from $123K has now turned into a consolidation phase, with sellers defending the $118K–$120K zone aggressively. Price action suggests that $115K has become the immediate level to watch, as a confirmed break below could open the door to deeper retracements toward $112K or even $110K. Trading volumes have also increased on down moves, signaling growing selling pressure. On the flip side, if Bitcoin manages to hold $115K and build a base, bulls may attempt another push toward $118K. However, momentum indicators suggest that buyers are losing steam, and the market could continue to consolidate before a decisive move. For now, BTC remains trapped between resistance at $123K and critical support at $115K, with the coming sessions likely to define its short-term direction.

The exchange demonstrated comprehensive upgrades across products, branding, security, and services, showcasing robust growth momentum and operational excellence. Trading Volume Growth Ranks No.1 Among Top Exchanges According to CoinGecko’s latest Q2 exchange report , HTX topped global rankings for trading volume growth, significantly outperforming industry averages. Additionally, CoinDesk’s July exchange market share report noted that HTX achieved the second-largest market share increase year-to-date, trailing only Binance—cementing its place among the top-tier global trading platforms. In July, HTX achieved remarkable performance metrics, including a 45% surge in new user registrations and 33% growth in trading volume month-over-month. HTX’s native growth engine keeps firing on all cylinders, propelled by surging organic traffic and industrial rankings that are fostering an increasingly vibrant ecosystem. HTX listed 12 new assets in July spanning AI, meme coin, and layer 1 sectors. Among them, token M debuted exclusively on the platform and soared as much as 25x, creating a significant wealth effect for early participants. The AI-focused ANI , buoyed by comments from Elon Musk, quickly became the hottest on-chain project in the humanoid AI category, posting a peak gain of 426% after listing. Other additions such as BLUM and COOKIE broadened HTX’s exposure to high-growth sectors. HTX New Listing Winners Campaigns Drive Liquidity and Brand Reach On the marketing operations front, HTX ran campaigns exclusive to stablecoins, centered on USD1, USDC, and USDD, generating over $400 million in spot trading volume. Additionally, the HTX 12th-Anniversary Carnival has begun and will run until September 12. Participants can light up “Task Planets” to earn rewards, including trading fee rebate vouchers, 0% margin interest vouchers, token airdrops, merchandise, and entries into lucky draws with grand prizes of 120 million $HTX and a $2,000 travel fund. During Istanbul Blockchain Week, HTX achieved 48+ million impressions in the Turkey market alone, and built deeper ties with partners including 0G Labs, 100xLabs, and Castrum Capital, which facilitated the listing of COOKIE. Online exposure rose by 60.8% versus prior events, with registrations and deposits hitting 14-day highs. Research and Product Upgrades Strengthen Platform This July, HTX Research published the first part of its in-depth report “ The New Stablecoin Order: Restructuring Global Payments, Regulatory Legitimization, and the Capital War ,” offering a macro view of stablecoin dynamics and forward trends. HTX also launched version 11.0 of its app , redesigning the homepage, assets page, and trading page with overhauled interfaces. Following the upgrade, homepage click-through rates jumped by 24%, streamlining the user experience. DAO Vision Refreshes with New Whitepaper HTX DAO released a newly updated Whitepaper, marking a pivotal declaration of strategic direction. The initiative signals HTX’s evolution—from a centralized exchange to a core force in on-chain financial governance—committed to building a user-led “Freeport of Finance.” Under this vision, all participants will not only share in the platform’s growth but also gain genuine decision-making power. Moving forward, the development of HTX DAO will be driven collectively by its community, opening a new chapter that blends decentralized governance with CeFi infrastructure. Strong Security and Transparent Reserves As a pioneer in implementing Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves, HTX has consistently demonstrated its dedication to transparency by publicly disclosing reserve data for 34 consecutive months. As of August 1, 2025, all reserve ratios stood at or above 100%, with full transparency via the Assets > PoR Reports section on its website. From accelerating user and trading growth to delivering standout crypto returns, product innovation, and global brand engagement, the July performance numbers underscore HTX’s ability to execute across multiple fronts. The exchange continues to deepen its user-centric approach and advance product and service innovations to help more traders seize the opportunities of the next market cycle.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, BTC is down 3% in the past 24 hours, changing hands at $113,000, while Ether is also in the red, down 5.6% to $4,100, extending a week of weakness across majors. The pullback comes despite a continued stream of bullish headlines, underscoring what market observers say is a widening gap between short-term price action and longer-term structural progress. In a recent report , Glassnode frames the decline as a function of fragility: spot momentum is fading, leverage is stretched, and profit-taking pressure is building. Even though U.S.-listed spot ETFs attracted nearly $900 million in inflows last week, Glassnode warns that without renewed conviction in spot markets, positioning remains vulnerable to deeper deleveraging. However, this view is not universal. Enflux, a Singapore-based market maker, by contrast, argued in a recent note shared with CoinDesk that the industry is maturing faster than prices suggest. Weak price action is a short-term disconnect, and traders aren't focusing on the more important headlines: Google becoming the largest shareholder in miner TeraWulf, Wyoming launching a state-backed stablecoin, and Tether hiring a former White House crypto policy official. These shifts, they argue, show capital and talent aligning around a regulatory-aligned, institutional future. The divergence in tone is telling. One camp sees fragile positioning and fading momentum; the other sees scaffolding being laid for an institutional, regulatory-aligned cycle. Prices may look unimpressed, but the industry’s trajectory suggests the market is maturing faster than charts imply. Market Movers BTC: Bitcoin fell 3.2% to below $114,000 as cryptocurrencies and related stocks extended losses ahead of the Fed’s FOMC minutes and Powell’s Jackson Hole speech later this week. ETH: Ether fell 3.5% to under $4,200 as investors reconsider the likelihood of a September Fed rate cut, with Bank of America economists warning Powell may argue for holding rates amid sticky inflation and tariff pressures. Gold: Gold edged up to $3,384.70 and silver to $38.115 in quiet trading as markets await Powell’s Jackson Hole speech Friday on the Fed’s policy outlook, while global stocks were mixed and China’s central bank injected $65 billion to steady bonds. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei slipped 1.14% to 43,050.89, retreating from record highs as investors weigh risks tied to a fragile U.S. trade deal. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday night, with the S&P 500 flat, Dow steady, and Nasdaq 100 down 0.2%, as investors awaited major retail earnings and Fed meeting minutes.

Union Square Ventures (USV), a prominent New York-based venture capital firm, has once again made headlines with a notable USV UNI sale . This move has caught the attention of on-chain analysts and the broader crypto community, raising questions about strategic portfolio adjustments by institutional investors. What’s Behind the Latest USV UNI Sale? According to on-chain data identified by Arkham, addresses linked to Union Square Ventures recently executed a substantial transaction. The firm reportedly sold 731,000 UNI tokens, valued at approximately $7.43 million. These tokens were transferred to Coinbase Prime roughly eight hours before the sale, indicating a deliberate and prepared move. This isn’t USV’s first foray into offloading UNI. On-chain analyst @EmberCN shared via an X post that this latest transaction marks the firm’s first UNI sale since December. In that earlier instance, USV offloaded an even larger sum: 3.51 million UNI tokens, fetching a remarkable $54.6 million at an average price of $15.53 per token. The consistent nature of these USV UNI sale events suggests a calculated approach to managing their digital asset portfolio. How Significant Are USV’s Remaining UNI Holdings After This Sale? Despite these considerable sales, Union Square Ventures still maintains a significant stake in the Uniswap ecosystem. USV-linked wallets currently hold approximately 9.68 million UNI tokens. At current valuations, this translates to an impressive $96.7 million. This substantial remaining holding indicates that while USV is taking profits or rebalancing its portfolio, it retains considerable exposure to UNI. For many, a venture capital firm’s continued investment, even after strategic sales, signals a long-term belief in the underlying asset and its potential. Understanding the full scope of the USV UNI sale requires looking at both what was sold and what remains. Key details of USV’s UNI activity: Recent Sale: 731,000 UNI ($7.43 million) via Coinbase Prime. Previous Sale (December): 3.51 million UNI ($54.6 million) at $15.53 average. Current Holdings: Approximately 9.68 million UNI ($96.7 million). What Does This USV UNI Sale Mean for the Market? When a major venture capital firm like USV makes significant moves in the crypto market, it often sparks discussions and speculation. Large-scale token offloads, such as this USV UNI sale , can be interpreted in several ways: Profit Taking: Given the substantial value of the tokens sold, it’s plausible that USV is realizing gains from their investment. Portfolio Rebalancing: VC firms frequently adjust their holdings to manage risk, diversify investments, or allocate capital to new opportunities. Market Sentiment: While not necessarily a bearish signal, large sales by early investors can sometimes influence market sentiment, prompting others to assess their positions. It’s important to remember that these are just a few possibilities. USV’s actions reflect their specific investment strategy and do not necessarily dictate the future trajectory of UNI or the broader DeFi market. However, monitoring such transactions provides valuable insights into institutional behavior within the evolving digital asset landscape. The ongoing interest in the USV UNI sale highlights the transparency of on-chain data and its role in understanding market dynamics. In conclusion, the recent USV UNI sale of $7.43 million in UNI tokens marks another strategic move by Union Square Ventures. While the firm has realized significant profits from its UNI holdings, its substantial remaining stake of nearly $97 million underscores its continued belief in the Uniswap ecosystem. These large-scale transactions by influential venture capital firms offer a fascinating glimpse into how institutional players navigate the volatile yet promising world of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Union Square Ventures (USV)? A1: Union Square Ventures (USV) is a well-known New York-based venture capital firm. They are recognized for their early investments in prominent technology and internet companies, including several significant projects within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Q2: What is UNI? A2: UNI is the native governance token of Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. UNI token holders can participate in the governance of the Uniswap protocol, voting on key proposals and changes. Q3: Why did USV execute this UNI token sale? A3: Venture capital firms like USV often sell portions of their holdings for various strategic reasons, including taking profits on successful investments, rebalancing their portfolio to manage risk, or freeing up capital for new investment opportunities. It’s a common practice in the investment world. Q4: How much UNI does USV still hold after this sale? A4: Despite the recent sales, USV-linked wallets still hold a substantial amount of UNI. Reports indicate they retain approximately 9.68 million UNI tokens, valued at around $96.7 million at current market prices. Q5: Does a large USV UNI sale impact the token’s price? A5: While a large sale by a prominent investor can sometimes influence market sentiment and potentially cause short-term price fluctuations, the overall impact depends on various factors, including market liquidity, broader crypto trends, and the fundamental strength of the Uniswap protocol. It’s not always a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Did you find this analysis of the USV UNI sale insightful?

The new app supports major digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), enabling users to manage mining activity directly from their mobile devices. What is cloud mining? Cloud mining involves mining cryptocurrency by renting computing power from remote data centers, eliminating the need to own or maintain mining hardware.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rapidly emerging $0.035 altcoin, is drawing attention for its innovative DeFi protocols and growing adoption, signaling potential influence in the next crypto bull cycle. Mutuum Finance token price in presale stage 6 is $0.035. It will go up by 14.29% to $0.04 in presale stage 7. Investors moving in now will receive minimum 400% returns when the token will go live. Mutuum Finance already has more than $14.6 million raised and over 15400 investors. While Ethereum maintains its dominant role, analysts are increasingly monitoring smaller players like Mutuum Finance, whose unique approach to decentralized finance could shape market dynamics in unexpected ways. Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $4,482.74, reflecting a modest 0.63% increase over the previous close. Despite recent profit-taking and a slight retreat from its intraday high of $4,489.75, ETH maintains a strong position above key support levels. Analysts remain optimistic, with projections suggesting potential gains toward $5,500–$6,000 by the end of August, contingent upon sustained institutional inflows and a favorable macroeconomic environment. However, market participants should remain vigilant, as any significant downturn could test support around $4,000. In this context, emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance are gaining attention for their innovative DeFi solutions, which could influence broader market dynamics. Mutuum Finance Presale Succeeds, Receives 95.00 Trust Score in Audit Mutuum Finance is performing very well in the DeFi sector. It has a 95.0/100 trust score, audited and assured by Certik.

President Donald Trump unveiled the new account , @whitehouse, on Tuesday evening. His debut post featured the lines: “I am your voice” and “America, we are BACK!” before greeting viewers with a casual, “What’s up, TikTok?” Trump has often credited TikTok with helping secure his youth vote in the 2024 election against Democrat Kamala Harris. His personal campaign account, @realdonaldtrump, has grown to more than 15 million followers. The Trump administration is doubling down on the platform’s reach by launching an official government account. Former White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described TikTok as vital for showcasing “the historic successes President Trump has delivered” to the widest audience possible. “During his campaign, President Trump’s message was dominant on TikTok,” Leavitt said. “We intend to build on that success and communicate in ways no other administration has before.” The White House account will share short videos highlighting Trump’s policies, events, and direct messages—part of a broader strategy to engage younger, increasingly TV-averse voters through digital platforms. Security worries and court battles escalate The launch is happening as TikTok has an uncertain future in the United States. The app was ordered to stop operating under a law passed in 2024 by Jan. 19, 2025, unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells its United States assets. And when Trump moved back into the White House in January, he shelved the ban. He first extended the deadline to April, then to June, and now to Sept. 17, 2025. Each extension has drawn criticism from Congress. Both Republicans and Democrats in Washington have warned that TikTok could surrender American user data to the Chinese authorities or distribute propaganda . Past intelligence reports have said ByteDance is “beholden” to Beijing. Critics complain that the Trump administration has largely ignored those risks. Besides, Minnesota has sued TikTok, accusing the platform of preying on young people with addictive algorithms that harm their mental health. Attorney General Keith Ellison said the case is about deception and manipulation, arguing the company knew the risks but failed to act. The lawsuit, filed under state laws on deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud, adds Minnesota to about 24 states now suing TikTok, following a nationwide investigation launched in 2022. Educators in Minnesota say they have seen a direct link between heavy TikTok use and rising depression, anxiety, and shorter attention spans among students. The case comes as President Donald Trump continues efforts to broker a deal for American investors to take over TikTok from its Chinese parent ByteDance amid data security concerns. TikTok has denied the allegations. Trump wields TikTok amid security risks Trump embraced social media early on to forge his political brand. From Twitter in his first presidency to Truth Social in his second, he has taken to online platforms to circumvent traditional media and communicate directly with supporters. On Truth Social, he posts most days and uses the platform to announce policies, attack opponents, and rally his base. He still posts to X (the platform once known as Twitter) and Instagram, but has largely pulled back to maintain a presence across all the major platforms. TikTok, however, offers something different. Its algorithm-based feed has a predilection for short, zippy videos that can go viral across broad swaths of people. This makes it a powerful megaphone for political messages. Trump’s campaign realized this in 2024 as brief clips of rallies and soundbites went viral, boosting his standing among younger voters. Campaign strategists say no other app provides instant reach to millions of people who don’t normally follow politics. But TikTok is more than a campaign cudgel — it is also a national security headache. National security officials have warned that the app’s Chinese ownership could make it a tool for the Chinese government to conduct espionage. The issue is user privacy and the ability to alter what Americans see, hear, and believe subtly. This is what makes the White House’s embrace of TikTok so paradoxical. On the one hand, the administration is pouring energy into using the app to connect with Americans. Meanwhile, Trump himself has postponed but not killed a law that would potentially ban TikTok on national security grounds. Get seen where it counts.

Writing on Truth Social, Trump said : “Could somebody please inform Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can’t get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut. ‘Too Late’ is a disaster!” The post landed as housing data continues to show cracks, and building sentiment slumps across the country. Despite a small jump in home construction last month, builder confidence has fallen again, mortgage rates remain high, and incentives are being thrown around like candy. Economists see no improvement in sight, and Trump, now in his second term in the White House, is placing the blame directly on Powell for delaying rate cuts that he believes are long overdue. Homebuilders slash prices as demand stays weak Last month, housing starts in the U.S. increased by 5.2%, reaching an annualized rate of 1.43 million homes. This is the highest figure in five months and was driven mostly by a rise in multifamily project construction. Still, the mood among homebuilders is in the gutter. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to 32 in August, the lowest level since December 2022, down from 33 in July. Economists had expected it to move up to 34. The drop reflects deep concerns about affordability and buyer hesitation. NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes, who builds homes in Lexington, North Carolina, said, “Affordability continues to be the top challenge for the housing market and buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to drop to move forward.” Hughes also pointed to long-standing issues developers face with land regulation and other construction-related red tape. Conditions have forced over a third of homebuilders to cut prices, with the average cut landing at 5%. On top of that, 66% of firms are offering sales incentives—the highest since the pandemic. Buyers are hard to find, and those who are interested are holding off until interest rates come down. Meanwhile, builder optimism about future sales hasn’t budged, and current sales conditions have worsened. Regionally, the Northeast saw confidence nosedive to the lowest point since January 2023. Sentiment in the South and Midwest stayed flat, while the West saw only a small improvement. Buyer foot traffic, though slightly higher than May, remains weak overall. Mortgage rates fall slightly but pressure builds on Powell The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.58% last week. That’s the lowest since October, and almost half a percentage point lower than where it stood at the start of this year. But this drop hasn’t been enough to shift the market. Buyers are still waiting, and builders are still bleeding. Robert Dietz, Chief Economist at NAHB, said, “Given a slowing housing market and other recent economic data, the Fed’s monetary policy committee should return to lowering the federal funds rate, which will reduce financing costs for housing construction and indirectly help mortgage interest rates.” But Powell hasn’t moved. All eyes are now on the Fed’s next policy meeting, where expectations for a cut are growing louder. This week, the Census Bureau is set to release July data on new home groundbreakings and permit filings. The outlook doesn’t look promising. In June, single-family housing starts dropped to an 11-month low, and permits fell to the lowest level in over two years. Economists told Reuters they don’t expect much better from July’s numbers.

This level is just 15% away from the coin’s all-time high. Chainlink is also making noise with a sharp breakout, showing signs of a potential 60% rise that could set up new highs. But the project turning heads is not trading on exchanges yet. Cold Wallet , now in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998, has already onboarded over 2 million users from its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition. With Stage 1 starting at $0.007 and a confirmed listing at $0.3517, it shows an ROI window sharper than ETH or LINK. Ethereum’s ETF Inflows Fuel $4,800 Outlook Ethereum is trading close to $4,293 after record ETF demand. A single day saw $1.02 billion flow into spot ETH ETFs. Leading the charge was BlackRock, which purchased 150,000 ETH worth $6.40 million. Fidelity and other funds followed, bringing total ETF inflows to $10.8 billion. This price marks Ethereum’s strongest level in more than two years and leaves it just 15% below the record highs from November 2021. On-chain data adds to the bullish case, showing ETH balances on exchanges at a nine-year low. With less supply available, selling pressure is falling. The technical picture also supports the case for growth. Resistance sits at $4,352, with price targets stretching to $4,800. If institutional demand continues, Ethereum could break higher, making it one of the most closely watched assets in this cycle. Chainlink Could Push Toward $50 Chainlink has shown strength after clearing long-term resistance. The breakout signals the chance for a 60% gain, with demand building and supply falling. Prices recently pushed through a trend that capped growth for months. The project’s progress is not limited to charts. A new partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) will deliver financial-grade data to blockchains. This expands its utility far beyond DeFi, strengthening its long-term role. Analysts point to several targets if the current trend holds. In the short run, LINK could push to around $26. Over the next few months, a rise to $31–$32 looks possible. Longer term, LINK may reach $35–$36. For those seeking the next strong mover, its technicals and expanding network utility suggest further gains are possible. Cold Wallet Presale Surpasses $6.3M Cold Wallet is changing the way launches unfold. Instead of raising funds first and searching for adoption later, it is entering the market with more than 2 million users in place. This reach comes from its $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet. Its model centers on utility, not speculation. Every swap, bridge, or transfer through Cold Wallet generates cashback rewards. That means the presale is not about testing interest but scaling an active user economy before the official listing. Stage 17 pricing sits at $0.00998, compared to $0.007 in Stage 1. Each new stage edges closer to the $0.3517 confirmed listing price. With $6.3 million already raised and more than 700 million coins sold, demand is climbing quickly. This momentum shows why the presale stages are closing faster than expected. As the window shrinks, so does the ROI gap. Those who wait until after launch may find the highest returns already gone. Why Cold Wallet Could Outpace ETH and LINK Ethereum’s strength comes from institutional demand, and Chainlink’s progress is tied to expanding partnerships. Both could generate sizable gains, but they remain tied to market swings and external factors. Cold Wallet offers a different angle. Priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, it carries a projected upside of 3,423% to its $0.3517 launch level. Unlike ETH or LINK, it begins its journey with millions of users and a functioning cashback system. This combination of adoption, utility, and growth potential sets it apart. Cold Wallet is not promising future development; it is already delivering value before listing. While Ethereum and Chainlink could continue to climb, Cold Wallet’s structure offers a quicker and potentially more certain path to exponential returns.

Solana is showing strength as it approaches $200, backed by technical breakouts and rising volume. PEPE is holding ground after a $40 million whale sell-off, with retail interest driving its recent price action. While both coins reflect short-term traction, BlockDAG is offering more than price movement. Its 200 ETH giveaway ties immediate incentives to deeper investment, rewarding buyers based on their presale volume. With $377 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG positions itself as a top coin project with a value-backed participation model. ETH Is the Prize, BDAG Is the Path: A Win-Win Formula for Investors BlockDAG’s 200 ETH giveaway is more than a headline. Instead, it’s a calculated incentive strategy designed to convert buyer interest into sustained commitment. The structure is simple: the more BDAG you purchase during the presale, the greater your odds of winning up to $1 million in Ethereum. There are no auctions. No complex rules. Just pure participation tied to investment. Consequently, this format flips the traditional model. Instead of separating speculation from utility, BlockDAG blends them. Investors are not only buying into a top coin project with strong long-term fundamentals, but also entering a high-reward competition with immediate upside. As a result, it’s a dual benefit that encourages faster decisions while reinforcing brand loyalty. Moreover, what sets this apart is BlockDAG’s credibility. After a successful 10 BTC auction that paid out over $1 million in gains, the project has shown it delivers on its promises. The numbers back it up: the presale has raised $377 million so far, with over 25 billion BDAG sold. Currently in batch 29, the token is priced at $0.0276, a 2,660% return since batch 1. Ultimately, this isn’t a short-term pump. Rather, it’s a long-game strategy that aligns buyer interest with project growth. As the mainnet approaches and momentum builds, this ETH giveaway functions as both an entry point and a confidence signal. For those tracking presale performance with an eye for real opportunity, BlockDAG continues to separate itself as a top coin project where short-term value and long-term vision are clearly aligned. Solana Price Momentum: Eyes on a Break Above $200 Currently, Solana is riding a notable wave of SOL price momentum, having broken out from a rising channel and closing in on the $200 level after bouncing from sub‑$160 earlier in August. This breakout reflects a series of higher highs and higher lows, suggesting buyers remain in control. Furthermore, futures volume has surged by over 66 percent to $44 billion, and open interest has jumped nearly 17 percent, both bolstering confidence in the strength behind the move. On the short‑term charts, however, technical indicators remain bullish yet cautionary: the RSI sits deep in overbought territory at 72.5, and prices are trading above the upper Bollinger Band, hinting at a possible short pause or pullback. Retail Strength Holds Ground as PEPE Coin Price Eyes Breakout Despite a $40 million sell-off from major holders, PEPE coin price posted a 9% gain, defying bearish pressure with growing retail momentum. Notably, the number of wallets holding PEPE increased from 207,000 to 211,000 in just a week, reflecting renewed interest from smaller investors. Meanwhile, technical signals remain mixed. While the On-Balance Volume shows consistent inflows, it hasn’t surpassed recent highs. In addition, bull-bear power has shifted toward buyers, though the intensity remains lower than previous peaks. At the same time, price action is now consolidating within a descending triangle, a pattern that often precedes a sharp move. If retail demand continues to hold firm, a breakout above this pattern could push PEPE up another 20%. Conversely, a breakdown would open room for deeper corrections. BlockDAG Outpaces Short-Term Hype with Long-Term Strategy While Solana tracks upward and PEPE leans on retail support, both rely heavily on short bursts of momentum. BlockDAG takes a different approach by connecting incentives to commitment through its 200 ETH giveaway. Instead of focusing solely on price, it builds value through participation, encouraging buyers to become part of its growth story. With $377 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI from batch one, BlockDAG’s presale structure offers more than a market reaction. It sets up a foundation where rewards and trust grow together, positioning it as a top coin project with a clear, steady purpose.

50364432,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=806865,1755655236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50364432.jpeg,Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Nearing Profit Zones That Marked Past Market Tops,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-warns-bitcoin-nearing-profit-zones-that-marked-past-market-tops/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has once again slipped under the $120,000 price mark, retracing after reaching a new all-time high above $124,000 last week. As of the latest market data, BTC is trading around $115,557, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 7% below its peak. This price movement suggests that the asset is currently consolidating after its recent rally, leaving market participants watching closely for the next directional move. Meanwhile, analysts are turning to on-chain data for signals on Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. One such perspective comes from PelinayPA, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, who examined long-term holder (LTH) behavior using a set of profit and loss metrics. The findings highlight that while profit-taking has begun, current selling levels remain below historical extremes seen in past bull market peaks. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP, ETH’s Pullback: Key Factors Behind The Recent Drop Tracking Long-Term Holder Signals According to PelinayPA, the LTH analysis uses several indicators to measure the relationship between Bitcoin’s price and the cost basis of long-term holders. Profit and loss bands, ranging from 150% to 1,000% above cost basis, help determine when Bitcoin enters zones historically associated with a higher risk of market tops. When BTC approaches the +500% band, it has often coincided with heightened selling activity and eventual cycle peaks. The analysis also incorporates a Spending Binary Indicator, which reflects the intensity of LTH selling, alongside “High Spending” signals that typically emerge near market tops and “Bottom Alerts” that occur during deep corrections. Reviewing past cycles, PelinayPA pointed to 2017 and 2021, where bear market downturns followed heavy long-term holder selling, while the 2022–2023 bottom was marked by multiple loss realization alerts around the $15,000–$20,000 range. Currently, Bitcoin sits within the 150%–350% profit band, leaving potential room for further growth, though the risk of a market top rises as the asset approaches the higher bands. The analyst noted that while green profit-taking bars are visible today, they remain well below the levels observed in earlier cycle peaks. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Short, Mid, and Long Term In outlining the potential scenarios, PelinayPA suggested that Bitcoin may remain range-bound in the short term, as controlled profit-taking by long-term holders limits upside momentum. However, if accumulation and broader demand continue, the price could advance into the $124,000–$178,000 range, corresponding to the higher profit thresholds on the LTH model. For the mid-term outlook, extending into late 2025, the analyst cautioned that if long-term holder selling intensifies like in 2021, Bitcoin could be nearing a cycle top. In such a scenario, the asset might peak above $150,000 before the next major correction. Looking ahead to 2026, the absence of new bottom alerts suggests that the market is still within the later stages of the ongoing bull cycle, rather than transitioning into a confirmed bear market.

50364441,560245,1755655243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50364441.jpeg,Crypto Giants Team Up: New Nonprofit Aims to Shape Washington’s View on Blockchain & AI,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-new-nonprofit-washingtons-view-blockchain-ai/,"A new nonprofit backed by some of the most prominent players in the crypto asset space has launched with the goal of improving how US lawmakers engage with emerging technologies. The American Innovation Project (AIP), supported by Coinbase, Uniswap Labs, Kraken, Paradigm, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG), officially began operations this week. The organization was formed to serve as a conduit between policymakers and the technology industry at a time when regulation of digital assets and artificial intelligence is moving to the forefront of US economic policy. According to its mission statement, AIP aims to create forums where lawmakers, industry leaders , and researchers can engage directly to better understand the implications of blockchain, AI, and related innovations. Mission and Structure of the American Innovation Project Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute, will lead AIP as president. In a statement, Smith explained that the nonprofit’s objective is to provide legislators with “the knowledge, context, and tools they need as they consider timely rules and regulations that meet the moment.” She emphasized that the group intends to promote bipartisan dialogue, bridging political divides to ensure regulatory decisions keep pace with rapid technological change. AIP plans to host a series of events, including workshops and roundtable discussions , designed to translate complex technological developments into accessible policy discussions. These gatherings will cover a broad range of topics, from the regulatory treatment of stablecoins to the implications of AI in financial services and national competitiveness. By engaging experts across sectors, AIP hopes to position itself as a central resource for government officials. The organization has secured seed funding from the Cedar Innovation Foundation, along with a $1 million contribution from Digital Currency Group. Mark Murphy, president of DCG, highlighted the initiative’s importance, stating that “the future of the U.S. economy will be shaped by the choices we make today in developing emerging technologies.” Policy Context and Industry Backing The launch of AIP comes at a moment of heightened activity in Washington regarding digital asset regulation. In recent months, lawmakers have advanced significant bills addressing cryptocurrency oversight . Last month, President Donald signed legislation establishing a federal framework for stablecoins, while the House of Representatives passed a comprehensive measure to regulate the crypto industry more broadly. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has begun “Project Crypto,” an initiative to update the agency’s rules governing custody , trading, and token distributions. Against this backdrop, AIP’s efforts to improve dialogue between the private sector and policymakers highlight the growing recognition that effective regulation requires technical fluency. Its founding supporters represent a cross-section of the digital asset ecosystem, from exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken to venture firms such as Paradigm, as well as associations like the National Cryptocurrency Association.

Onlookers and market analysts quickly took note when Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service, reported a substantial movement of Bitcoin. This particular transaction involved 2,000 BTC, which moved from the digital asset financial service provider Hashkey to a wallet whose owner remains unidentified. This single BTC transfer holds an estimated value of approximately $226 million, highlighting its immense scale and potential market impact. What Happened with This Significant BTC Transfer? The core of the news revolves around a large-scale Bitcoin movement. Specifically, 2,000 Bitcoin, worth a staggering $226 million at the time of the report, departed from Hashkey’s holdings. This type of transaction, often termed a ‘whale movement,’ immediately draws attention due to the sheer volume of assets involved. It signifies a major shift in digital wealth. Source of Funds: Hashkey, a well-known entity in the digital asset space. Destination: An ‘unknown wallet,’ meaning the recipient’s identity is not publicly linked to the address. Reported By: Whale Alert, a service dedicated to tracking large cryptocurrency transactions. Such a substantial BTC transfer can often precede significant market activity or indicate a strategic shift by a large holder. Why Do Large BTC Transfers Capture Attention? Large Bitcoin movements, especially those involving significant sums like this BTC transfer , always spark curiosity and discussion within the crypto community. These transactions are often seen as indicators of potential future market trends or shifts in investor sentiment. When a ‘whale’ moves a large amount of Bitcoin, it suggests a strategic decision is underway, which could impact supply, demand, or overall market stability. Consider these key reasons why such transfers matter: Market Sentiment: Large movements can influence whether the market feels bullish (optimistic) or bearish (pessimistic). Supply Dynamics: A large transfer to an exchange might suggest an intent to sell, while a transfer away could mean holding or cold storage. Transparency vs. Privacy: While transactions are on a public ledger, the identity behind an ‘unknown wallet’ remains private, adding a layer of mystery. Decoding the “Unknown Wallet”: Challenges and Speculations The term “unknown wallet” is crucial here. On the blockchain, every transaction is transparent, but the identities behind the wallet addresses are not always public. This anonymity is a core feature of many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Therefore, while we know the Bitcoin moved, identifying the exact entity that received this BTC transfer is challenging. Speculations often arise regarding the purpose of such a move: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals often use OTC desks for significant trades to avoid impacting exchange prices. Exchange Rebalancing: Exchanges sometimes move funds between their own cold and hot wallets for security or operational reasons. Institutional Accumulation: A large entity might be accumulating Bitcoin for long-term holding. Security Relocation: Funds might be moving to a more secure cold storage solution. Without further information, the true intent behind this particular BTC transfer remains a subject of speculation. Potential Market Implications of This BTC Transfer The immediate impact of a large BTC transfer is not always clear-cut. While some might interpret it as a precursor to selling pressure, others may see it as a sign of long-term holding or institutional adoption. The market’s reaction largely depends on broader economic conditions and prevailing crypto sentiment. Investors typically monitor such whale movements closely, as they can sometimes signal upcoming volatility or stability. For instance, if the BTC moved to an exchange, it could suggest an intention to sell, potentially increasing supply and putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, if it moved to a private cold storage wallet, it might indicate a long-term holding strategy, reducing immediate supply and potentially supporting prices. The recent BTC transfer from Hashkey to an unknown wallet is a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the specific intentions behind this $226 million move remain private, such large transactions underscore the significant capital flowing within the digital asset ecosystem. Monitoring these whale movements provides valuable, albeit sometimes ambiguous, insights into the market’s pulse and potential future directions. As the crypto space continues to mature, understanding these large-scale transfers becomes increasingly vital for investors and enthusiasts alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “whale movement” in crypto? A “whale movement” refers to a large transaction of cryptocurrency, typically involving a significant amount of a particular asset, executed by a single individual or entity (known as a “whale”) that holds a substantial portion of that asset. Why is the destination wallet often “unknown”? Blockchain transactions are pseudonymous. While the wallet address is public, the real-world identity of the person or entity controlling that address is not inherently linked or revealed, making it an “unknown” wallet to the public. Does a large BTC transfer always mean a price change is coming? Not necessarily. While large transfers can sometimes precede price volatility, they can also be for internal purposes (like exchange rebalancing or moving to cold storage) and may not directly lead to immediate price changes. It depends on the context and the ultimate destination of the funds. How can I track large crypto transactions like this BTC transfer? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking and reporting large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Many crypto news sites and analytics platforms also provide updates on significant movements. If you found this analysis insightful, share it with your network!

Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a significant movement of 2,068 Bitcoin (BTC) from an unidentified wallet to Hashkey, a well-known digital asset financial services group. This transaction, valued at approximately $233 million, immediately captured the attention of market observers and analysts alike. Such large-scale movements often signal potential shifts or strategies within the crypto ecosystem, prompting questions about their implications. What Does This Significant BTC Transfer Mean? This particular BTC transfer involves a substantial sum, making it noteworthy. When a large quantity of Bitcoin moves from an ‘unknown’ or ‘cold’ wallet to an exchange, it typically sparks curiosity. The ‘unknown wallet’ refers to an address not publicly associated with any known entity, adding an element of mystery to the transaction. Conversely, Hashkey is a regulated platform, suggesting a move towards a more formal or institutional environment. Key aspects of this transaction include: Scale: 2,068 BTC represents a significant portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, impacting potential market dynamics. Origin: The ‘unknown wallet’ status indicates a holder who has maintained anonymity, possibly a long-term holder or an early adopter. Destination: Hashkey’s role as a licensed digital asset platform implies a move towards liquidity, custody, or regulated trading. Why Do Large BTC Transfers Spark Investor Interest? Large BTC transfers , especially those involving ‘whale’ wallets, often generate considerable buzz. Investors and traders closely monitor these movements because they can sometimes precede significant market events. For instance, a large influx of BTC to an exchange might suggest an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and exerting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a large withdrawal from an exchange could indicate accumulation or a move to long-term storage, which might be seen as bullish. However, it is crucial to remember that a large BTC transfer does not automatically predict market direction. These transactions can serve various purposes: Consolidating holdings Moving funds for over-the-counter (OTC) deals Rebalancing portfolios Preparing for institutional investment Who is Hashkey and What Could This BTC Transfer Signal? Hashkey Group is a prominent end-to-end digital asset financial services group based in Asia. They operate regulated exchanges, provide asset management, and offer blockchain solutions. The transfer of 2,068 BTC to Hashkey could signal several possibilities: Institutional Activity: Hashkey serves institutional clients. This BTC transfer could be part of a larger institutional investment strategy, where a fund or corporation is either acquiring or rebalancing its Bitcoin holdings through a regulated channel. Custody Services: The Bitcoin might be moving into Hashkey’s secure custody solutions, indicating a desire for professional, regulated storage rather than self-custody in an unknown wallet. OTC Trading: The funds might be earmarked for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, which allows large transactions to occur without directly impacting exchange order books. Understanding the destination helps contextualize the transfer. Hashkey’s reputation as a compliant and secure platform adds a layer of professionalism to this significant move. The Enduring Mystery of the Unknown Wallet While the destination of this substantial BTC transfer is clear, the origin remains shrouded in anonymity. This highlights a fundamental characteristic of blockchain technology: transparency of transactions combined with the pseudonymity of participants. The identity behind the ‘unknown wallet’ could be a long-term holder, a private individual, or even an entity moving assets for strategic reasons. Without further information, the exact motive behind this particular transfer remains speculative, adding to the intrigue of such whale movements. In conclusion, the movement of 2,068 BTC to Hashkey is a significant event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate implications are subject to interpretation, such large-scale BTC transfers are always worth monitoring for insights into market sentiment, institutional adoption, and the evolving landscape of digital assets. It reminds us that behind the numbers, there are often strategic decisions shaping the future of Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale alert’ in cryptocurrency? A: A ‘whale alert’ refers to a notification system that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions, often involving significant amounts of Bitcoin or other digital assets. These alerts help observers identify major movements by large holders, or ‘whales’. Q2: What is Hashkey? A: Hashkey Group is a prominent digital asset financial services group based in Asia. They offer a range of services including regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, asset management, and blockchain solutions, primarily catering to institutional and professional investors. Q3: Why are large BTC transfers important to track? A: Large BTC transfers are important because they can signal potential market activity, such as selling pressure if funds move to exchanges, or accumulation if they move to cold storage. They offer insights into the strategies of major holders and institutional players, influencing market sentiment. Q4: Does this BTC transfer mean Bitcoin’s price will drop? A: Not necessarily. While a large transfer to an exchange can indicate an intent to sell, it could also be for other purposes like OTC deals, rebalancing, or moving to regulated custody. The price impact depends on the actual intent and subsequent actions of the recipient. Q5: How secure are such large BTC transfers? A: Bitcoin transactions are secured by the underlying blockchain technology, which uses cryptography to ensure immutability and prevent double-spending. However, the security of the funds ultimately depends on the security practices of the sender and recipient wallets/exchanges. Share This Insightful Article!

Whales are loading up, meme coins are exploding, and presale stages are closing faster than ever. Just last week, Neiro made waves with its lightning-fast community growth, while Memecoin shocked skeptics with back-to-back exchange listings. These shifts highlight one truth: momentum drives everything in crypto, and timing is everything. That’s why Arctic Pablo Coin is creating so much noise right now. Sitting at its 37th location, called “Ice Ice Baby,” Pablo is not just another meme coin. It’s a full-blown adventure. With a presale price of $0.00088, more than $3.5 million raised, and a built-in 66% APY staking program, Arctic Pablo is staging itself as one of the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025. Every location unlocks new scarcity thanks to its token burn system, giving investors both urgency and confidence that supply will stay tight. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) — The Adventure-Packed Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 In the heart of an icy expanse, where myths intertwine with reality, Arctic Pablo Coin embarks on a journey across frozen realms. Each presale phase isn’t just a number—it’s a new location with a backstory, a bonus stage that keeps fueling frenzy. Right now, the 37th location, “Ice Ice Baby,” is live at $0.00088, with Pablo having already secured more than $3.5 million in raised funds. For investors, this isn’t just a presale—it’s a narrative that blends gamification, scarcity, and wealth creation. Arctic Pablo is more than a meme coin—it’s a story. It invites investors to join Pablo on his myth-busting ride through icy lands, discovering shimmering APC tokens that promise ROI beyond imagination. At this current presale point, ROI for earliest joiners is already clocking over 5,766%. With projections running as high as 11,263% if it hits $0.1, the clock is ticking. And here’s the kicker: the presale is ending soon, and when the listing hits $0.008, today’s entry point will vanish for good. The tokenomics back this up. With a total supply of 221.2 billion APC, half of it (110.6 billion) goes directly into public presale. Weekly unsold tokens get burned, permanently reducing supply. At listing, $APC will open at $0.008, guaranteeing more than 809% ROI for anyone buying at the current location. Analysts project an eventual rise to $0.1, which would hand out more than 11,263% ROI. For earliest buyers, ROI already stands at 5,766%. That’s why Arctic Pablo stands out as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 —its entire journey creates urgency to jump in before the next location closes. But the attraction doesn’t stop at price. The 66% APY staking program transforms Pablo into a yield engine. Simply stake tokens and watch them multiply, vested for just two months post-launch. Add referral rewards, community competitions, and a two-fold burn system, and the mechanics keep buyers locked in. Even a $50,000 stake today equals 113,636,000 APCs, ballooning to more than $909,000 when the listing price goes live. Throw in the 200% bonus coin offer with the code BONUS100, and it’s clear: this is the bonus stage nobody wants to miss. Neiro — Viral Energy Meets Meme Power Neiro has quickly turned itself into one of the most talked-about projects in the meme ecosystem. Originally dismissed by critics as “just another Doge spin-off,” Neiro defied the odds with viral traction on X (Twitter) and TikTok. Its strength lies in community hype, which fuels short-term spikes. Just this month, Neiro recorded a trading surge after partnerships with prominent influencers pushed daily volume past the $200 million mark. However, unlike Pablo, Neiro lacks a staking program or token burn mechanism. This means sustainability relies heavily on community buzz. Still, its fast adoption curve proves that in crypto, virality can outpace mechanics. With a recent price breakout near $0.00013, investors see short-term ROI potential if the rally sustains. Memecoin — The OG of Meme Branding Memecoin, true to its name, has become the “brand coin” of the meme world. Built as both a token and a marketing engine, celebrity investors and entertainment giants have picked it up. Recent listings on top-tier exchanges added even more liquidity, pushing its market cap over $400 million. For a token built purely on brand identity, that’s a strong signal of staying power. Memecoin isn’t about elaborate mechanics like Arctic Pablo or hype-first models like Neiro. Instead, it markets itself as the cultural backbone of meme trading. By leveraging partnerships with gaming studios and NFT platforms, Memecoin is building an ecosystem that keeps it relevant beyond just speculation. Its steady growth model has allowed it to carve a niche as one of the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 for traders looking for cultural relevance combined with mainstream adoption. Final Thoughts Based on the research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025. With its unique location-based presale system, token burns, and 66% APY staking program, it’s offering investors structured pathways to extraordinary ROI. Neiro rides the viral meme train, while Memecoin plays the role of branding giant. But only Pablo blends myth, mechanics, and momentum. Arctic Pablo’s bonus code BONUS100 with 200% extra coins sweetens the pot even further. Join the Pablo meme coin presale now—before the gates to the next location lock shut.

Recently, two Nasdaq-listed companies, BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, have made headlines for their significant Ethereum holdings . Their accumulation strategies, particularly at average costs below the current market price, highlight a fascinating trend in corporate crypto adoption. What Are These Strategic Ethereum Holdings? On-chain analyst @EmberCN reported that BitMine Immersion Technologies, primarily known as a Bitcoin miner, began accumulating Ethereum (ETH) on July 9. By August 17, this company held a substantial 1,523,373 ETH. Their average acquisition cost stood at an impressive $3,730. This demonstrates a calculated approach to building their Ethereum holdings . BitMine Immersion Technologies: Acquired 1,523,373 ETH at an average cost of $3,730. SharpLink Gaming: Started buying on June 13, accumulating 740,760 ETH at an average cost of $3,478. To put this into perspective, CoinMarketCap data showed ETH trading at $4,072.50, despite a 5.44% drop in the past 24 hours. Both companies acquired their Ethereum holdings at prices significantly below this figure, indicating a shrewd entry point. Why Are Companies Building Such Significant Ethereum Holdings? The decision by publicly traded companies to accumulate substantial amounts of a volatile asset like Ethereum is not taken lightly. Several factors likely influence these strategic Ethereum holdings : Long-Term Belief: These firms may hold a strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential, viewing it as a foundational asset for the decentralized web. Diversification: For BitMine, primarily a Bitcoin miner, adding ETH to its balance sheet provides diversification within the crypto sector. DeFi and NFT Growth: Ethereum remains the leading blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Exposure to ETH offers a stake in these booming ecosystems. Staking Opportunities: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, companies can potentially generate passive income by staking their Ethereum holdings . This trend suggests a growing institutional comfort level with digital assets beyond just Bitcoin. What Do These Ethereum Holdings Signify for the Market? The accumulation of significant Ethereum holdings by Nasdaq-listed entities sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It underscores increasing institutional interest and validation of Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. When established companies like BitMine and SharpLink commit capital, it can bolster investor confidence. Moreover, these substantial holdings could influence market dynamics. If these companies continue to accumulate, it could reduce the circulating supply, potentially creating upward price pressure. Conversely, any large-scale selling could lead to downward pressure. For now, their average acquisition costs suggest they are in a favorable position, holding their ETH below current market values. Key Takeaways from BitMine and SharpLink’s Ethereum Holdings The actions of BitMine and SharpLink offer valuable lessons for anyone interested in the crypto market: Strategic Accumulation: Both companies acquired their ETH at attractive price points, demonstrating careful market timing. Institutional Validation: Their involvement highlights a growing acceptance of Ethereum among publicly traded firms. Diversification Benefits: For miners or gaming companies, adding crypto assets like ETH can broaden their investment portfolios. Long-Term Vision: These significant Ethereum holdings likely reflect a long-term bullish outlook on the asset’s future utility and value. Understanding these corporate strategies provides a glimpse into the evolving landscape of digital asset investment. The strategic accumulation of Ethereum holdings by companies like BitMine and SharpLink is more than just a financial transaction; it represents a significant vote of confidence in the future of decentralized technologies. Their ability to acquire large quantities of ETH at favorable average costs positions them well for potential future gains, and their actions certainly warrant attention from the wider crypto community. As the digital asset space matures, such institutional movements will likely become increasingly common, shaping market trends and validating the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.823 Market cap $824.91M Trading volume $239.21M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.8713 24-hour low $0.8174 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.82% 50-day SMA $0.9753 14-Day RSI 43.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 56 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $1.2625 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF shows signs of stabilization above the $0.799 support with modest upside momentum Breaking above resistance at $0.847-$0.916 will determine if recovery can gain traction. The observed volume decline suggests a consolidation phase before the next major directional move. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart The daily WIF chart for August 20 displays a modest recovery with the price at $0.830, up 0.36%, attempting to stabilize after the brutal selloff from highs near $1.030. The coin has found temporary support around the $0.799 level, marked by the lower Bollinger Band, while the middle band sits at $0.916, representing the first major resistance hurdle. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The descending trendline from the peak continues to cap upside moves around $0.920-$0.930, creating a formidable barrier for any sustained rally attempt. Volume has contracted significantly to 30.92M. The RSI at 47.17 indicates neutral momentum territory, while price remains trapped between the critical $0.799 support and $0.916 resistance zone. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour timeframe shows WIF attempting to build a base above the $0.813-$0.810 support cluster. The Alligator indicator shows all three lines converging around current price levels, suggesting a potential breakout scenario in either direction. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview Most notably, price has broken above the short-term descending trendline and is testing the $0.841 resistance level, with the next major obstacle at $0.847. The OBV at 3.45M shows declining volume participation, indicating that while selling pressure has eased, strong buying conviction remains absent. The consolidation pattern between $0.813-$0.847 suggests WIF is preparing for its next directional move. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7138 BUY SMA 5 $0.7987 BUY SMA 10 $0.9072 SELL SMA 21 $0.9181 SELL SMA 50 $0.9753 SELL SMA 100 $0.9796 SELL SMA 200 $1.2625 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9558 SELL EMA 5 $0.9503 SELL EMA 10 $0.8890 SELL EMA 21 $0.7649 BUY EMA 50 $0.7028 BUY EMA 100 $0.9222 SELL EMA 200 $1.3250 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF appears to be at a critical juncture where a break above $0.847-$0.850 could target the $0.916 resistance, while failure to hold $0.813 support opens the door to retest $0.799 lows. The immediate bias remains neutral with slight bullish undertones. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Recent data reveals that Bitcoin’s (BTC) 30-day options delta skew on Deribit has surged to 12%, marking its highest point in over four months. This crucial indicator often reflects market sentiment, and its current reading suggests a notable shift in how traders perceive future price movements. While a high skew typically points to apprehension, understanding its full implications requires a deeper look into its mechanics and historical context. What is the Bitcoin Options Market Skew Telling Us? Understanding the 30-day options delta skew is vital for grasping the current sentiment in the Bitcoin options market . This gauge measures the relative pricing of call and put options. It essentially tells us which side of the market – bullish or bearish – traders are willing to pay a premium for. Under neutral market conditions, this skew typically hovers between -6% and +6%. This range indicates a relatively balanced view between upside potential and downside risk. A reading above 10%, like the current 12%, indicates elevated fear among participants. It suggests a significantly higher demand for put options compared to call options. Put options provide the right to sell an asset at a specific price, serving as insurance against price drops. Therefore, a surge in their demand signals that a significant portion of the market is bracing for potential downside volatility in BTC, indicating a collective defensive posture. This metric is a powerful tool for gauging short-term market expectations, offering a glimpse into the collective anxiety or confidence of professional traders. Decoding the Fear: Why is the Bitcoin Options Market Reacting This Way? Why would the Bitcoin options market suddenly exhibit such a strong signal of fear? Several factors could contribute to this shift in sentiment. Traders might be reacting to a combination of macroeconomic uncertainties, such as inflation concerns or interest rate hikes, which can dampen appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Additionally, anticipation of upcoming regulatory announcements or a general cooling-off period after recent price rallies could prompt investors to secure their gains or hedge against potential pullbacks. This heightened demand for downside protection often reflects a collective anxiety about the immediate future of Bitcoin’s price. It’s a snapshot of prevailing short-term expectations, where market participants are actively seeking to mitigate potential losses rather than aggressively betting on further rallies. This proactive hedging highlights a cautious approach among those active in the options space. Historical Insights: Does Fear Always Lead to a Dip in Bitcoin? Interestingly, a high fear signal in the Bitcoin options market does not always guarantee a price downturn. History offers a compelling counter-example that challenges this assumption, suggesting that extreme fear can sometimes precede a strong recovery or even a new rally. The last time this specific skew reached a similar level (13%) was on April 7. At that time, many feared a significant correction. Following that peak, BTC did experience a brief dip, falling below $74,500. This initial reaction aligned with the fear signal. However, what happened next was remarkable: Bitcoin quickly reversed course, surging significantly to reach $104,150 by May 8. This demonstrates that the market can surprise, turning perceived weakness into strength. This historical precedent suggests that while the current skew indicates caution, it doesn’t necessarily signal the definitive end of Bitcoin’s impressive rally. Instead, it might represent a moment of market re-evaluation and consolidation before its next major move. Such periods of extreme sentiment often precede notable shifts, both positive and negative. Navigating the Bitcoin Options Market: Actionable Insights For investors and traders, understanding these signals from the Bitcoin options market is crucial. While the current fear might seem concerning, it’s important to approach it with a balanced perspective. Consider these actionable insights: Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: If you’re concerned about short-term volatility, reassess your portfolio’s exposure to BTC. Adjusting position sizes or setting stop-loss orders can help manage risk effectively. Look Beyond the Immediate: Short-term fear can sometimes create valuable buying opportunities for long-term holders. Periods of high put demand might indicate a capitulation point, potentially signaling a floor for prices. Diversify Your Strategy: Do not rely solely on one indicator. Combine options market data with fundamental analysis, technical charts, and broader macroeconomic trends for a more comprehensive view. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on other market indicators, on-chain data, and relevant news that could influence Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Understanding the full picture helps in making informed decisions. The current skew highlights that many are hedging against downside, but it also presents a scenario where a potential bounce could surprise those overly focused on bearish outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of a well-rounded strategy. In conclusion, the surge in Bitcoin’s 30-day options delta skew to a four-month high undeniably signals elevated fear within the Bitcoin options market . While this indicates that many traders are bracing for potential downside, historical data reminds us that such fear signals do not always predict a crash. Sometimes, they precede significant recoveries, offering a nuanced perspective. Investors should remain vigilant, understand the intricacies of these signals, and make informed decisions based on a comprehensive view of the market, rather than succumbing to panic. The market’s current apprehension could be a precursor to its next decisive move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a high Bitcoin options delta skew mean? A high Bitcoin options delta skew, typically above 10%, indicates that traders are paying a premium for put options compared to call options. This suggests a collective sentiment of fear or anticipation of downside price movement for Bitcoin. Is a high skew always bearish for Bitcoin? Not necessarily. While it signals fear, historical data shows instances where a high skew preceded a brief dip followed by a significant rally, as seen in April 2024. It suggests caution but not always a definitive crash. How can I use the options skew in my trading strategy? You can use the options skew as an indicator of market sentiment. A high skew might suggest a potential short-term pullback, but also a possible contrarian buying opportunity if combined with other bullish indicators, especially for long-term investors. What is the Bitcoin options market? The Bitcoin options market is a financial market where traders buy and sell options contracts, which give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) Bitcoin at a specified price on or before a certain date. Where does the 30-day options delta skew data come from? The data for the 30-day options delta skew often comes from major cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges like Deribit, which is a primary platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum options trading.

On August 19, U.S. spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs experienced a staggering $422.29 million in net outflows. This marks the second-largest daily withdrawal since these investment products first launched, prompting many to ask about the underlying reasons for such a substantial movement. What Caused This Significant Shift in U.S. Spot ETH ETFs? While the immediate cause for such a large outflow from U.S. spot ETH ETFs isn’t explicitly stated in the initial report, several factors can influence investor behavior in the volatile crypto market. For instance, broader market sentiment plays a crucial role, often reacting to macroeconomic news or regulatory developments. Additionally, changes in Ethereum’s price performance itself or strategic portfolio rebalancing by large institutional investors could trigger such movements. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for grasping the full picture of why capital flows in and out of these digital asset vehicles. Such significant withdrawals highlight the dynamic nature of the crypto investment landscape, where sentiment can shift rapidly. Breaking Down the Outflows: Who Led the Charge Among U.S. Spot ETH ETFs? The data clearly shows which funds bore the brunt of these significant withdrawals, offering insights into where investor sentiment might be shifting. Fidelity’s FETH, for example, accounted for a substantial portion of the redemptions, indicating a notable divestment specifically tied to that fund. Fidelity’s FETH: Saw the largest redemption, totaling $156.32 million. This substantial figure highlights a major divestment from this particular fund among U.S. spot ETH ETFs . Grayscale’s ETHE: Followed with significant outflows of $122.05 million. Grayscale’s products often experience large movements due to their considerable market share and unique redemption mechanisms. Grayscale’s Mini: Recorded $88.53 million in withdrawals, further contributing to Grayscale’s overall net outflow from its Ethereum-linked products. Bitwise’s ETHW: Experienced $39.8 million in outflows, indicating broader participation in the withdrawals across various providers of U.S. spot ETH ETFs . Smaller Withdrawals: Franklin’s EZET ($6.29 million), BlackRock’s ETHA ($6.27 million), and VanEck’s ETHV ($3.03 million) also saw net redemptions, albeit on a smaller scale, reflecting a widespread trend. No Flows/Data Unavailable: Notably, 21Shares’ CETH reported no flows for the day, while data for Invesco’s QETH was not available, providing an incomplete picture for some funds. What Do These U.S. Spot ETH ETFs Outflows Mean for Investors? Such large outflows from U.S. spot ETH ETFs can signal a few things for both current and prospective investors. Firstly, it might suggest a period of profit-taking, especially if investors bought in during earlier, lower price points. Alternatively, it could reflect a cautious outlook on Ethereum’s immediate price trajectory or broader cryptocurrency market conditions. Investors often reallocate capital based on perceived risk and reward. Consider these implications: Market Volatility: The crypto market remains highly volatile. Large outflows can sometimes precede or follow price corrections, emphasizing the need for a robust risk management strategy. Institutional Sentiment: Significant movements in U.S. spot ETH ETFs often reflect the sentiment of institutional players. Their actions can have a magnified impact due to the size of their holdings, influencing broader market trends. Diversification: For those invested in ETH ETFs, this event serves as a reminder of the importance of diversification within a portfolio and staying informed about market trends. Long-Term Outlook: Despite daily fluctuations, many analysts maintain a positive long-term outlook for Ethereum and the broader digital asset space. Daily outflows, while notable, do not necessarily define the entire market trajectory. The recent $422.29 million outflow from U.S. spot ETH ETFs is a significant event, marking a notable day in the history of these relatively new investment vehicles. While it’s important to acknowledge such large movements, understanding the context—whether it’s market rebalancing, profit-taking, or a reaction to specific news—is key. The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, and data from products like U.S. spot ETH ETFs offers valuable insights into investor sentiment and capital flows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are U.S. spot ETH ETFs? A U.S. spot ETH ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment product that allows investors to gain exposure to the price of Ethereum (ETH) without directly owning the cryptocurrency. These funds hold actual ETH, and their shares trade on traditional stock exchanges. Q2: Why did U.S. spot ETH ETFs see such large outflows on August 19? While the exact reasons are not always immediately clear, large outflows can be influenced by various factors including broader market sentiment, significant price movements in Ethereum, profit-taking by investors, or a shift in institutional investment strategies. Q3: Which funds were most affected by these outflows? Fidelity’s FETH experienced the largest redemption, followed by Grayscale’s ETHE and Grayscale’s Mini. Bitwise’s ETHW also saw significant withdrawals, alongside smaller outflows from Franklin’s EZET, BlackRock’s ETHA, and VanEck’s ETHV. Q4: Does this mean Ethereum’s price will fall? Large outflows from ETFs can sometimes put downward pressure on the underlying asset’s price, but they are just one factor among many. The overall market sentiment, trading volume, and other fundamental and technical indicators also play a significant role in Ethereum’s price action. Q5: How can investors stay informed about U.S. spot ETH ETFs performance? Investors can stay informed by following financial news, checking daily flow reports from reliable data providers, and monitoring market analysis from reputable crypto and financial experts. Understanding the broader market context is always beneficial. Did you find this analysis helpful?

50367205,https://invezz.com/?p=2843976,1755657713,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Cardano hits $0.9241 on governance moves; which coin hits $3 first?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/20/cardano-hits-0-9241-on-governance-moves-which-coin-hits-3-first/,"Cardano (ADA)’s recent governance update has impressed the market, with its price touching $0.9241 and sparking renewed energy within its community. Governance progress often signals maturity, but experienced traders understand that governance changes alone rarely fuel exponential rallies. What investors are now watching more closely are new DeFi protocols that combine real-world functionality with token economics designed for growth. One name increasingly surfacing in crypto predictions is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized liquidity protocol gearing up for launch with multiple features that analysts expect to set it apart. Cardano (ADA) hits $0.9241 Cardano (ADA) surged 12.9% to ~$0.9241, driven by a historic governance vote approving a $71 million treasury fund for core development, including Hydra and Ouroboros Leios, on August 3, 2025, with 74.01% support from 4.657 billion delegated ADA. The rally, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.28 billion, reflects strong investor confidence following the Plomin hard fork’s decentralized governance milestone. Technical indicators show ADA breaking $0.89 resistance, with RSI at 71.45 and support at $0.8241. Whale accumulation of 390 million ADA and ETF speculation, with 75% approval odds, further fuel optimism. Analysts project a $1.20 target if $1.02 clears, but macro pressures like US tariffs pose risks. A drop below $0.8241 could test $0.70. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has entered the spotlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as more than a typical DeFi experiment. Built as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol, it introduces both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending. This dual model allows users to either access pooled liquidity directly or negotiate rates individually, creating flexibility for both retail and institutional users. By integrating on layer-2 infrastructure, the project will offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to older platforms relying purely on layer-1 systems. For anyone involved in crypto investing, this type of efficiency is not just an upgrade but a requirement for scalability. Another major highlight is the decentralized stablecoin planned for launch. This $1 stable asset will be minted only when borrowers post collateral such as ETH, and it will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will actively adjust interest rates to maintain its peg close to $1, while arbitrage ensures market stability. The stablecoin will bring predictable liquidity to the ecosystem and encourage users to adopt lending and borrowing without the volatility that makes traditional crypto investment strategies more challenging. Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale at a price of $0.035 per token. It has already raised over $14.65 million, with 22% of tokens sold across a community of more than 15,400 holders. The credibility of the project is strengthened by its CertiK audit, which earned a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. Phase 6 is already 22% sold out, and with the next phase raising the price by another 15%, urgency is building among investors who do not want to miss out on discounted entry. The road to $3 and beyond What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) especially attractive is not just the presale excitement but the mechanics that will sustain demand once trading goes live. A portion of protocol revenue generated from its lending services will be used to buy back MUTM directly from the market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers, creating a continuous reward system and incentivizing users to hold long term. Unlike many projects that rely solely on hype, this buy-and-distribute mechanism directly ties token rewards to platform usage, producing a demand loop that will strengthen as adoption grows. This structure will gain traction once the beta platform is launched, as real users will be able to test its features in a live environment. Combining the lending protocol with the upcoming stablecoin and staking rewards provides a multi-layer utility that expands beyond speculation. For long-term crypto investment strategies, these factors establish a foundation for sustainable growth rather than short-lived spikes. Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not standing still after presale. Its roadmap outlines four stages: launching with a focus on presale and compliance, building its smart contracts and interface, finalizing with beta testing and exchange preparations, and then delivering on exchange listings with further feature rollouts. With exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, and Kraken targeted for listings, global accessibility will further increase trading volume and visibility. Such momentum has already led analysts to suggest that MUTM could surge toward the $3 mark, outpacing older tokens that rely primarily on governance headlines to stay relevant. Conclusion Investors entering at the $0.035 presale level will already see significant paper gains once the token lists at $0.06. As user adoption of lending, staking, and stablecoin features grows, those gains will expand further. This aligns with broader investor behavior: when asking why crypto is down in certain weeks, the reality is that capital rotates toward projects offering real utility and strong fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides both, making it a standout for crypto investing strategies seeking higher growth potential. While Cardano (ADA) has captured attention with its governance updates, the real buzz is shifting toward protocols preparing to deliver functional ecosystems with sustainable economics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just following the trend but setting a new benchmark for DeFi by combining speed, liquidity, and recurring rewards. For investors looking for the next major leap, this presale offers one of the last chances to secure tokens at entry prices before global listings and beta adoption fuel demand.

This marks a concerning third consecutive day of withdrawals, signaling a notable period of investor re-evaluation in the market. Such sustained movements in these investment vehicles often capture the attention of market participants. They can offer insights into broader sentiment and the flow of capital within the digital asset space. What’s Driving the Recent U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflows? According to data shared by Trader T on X, this latest wave of withdrawals brings the total to three straight days of net negative flows for these popular investment vehicles. The sheer volume of $523.31 million indicates a strong selling pressure from investors. Let’s break down which funds saw the most significant redemptions: Fidelity’s FBTC bore the brunt, reporting the steepest redemptions at a hefty $246.89 million. Following closely was Grayscale’s GBTC , which saw $115.53 million in outflows. Other significant contributors to the decline included Bitwise’s BITB with $86.76 million and ARK Invest’s ARKB at $63.35 million. Even smaller funds like Grayscale’s Mini ($7.51 million) and Franklin’s EZBC ($3.27 million) recorded withdrawals. While data for Invesco’s BTCO was not yet available, other remaining funds showed no change, suggesting the outflows were concentrated among a few key players. Understanding the Impact: Why Do These Withdrawals Matter? These consistent outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just numbers; they reflect evolving market sentiment. When investors pull funds from these instruments, it often suggests a cautious outlook or a move to reallocate capital. While direct causation is complex, sustained outflows can contribute to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. This occurs as ETF providers may need to sell underlying BTC to meet redemption requests, creating a ripple effect across the broader crypto ecosystem. Moreover, such trends highlight shifts in investor behavior. Are institutional investors taking profits, or are retail investors reacting to broader economic uncertainties? Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. Navigating Volatility: What Should U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Investors Consider? For those invested in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , it’s important to distinguish between short-term market fluctuations and long-term investment strategies. Bitcoin has historically demonstrated resilience, but periods of significant outflows can test investor resolve. Considering diversification beyond a single asset class or investment vehicle remains a prudent strategy. Monitoring the overall economic landscape, regulatory developments, and broader crypto market trends can provide valuable context. Staying informed about daily flow data, alongside fundamental analysis of Bitcoin’s adoption and technological advancements, empowers investors to make more informed decisions. The crypto market is dynamic, and vigilance is key. The recent three-day streak of substantial outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , totaling over half a billion dollars, serves as a significant market signal. While specific reasons can be multifaceted, these withdrawals underscore the fluctuating nature of digital asset investments. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these flow dynamics becomes paramount for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. 2. Why are outflows from Bitcoin ETFs significant? Outflows indicate that more investors are selling their shares than buying new ones, leading to a net reduction in the amount of Bitcoin held by the ETF. This can reflect a shift in investor sentiment or a response to market conditions. 3. Which ETFs saw the largest outflows on August 19th? Fidelity’s FBTC saw the steepest redemptions at $246.89 million, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC ($115.53 million), Bitwise’s BITB ($86.76 million), and ARK Invest’s ARKB ($63.35 million). 4. Does this mean Bitcoin’s price will fall? While significant outflows can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin’s price, many factors influence the price. These outflows are one data point among many that investors consider. 5. How often do U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experience outflows? ETF flows are dynamic and can fluctuate daily, experiencing both inflows and outflows based on market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and investor behavior. Three consecutive days of outflows is a notable trend. Did this article help you understand the recent movements in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs ?

50366711,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787931,1755658250,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50366711.jpeg,Paul Atkins says the SEC will launch the President’s Digital Assets Group soon,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/atkins-announces-digital-assets-group-launch/,"SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the Commission will soon launch the President’s Digital Assets Group as part of a new chapter in US crypto rules. Atkins announced this during his speech at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium , where he shared his plan for “Project Crypto” and promised to stop using regulation by enforcement. SEC chair launches group to set crypto rules Atkins explained that the group’s first task would be to implement the recommendations from the President’s Digital Asset Markets Working Group. He made it clear that the project was a major part of the White House’s bigger plan for digital assets and praised President Trump for supporting the effort. The SEC chair further explained that the group will create rules and find the right balance between protecting investors and allowing new ideas to grow. He said the SEC must create rules that are strong enough to prevent abuse but flexible enough to adapt as technology develops. He added that the SEC will partner with Congress, the White House, and other agencies to ensure the US rules remain fair, consistent, and in line with international standards. This approach could unite the different parts of the government around digital assets. Atkins’ predecessor, Gary Gensler, often said that most crypto assets should be securities under existing SEC rules . Critics said this approach pushed innovation overseas because it forced many projects to either register with the SEC or face enforcement actions. Atkins rejected this view and said, “There are very few tokens that are securities.” He explained that the important factor is not the token itself but how it is packaged, marketed, and sold to the public. The change of direction suggests that the SEC will make it easier for crypto projects to launch in the US without being treated as securities. President’s plan drives SEC’s new crypto push The President’s Digital Assets Working Group released a policy roadmap in July, requesting regulators adopt rules that make life easier for crypto businesses while keeping investor protections in place. Paul Atkins said the SEC will stick to the roadmap to move in the same direction as the White House and reduce conflicting voices. According to Atkins, the SEC will provide tailored exemptions, safe harbors, and new types of disclosure rules for crypto companies to replace the one-size-fits-all regulations of the past. Activities like initial coin offerings (ICOs), airdrops, network rewards, and even the development of decentralized apps could be treated more flexibly to allow entrepreneurs to innovate without fear. Atkins said that it didn’t mean a free-for-all, but rather a better structure that will protect investors and encourage responsible growth at the same time. Venture capital firms and advocacy groups like Andreessen Horowitz and the DeFi Education Fund have already started pushing the SEC to create exemptions to protect developers from enforcement risks. These groups say that safe harbors will make developers more confident in innovating in the United States instead of overseas. Atkins responded and said the SEC is open to industry feedback, but was clear that it can only change its approach for now because lasting certainty depends on legislation. He further emphasized that enforcement should focus on fraud, scams, or abuse cases, and let legitimate projects get room to grow. If those promises are kept, the SEC’s partnership with the administration’s working group could be the most significant change in US financial regulation in many years.

It is important to understand that this is a temporary measure, not a delisting, and it is a common practice in the crypto world. While deposits and withdrawals will pause, trading of BERA tokens on Bithumb might continue as usual. However, users should always verify the latest information directly from Bithumb’s official channels. Planning any BERA transfers well in advance of the September 3 deadline is a smart move to avoid any inconvenience. Why is Bithumb Implementing This BERA Suspension ?

Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For 10x Surge? Analyst Points To Gold’s Playbook At the time of writing, LINK trades around $24.2, marking its highest level in seven months. The move came with strong trading volume, confirming a bullish breakout above the 200-day moving average. Whale accumulation has played a pivotal role in fueling the rally. On-chain data reveals that large holders scooped up 1.1 million LINK, valued at approximately $27 million, mover the past seven days. The top 100 wallets also increased their holdings by more than 12%, signaling renewed confidence from institutional and high-net-worth investors. LINK Wallet Growth Hits 2025 Highs Beyond whale activity, organic network growth has also surged. Analytics firm Santiment reported that nearly 9,600 new LINK wallets were created in mid-August, while daily transfers from active addresses exceeded 9,800, both setting records for 2025. Wallet creation and transaction spikes are widely viewed as indicators of healthy adoption. For Chainlink, these metrics suggest that both retail and institutional demand are rising in tandem, potentially supporting more sustainable price growth. The renewed activity also coincides with the launch of the Chainlink Reserve, a smart contract treasury absorbing tokens from enterprise integrations, which adds deflationary pressure on circulating supply.

50366726,560090,1755658839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50366726.jpeg,Bitmine Becomes 2nd Largest Crypto Treasury Company: Now Holding $6.6B In Ethereum,https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-becomes-2nd-largest-crypto-treasury-company/,"BitMine, a publicly traded company renowned for its bold treasury strategy, has officially become the second-largest crypto treasury company in the world. The firm now holds more than $6.6 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH), totaling 1.52 million tokens — a staggering 1.26% of the total ETH supply. This milestone underscores BitMine’s aggressive accumulation strategy, which has set it apart from other institutions and corporate treasuries in the crypto space. What makes this move even more significant is BitMine’s long-term vision: the company has set a target of holding 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, meaning they are already 25% of the way toward their ambitious goal. The announcement sends a strong signal to markets and institutional investors. Ethereum’s growing role as both a financial and technological backbone of Web3 is attracting corporations to treat ETH not just as an asset, but as a strategic reserve. BitMine’s approach mirrors the conviction once seen in Bitcoin-focused treasury strategies , but it places Ethereum front and center in the evolving digital asset economy. BitMine Becomes The Leading Ethereum Treasury BitMine has cemented its position as the largest Ethereum treasury in the world, now holding over $6.6 billion worth of ETH, up from $4.9 billion just last week. This rapid increase highlights the company’s aggressive accumulation strategy and its conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value. The treasury currently accounts for 1.52 million ETH, making BitMine the undisputed leader in Ethereum corporate holdings. Globally, BitMine now ranks as the second crypto treasury company overall, second only to Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which dominates Bitcoin holdings. This milestone underscores the shifting landscape of institutional crypto adoption, where Ethereum is increasingly being recognized as more than just the leading smart contract platform — it is becoming a core reserve asset. Notably, BitMine now holds more ETH than Sharplink Gaming, The Ether Machine, and The Ethereum Foundation combined. This marks a turning point in the treasury race, where corporations are no longer competing on Bitcoin alone but are diversifying into Ethereum at unprecedented levels. This growing trend is likely to continue as ETH gains momentum, supported by strong institutional demand, ETF inflows, and broader adoption across decentralized finance and real-world asset tokenization. Analysts believe that if BitMine maintains its current pace, its treasury strategy could reshape how companies manage long-term reserves in the digital economy. ETH Facing Critical Test Ethereum is currently trading near $4,310 after a sharp retrace from its recent peak above $4,790. The chart highlights that ETH has entered a consolidation phase after weeks of strong bullish momentum, with price now testing key support levels. The 50-day moving average is trending upward and currently sits near $3,560, well below current price levels, signaling that the broader bullish structure remains intact. Meanwhile, the 100-day and 200-day moving averages at $3,048 and $2,575, respectively, also confirm strong long-term support. This alignment suggests that despite the pullback, Ethereum’s broader trend is still positioned for growth. If ETH manages to hold this level, a rebound back toward resistance at $4,600–$4,800 is likely in the short term. However, a breakdown below support could open the door for a deeper retrace toward $3,800. The coming sessions will be key to determining direction.

50366743,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79312,1755658844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Spots XRP Historical Data That Shows Looming 777% Price Pump,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-spots-xrp-historical-data-that-shows-looming-777-price-pump/,"A recent market study suggests that XRP may be preparing for a significant upward move, potentially reaching $28 by September 2025. The projection, made by analyst EGRAG, is based on recurring price structures observed on XRP’s long-term charts. The forecast comes amid XRP’s attempt to hold above $3 after a period of volatility. Following a high of $3.35 on August 14, the asset declined under persistent selling pressure and slipped below the $3 threshold on August 18. Despite this setback, EGRAG’s research indicates that XRP is currently repeating a historical cycle that has previously preceded major rallies. Historical Chart Patterns According to EGRAG’s analysis, XRP has historically displayed a recurring sequence whenever it reenters a multi-year ascending channel. In this setup, the asset typically experiences two major rallies. The first produces an initial top, followed by a consolidation phase, and then a second, often higher, peak. #XRP – The Chart Doesn’t Lie! The chart is speaking volumes, and a 777% surge is all we need to ignite this journey! What we’re witnessing now is just the beginning of something much bigger. A Call to Action : Hey, @bgarlinghouse , what’s holding you back from sharing… pic.twitter.com/gEm5HG9uJz — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 10, 2025 This cycle was first recorded in 2017 . XRP rose from a trading range of $0.0490–$0.0690 within the ascending channel and advanced to a high of $0.3988 in May 2017. After six months of consolidation, it surged again to a new peak of $3.30 in early 2018. The period between the two tops lasted 245 days, or eight monthly candles. The same pattern reappeared in 2020. After returning to the ascending channel in November 2020, XRP climbed to $0.79 before consolidating. It then rallied to $1.96 in April 2021. In this case, the interval between the first and second highs was 151 days, equal to five monthly candles. Current Cycle and Outlook EGRAG argues that the same structure is now unfolding. XRP revisited the ascending channel during April to November 2024, when prices declined to around $0.50. A strong recovery followed the U.S. elections , pushing the asset to $3.40 in January 2025, which represented the first top of the cycle. Since then, XRP has corrected to the $2 range and spent six months consolidating before recently regaining levels above $3. If the current path continues to mirror the 2017 sequence, the second top is expected to occur in September 2025, 243 days, or eight monthly candles, from the first peak at $3.40. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Based on this projection, EGRAG estimates that XRP could increase by as much as 777% from its consolidation levels, setting a potential target of $28.16. This outlook aligns with a separate forecast from analyst CrediBULL, who argued that XRP is advancing in a formation similar to Bitcoin’s Elliott Wave cycles, which could also support a move toward $28. Community Developments EGRAG’s analysis comes shortly after Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission jointly agreed to end their prolonged legal dispute by withdrawing their appeals. However, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has not publicly addressed the settlement, raising speculation among community members about the implications of his silence. While no outcome is guaranteed, the chart-based analysis highlights that XRP may be repeating a well-documented cycle that has historically led to substantial gains. If this trend holds, September 2025 could mark the next significant price peak for the asset, with projections ranging toward $28.

BlockDAG’s 30,000x Path Could Be the Best Buy in 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-and-ethereum-blockdags-30000x-path-could-be-the-best-buy-in-2025/,"Not every opportunity is judged by today’s value. The biggest rewards often come from where a project could be in just a few years. Crypto history proves that those who acted early on Bitcoin or Ethereum didn’t just make profits. They multiplied their wealth thousands of times over. For those seeking the next big chance in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) is shaping up as one of the strongest options. The presale has already brought in more than $377 million and continues to expand at a rapid pace. The excitement is clear. With these numbers, BlockDAG may be walking the same road that early-stage Bitcoin and Ethereum once took. The stage is set for what could be one of the boldest stories in the market. Numbers That Speak for Themselves BlockDAG’s presale success is hard to ignore. Starting at just $0.001 in Batch 1, the price has climbed steadily to $0.0276 in Batch 29. That marks an early return of 2,660% for those who joined at the very start. More than 25.2 billion coins have already been sold. The presale has collected over $377 million, making it one of the largest events of its kind in recent years. On top of this, miner sales have crossed $7.8 million, with more than 19,300 miners purchased by the community. For anyone searching for the smartest choice in 2025, these figures are not just encouraging. They show that BlockDAG’s demand is real, fueled by both capital and participation. The ROI Projection That Could Redefine the Game BlockDAG is not just about today’s presale. It is about where this growth can lead. Analysts and community voices suggest that by 2030, the potential ROI could stretch as high as 30,000x from the current presale levels. This kind of projection is backed by past examples. Ethereum’s earliest supporters watched their holdings grow massively within five years. Solana’s rise also turned early backers into overnight success stories. BlockDAG stands out because entry at presale is still open. The price is yet to move into exchange listings. The full use of its network has not been unlocked. This timing creates a rare opening, making BlockDAG one of the best-aligned projects for those planning their moves in 2025. Why Getting in Early Matters Most In crypto, timing can mean the difference between a good return and a life-changing outcome. The gap between presale and launch is often where the biggest rewards are made. Right now, BlockDAG’s price sits at $0.0276. Those entering today are ahead of all the major exchange listings and before retail hype takes over. When liquidity from large markets arrives, those who secured positions early will benefit from both immediate growth and longer-term appreciation. The last bull runs proved this clearly. Those who stepped in early on breakout projects walked away with far more than latecomers. For anyone weighing options on the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG is timed perfectly to deliver both strong entry and future growth potential. Last Thought Chances like this don’t appear often, and when they do, they rarely stay open for long. BlockDAG’s presale has already handed its earliest supporters gains of 2,660%. Yet its path forward suggests the real journey is only beginning. The project has raised more than $377 million, sold over 25.2 billion coins, and achieved miner sales of $7.8 million from selling 19,300 devices. Its projections point to a possible 30,000x ROI by 2030, giving it one of the boldest outlooks in the market. For anyone looking closely at the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG has the right mix of strong funding, steady demand, and a clear roadmap. The window is open now, but it will not stay open forever.

Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction has turned bullish as a clear bull flag points to a possible breakout at $0.35, supported by rising institutional activity. Chainlink (LINK) price growth is also gaining speed, with its $60 billion DeFi footprint fueling a third Elliott Wave rally that could push it toward $30. But Cold Wallet (CWT) is building momentum of its own. With a Stage 17 price of $0.00998, $6.2 million already raised, and over 736 million tokens sold, Cold Wallet (CWT) is racing ahead. Its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition delivered a built-in community of 2 million+ active users. Early Stage 1 entries at $0.007 now point toward a confirmed listing at $0.3517, projecting an ROI of over 3,400%. Dogecoin Bull Flag Signals Breakout Toward $0.35 Dogecoin has formed a clear bull flag and double-bottom pattern, pointing to further strength. Analysts say the setup could push prices toward $0.35 as resistance zones open up. The meme coin also broke a long downtrend and flipped it into support, adding weight to the bullish case. Institutional interest is climbing, adding deeper support for price action. Support levels at $0.23–$0.24 remain strong, offering a launchpad for more gains. For traders watching chart setups, Dogecoin’s mix of bullish structures and growing confidence makes it one of the breakouts to watch. Chainlink Builds Toward $30 With $60B DeFi Growth Chainlink (LINK) is moving higher as its total value secured (TVS) in DeFi hits $60 billion. This dominance in data feeds has sparked the third phase of an Elliott Wave, often the most powerful part of a rally, setting targets around $30. A breakout from a double-bottom reversal and open futures interest above $1.4 billion further strengthens the outlook. While a drop under $17.90 could challenge the setup, momentum still favours more upside. LINK’s integrations and technical strength make it a strong candidate for those seeking the next breakout play. Cold Wallet’s Presale Hits $6.2 Million in Weeks Cold Wallet is defying normal presale trends. Instead of slowing down after crossing $5 million, it has only accelerated. Stage 17 is priced at $0.00998, with $6.2 million raised and more than 736 million tokens sold already. This surge suggests that large-scale buyers are watching closely. Unlike early-stage projects that rely on hope, Cold Wallet is backed by a $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition, instantly adding over 2 million real users. This gives Cold Wallet a rare edge: adoption before launch. The presale is moving quickly, and if momentum continues, several stages could sell out in clusters. Stage 1 participants who entered at $0.007 are already looking at a potential ROI of 3,400% at the confirmed $0.3517 listing price. Cold Wallet’s model also makes it different. Cashback on swaps, bridge rebates, and gas-fee refunds are already part of its system, ensuring users benefit from the start. This structure encourages daily use and turns the wallet into more than storage; it becomes a revenue tool for users. As more capital flows in, the sub-cent entry point will vanish, leaving higher costs for late buyers. With strong inflows, live features, and adoption already secured, Cold Wallet is shaping up to be one of the most important infrastructure plays of 2025. Final Thoughts Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction and Chainlink (LINK) price growth both highlight strong near-term opportunities, but Cold Wallet stands apart. With rapid fundraising, live cashback systems, and millions of built-in users, it doesn’t wait for adoption, it begins with it. At $0.00998, with a confirmed $0.3517 listing ahead, the ROI potential still sits above 3,400%. In a year where speed will define success, Cold Wallet is one of the few projects positioned to deliver both utility and scale immediately. Missing its current entry may mean missing one of 2025’s strongest returns.

This is precisely what the Radiant Capital hacker has achieved, turning an initial heist into a significantly larger fortune through clever cryptocurrency trading. How the Radiant Capital Hacker Amplified Their Gains It’s an alarming development reported by on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X: the individual responsible for the Radiant Capital (RDNT) exploit has managed to nearly double their ill-gotten gains. This isn’t just about holding onto stolen assets; it involves active, strategic trading. Here’s a breakdown of their audacious moves: Initial Sale: About a week ago, the Radiant Capital hacker sold a substantial 9,631 Ethereum (ETH) at an average price of $4,562. This transaction converted their ETH holdings into a massive 43.93 million DAI, a stablecoin. Strategic Repurchase: As ETH prices experienced a pullback, the hacker seized the opportunity. They repurchased 2,109.5 ETH at a lower average price of $4,096, spending 8.64 million DAI. This move allowed them to acquire more ETH for less capital. This calculated maneuver demonstrates a keen understanding of market dynamics, enabling the Radiant Capital hacker to capitalize on price fluctuations. Understanding the Hacker’s Ethereum Trading Strategy The hacker’s strategy was straightforward yet effective: sell high, buy low. This classic trading principle, when applied to a large sum of stolen funds, allowed for significant profit amplification. By converting ETH to DAI when ETH was at a higher valuation and then buying back when the price dipped, they effectively increased their ETH holdings and overall portfolio value. Currently, the Radiant Capital hacker holds a staggering 14,436 ETH and 35.29 million DAI. The combined value of these assets stands at an astounding $94.63 million. This represents a substantial $41.63 million increase from the original $53 million stolen during the exploit last year. Such a profit margin is a stark reminder of the challenges in recovering funds once they fall into the wrong hands, especially when those hands are adept at market manipulation. The Unsettling Reality of the Radiant Capital Hacker’s Success The success of the Radiant Capital hacker in growing their illicit fortune sends a troubling message across the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. It highlights not only the vulnerabilities within protocols but also the difficulty in tracing and freezing funds once they are actively traded across different assets. While on-chain analysis can track these movements, actual recovery remains a formidable challenge. This incident underscores the critical need for enhanced security measures within DeFi projects and more robust collaboration among exchanges and law enforcement agencies to prevent such financial gains from criminal activities. The ability of the Radiant Capital hacker to operate with such impunity, even turning a profit, emphasizes the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between cybercriminals and the crypto community. In conclusion, the journey of the funds stolen from Radiant Capital, from an initial hack to a nearly doubled fortune through strategic ETH trading, is a sobering tale. It serves as a potent reminder of the sophistication of some cybercriminals and the persistent challenges faced by the blockchain ecosystem in safeguarding assets and ensuring justice. As the crypto space evolves, so too must its defenses against such illicit activities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What happened in the Radiant Capital hack? The Radiant Capital protocol experienced an exploit last year, resulting in approximately $53 million worth of cryptocurrency being stolen by a hacker. The details of the exploit typically involve vulnerabilities in the protocol’s smart contracts. How did the Radiant Capital hacker increase their stolen funds? The hacker strategically traded Ethereum (ETH). They initially sold a large amount of ETH for DAI (a stablecoin) when ETH prices were high. Later, when ETH prices pulled back, they used some of the DAI to repurchase more ETH at a lower price, effectively increasing their total crypto holdings and overall portfolio value. What is the current value of the funds held by the Radiant Capital hacker? According to on-chain analysis, the hacker now holds assets valued at approximately $94.63 million, which includes 14,436 ETH and 35.29 million DAI. This marks a $41.63 million increase from the original stolen amount. Does this incident pose a risk to other DeFi projects? While this specific incident targets Radiant Capital, the hacker’s ability to profit from stolen funds highlights broader security challenges in the DeFi space. It emphasizes the need for continuous security audits, robust smart contract design, and proactive monitoring to prevent similar exploits and subsequent illicit gains.

Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act was officially ratified last month at a White House signing ceremony, where U.S. President Donald Trump praised the landmark stablecoin bill . “Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,” the president said. “You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago—but this signing is a massive validation.” Key players in the Democratic Party, however, have pushed back against certain pieces of crypto legislation. In July, Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) launched “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week,” where she called both the CLARITY and GENIUS Act “especially dangerous.” “The CLARITY and GENIUS bills wrap themselves in the flag of innovation, but all they really do is replicate the same mess that led to past financial crises: They call for few regulations, minimal enforcement, weak consumer protections, and more industry consolidation,” Waters said.

One significant event that frequently impacts traders is crypto perpetual futures liquidation . Over the past 24 hours, we observed a substantial wave of these liquidations across major digital assets, highlighting the inherent volatility and risks in leveraged trading. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? For those new to the derivatives market, perpetual futures are a type of futures contract without an expiry date. They allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset, often using leverage. Leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses, making it a double-edged sword. Crypto perpetual futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s position is automatically closed by the exchange. This happens because their margin collateral falls below a certain maintenance level, usually due to adverse price movements. Essentially, it’s a forced closure designed to prevent further losses and ensure the solvency of the exchange and the broader market. How Did Major Cryptos Fare in the Last 24 Hours of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? The recent 24-hour period saw significant liquidations, particularly for long positions. This indicates a sharp downward price movement caught many traders off guard. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the crypto perpetual futures liquidation figures: ETH: $200.61 million liquidated, with a staggering 79.80% being long positions. This suggests a strong bearish move against bullish bets on Ethereum. BTC: $116.68 million liquidated, and an even higher 95.77% were long positions. Bitcoin traders holding leveraged long positions faced immense pressure. SOL: $21.26 million liquidated, with 81.90% stemming from long positions. Solana also saw its share of optimistic traders caught on the wrong side of the market. These figures underscore the rapid and often unforgiving nature of the crypto market, especially when leverage is involved. A “long” position means a trader bets on the price going up, while a “short” position bets on the price going down. The high percentage of long liquidations clearly indicates a sudden price drop that caught bullish traders off guard. Why Do Such Massive Liquidations Occur in Crypto Futures? Several factors contribute to large-scale crypto perpetual futures liquidation events. Market volatility is a primary driver. Cryptocurrencies are known for their rapid price swings, which can quickly erode margin collateral for leveraged positions. Unexpected news, macroeconomic shifts, or even large whale movements can trigger cascading liquidations. Moreover, the use of high leverage amplifies the risk. While leverage can boost profits, it also means a smaller price movement against a position can lead to swift liquidation. Traders often underestimate the speed at which the market can turn, leading to these forced closures. What Actionable Insights Can Traders Gain from Recent Liquidations? Understanding these liquidation events is vital for responsible trading. These occurrences serve as powerful reminders of the risks inherent in highly leveraged trading. They emphasize the need for robust risk management strategies to navigate the unpredictable crypto landscape. Here are some key takeaways: Risk Management is Paramount: Never over-leverage. Use stop-loss orders diligently to limit potential losses and protect your capital. Understand Market Sentiment: While data like this shows past events, it highlights the importance of analyzing market trends and sentiment before entering leveraged positions. Start Small: If you’re new to perpetual futures, begin with small positions and low leverage to gain experience without risking significant capital. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data to make more informed trading decisions. In conclusion, the recent 24-hour breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation serves as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of leveraged crypto trading. While perpetual futures offer opportunities for amplified gains, they come with significant risks, as evidenced by the millions liquidated from long positions in ETH, BTC, and SOL. Prudent risk management, understanding market dynamics, and avoiding excessive leverage are essential for anyone engaging in this complex segment of the crypto market. Always prioritize capital preservation over aggressive speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date. How does liquidation work in perpetual futures? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses and ensure the trader can meet their obligations. Why were so many long positions liquidated recently? A high percentage of long liquidations typically indicates a significant and rapid downward price movement in the underlying asset. Traders who bet on prices increasing were caught off guard by the sudden drop. How can traders avoid crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Traders can reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and carefully managing their overall risk exposure. What is the role of leverage in liquidations? Leverage amplifies both profits and losses. While it can increase potential gains, it also means smaller adverse price movements can lead to liquidation much faster compared to unleveraged trading. Did you find this breakdown insightful?

The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange has announced a significant Binance delisting affecting three specific spot trading pairs. This strategic move, set for August 22, 2024, at 03:00 UTC, directly impacts MOVE/FDUSD, NIL/FDUSD, and SXT/BNB. Understanding such announcements is paramount for every trader navigating the dynamic and often unpredictable crypto landscape. Binance, renowned for its extensive range of digital assets and robust trading platform, regularly reviews its listings. This proactive approach ensures a healthy, secure, and compliant trading environment for its global user base. The official announcement, readily available on their website, clearly detailed the affected pairs and the precise time of their removal. Consequently, after the specified date and time, users will no longer be able to execute spot trades for these pairs. Why Does Binance Delisting Occur? You might wonder why a leading exchange like Binance opts for a Binance delisting . It’s a standard practice within the industry, driven by a comprehensive evaluation process. Binance conducts periodic and thorough reviews of all listed digital assets, adhering to strict internal criteria. Several key factors influence these decisions: Trading Volume and Liquidity: Pairs with consistently low trading volume or insufficient liquidity may be delisted. This ensures market efficiency and prevents potential manipulation. Project Commitment and Development: Binance assesses the project team’s commitment to their asset, including development activity, roadmap progress, and community engagement. A lack of ongoing effort can trigger a review. Network Stability and Security: The stability and security of the underlying blockchain network are critical. Any vulnerabilities or persistent technical issues can lead to a Binance delisting . Regulatory Compliance: The evolving global regulatory landscape plays a significant role. Assets that no longer meet regulatory standards in various jurisdictions may be removed to maintain compliance. User Feedback: While not the sole factor, user feedback and reports of issues can also contribute to the review process. What is the Impact of This Binance Delisting on Traders? For traders holding positions in MOVE/FDUSD, NIL/FDUSD, or SXT/BNB, this Binance delisting necessitates immediate action. Ignoring such an announcement can lead to potential financial losses or complications in managing your assets. Here’s what you need to consider: Potential Price Volatility: Often, assets facing delisting can experience increased price volatility leading up to the effective date. Some traders might rush to sell, while others might look for arbitrage opportunities. Limited Trading Options: Once delisted from spot trading, your options to trade these specific pairs on Binance become severely restricted. Asset Management: Binance typically advises users to convert their affected assets into other available cryptocurrencies or withdraw them to external wallets before the delisting deadline. It’s crucial to act promptly to avoid any inconvenience. Navigating Crypto Delistings: Actionable Insights Proactive management is your best defense against unexpected market shifts, including a Binance delisting . Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate such situations effectively: Stay Informed: Regularly check official announcements from exchanges where you trade. Binance’s official website and social media channels are primary sources for such critical updates. Review Your Portfolio: Periodically audit your cryptocurrency holdings. Identify any assets that might be at risk due to low liquidity or project inactivity. Understand Your Options: If an asset you hold is slated for delisting, understand the available options. This might include converting it to a stablecoin or another major cryptocurrency, or transferring it to a different exchange that still supports the asset. Set Reminders: For critical dates like the August 22 Binance delisting , set multiple reminders to ensure you take action well before the deadline. Diversify Your Holdings: A diversified portfolio can mitigate risks associated with individual asset performance or delistings. The upcoming Binance delisting of MOVE/FDUSD, NIL/FDUSD, and SXT/BNB serves as a potent reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic and ever-evolving nature. While delistings can seem disruptive, they are often a necessary part of maintaining a healthy and efficient trading ecosystem. Staying informed, being proactive, and having a clear strategy for managing your digital assets are paramount to navigating these changes successfully. Embrace the opportunity to refine your trading habits and remain resilient in the face of market adjustments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What happens if I hold assets in a delisted pair after August 22? Binance typically converts delisted assets into stablecoins or allows withdrawals for a certain period. However, it is strongly advised to manage your assets before the delisting date to avoid potential complications or losses due to market volatility. 2. Can I still withdraw my assets after the delisting deadline? Yes, usually Binance allows users to withdraw delisted assets for a specific period after the spot trading ceases. However, the exact duration varies, and it’s always best to withdraw or convert your funds promptly. 3. Why did Binance choose these specific pairs for delisting? Binance delists pairs based on a rigorous review process considering factors like trading volume, liquidity, project commitment, network stability, and regulatory compliance.

Now, there’s a significant update bringing a sigh of relief to many: Celsius is beginning its third distribution of funds. This latest Celsius payout , totaling an impressive $220.6 million, represents a crucial step towards recovery for thousands of affected creditors. What Does This Celsius Payout Mean for Creditors?

For those who had their assets locked up with Celsius, this news is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a tangible sign of progress and a step closer to regaining lost funds.

This new Celsius payout provides a partial recovery, offering a measure of relief and a pathway to closure. Navigating the Road to Recovery: The Celsius Payout Process Understanding how these distributions work can be complex.

Binance Alpha and Futures are set to add SAPIEN, a significant development that has captured widespread attention. This Binance SAPIEN listing was initially announced via the New Listings Feed on X, marking a major milestone for the SAPIEN project. For many, securing a listing on a top-tier exchange like Binance represents substantial validation and opens up critical new trading avenues. What Does the Binance SAPIEN Listing Uncover for Traders? Binance Alpha functions as an early-stage discovery program. It meticulously identifies promising tokens based on specific, stringent criteria. These criteria primarily include robust community engagement and alignment with emerging market trends. The core objective is to highlight potential crypto gems before they gain mainstream recognition. However, it is important to note that selection for Alpha does not automatically guarantee a subsequent listing on Binance Spot or Futures markets. This distinction makes the direct futures listing for SAPIEN particularly noteworthy and impactful. The fact that SAPIEN secured a futures listing directly is a powerful indicator of its perceived potential. It strongly suggests that Binance sees considerable promise in the token and its underlying project. Futures trading enables users to speculate on the future price of an asset without needing to own the underlying asset itself. This mechanism can offer enhanced liquidity and diverse opportunities for both long and short positions. Ultimately, the Binance SAPIEN listing on futures has the potential to dramatically increase its overall market exposure and appeal. Why Did SAPIEN Achieve This Remarkable Binance Listing? Binance’s selection process for Alpha tokens is notoriously rigorous. It places significant emphasis on projects that demonstrate active communities and those that resonate with current market narratives. SAPIEN’s ability to meet these demanding standards speaks volumes about its inherent strength and growing appeal. A vibrant and engaged community often translates directly into sustained interest and ongoing development, both of which are absolutely crucial for a project’s long-term viability and success. Moreover, emerging market trends play a truly vital role in Binance’s listing decisions. Binance continuously monitors the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape to identify truly innovative and impactful projects.

A comprehensive understanding of these inherent risks is paramount for any trader considering participation. Traders must always conduct thorough and independent research before engaging in any form of futures trading. The volatility inherent in the crypto market can be extreme and unpredictable. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial to employ robust and well-thought-out risk management strategies.

50368289,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=409153,1755661271,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/50368289.jpeg,Tron Short-Term Gains Exceed 30%: Rising Profits Could Spark a Market Rally,https://cryptopotato.com/tron-short-term-gains-exceed-30-rising-profits-could-spark-a-market-rally/,"Tron (TRX) short-term holders (STHs) are witnessing good returns, with some groups now sitting on profits exceeding 30% in just three months. Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Burak Kesmeci shows that one-week holders of the token are currently up 3.8%, while one-month holders have gained 10.3%. However, three-month TRX holders are enjoying the biggest profit margin, with their investment up by 31.2%. Earlier Profit-Taking Wave Paved the Way According to Kesmeci, this increase in profitability has lifted sentiment among traders and fueled talk of a potential rally if momentum continues. He posited that Tron’s profitability will boost confidence among existing holders, which would in turn help bring in new capital to the ecosystem. “When short-term investors are in profit, sentiment improves,” the analyst stated. “These traders tend to share their success stories, which often attracts new participants into the market.” In his opinion, as long as STHs stay in the green, it builds a strong foundation for a likely TRX rally in the foreseeable future. The upbeat mood comes after a heavy round of profit-taking by long-term TRX investors earlier this month. On August 6, CryptoPotato reported that wallets holding Tron’s native token for three to five years drove a $1.4 billion realized profit spree, the second-largest single-day profit event for TRX this year. While that wave of selling reflected veteran holders cashing out into strength, it did little to dampen Tron’s wider momentum. The network continues to stand out in the stablecoin sector, hosting more than $82 billion worth of Tether (USDT), per DefiLlama, and processing roughly 60% of all global USDT transfers. This activity has cemented Tron’s position as a preferred network for institutions and emerging markets. The blockchain also enjoyed a burst of online attention last week, ranking among the most-discussed cryptocurrencies on social media. Adding to the story, corporate adoption has begun to surface. Leisure goods firm SRM Entertainment not only integrated TRX into its treasury holdings but also rebranded itself as “Tron Inc.,” highlighting the token’s growing presence outside pure crypto circles. TRX Price Performance TRX is currently trading at $0.3494, slightly edging up by 0.8% over the past seven days. This contrasts sharply with the broader crypto market, which has slipped 4.2% in the last week, and with rival smart contract platform tokens, which, according to CoinGecko, are down about 2% in the same period. The cryptocurrency’s price has fluctuated between $0.345 and $0.3525 in the last 24 hours, showing a measure of resilience in a broadly weaker market. Additionally, over the past 30 days, it has gained 9.3%, while its year-on-year performance has seen it go up by just under 158%. Even so, TRX remains 19.1% below its December 2024 peak of $0.4313, leaving headroom for further gains if fresh buying pressure emerges.

The company sold over 11.1 million shares of rival miner Bitfarms for a substantial $15.1 million. This strategic move, initially reported by TheMinerMag, immediately caught the attention of market observers and industry participants alike. It represents a notable shift in the relationship between these two prominent entities. This share divestment reduces Riot Platforms ‘ ownership stake in Bitfarms to below the crucial 5% disclosure threshold. This development follows a period of intense corporate maneuvering. Previously, Riot Platforms had attempted a full takeover of Bitfarms, a move that ignited a public management dispute. However, both firms eventually reached a settlement in September 2024, aiming to resolve their differences amicably. This latest sale appears to be a direct consequence of that agreement, signaling a new chapter for both companies in the dynamic and competitive crypto mining landscape. What’s Behind Riot Platforms ‘ Strategic Share Sale? The decision by Riot Platforms to offload such a significant block of Bitfarms shares is certainly strategic. While the exact motivations are proprietary, several factors likely influenced this move. Firstly, the sale could represent a reallocation of capital. By liquidating this investment, Riot Platforms gains a considerable sum of $15.1 million, which it can then deploy into its own core operations, expansion projects, or other strategic investments. Moreover, the sale allows Riot Platforms to streamline its focus. After a contentious takeover attempt and subsequent settlement, maintaining a substantial minority stake in a rival could lead to ongoing complexities. Divesting these shares offers a cleaner break, enabling Riot Platforms to concentrate solely on its independent growth trajectory without potential conflicts of interest or distractions arising from a significant holding in a competitor. This aligns with a broader trend of companies optimizing their portfolios for maximum efficiency. How Does This Impact Bitfarms and the Broader Bitcoin Mining Sector? For Bitfarms, the implications of Riot Platforms reducing its stake are largely positive. With a major, formerly adversarial shareholder significantly reducing its influence, Bitfarms can now operate with greater autonomy. This potentially reduces external pressure and allows its management to pursue its strategic vision without the constant shadow of a potential takeover or activist investor. The broader Bitcoin mining sector also watches these developments closely. This move by Riot Platforms could set a precedent or at least offer insights into how large mining companies manage their portfolios and competitive dynamics. The industry is constantly evolving, marked by fluctuating Bitcoin prices, increasing network difficulty, and the race for operational efficiency. Strategic divestments like this highlight the ongoing adaptation within the sector as companies seek to optimize their positions and capital allocation. This event underscores the maturing nature of the cryptocurrency mining industry. Companies are making calculated moves, not just based on mining profitability, but also on corporate strategy and portfolio management. It reflects a sophisticated approach to navigating a highly competitive and capital-intensive environment. Investors and market watchers will continue to monitor how both Riot Platforms and Bitfarms evolve following this significant transaction. In conclusion, Riot Platforms ‘ sale of Bitfarms shares is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic realignment. It signifies a clear pivot for Riot away from a direct investment in its competitor, likely freeing up capital and focus for its own ambitious plans. For Bitfarms, it brings a renewed sense of independence. Ultimately, this move contributes to the ever-changing narrative of the Bitcoin mining industry, emphasizing strategic decision-making in a dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Riot Platforms? Riot Platforms is a prominent Bitcoin mining company, operating large-scale data centers for cryptocurrency mining. Why did Riot Platforms sell Bitfarms shares? The sale of Bitfarms shares by Riot Platforms likely represents a strategic decision to reallocate capital, streamline focus on core operations, and potentially move past the complexities of a previous takeover attempt. What was the previous relationship between Riot Platforms and Bitfarms? Riot Platforms previously attempted a takeover of Bitfarms, which led to a public management dispute. The two companies reached a settlement in September 2024 to resolve their differences. How does this sale affect the Bitcoin mining industry? This sale highlights the strategic shifts within the competitive Bitcoin mining industry, indicating companies are optimizing their portfolios and focusing on independent growth and operational efficiency. What is the 5% disclosure threshold? In many jurisdictions, a 5% disclosure threshold means that if an entity’s ownership stake in a publicly traded company crosses this percentage, they are typically required to publicly disclose their holding, often signaling significant influence or intent.

The Nasdaq-listed firm announced Tuesday that Dogehash shareholders will swap all of their holdings for 30.7m shares of Thumzup. Once the deal closes, the combined company will be renamed Dogehash Technologies Holdings and trade under the new ticker XDOG. The transaction is expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter, pending shareholder approval and regulatory clearance. Dogehash Runs 2,500 Scrypt Miners Across North America Dogehash operates roughly 2,500 Scrypt ASIC miners across North America, focused on producing Dogecoin and Litecoin. The company plans to expand its fleet later this year, targeting significant growth in output through 2026. Its operations are centered at a renewable-energy data center, with satellite sites being added to scale production. $TZUP and Dogehash aim to become the world's leading #Dogecoin mining platform and will leverage Dogecoin Layer-2 infrastructure via staking in DeFi products within the DogeOS ecosystem to enhance miner economics and amplify yield beyond base block rewards. … — Thumzup Media Corporation (@thumz_up) August 19, 2025 By joining forces, Thumzup and Dogehash expect to leverage Dogecoin’s Layer-2 infrastructure through DeFi staking products built into the DogeOS ecosystem. Executives say this will improve mining economics and deliver higher yields than standard block rewards. Performance metrics will be disclosed after the merger closes. Dogecoin, one of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies, is valued for its fast block times and low transaction fees. It has an inflationary but predictable supply that mirrors fiat currency issuance, making it a staple for high-throughput payments and trading. The asset consistently records millions in daily volume and remains one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Thumzup Acquisition Follows $50M Fundraising Round Thumzup chief executive Robert Steele said the deal would accelerate the company’s transformation from a marketing platform into a diversified digital asset infrastructure player. Meanwhile, Dogehash head Parker Scott said the company had invested in infrastructure rather than speculative trading. “Unlike many companies that simply used their cash to buy cryptocurrency, we have invested in mining infrastructure. By owning and operating our own fleet of ASICs, we generate revenue directly from production, creating an ongoing, sustainable source of Dogecoin,” he said. Further, the acquisition comes after Thumzup raised $50m in July. The funds were set aside to expand its crypto strategies and buy more mining rigs. Additionally, the board approved up to $250m in digital asset holdings . These include Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Ether and USDC. Thumzup began its crypto journey in January by purchasing Bitcoin and now holds 19.1 BTC. Its shift into mining marks a new chapter for the Los Angeles-based firm, which until recently was best known for its digital marketing platform that rewarded users for promoting brands on social media. The company gained further visibility in July when Donald Trump Jr., son of the US president, bought 350,000 shares worth nearly $3.3m at the time, according to regulatory filings. The purchase positioned the Trump family as notable backers of Thumzup’s growing ambitions in digital assets.

WazirX Restructuring Heads Back To Court After Overwhelming Support Indian crypto exchange WazirX became prey to a notorious hack in July of last year, in which it lost user funds amounting to about $235 million, nearly half of what its reserve had at the time. WazirX shut down its withdrawals in response, and to this day, the remaining user funds have sat in the custody of the exchange. This may finally be about to change, however, as the platform has cleared a crucial step in restarting operations. As announced by the exchange in a blog post , users have voted in favor of the latest restructuring plan. The vote occurred between July 30th and August 6th, and asked creditors whether they approve of the platform’s restructuring scheme. This was actually the second vote done by the exchange. The first vote occurred back in March, and 93.1% of creditors were in favor of it. So, why did a revote have to take place? The answer is that even though creditors approved of the crypto distribution plan, Zettai PTE LTD, a Singaporean entity responsible for handling WazirX’s crypto funds, couldn’t get it sanctioned through the Singapore High Court due to compliance issues. Last month, the company again went to court with an amended proposal, and this time, it obtained the thumbs-up. The change from the previous restructuring plan was that WazirX’s Indian parent entity, Zanmai Labs, would instead handle user withdrawals, not Zettai. The revote was to get creditors’ approval on this new restructuring scheme. The results are now in, with 95.7% of users saying yes, slightly more than the previous vote. By value of approved claims, these creditors make up 94.6% of the total. “A second round of voting having such strong numbers is a testament to our approach towards the restructuring, which has been fair, transparent, and the quickest option for users to recover funds,” said Nischal Shetty, WazirX founder. The next step for the exchange is to return to the Singapore High Court to get the creditor-approved amended scheme sanctioned. According to an email sent out to creditors, the platform has already made a filing with the court, ahead of the earlier planned date of August 21st. “Should the Singapore Court sanction the Scheme, we are committed to restarting operations within 10 business days of the scheme taking effect,” noted Shetty. Last month, another Indian crypto exchange, CoinDCX, also fell prey to a $44 million hack . The timing of the attack was eerie, coming one year after the WazirX incident almost exactly to the date (July 18th vs July 19th). Bitcoin Price Bitcoin recovered toward $117,000 on Monday, but it appears the asset’s momentum has already faded as its price is now back at $115,600.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto exchange|Crypto Exchange WazirX|WazirX,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|ASIA|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 04:00:04

A groundbreaking development is reshaping how large players engage with digital assets: the rise of institutional staking . This innovative approach offers a secure pathway for major entities to participate in the crypto economy. What is Institutional Staking and Why Does It Matter? Recently, Core Foundation, a Bitcoin-based EVM-compatible blockchain, announced a pivotal integration. They have woven their unique dual staking feature into Hex Trust’s institutional custody platform. This collaboration, reported by BlockchainReporter, marks a significant step forward for the industry. So, what exactly is staking? In simple terms, it involves locking up cryptocurrency holdings to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return, participants earn rewards. However, for institutions, security, compliance, and liquidity are paramount. This is where institutional staking solutions become crucial. Security: Institutions require enterprise-grade security to protect substantial asset holdings. Compliance: Navigating complex regulatory environments is essential for institutional participation. Liquidity Management: The ability to earn rewards without liquidating core assets is a key benefit. Unlocking Value: The Core Foundation and Hex Trust Collaboration The integration between Core Foundation and Hex Trust directly addresses these institutional needs. Hex Trust, a leading digital asset custodian, provides a robust and secure environment for institutional clients. By integrating Core Foundation’s dual staking, they enable a new era of secure yield generation. This partnership empowers institutional clients to stake both Bitcoin (BTC) and Core (CORE) directly from their custodial accounts. This means they can earn on-chain rewards without the need to sell off their valuable holdings. It’s a game-changer for institutions looking to maximize their digital asset portfolios while maintaining stringent security protocols. This form of institutional staking offers a pathway to passive income for large-scale investors. How Does This Partnership Enhance Institutional Staking Security? Security is often the biggest hurdle for institutions entering the crypto space. Hex Trust’s role as a regulated digital asset custodian is central to this integration. Their platform is built with institutional-grade security measures, including advanced encryption, multi-party computation (MPC), and robust internal controls. By leveraging Hex Trust’s secure infrastructure, Core Foundation ensures that institutions engaging in BTC and CORE staking can do so with peace of mind. This reduces operational risks and helps institutions meet their compliance obligations. The emphasis on a secure custodial solution significantly de-risks the process of institutional staking . The Future of Institutional Staking: Broader Adoption Ahead? This development has far-reaching implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. As more secure and compliant pathways for earning yield emerge, we can expect a surge in institutional interest. The ability to generate returns on dormant assets without compromising security or liquidity is a powerful incentive. This collaboration sets a precedent, demonstrating how blockchain innovation can meet the stringent demands of traditional finance. It paves the way for greater institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives in a regulated and secure manner. The growth of institutional staking solutions is a clear indicator of the maturing crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, the partnership between Core Foundation and Hex Trust represents a significant leap forward for institutional participation in the crypto economy. By enabling secure and compliant dual staking for BTC and CORE, they are opening new avenues for yield generation and accelerating the integration of digital assets into traditional financial portfolios. This innovative step underscores the increasing sophistication and accessibility of the blockchain space for large-scale investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Core Foundation? A1: Core Foundation operates a Bitcoin-based, EVM-compatible blockchain, designed to bring Bitcoin’s power and security to a broader decentralized ecosystem. Q2: What is Hex Trust’s role in this partnership? A2: Hex Trust is a leading digital asset custodian that provides institutional-grade custody solutions, ensuring the secure storage and management of digital assets for their clients. Q3: Which cryptocurrencies can institutions stake through this integration? A3: Through this integration, institutional clients can stake both Bitcoin (BTC) and Core (CORE) assets. Q4: What are the main benefits of institutional staking through this partnership? A4: The primary benefits include earning on-chain rewards without liquidating holdings, enhanced security through Hex Trust’s custodial platform, and compliance with institutional requirements. Q5: Does this integration require institutions to liquidate their holdings? A5: No, a key benefit of this integration is that it allows institutional clients to stake their BTC and CORE without liquidating their holdings, maintaining their asset positions while earning rewards.

Although ETH has since corrected to around $4,306, the asset remains positive in terms of weekly performance, showing a 0.7% increase. This price action shows ongoing investor interest at a time when Ethereum’s relative performance against Bitcoin is attracting attention. Analysts have pointed to Ethereum’s growing strength in both spot and derivatives markets, where ETH is showing resilience against BTC. On CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, contributor EgyHash noted that the ETH/BTC trading pair has reached levels not seen since the beginning of the year, with spot trading volumes climbing to record highs. This shift in participation highlights Ethereum’s expanding role within the broader crypto market, particularly as institutional activity continues to increase. Related Reading: Ethereum Store-of-Value Evolution: From Utility Token To Digital Reserve Asset ETH/BTC Ratio and Market Participation According to EgyHash, Ethereum has recovered significantly after reaching a six-year low against Bitcoin earlier this year. The ETH/BTC pair now trades at 0.0368, its highest level in 2025, though still well below past cycle peaks. Notably, weekly spot trading volumes for ETH relative to BTC reached an all-time high, with Ethereum trading nearly three times the volume of Bitcoin last week. This signals an adjustment in market preference, as traders and investors increasingly allocate toward ETH. The derivatives market has also reflected this trend. Data shows that ETH/BTC perpetual futures open interest has risen to 0.71, its highest point in 14 months. This rise suggests stronger speculative positioning around Ethereum. EgyHash emphasized that such increases often signal short-term strength but also warned that Ethereum’s long-term standing against Bitcoin will depend on sustained adoption and continued investor conviction. Ethereum Institutional Demand and Policy Context Beyond spot and derivatives activity, institutional demand for Ethereum has been growing steadily. Another CryptoQuant analyst, writing under the pseudonym OnChain, highlighted that investment funds now hold approximately 6.1 million ETH. This represents a 68% increase compared to December 2024 levels and a 75% rise from April 2025. Alongside these holdings, the fund market premium for ETH has expanded significantly, climbing to a two-week average of 6.44%, far higher than during previous cycle peaks. Related Reading: Ethereum Plunges 10% After Smashing Into This Historical Barrier OnChain noted that such institutional accumulation reflects both financial and psychological market effects, with entities like BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF expanding exposure. The analyst also suggested that once staking becomes available within ETH-based ETFs, institutional flows could increase further. This development could coincide with broader US regulatory clarity, as legislation such as the proposed CLARITY Act seeks to formally classify both Bitcoin and Ethereum as digital commodities under federal law.

According to market expert Zach Rynes, the decentralized oracle network is better equipped than XRP to harness the forthcoming wave of institutional blockchain adoption and the tokenization of trillions in assets. Chainlink Vs XRP While some argue that Chainlink and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) do not compete directly on a product basis, Rynes suggests that this perspective overlooks the broader implications of their respective roles in the blockchain landscape. The expert highlights that Chainlink offers a platform that encompasses on-chain data delivery, cross-chain interoperability, automated compliance, privacy-preserving computing, and integration with legacy systems. These features are considered essential for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) such as funds, equities, commodities, and currencies across diverse blockchain networks, both public and private. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts The Collapse Of Bitcoin In This Timeframe As a result of these advantages, Chainlink is already collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Brazil, to facilitate the adoption of blockchain technologies and tokenized assets. Investing in XRP, according to the expert, hinges on the belief that institutions will favor the XRPL as their ledger of choice over others, including proprietary private chains. In contrast, a bet on Chainlink reflects confidence that institutions will adopt blockchain technology more broadly, regardless of which specific ledger they choose to implement. Rynes emphasizes that this distinction is crucial, as Chainlink’s services enhance the functionality of any blockchain used by institutions, making it a more complete player in the ecosystem. Why LINK Is Key For Institutional Blockchain Adoption Currently, Chainlink secures over $92 billion in total value locked (TVL) across more than 60 blockchain networks through its oracle network, which supports over 450 applications. In comparison, XRPL has a DeFi TVL of around $100 million. The expert further asserts that the core capabilities that Chainlink provides are more valuable to institutions seeking to navigate the tokenization sector. For instance, data oracles are essential for delivering accurate net asset value (NAV) data for tokenized funds and corporate actions for tokenized equities. Cross-chain oracles also enable the secure transfer of assets across different blockchains, facilitating delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) workflows. Additionally, Chainlink’s legacy-system oracles allow traditional financial institutions to interact with public and private blockchains using existing infrastructure and messaging standards, such as SWIFT. Related Reading: SUI Holds The Line: Rounded Bottom Hints At 13% Breakout Setup The expert also notes that a trend of margin compression is emerging for blockchain technology, where the value generated from transaction ordering is increasingly recaptured by applications rather than the networks themselves. Rynes highlights that this shift underscores the importance of infrastructure providers like Chainlink, which can monetize their services through enterprise deals and integration programs. While XRP aims to position itself as a bridge currency, Rynes argues that Chainlink’s ability to facilitate cross-chain transactions involving stablecoins and other assets diminishes the need for such intermediary currencies. As of this writing, LINK is trading at $24, down nearly 5% over the last 24 hours. Over longer periods, however, the cryptocurrency has ranked among the market’s top performers, recording year-to-date gains of 140%.

These three names are commanding serious buzz, but each is building momentum in very different ways. Cardano’s chart is flashing signals of a breakout above $1.00, supported by strong derivatives activity and several technical confirmations. Chainlink is gaining from whale demand and major institutional links, with sights set on new highs beyond $30. Then there is BlockDAG (BDAG) , already raising $377 million in presale funding, activating 2.5 million mobile miners, and securing key sports sponsorships. With Cardano powering up, Chainlink roaring, and BlockDAG executing on an aggressive multi-track strategy, the race for the crypto with the most potential is heating up fast, and the next big move could shift market attention in a major way. Cardano’s $1 Target: Bulls Prepare for the Push Cardano (ADA) is moving near $0.87, climbing more than 4%, as buying pressure builds across the market. Futures Open Interest jumped to $1.43 billion from $1.2 billion on August 3, showing strong retail and speculative demand. This follows the July rally to $0.93, when OI hit $1.74 billion before profit-taking pulled it back. In the last 24 hours, $3.35 million in positions were liquidated, including $2.4 million from shorts, adding to bullish signals. ADA is still held back by a trendline from December’s $1.32 peak, but breaking through could open a clear path to $1.00. Technical indicators also favor bulls. A recent MACD buy signal combined with several Golden Cross patterns, including the 50-day EMA moving above the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. In early August, the 100-day EMA also crossed over the 200-day, adding more bullish confirmation. If profit-taking slows progress, strong support rests at $0.74, $0.72, and $0.71. With structure and sentiment aligning, ADA is proving itself as a strong contender for crypto with the most potential. Chainlink’s Whale Moves and Institutional Momentum Chainlink (LINK) has jumped over 30% in the past week, trading at $23.50 after a 9% daily gain, with $1.35 billion in daily trading volume. Whales are active, including a 510,000 LINK ($11.13M) withdrawal from Binance to Compound, along with other large buys worth $13 million. Daily active addresses climbed from 5,500 to 9,410, showing retail and whale demand rising together. Institutional support is also building, with names like Fidelity, Swift, DTCC, Citi, JPMorgan, and BNP Paribas adopting Chainlink for Web3 infrastructure. Chainlink Reserve enables fiat-based payments tied to the token economy, boosting DEX volume to $1.298 billion in just 24 hours. On the charts, LINK confirmed a breakout after retesting $18 and could target $30 if it holds above $24. Analyst Posty has even called LINK “too cheap” and sees a possible run to $100, which would take its market cap from $15 billion to $100 billion. With whales buying, Wall Street backing, and bullish technicals, LINK stands firmly in the spotlight in the crypto with the most potential. BlockDAG’s 2.5M X1 Miners: The Hidden Advantage While Cardano and Chainlink chase near-term price rallies, BlockDAG is building a structure for long-term strength that could push both into the background. The presale has already pulled in more than $377 million, with BDAG priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29 and set to launch at $0.05, giving early access a clear appeal. Driving this momentum are 2.5 million X1 mobile miners, allowing people to mine daily without expensive rigs. This setup is reinforced by the X10 miner, which was unveiled live on July 23 in a showcase that highlighted how mobile and hardware mining connect seamlessly. With the power to create up to 200 BDAG per day, ten times the output of the X1, the X10 balances entry-level access with scaling for serious users. Beyond mining, BlockDAG is making waves in sports with headline partnerships with the Seattle Orcas and Seattle Seawolves. These collaborations bring NFTs, fan tokens, and unique digital experiences to sports followers, connecting crypto directly to mainstream culture. On the technical side, BlockDAG’s hybrid blockchain and DAG model can process 2,000 to 15,000 transactions per second, with EVM compatibility that supports smart contracts and dApps. Confirmed listings on 20 exchanges after launch promise fast liquidity and worldwide reach. This mix of strong adoption, mining access, real-world partnerships, and scale-ready infrastructure makes BlockDAG more than another presale coin, placing it firmly in the spotlight as the crypto with the most potential for 2025. Final Word Cardano is close to breaking through technical barriers that could drive it toward $1.00. Chainlink is pulling in whales and big institutions as it targets $30 and beyond. Both have strong momentum, yet BlockDAG’s mix of crypto presale strength, community growth, accessible mining, and sports deals shows a very different kind of strategy. While ADA and LINK depend heavily on charts and ecosystem trends, BlockDAG already has its community, network design, and revenue base in place before launch. That is why, in the race for the crypto with the most potential, BlockDAG’s 2.5 million mobile miners may be the game-changer. For those thinking past the next quick surge, this is where real momentum and execution are already moving in sync.

Both tokens have kept traders engaged, offering setups that appeal to those looking for quick and meaningful gains. While these price movements generate excitement, the challenge remains in preserving profits. High transaction costs can erode margins, making it harder for active traders to fully benefit from their strategies. Fees often become the hidden barrier that limits overall returns. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) provides a direct solution by rewarding participation instead of penalizing it. Its system gives users cashback on gas fees, turning activity with BONK, LINK, or any asset into a more profitable experience. This combination of cost savings and secure self-custody makes it a practical tool for traders aiming to capture more value in every market cycle. BONK Price Momentum Draws Trader Attention BONK has surprised many traders with a sharp move upward, gaining nearly 10% to reach $0.000027 before profit-taking slowed the rally. This surge has attracted short-term traders who see the potential for another push higher if buying pressure resumes. Volumes across major exchanges have been rising, and despite minor pullbacks, sentiment around BONK remains strong. Technical signals suggest the token has been consolidating within a key support range, gradually edging closer to resistance. If BONK can break above its recent peak with sustained volume, analysts believe higher targets may come into play, especially if overall market strength continues. Chainlink Price Forecast Points to Strong Upside Chainlink is building a bullish case as it climbs back to the $24 mark, with projections indicating a possible 82% surge. Analysts note that a move above $25 could confirm a breakout, giving LINK room to challenge long-term resistance levels and potentially sustain a broader uptrend. Developer and institutional interest in Chainlink’s oracles continues to rise, reinforcing its critical role in DeFi and cross-chain ecosystems. With strong utility paired with favorable technicals, LINK’s current consolidation is seen as a healthy reset that may set the stage for patient holders to capture significant gains. Cold Wallet Puts Users Back in Control Crypto was built on the idea of freedom and ownership, yet for many users, it feels more like paying tolls on every transaction. Gas fees, swap charges, and on and off-ramp costs have turned participation into a constant drain. The more active you are, the more it eats away at your holdings, creating a barrier that stops adoption before it starts. For newcomers, the problem is obvious. No one wants to invite a friend into crypto only for them to face a $30 gas fee on their first transaction. Traders who move stablecoins daily see the hidden cost add up with every swap. Crypto is not avoided because it is complicated; it is avoided because it is expensive, and this is the wall Cold Wallet is breaking down. Cold Wallet changes the equation by rewarding activity instead of punishing it. Users keep full control of their assets while receiving rebates in CWT every time they transact. Pay gas, earn some back. Make a swap, collect cashback. Move assets across chains, and the system rewards you instead of charging you more. It builds a loop where engagement creates measurable value. The presale is already showing traction, priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17 with more than $6.3M raised and 745M tokens sold. This framework allows gains from other trending coins like BONK or LINK to remain in the user’s pocket instead of being lost to fees. Cold Wallet is delivering on the original promise of crypto: ownership that feels empowering, useful, and fair. Looking Forward BONK’s rally shows that bold moves in the market can still be rewarded, while Chainlink’s bullish forecast highlights how strong fundamentals can attract attention from traders and long-term holders alike. Both tokens continue to capture interest, making them clear candidates for those scanning the top crypto picks of the moment. Yet profits are only as strong as what traders keep after fees. Cold Wallet changes that equation by giving users up to 100% gas cashback on every transaction. Pairing BONK and LINK with Cold Wallet ensures gains are maximized and participation truly pays back.

While these holders passively wait for speculative surges, active traders are setting their sights on new opportunities that generate income rather than idle promises. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one such project, offering real functionality with its lending ecosystem that combines both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models. SHIB accumulated by dormant wallets Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw significant accumulation by dormant wallets, with a whale wallet (0xE996) acquiring 64.8 billion SHIB ($834,620) on March 20, 2025, after two months of inactivity, per Arkham Intelligence data. The wallet, holding $5.2 million in assets including 1,680 ETH, also bought other Ethereum-based tokens, suggesting a strategic move by a single entity, possibly a market maker. SHIB trades at ~$0.000013, down 10% weekly, with a 24-hour trading volume of $250 million. Technical indicators show SHIB below $0.000014 support, with RSI at 45 and new support at $0.0000125. Despite Shibarium’s 40% fee cut and a 3,000% burn rate spike, macro pressures like US tariffs pose risks. A rebound above $0.000014 could target $0.000015, but a drop below $0.0000125 risks $0.000011. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): presale phase gathers strong momentum Through the P2C system, users will be able to deposit assets into liquidity pools and earn attractive returns. For instance, an investor depositing 25,000 MATIC will secure 16% APY, generating 4,000 USDT annually without relying on unpredictable market swings. On the borrowing side, someone holding $4,000 worth of BTC will use it as collateral at a 75% loan-to-value ratio, unlocking an instant $3,000 USDT while still maintaining exposure to BTC’s growth. In the P2P model, traders will negotiate loan terms directly. An example would be a lender extending a PEPE loan at a 28% rate, specifically designed for meme coin speculators who seek high-risk, high-reward opportunities. While the broader market debates topics like the crypto fear and greed index or wonders why is crypto down, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has advanced with steady presale traction. Currently in Phase 6 at $0.035, the project has already raised over $14.65 million with 22% of tokens sold and more than 15,400 holders onboarded. This growing base underscores the community’s confidence in a protocol audited by CertiK, which awarded MUTM a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. To further strengthen security and transparency, the project has rolled out a $50,000 bug bounty program that rewards severity-based reporting, while also engaging the community through a $100,000 giveaway that will see 10 winners selected. Urgency is now critical. The next stage, Phase 7, is priced at $0.04, a 15% increase from today. For those considering serious crypto investment strategies, the timing becomes an important factor. History already illustrates the returns possible for early movers. A $5,000 entry during Phase 1 at $0.01 is now valued at $17,500 in Phase 6. Once the token lists at $0.06, this position will stand at a sixfold growth. Analysts point out that if Mutuum Finance (MUTM) captures adoption in the borrowing and lending market similar to established players like Compound (COMP), a 15x to 20x projection post-launch becomes a realistic outlook. The hidden gem beneath the noise While SHIB whales continue to sit on dormant holdings, waiting for speculative winds to shift, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built a pathway that rewards active participation. Its dual lending structure encourages income for depositors, provides liquidity for borrowers, and opens space for direct deals in the P2P market. With the presale nearing its next price tier, the project stands as one of the few under-$0.040 tokens that offer genuine utility. As the conversation around markets broadens—from the excitement around every new crypto etf to the recurring question of why is crypto down—smart traders are adjusting strategies. Instead of hoarding idle meme coins, they are pursuing projects that merge real use cases with growth potential. With its strong presale performance, audited framework, community-driven programs, and clear revenue mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as that hidden gem. Those who wait on dormant meme coins might miss the next evolution, while those who step into the ecosystem of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be tapping into a project prepared to deliver both immediate functionality and long-term value appreciation.

This DeFi coin already joined ETH rally,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/20/top-crypto-to-buy-before-q4-2025-this-defi-coin-already-joined-eth-rally/,"The recent rally in Ethereum (ETH) has reignited market confidence across decentralized finance. Investors are closely tracking crypto prices today, searching for the next project that could capture momentum before Q4 2025 sets the stage for a broader altseason. Among the tokens emerging with strong traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi protocol preparing features that aim to combine lending, staking, and a revenue-driven rewards structure into one ecosystem. While ETH remains the backbone of DeFi, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to become the name that aligns with the next phase of growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s approach to stability and rewards One of the most distinctive elements of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its plan to introduce a stablecoin pegged to $1. Unlike many projects whose value fluctuates with market swings, this stablecoin is expected to bring stability to users borrowing and lending within the platform. It will be minted only when borrowers lock collateral like ETH and will be burned as loans are repaid, keeping its peg intact through controlled issuance and automated liquidation where necessary. This stability is designed to create a secure backbone for transactions inside the protocol. At the same time, lenders depositing assets will receive mtTokens in return, which grow in value with interest earned. These mtTokens can also be staked in dedicated smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards. The uniqueness here lies in the rewards mechanism itself—platform-generated revenue will be used to buy back MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to stakers. This ensures that rewards are directly tied to real usage of the protocol rather than inflationary emissions, an approach many seasoned voices in crypto investing are now demanding. Presale progress and investor case study Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its Phase 6 presale, priced at $0.035. The project has already raised over $14.65 million, with 22% of this phase’s allocation sold and more than 15,400 holders participating. Once the phase concludes, the token price will increase to $0.040, representing an immediate 15% rise for new entrants. At listing, the price is set to debut at $0.06, doubling the current entry. Investor case studies already show strong returns on paper. For example, an early participant who diversified from Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 3 at $0.020 is now holding unrealized gains of 75%. At the upcoming listing price, their position is set to represent a full 200% return. These outcomes highlight why crypto predictions around Q4 are increasingly pointing toward tokens like MUTM that already demonstrate significant traction before their official launch. Roadmap and lending mechanics building real utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just offering presale excitement; its 4-phase roadmap is structured to deliver a fully operational ecosystem. The first phase introduced the presale and marketing. The second has focused on developing core smart contracts and the DApp interface. The third centers around bug reporting, demos, compliance work, and final development steps before release. Finally, the fourth phase will bring the live launch, exchange listings, multi-chain expansions, and partnerships. With this structured roadmap, investors have visibility on how the project plans to deliver on its promises. The lending model is another standout feature. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) design, borrowers will be able to lock ETH as collateral and instantly access loans in USDT, giving them liquidity while holding their ETH positions. On the peer-to-peer (P2P) side, users will negotiate loan terms directly with one another, enabling flexible interest agreements. Together, these two approaches are designed to cover both standardized lending and tailored, market-driven solutions. Adding to the project’s credibility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already undergone a CertiK audit, earning a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. Security confidence is further supported by a $100,000 giveaway campaign to expand community participation and a $50,000 bug bounty program structured to reward discoveries based on severity. These steps underline that the team is prioritizing both safety and growth from the outset. Why momentum favors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Crypto prices are moving in sync with Ethereum (ETH)’s latest rally, but not every project has the balance of utility and growth potential that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents. While ETH showcases market leadership, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already joined the momentum through its presale traction and upcoming product suite. For those tracking crypto prices today, the project represents an alternative that combines exposure to DeFi innovation with early-stage investment upside. As Q4 2025 approaches, the debate around whether altseason will fully materialize remains open. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers something that transcends market timing. With its stablecoin, mtToken staking, buyback-driven rewards, detailed roadmap, and growing presale success, the project is already aligning itself with Ethereum (ETH)’s trajectory. Investors focused on crypto investing now have the opportunity to capture unrealized gains before the official exchange listings give the wider market access.

Known investors adding Mutuum Finance (MUTM),https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/20/best-crypto-to-invest-in-now-known-investors-adding-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"When investors talk about the next big opportunity in crypto investing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly part of the conversation. This decentralized liquidity protocol is introducing powerful features that set it apart from many tokens currently shaping crypto prices today. At the core of its innovation is a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain a steady $1 peg. Unlike other tokens, this stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against collateral such as ETH, and it will be burned when loans are repaid. Governance will control its interest rate to keep the price stable, making it an essential tool for those looking to transact or store value without exposure to volatility. Another highlight is the staking system around mtTokens. Whenever users deposit assets into liquidity pools, they will receive mtTokens, ERC-20 tokens that grow in value as interest accrues. These tokens will not only be transferable but also staked in smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards. A portion of protocol revenue will go into buying back MUTM from the open market and distributing it to stakers, ensuring continuous demand. This buyback-and-distribute model is designed to reward long-term commitment and create ongoing buy pressure. These mechanisms offer a future where investors are not only borrowing and lending in efficient ways but also generating multiple streams of returns. With strong fundamentals, crypto predictions surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are beginning to reflect a growing confidence in its design. Growing investor interest and presale momentum Investor activity is proving the excitement is real. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. Over $14.65 million has been raised already, with 22% of the tokens sold and more than 15,400 holders on board. The price will soon climb to $0.040, representing a 15% increase for those waiting too long. With a listing price already set at $0.06, early entrants are locking in attractive paper gains before the market catches up. Take the example of an investor who allocated part of their ETH portfolio to Phase 2 at $0.015. That position now represents a 133% gain on paper, showcasing the strength of entering early into a project that continues to gather momentum. Unlike volatile swings often seen in crypto prices, MUTM’s presale structure has provided a steady upward trajectory, which is why many investors are rebalancing portfolios to include it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also securing credibility in ways retail and institutional investors value. It has completed an audit with CertiK, receiving a strong Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. To further harden trust, the team has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program with severity-based rewards and a $100,000 giveaway distributed among ten winners. These steps reflect a commitment to transparency and security, cornerstones for a sustainable DeFi platform. The roadmap provides another reason investors are paying attention. Phase 1 began with presale initiation, listings on trackers, giveaways, and audits. Phase 2 centers on building out the core protocol, front-end and back-end, and advanced features. Phase 3 will finalize testing, demos, and exchange listing preparation. Phase 4 is when the live platform and exchange listings go public, accompanied by compliance expansion and multi-chain enhancements. With most of this roadmap still ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers forward-looking growth opportunities that crypto investing enthusiasts crave. Within this roadmap, the peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models are central. In the P2C system, lenders will deposit assets into liquidity pools, and borrowers will access those pooled funds. Interest rates will dynamically adjust based on utilization, creating a fair and efficient environment. In the P2P model, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly, giving them flexibility. Imagine lending $15,000 USDT in P2C and generating consistent APY, or using ETH collateral in P2P to unlock liquidity without selling the asset. Both systems bring practical use cases that are simple yet effective, reinforcing why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has attracted attention at this stage. Why investors are not waiting Savvy investors have recognized that with crypto prices today offering limited entry points on bluechips like BTC and ETH, the real upside is often found in promising presales. Known investors are quietly adding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into their portfolios while it is still affordable, anticipating the 71% jump from $0.035 to $0.06 at listing. They are not waiting for the market to reprice this opportunity once the beta launch and exchange listings begin to unfold. ETH under $1 created millionaires for those who acted early. With the presale clock ticking, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035 represents a similar rare chance. For those serious about building diversified positions, the window is now, before the market corrects its valuation upward.

The post read, “The neXt era of rewaRds is preParing to launch.” The unusual capitalization of certain letters immediately stood out. By emphasizing X, R, and P, the exchange appeared to signal that a new product related to XRP may be imminent. JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), a prominent figure in the XRP community, quickly drew attention to the post, suggesting that the exchange is hinting at something big for XRP. BREAKING: @Gemini , a major exchange, hints at something significant coming for #XRP ! pic.twitter.com/eqnvfySO2D — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 19, 2025 What the Message Could Mean Gemini has a history of utilizing product releases to enhance customer engagement, including its credit card rewards program and staking opportunities for select tokens. Given that background, speculation now centers on what form an XRP-focused initiative might take. The most straightforward possibility is the expansion of XRP-related services and rewards in Gemini’s existing credit card system. The company launched a cashback program for XRP users in March, offering 4% back to anyone who made payments through the card using XRP. Another potential direction is an XRP-based yield product . Gemini previously introduced staking for other assets, offering customers the opportunity to earn returns through the platform’s custody service. Extending that model to XRP would fit naturally into its current offerings. Alternatively, the exchange could opt for a loyalty framework that ties platform benefits to XRP balances or activity, effectively positioning the token as a utility within its ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expansion of a Strategic Relationship Gemini recently entered into a financing partnership with Ripple, securing a revolving credit line to support its upcoming IPO. The agreement signals more than financial backing, as it highlights a growing alignment between the two companies. With Ripple providing capital support and Gemini hinting at an XRP-related rewards program, the collaboration appears to be broadening. This collaboration is important as it demonstrates how Ripple’s partnerships can pave the way for broader XRP integration and utility, extending beyond traditional funding arrangements. The teaser may be the first sign that Gemini intends to integrate the digital asset into customer-facing products, potentially positioning XRP as a central component of its future rewards and loyalty offerings. Gemini has previously shared a similar teaser about RLUSD , and the new post suggests XRP could receive comparable treatment as part of its expanding product strategy, signaling Gemini’s intent to give the token greater visibility and utility across its ecosystem.

His comments, which are a stark contrast to his predecessor Gary Gensler’s view that the vast majority of crypto assets were securities, came at the SALT Wyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025 on Tuesday. Sporting an orange tie, Atkins said the SEC’s “Project Crypto,” which aims to establish rules on such assets, may affect how the agency addresses companies moving forward. “We can not go about looking at oranges [tokens] themselves as necessarily being a security,” he said before adding, “from the SEC’s perspective, we will plow forward on the idea that the token itself is not necessarily a security.” “There are very few, in my mind, tokens that are securities.” Moving Forward on Crypto Regulations “The President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released clear recommendations for the SEC — and we’re setting out to implement them as soon as we can,” said Atkins on X following the conference. I had a great conversation with @TeresaGoody at @SALTConference ’s Wyoming Blockchain Symposium today about my priorities as @SECgov chairman, including Project Crypto and making IPOs great again.

Atkins also praised the recently passed GENIUS Act stablecoin regulations, stating it was a “seminal step for the US Congress and government.” However, he also said there was a lot of “spring cleaning to do at the SEC,” following years of regulation by enforcement by the previous administration. In related news, the former Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council under President Trump, Robert Hines, has been appointed by stablecoin issuer Tether as its new advisor. Crypto Market Correction Deepens The crypto market pullback has deepened despite the latest positive move from US financial regulators. Total market capitalization has tanked a further 2.3% on the day to $3.87 trillion, its lowest level for a fortnight. Bitcoin led the losses with a 2.7% dump to bottom out at $112,650 during early trading in Asia on Wednesday. The asset recovered to the $113,500 level at the time of writing, but was 8.5% down from its peak last week and was looking at further losses. Ethereum had wiped out last week’s gains in a fall below $4,100 on Wednesday morning as markets continued to melt down. Altcoin losses were not as severe, but they were mostly in the red at the time of writing.

She compared the situation to “learning a sport from someone who’s never played,” and believes that real-world experience is crucial as the Fed develops a supervisory framework for digital asset issuers. Her comments were made alongside the debut of the American Innovation Project, a new nonprofit backed by major crypto players to encourage bipartisan dialogue between policymakers and the digital asset industry. Fed Staff to Needs Hands On Crypto Insight Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman suggested that staff at the US central bank should be allowed to hold small amounts of cryptocurrency in order to better understand the technology they regulate. At a blockchain event in Wyoming on Tuesday, Bowman argued that allowing de minimis investments in digital assets will actually help Fed staff gain some practical experience with how ownership and transfers function, which she said is critical as the institution moves toward creating a framework for supervising issuers of such assets. Currently, most Fed employees and their spouses are prohibited from owning crypto or related products, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and shares in crypto companies. These restrictions were tightened in early 2022 after revelations that three senior officials engaged in questionable trading during 2020, while the Fed was implementing emergency measures to support the economy at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Bowman acknowledged the importance of safeguarding against conflicts of interest, she said the current rules risk pushing away talent from joining the Fed and limit existing staff from acquiring the expertise necessary to engage with emerging technologies. She compared the situation to learning a sport from an instructor who has never actually practiced it, and even said she “wouldn’t trust someone to teach me to ski if they’d never put on skis.” Bowman also pressed regulators more broadly to avoid what she called an “overly cautious mindset,” and warned that excessive skepticism toward blockchain and related innovations could leave the traditional banking system behind. She pointed out that many bankers see distributed ledger technology as a threat to established business models but explained that it has the potential to transform finance regardless of resistance from incumbents. Regulators, she argued, have to decide whether to embrace the change and shape a durable, reliable framework that preserves safety and soundness while reaping the benefits of efficiency and speed, or risk being bypassed altogether. Announcement from the Fed Her comments were made as the Trump administration is taking a much more favorable stance toward the crypto sector. Just last week, the Fed announced it will end a supervision program for blockchain-related bank activities that was put in place under President Biden. Earlier this month, Trump also signed an executive order directing regulators to investigate claims of debanking from the crypto industry and conservative groups. American Innovation Project Debuts Meanwhile, a new nonprofit organization emerged in Washington, DC, and its goal is to bridge the gap between US policymakers and the digital asset sector. The American Innovation Project (AIP), which launched on Tuesday, describes itself as a 501(c)(3) dedicated to fostering understanding of emerging technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence. It is led by Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute, and the group’s board includes executives from major industry players including the Blockchain Association, Paradigm, Digital Currency Group, and Coinbase. LinkedIn post from American Innovation Project Smith explained that the initiative wants to create bipartisan dialogue and collaboration, and believes there is an urgent need for lawmakers to be equipped with the knowledge and tools to craft timely and effective regulation. The AIP’s creation follows a wave of pro-crypto lawmakers entering government after the 2024 elections, and it now joins a growing number of advocacy groups like the National Cryptocurrency Association, the Solana Policy Institute, and the DeFi Education Foundation. The nonprofit’s funding sources include $1 million from Digital Currency Group, as well as contributions from Andreessen Horowitz, Kraken, Uniswap Labs, Stand With Crypto, and an undisclosed amount from the Cedar Innovation Foundation. This is a group with ties to the pro-crypto political action committee Fairshake. The group’s launch coincides with the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole. AIP plans to host an “off-record” summit this week that is designed to build connections between the blockchain gathering and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, which begins on the same day. Among some of the more well known attendees at the Wyoming event were Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, and SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who suggested that the agency could shift its approach to digital assets under his leadership.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-20 05:30:00

Silver prices slid toward $37 per ounce on Wednesday, marking their lowest level in more than two weeks, as the dollar firmed ahead of key Federal Reserve events. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) traded around $113,000 in late August, holding most of its losses following a sharp sell-off that pushed it near a six-week low. Gold fell to around $3,310 per ounce on Wednesday, approaching a three-week low, as prospects of easing geopolitical tensions and a rising US dollar weighed on the metal ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium. The United States Commerce Department widened its 50% steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 product categories, including auto parts, chemicals, plastics, and furniture components that contain the metals. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.52% to below 43,200, while the broader Topix Index lost 0.3% to 3,107 on Wednesday, extending the previous session’s decline. The Japanese yen firmed to around 147.5 per dollar on Wednesday, extending gains from the prior session, even as trade figures disappointed. Japan's exports fell 2.6% year-on-year in July, the sharpest decline in more than four years as sweeping US tariffs weighed on overseas demand. Imports also contracted 7.5%, marking the fourth decline this year but faring better than expectations for a 10.4% drop. Separately, core machinery orders—a leading indicator of capital spending over the next six to nine months—unexpectedly rose in June, rebounding after two months of declines. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that a document outlining the recent deal on U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports is likely “weeks away.” China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.07% to around 3,730 while the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.2% to 11,800 on Wednesday, with mainland equities struggling for direction, and the offshore yuan edged lower to around 7.19 per dollar on Wednesday as investors digested the People’s Bank of China’s latest monetary policy decision alongside developments in the ongoing US-China trade truce. At its August meeting, People’s Bank of China’s kept its key lending rates at historic lows for the third straight month , as expected by the market. The one-year Loan Prime Rate was held at 3.0% and the five-year LPR remained at 3.5%. India and China have agreed to resume direct flights and enhance trade and investment flows as part of efforts to rebuild ties strained by a 2020 border clash. China's exports of rare earth magnets surged nearly 75% from the previous month to a six-month high of 5,577 metric tons in July 2025, highlighting a return to pre-restriction levels before the country imposed export curbs, following a series of deals reached in June between China and both the US and Europe aimed at reopening the rare earth trade. On the trade front, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that negotiations between Washington and Beijing are “going well”, as both countries work toward a possible agreement during the current 90-day suspension of new tariff measures. China’s fiscal revenue edged up 0.1% year-on-year to over CNY 13.58 trillion (USD 1.9 trillion) in the first seven months of the year, the Ministry of Finance said Tuesday. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.59% to 25,019 in Wednesday morning trade, slipping for the fifth session. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.09% trading around 81,661 in early deals on Wednesday after gaining in the previous four sessions, as gains in tech and real estate stocks were offset by losses in the pharmaceutical, healthcare, and banking sectors. The Indian rupee traded around 87.1 per dollar on Wednesday, holding its biggest gain in over a month to stay near a three-week-high, supported by easing US tariff risks and optimism over New Delhi’s tax reforms. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit China later this month for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, his first trip there in over seven years. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.14% to below 8,880 on Wednesday, extending its decline from the previous session, weighed by cautious trading as investors continued to parse corporate updates. The Australian dollar weakened to below $0.645 on Wednesday, marking its third straight session of losses to hit a nearly three-week low. Investors now await upcoming PMI data for clues on Australia’s economic momentum. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand reduced its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 3% during its August 2025 meeting, lowering borrowing costs down to their lowest point since August 2022. The New Zealand dollar fell more than 1% to $0.582 on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level since mid-April after the Reserve Bank cut interest rates as expected and signaled scope for further easing. The central bank slashed its official cash rate by 25bps to a three-year low of 3%, bringing its easing cycle so far to a whopping 250bps In the U.S. on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended lower as losses in major technology names dragged the market lower, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.6% and the Nasdaq falling 1.5%, its lowest level in more than two weeks, on steep drops in chipmakers.

Investors are watching closely for signals on whether the Fed is prepared to cut rates in September or remain focused on inflation. July’s economic data painted a mixed picture, with headline consumer prices slowing to 2.7%, but core inflation edging up to 3.1% and producer prices rising 3.3%. The combination of cooling job growth and persistent price pressures has stirred stagflation concerns, complicating the Fed’s decision. Bitcoin has often reacted sharply to Powell’s words at Jackson Hole. In 2022, a hawkish speech that reaffirmed tightening led to a 10% weekly drop. Market watchers expect Powell to tread carefully this year, avoiding a clear rate-cut pledge but leaving room to adjust if inflation trends weaken. Institutional Flows Seen Offsetting Short-Term Market Weakness Dom Harz, co-founder of Bitcoin DeFi protocol BOB, said the retreat is little more than a pause after record highs. “This short-term correction is really just noise; a minor distraction from the fact that Bitcoin and, particularly Bitcoin DeFi, are undeniably rising,” he said. He pointed to continued institutional demand as a key driver. “Mainstream and institutional adoption will continue to be a driving force behind Bitcoin, as institutions continue to accumulate the crypto asset. This will also drive technological developments in Bitcoin DeFi,” he said. Meanwhile, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, said it is too early to judge where the correction will settle. “The current correction is still unfolding, and it remains uncertain at which levels it will ultimately stabilize,” he said. Medium-Term Investors Seen Securing Profits as Markets Look Stretched Lienkha warned that weakness in equities could deepen the slide. “A significant correction in equity markets, for example, could trigger a deeper pullback in Bitcoin as well. That said, it is true that Bitcoin’s historical volatility has been gradually declining over time,” he added. He said profit-taking reflects caution rather than lost confidence. “Profit-taking is indeed occurring at the moment, and in many cases, it reflects disciplined risk management. This is particularly true in the current environment, where institutional discussions increasingly emphasize that we may be entering the later stages of the bull market.” Fund managers have voiced concerns that US stocks are overvalued, encouraging some to lock in gains in crypto. Lienkha said this trend is more about portfolio balance than outright bearishness. “While long-term investors are generally less affected by these short-term dynamics, those operating within medium-term horizons, such as two- to three-year cycles, often adopt relative strategies that encourage them to secure gains when markets look stretched,” he said.

Related Reading: What’s Next For XRP After Crashing Below $3? Analyst Answers Over the past week, ADA has surged 20%, maintaining strong momentum even as broader market sentiment turned cautious. According to CoinGecko data, ADA is up nearly 175% year-on-year, trading near $0.92 after consistently holding green candles across daily, weekly, and monthly charts. Bitcoin briefly slipped below $115,000, while Ethereum retraced to $4,200 after touching a multi-year high. Yet Cardano has shown resilience, buoyed by technical and macroeconomic factors that are drawing fresh investor attention. What’s Fueling ADA’s Breakout? One key driver of ADA’s rally is the formation of a golden cross, a bullish chart pattern historically linked to major price upswings. Crypto analyst Lark Davis highlighted that the last golden cross on Cardano preceded a 236% rally, fueling optimism that a similar move could be underway. Speculation about a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September has also added momentum. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup project a cumulative 75-basis-point reduction by year-end, a scenario that typically encourages risk-on investments like cryptocurrencies. Adding to bullish sentiment, ADA’s price structure is tightening within a triangle pattern, with $0.98 marked as the key breakout level. A push above this threshold could unleash fresh buying pressure, while support at $0.89 remains crucial to sustaining the trend. ADA's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Can Cardano (ADA) Really Hit $10? While ADA’s near-term breakout potential looks promising, analysts caution that the ambitious $10 price target remains a long shot in this cycle. Crypto trader Crypto Patel notes that Cardano must first reclaim $1.10, then decisively break the heavy resistance at $2.90, a level that capped gains in the previous bull cycle. If ADA successfully clears those hurdles, the path toward $4–$5 becomes realistic, setting the stage for higher targets in the future. However, reaching $10 would require a 10x surge from current levels, pushing Cardano’s market cap above $300 billion, a feat dependent on widespread adoption, institutional inflows, and ecosystem growth.

Even if $10 remains aspirational, analysts agree that a climb toward $2.50–$3.00 in 2025 would already mark a significant achievement for Cardano investors.

According to market analyst MattMax, wallets holding 10,000 XRP have surged over 220% in the last five years, signaling growing confidence among mid-tier investors. The analyst added that the largest holders, those controlling more than 100,000 XRP, have not been left out because their positions rose by 120% over the same period. While institutional demand grabs headlines, the surge in XRP wallets highlights growing retail and mid-sized investor participation, as analysts note these holders are positioning for XRP’s expanding role in cross-border payments and corporate blockchain solutions. MattMax highlights that XRP wallet growth is driven by more than speculation. Widespread adoption by payment providers and financial institutions has cemented its credibility, positioning XRP as a key bridge currency and prompting both accumulation and long-term holding. Data shows mid-tier wallets holding 10,000 XRP have outpaced whales in growth, signaling that retail investors have become more agile since they are actively expanding their positions. This broader participation may strengthen market health and reduce volatility risks. Meanwhile, a single whale recently snapped up 19M XRP worth a whopping $61M on Upbit, sending traders scrambling to monitor order books and on-chain activity. WisdomTree Calls XRP a “Tactical Onshore Play” — A New Institutional Bet Crypto observer SMQKE has reported that WisdomTree has identified XRP as a ”tactical onshore play” for institutional portfolios. This strategic assessment underscores XRP's growing appeal among sophisticated investors seeking diversification and exposure to the evolving digital asset landscape. WisdomTree’s endorsement reflects XRP’s standout performance , including a 384% annual gain in July 2025, outpacing Bitcoin and Ethereum. Institutional demand drove the surge, with $946M inflows into European physical ETPs and $129M into U.S. synthetic ETFs, surpassing Ether and Solana. XRP’s utility as a payment solution boosts its institutional appeal. Designed for cross-border transactions, it settles in 3–5 seconds using a sustainable Proof-of-Association mechanism, making it a practical alternative to traditional finance. WisdomTree’s move underscores a growing trend among asset managers embracing digital assets. The launch of its Physical XRP ETP in Europe and the SEC filing for a spot XRP ETF reinforce XRP’s credibility as a mainstream investment. Conclusion XRP’s strong performance, practical utility, and institutional support cement its role as a strategic asset. As digital finance evolves, its position as a 'tactical onshore play' is set to draw growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, wallets holding 10,000 XRP have surged 220% over five years, while the largest holders with more than 100,000 XRP grew by 120%. This on-chain momentum points to a structural shift in XRP accumulation, potentially reshaping liquidity, price dynamics, and the narrative of who drives demand.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-20 06:00:08

In the latest development, the firm purchased 143,593 ETH over the past week, bringing its total digital asset holdings to over $3 billion. SharpLink Gaming Increases Ethereum Holdings, Again According to a statement issued today, Minneapolis-based SharpLink Gaming acquired 143,593 ETH between August 10 and August 17. The firm raised $537 million in net proceeds during the same period to finance the ETH purchase. Specifically, SharpLink Gaming raised $390 million through a registered direct offering, which closed on August 11. Another $146 million was raised through its at-the-market (ATM) facility over the past week. The company’s official announcement revealed that the latest cryptocurrency purchase had an average price of $4,648 per ETH – about 8% higher than the asset’s current market price. This acquisition increases SharpLink Gaming’s total holdings to 740,760 ETH. In addition, the firm’s total staking rewards – ETH earned as rewards for staking on the Ethereum network – have surged to 1,388 since launching its treasury strategy on June 2. Notably, SharpLink Gaming still has nearly $84 million available for further ETH acquisitions. Despite these sizable reserves, SharpLink Gaming remains behind BitMine Immersion Technologies in total ETH holdings. BitMine recently claimed the top spot for ETH treasury management globally and ranks as the second-largest crypto treasury overall. As of August 18, BitMine held ETH worth more than $6.6 billion, totaling over 1.5 million coins purchased at an average price of $4,326 per unit. The firm highlighted the GENIUS Act and the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Project Crypto as pivotal developments for the digital assets industry in 2025. Importance Of Favorable Crypto Regulations To recall, the GENIUS Act is the first US law regulating stablecoins, requiring them to be fully backed by liquid assets and subject to audits. It also prioritizes stablecoin holders in bankruptcy, ensuring claims on reserves are settled first. Meanwhile, Project Crypto is an SEC initiative to modernize securities rules for digital assets, offering clearer classifications, custody standards, and safe harbors. It also encourages tokenized markets and single-licensed “super-apps” for crypto services. Favorable regulations like the GENIUS Act and Project Crypto have established clearer legal frameworks, reducing uncertainty and encouraging institutional participation in the crypto market. This clarity has boosted investor confidence in Ethereum and other digital assets, attracting more capital and supporting broader adoption. That said, ETH may still experience temporary fluctuations before resuming its uptrend to new all-time highs, as recent data suggests hedge funds are shorting the digital asset. At press time, ETH trades at $4,195, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|BitMine|crypto|Cryptocurrency|ETH|Ether|Ethereum Adoption|ETHUSDT|GENIUS Act|Sharplink Gaming,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 06:00:21

Bowman said that the first thing he did after taking office was to remove supervisory guidelines to prevent banks from discriminating against customers on the grounds of “reputational risk.” “Banks can accept anyone engaged in lawful activities as a customer. There can be no discrimination based on business model, political views or any other reason,” Bowman said. Bowman also commented on crypto assets, stating that the Fed has disbanded the “innovation oversight group” it established two years ago and transferred its oversight expertise directly to the review teams of regional Fed banks. Bowman stated that with regulations passed by Congress, digital assets will be able to operate within a legal framework both within and outside the banking system. “I also want to encourage the industry to collaborate with regulators to help us understand the potential of blockchain and other solutions,” he said. “I am committed to changing our culture and attitudes around technology adoption and integration of new products and services.” Related News: South Korea Forced to Make Controversial Cryptocurrency Decision Following Recent Developments Speaking about capital regulations, Bowman stated that they have published a new proposal for a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which they aim to support, rather than restrict, banks' ability to operate in the Treasury market. He also noted that the Basel III compliance process has been completed in other countries, and added that the US will also consider international standards when developing its own framework. Bowman stated that changes will be made to the rating system of large banks, and that the four pillars of the capital adequacy framework, namely the stress capital buffer, the G-SIB additional liability, Basel III and leverage ratio regulations, will be addressed together. Bowman also spoke about criticism of the multi-headed regulatory structure in the US, stating that the current system is necessary for national and state banks, and that any possible change is within the authority of Congress. *This is not investment advice.

In his analysis, he emphasized that XRP remains in a higher high and higher low structure on the weekly timeframe, indicating that the broader trend still points upward despite recent volatility. According to his review, XRP is currently forming what appears to be a bullish continuation pattern, suggesting the possibility of another rally. Steph outlined his projected price targets using both trendline projections and Fibonacci extensions. Based on these calculations, he sees a potential resistance zone for XRP between $4 and $5, with $4.50 to $5 being the most critical range to monitor. He stressed that this move could represent a nearly 70% increase from current levels. However, he also highlighted a crucial support level. A trendline drawn from January’s highs through recent lows intersects near the $2.64 range, which aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. Steph explained that maintaining this support zone is vital, as a breakdown below it could indicate a bearish continuation. Historically, XRP has faced rejections at this level, most notably in May and December of the previous year, reinforcing its importance as a price floor. THIS IS WHY #XRP DUMPED! (watch within 24 hours) pic.twitter.com/vrCVQ7oVTj — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 19, 2025 Market Conditions, Investor Behavior, and Potential Catalysts Beyond technical chart patterns, Steph connected XRP’s prospects with broader market dynamics. He noted that inflation in the United States remains below the Federal Reserve’s two percent target, creating expectations for possible rate cuts in the coming months. According to him, this could bring short-term bullish momentum, though he warned that rate cut announcements may also trigger temporary “sell the news” reactions. Steph pointed to several on-chain and investor behavior metrics. The share of XRP holders in profit has decreased from 98.2 percent to around 93 percent, which he views as positive because it reduces excessive profit-taking pressure. At the same time, short-term XRP wallets — those active within the last three months — have nearly doubled, rising from 5.8 percent to 9.3 percent in just two weeks. He interpreted this as a sign of retail investors continuing to buy XRP at current levels, particularly around the $3 range. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 One concern he raised came from Google Trends data, which shows declining search interest for XRP compared to December highs. Despite XRP posting higher price levels since then, overall retail attention has fallen, which Steph identified as a bearish factor. In his view, while near-term price action could still support a move toward $4 to $5 , this lack of retail momentum should be considered a risk. Altcoin Performance and HBAR Outlook Steph also provided insights into the broader altcoin market. He referred to the Altcoin Season Index, which currently sits at 53, leaving room for further growth before historically reaching levels that trigger corrections. He argued that this supports the case for more gains in XRP and other altcoins in the near term. In addition to XRP, Steph analyzed Hedera (HBAR) against Bitcoin. He noted that HBAR historically outperformed Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021, with rallies exceeding 600%. He observed similar patterns unfolding in the current cycle, with HBAR already showing strong relative performance in 2024. Based on these comparisons, he suggested that HBAR could once again outperform Bitcoin in the coming weeks or months. Steph Is Crypto concluded his video by reiterating that XRP remains technically positioned for another rally, provided it maintains support above $2.64. His short-term target remains between $4 and $5, with resistance likely in that zone. While some indicators, such as reduced retail search interest, raise caution, he believes that both XRP and HBAR present significant opportunities under current market conditions.

One powerful indicator that reveals collective sentiment is the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios . This metric provides a clear snapshot of whether traders are predominantly betting on Bitcoin’s price to rise (long) or fall (short) over a specific period. It offers invaluable insights into the prevailing market mood, helping you make more informed decisions. What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Reveal? The long-short ratio is a simple yet effective tool. It measures the proportion of traders holding long positions versus those holding short positions in BTC perpetual futures contracts. A higher percentage of long positions suggests bullish sentiment, while a higher percentage of short positions indicates a bearish outlook. These ratios are particularly insightful because perpetual futures are popular trading instruments, reflecting a broad spectrum of speculative activity. Over the past 24 hours, the aggregated BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios across major cryptocurrency exchanges show a slight tilt towards short positions. Here is a detailed breakdown: Total Market: Long 49.47%, Short 50.53% This overall figure suggests a marginally bearish sentiment prevailing in the market, with slightly more traders anticipating a price decline than an increase. However, a closer look at individual exchanges reveals interesting variations. Analyzing Current BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Across Top Exchanges Examining the data from leading platforms provides a granular view of trader behavior. Each exchange caters to a slightly different demographic, and their aggregated ratios can sometimes diverge from the overall market trend, offering unique insights. Binance: Long 49.17%, Short 50.83% Bybit: Long 47.48%, Short 52.52% Gate.io: Long 51.06%, Short 48.94% Notice the distinct patterns. While Binance and Bybit reflect the overall slight bearish bias, with Bybit showing the strongest short conviction among the top three, Gate.io stands out. On Gate.io, long positions slightly outweigh short positions, indicating a more bullish outlook among its user base. This variance underscores the importance of not just looking at aggregated data, but also considering specific platform dynamics when evaluating BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios . How Can Traders Utilize BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios? Understanding these ratios is more than just knowing percentages; it’s about interpreting what they mean for your trading strategy. Traders often use this data as a contrarian indicator or as a confirmation tool. For instance, if the ratio is overwhelmingly long, some might interpret it as a sign of over-optimism, potentially preceding a price correction. Conversely, an extreme short bias could suggest an oversold market ripe for a rebound. Key takeaways for traders: Sentiment Confirmation: Use the ratios to confirm your existing market outlook. Contrarian Signals: Extreme deviations in BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios can sometimes signal potential reversals. Exchange-Specific Insights: Analyze individual exchange data to identify unique trading patterns or sentiment pockets. Remember, while these ratios are powerful, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Always combine them with other technical analysis tools and fundamental factors for a comprehensive market view. In conclusion, keeping an eye on BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios is a fundamental practice for anyone involved in Bitcoin trading. These ratios offer a transparent window into market sentiment, highlighting whether the crowd is leaning bullish or bearish. By understanding these dynamics across various exchanges, traders can refine their strategies and navigate the volatile crypto landscape with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay strategic! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios 1. What are BTC perpetual futures? BTC perpetual futures are derivatives contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, allowing positions to be held indefinitely. 2. How are long-short ratios calculated? Long-short ratios are calculated by dividing the total number or volume of long positions by the total number or volume of short positions on a given exchange or across multiple exchanges. This provides a percentage breakdown of bullish versus bearish sentiment. 3. What does a high long-short ratio indicate? A high long-short ratio, where long positions significantly outweigh short positions, indicates a predominantly bullish market sentiment. Traders are collectively betting on Bitcoin’s price to increase. 4. Can long-short ratios predict price movements? While BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios are a strong indicator of market sentiment, they are not a direct predictor of future price movements. They can offer insights into potential reversals (e.g., extreme ratios) but should always be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. 5. Which exchanges provide BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios data? Most major cryptocurrency exchanges that offer perpetual futures trading, such as Binance, Bybit, Gate.io, OKX, and others, provide data on their respective long-short ratios, often publicly accessible through their data APIs or analytics platforms.

50374306,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787962,1755670234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50374306.jpeg,Why Have Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) Fallen Out Of Favor – Does It Have Something To Do With This Viral Token?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-have-solana-sol-and-ripple-xrp-fallen-out-of-favor-does-it-have-something-to-do-with-this-viral-token/,"Solana and Ripple (XRP) are both well-known names in crypto, yet they’ve begun to lose their shine among traders and whales. Solana, once riding high, is now struggling to maintain support around $180–$200 and XRP is showing signs of investor fatigue. Meanwhile, a newcomer with real utility and clear milestones, which is widely known as a viral alternative, is drawing serious attention from smart money. This shift may explain why Solana and Ripple are slipping in favor. Solana: Once Hot, Now Cooling Off Solana’s price hasn’t held above $180, dropping about 1–2% recently and prompting some investors to eye $150 as support if selling continues. Despite healthy trading volume, technical indicators hint at hesitation, showing consolidation below key signals. Whales appear to be muting their bets on SOL. One major holder moved over 108,000 SOL to exchanges, which suggests profit-taking and rotation into safer or more promising bets. Experts say that the SOL price could retrace to about $160 soon . Ripple (XRP): Volume Drops and Shifting Sentiment While XRP isn’t collapsing by any means, investor enthusiasm seems to be waning. Trading volumes have slipped and without fresh catalysts or use-case expansion, XRP is no longer the de facto pay-fi token it once was. As investors seek tokens with tangible utility and adoption roadmaps, XRP feels increasingly passé. However, experts have now noticed a symmetrical triangle forming on the daily chart. This is usually a bullish indicator. Remittix: The Viral Token That’s Drawing Capital Away A new, mobile-first crypto with real-world purpose is causing whales to pivot. Remittix delivers PayFi features such as low gas fees, fast cross-chain support and a utility-first design. With its Q3 wallet reveal and product roadmap, it’s positioning itself as the next-generation payments solution. Compared to Solana and Ripple, Remittix stands out through execution. SOL and XRP rely on legacy infrastructure, while Remittix offers real value: audited code, a vibrant community, and forward-focused development, which makes it a top DeFi project for 2025. Why Remittix Draws Attention Real-World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms Built for borderless payments with global reach Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch On top of this, Remittix has reached the $20 million+ fundraising mark. Following this milestone, the team has announced the first centralized exchange listing with Bitmart adding liquidity and exposure. Real Utility Wins Over Nostalgia: Get Set on Remittix Now As Solana and Ripple fade a bit from the spotlight, a smarter investment may lie in tokens built for everyday use. Remittix isn’t just hype, it’s delivering tech, a real product and a path to mass adoption. With a forthcoming Q3 wallet launch, $250,000 giveaway and a major CEX listing on the cards, it’s a project with traction and real world change. If you’re searching for the next big altcoin 2025, a low-cap crypto gem or a crypto with real utility, Remittix deserves your attention, especially before its visibility hits mainstream levels.

The answer might not be a legacy altcoin but a brand new Ethereum Layer 2 meme token. Experts are already projecting that $LBRETT could explode by 200x , positioning it as the next big crypto. While established networks like Solana and Ripple have captured headlines in the past, a new player in the crypto presale space is poised to take their place. Layer Brett isn’t just a community-driven project; it’s a technological leap forward, blending viral culture with real blockchain utility. Solana’s Past Woes Put Layer Brett in a Different League For a while, Solana was seen as the “Ethereum killer,” but its reign has been marked by repeated outages and network instability. A blockchain that goes down isn’t a long-term investment, no matter how fast it claims to be. This is where Layer Brett completely changes the game. Unlike Solana, which is running on a fairly congested network, Layer Brett has an Ethereum Layer 2 core, gaining Ethereum security and decentralization. At the same time it can escape the slow speeds and high gas fees that plague the main network. Its design allows for lightning-fast transactions, making it a truly scalable alternative to networks like Solana. Why Layer Brett is Poised to Overtake Ripple Long-time crypto investors are familiar with Ripple, a project that has been mired in regulatory uncertainty for years. The long-running SEC legal battle has put a ceiling on Ripple’s growth potential, limiting its ability to attract new users and compete with modern, decentralized projects. This is where the true promise of $LBRETT shines. Unlike Ripple, Layer Brett is completely decentralized, self-custodial, and operates with no KYC. The community has full control. Because Layer Brett has a much smaller market cap than Ripple, it has far greater opportunity for explosive growth and could be one of the top gainers of the next bull run. Layer Brett: The Best Crypto to Buy Now Why are so many investors flocking to this new crypto coin? The answer lies in its unique value proposition: it’s a meme token with substance. While projects like Pepe and Shiba Inu rely purely on hype, Layer Brett provides real utility. It’s an escape from the utility-free origins of the original Brett, offering a powerful staking mechanism. Early buyers in the crypto presale can immediately stake their tokens and earn a massive 7500% APY, rewarding them for their early support. This blend of fun and function is what makes $LBRETT a top contender for the best crypto to buy now. The Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Next 100x Altcoin The opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a truly innovative project is rare. While legacy tokens like Solana and Ripple may be household names, they are unlikely to deliver the life-changing gains many investors seek. Layer Brett offers a fresh path forward, combining the speed of a top-tier Layer 2 blockchain with the viral power of a meme coin. With its presale underway and a rapidly growing community, the window to get in at a low price is closing. Don’t miss your chance to be a part of the next big crypto. Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

Amidst this downturn, savvy investors are looking for hidden gems poised for a rebound. This article explores which digital asset is showing promise amid the current turbulence, offering insights into potential growth opportunities in a struggling market. SPX6900 Price Trends: Short-Term Dips Against Long-Term Gains SPX6900 experienced a one-month decline of around 16% alongside a steep one-week drop nearing 24%. However, a six-month performance surge of 139% highlights a significant reversal. This historical movement shows a clear contrast between short-term weakness and a robust long-term rally. Price action during this period fluctuated within a defined band, reflecting both vulnerability in the immediate term and resilience over the past six months. Current trading levels place SPX6900 within a range of approximately $1.03 to $2.26. Key support is around $0.44, while immediate resistance is near $2.89, with a further barrier at about $4.11. Price indicators suggest bears are asserting pressure, with a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator and an RSI close to 41. No strong trend has been established, leaving the market in a balancing act. Traders might target buying opportunities near support with tight stop-loss measures, while selling as price nears resistance could be wise if bullish signals fail to appear. Breaking above $2.89 may signal renewed momentum, while a dip below $0.44 might intensify bearish control. Ethena Price Action: Recent Gains Amid Short-Term Corrections Ethena surged by nearly 76% over the past month, reversing a one-week decline of roughly 14%. This reflects a dynamic interplay of recovery and brief pullbacks. Over the six-month period, the coin rose by about 63%, indicating a broader upward trend despite intermittent corrections. Historical performance reveals a volatile path where significant month-long gains coexist with short-term setbacks, offering a mixed picture of market sentiment. Recent technical assessments highlight rapid escalations followed by brief pullbacks that contribute to its unpredictable character. Currently, Ethena trades within a price band of approximately $0.31 to $0.76 with key levels attracting attention from traders. The nearest resistance is around $0.96, while support sits near $0.05. Price action shows neither a clear bullish trend nor an outright bearish slide. Technical indicators present a mixed story; the RSI reading slightly above the midpoint hints at modest strength, while oscillators signal caution. A breakout above $0.96 could renew bullish confidence, potentially targeting $1.41, while failure to maintain momentum might lead to retractions and lower entry points. Monitoring price behavior near resistance and volume shifts can aid short-term trades. Cronos: Price Trends and Key Levels Reveal Bullish Potential Cronos experienced varied movement over the recent month with a notable increase of 24.54% that contrasted a sharper gain of 73.97% over the past six months. A brief downturn occurred over the last week, falling by 10.27%, which tempered the overall upward momentum. Price changes have revealed alternating phases of retracement and accumulation as traders capitalized on intermittent dips while riding the longer-term surge. The steady climb over the half-year period suggests growing interest among investors as the asset moved higher from its earlier price levels. The coin currently trades within a defined range with values between $0.0957 and $0.1664, anchored by key support at $0.0522 and facing immediate resistance at $0.1936. Indicators show a careful balance; the RSI at 53.78 suggests the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The market indicates sideways movement with moments of brief bullish advances and pullbacks. Bulls are pushing the price toward resistance levels, yet bears have maintained enough presence to check any rapid ascent. Trading strategies might focus on acquiring positions near the support of $0.0522, aiming for gains as the price nears $0.1936, or considering short positions if a breakout fails. Conclusion SPX shows steady performance even in tough times, making it a strong option. ENA offers innovative features and a loyal community, adding to its appeal. CRO has strategic partnerships that give it a solid foundation. Diversifying investments among these three could be a wise move. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Both Avalanche and Fantom offer unique advantages in the crypto landscape. Investors constantly seek tokens with the potential for long-term growth. This article examines the key factors that may influence these two blockchain tokens' future, providing insights into their viability and growth prospects. Avalanche Price Trends Highlight Key Levels and Market Steadiness Avalanche showed a steady increase over the past month with a 2.02% gain and maintained a slight upward change of 1.96% over the past six months. Price movement remained stable despite minor fluctuations, reflecting a market that has been quietly building strength. The coin experienced limited volatility, with weekly performance hinting at emerging activity. Overall, the historical data points to a coin that has maintained a consistent, if modest, upward trend through recent months. Current price situation shows the coin trading within a range of approximately $17 to $28. The nearest resistance sits around $32 while the nearest support is near $12, with a secondary resistance at $43 and a second support close to $2. Price action remains relatively balanced and moderately steady despite small upward movements in recent weeks. Bulls demonstrate minor control with small but consistent gains, yet bears continue to influence price stability, making the overall trend uncertain. Trading ideas include monitoring a break above $32 for a potential bullish surge towards $43, or a drop below $12 that could signal further losses. Fantom FTM: Dynamic Movements and Level-Based Trading Insights Fantom 's price journey over the past month has shown moderate fluctuations, highlighting market uncertainty. In the previous six months, the coin experienced various back-and-forth actions, with modest rallies followed by steady corrections. The price has exhibited range-bound behavior, featuring intermittent upward momentum amid cautious optimism and pullbacks from traders. Technical indicators during these times indicated mixed sentiment, as small gains were often countered by adjustments, leaving the overall trend somewhat indecisive. While there were moments of bullish energy, the coin primarily remained within a limited range without a definitive direction. The current price action places Fantom in a tight range where key support and resistance levels are crucial. The price is hovering around a critical support zone that has been tested multiple times, while resistance levels hinder upward movement. Bulls have made attempts to push toward the upper level, but selling pressure has halted breakout efforts. A clear trend has yet to emerge, as the coin struggles to maintain above support or fall below resistance. Trading ideas should focus on observing these zones, considering short-term buying opportunities on a secure bounce from support, while maintaining caution if resistance is convincingly breached. Both bulls and bears are actively influencing the market, necessitating careful monitoring of volume and momentum for informed trading decisions. Conclusion Both AVAX and FTM have unique strengths that appeal to different types of investors. AVAX offers benefits in transaction speed and energy efficiency. FTM stands out for its focus on decentralized applications and strong developer community. The choice between them depends on investment goals and risk tolerance. Holding either token long-term has potential, but careful analysis of market trends and developments is crucial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

50376548,560789,1755674236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50376548.jpeg,3 Meme Coins DeepSeek Predicts Could Deliver Massive Moonshots,https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-deepseek-predicts-could-deliver-massive-moonshots/,"While mainstream cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano have all enjoyed strong rallies over the past month, capital is now flowing aggressively into meme coins. The result? A wave of double- and even triple-digit gainers in recent days , hinting that meme coin season may only just be getting started. To help you make the most of this potentially explosive rally, we turned to DeepSeek, aka the internet’s ultimate hype tracker. After all, in a market driven by memes, social buzz, and online frenzy, who better than an AI plugged into the nonstop chatter of Reddit, X, and beyond? Keep reading to discover DeepSeek’s top three picks for the best meme coins to buy now , along with what they bring to the table and the massive returns they could deliver. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – First True Layer 2 Supercharging Bitcoin’s Speed and Utility Don’t let Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ’s Pepe-inspired mascot fool you. While many tokens borrow from the Pepe meme playbook, Bitcoin Hyper is no ordinary copycat. Its golden-suited, always-on-the-run Pepe might symbolize its Bitcoin association, but what truly sets Hyper apart is its mission to build the first-ever high-speed, low-cost Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. Bitcoin, for all its status as the OG blockchain, still processes just 7 transactions per second, falling far behind modern chains like Solana and Ethereum that can handle thousands. This lack of speed, scalability, and Web3 compatibility has long been Bitcoin’s Achilles’ heel. $HYPER aims to change that. Think of it as a fast side lane built onto a jammed expressway. Hyper’s Layer 2 reduces fees, accelerates speeds, and finally gives developers the ability to build smart contracts and decentralized applications on Bitcoin. $HYPER’s secret weapon? Integration with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), bringing Solana-grade performance and Web3 functionality directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. But how do you actually get your ‘car’ onto that side lane? That’s where Hyper’s non-custodial canonical bridge comes in. This decentralized bridge allows users to seamlessly convert their native Bitcoin into Layer 2-compatible tokens. Once across, those tokens can interact with Hyper’s SVM-powered environment, including high-speed DeFi trading apps, NFT platforms, DAOs, gaming, lending, staking, and more. Even better? According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could rocket over 400% by year-end, potentially hitting $0.32. The project is currently in presale, where it has already amassed a whopping $10.8M. And you can buy $HYPER for just $0.012765 if you get in now. For more information, visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Fierce Meme Coin Built on Pure Degen Energy Maxi Doge ($MAXI) stands out as a top choice if you’re looking to supercharge your crypto portfolio with the best chance at life-changing returns this cycle. What drives Maxi isn’t a flashy roadmap or some forced ‘utility’ narrative. Instead, it thrives on raw, degen-powered hype, which is the very force that has delivered the biggest gains in the meme coin industry. Maxi’s backstory is one of madness and rebellion. While Dogecoin, Maxi’s distant cousin, enjoyed all the love and attention as the legendary, adorable meme mascot, Maxi was left in the shadows. Fueled by rage and determination, Maxi hit the gym and transformed into everything Doge is not: a shredded, caffeine-fueled Shiba Inu who never sleeps, trades nonstop, and wields a candlestick lightsaber to fight off mediocre returns. The community quickly rallied around his philosophy of ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump,’ helping the project raise over $1.28M in early investor funding just weeks into its presale. But Maxi isn’t all bark. The developers have laid out an aggressive marketing plan, allocating 40% of the token supply to PR, campaigns, and ads, all aimed at making $MAXI a top trending crypto and a true challenger to Dogecoin’s dominance. On top of that, holders will enjoy weekly trading competitions, leaderboard rewards, and exclusive community perks to keep engagement high. Maxi Doge won’t stop at basic CEX and DEX listings. The team is also pushing for futures listings, giving hardcore $MAXI holders the chance to go full throttle with high leverage and chase mind-boggling returns. Currently, each token is available for just $0.000253, and here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy Maxi Doge . Visit $MAXI’s official website for more information. 3. TROLL ($TROLL) – The Meme Coin That Turned Internet’s Chaotic Culture Into 700%+ Gains TROLL ($TROLL) has been one of the most dominant meme coins in recent weeks, surging more than 700% in the past 30 days . And while those gains are already mind-boggling, a quick look at its chart suggests its monstrous rally may be far from over. The token is currently consolidating inside a clean triangle pattern, supported by an upward-sloping trendline at the bottom and capped by a descending resistance line at the top, a breakout above which looks highly likely. Such a move could easily push $TROLL to new all-time highs, delivering at least a 40-50% rally from current levels, if not more, especially with the meme coin frenzy only just beginning to take full throttle. So what exactly is TROLL? As the name suggests, it’s a pure meme coin built on the internet phenomenon of trolling – making fun of anyone and everyone, from government officials and celebrities to everyday people. It’s worth noting that trolling isn’t inherently good or bad; it’s simply part of the internet’s chaotic culture. And for crypto degens, a little controversy goes a long way. That’s why $TROLL has resonated so strongly with the community, driving massive inflows of capital. Currently priced around $0.1822, $TROLL has already sparked calls for it to reach $1 ahead of a potential Binance listing. If that plays out, today’s ‘discounted’ entry could set you up for truly massive returns. Conclusion In our quest to find the next 1000x crypto , we turned to DeepSeek, and it delivered a strong mix of utility-driven meme coins and pure hype plays. From $TROLL’s proven gains to $HYPER and $MAXI ’s explosive presale momentum, each has already captured the market’s fancy and could be poised for even bigger moves ahead. That said, keep in mind that the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. None of the above is financial advice, so please do your own research before investing.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 07:17:16

Promising altcoins like Arbitrum , UNI , AAVE , and LTC show strong signs of being poised for significant gains. This article delves into why these digital assets are on the radar for 2025 supremacy, offering insights into what could make them stellar investments. Arbitrum Price Surge: Bulls Eye Key Support and Resistance Levels ARB price performance shows a steady upward push with gains of around 15% over the last month and roughly 13% in the past six months, reflecting a persistent trend. A weekly jump of nearly 12% adds to a picture of growing momentum and price stability. The asset has traded in a range between $0.30 and $0.50, indicating strength across different periods. Consistent rallies have bolstered confidence among buyers, while periods of consolidation have kept volatility in check, reinforcing overall bullish sentiment. Current price conditions present a notable stage where technical levels influence potential moves. Immediate resistance at $0.60 and secondary resistance at $0.80 offer clear upper targets for traders, while strong support is visible at $0.21 with an additional cushion near $0.14. Technical indicators such as the RSI near 59 suggest growing bullish participation, although market participants await confirmatory signals. Price action in the $0.30 to $0.50 range provides a stable base, with a successful push above $0.60 signaling potential upward momentum. This environment encourages traders to consider accumulation on dips, especially when testing support levels. Monitoring these levels with disciplined risk management is crucial for capturing opportunities in this evolving market. Uniswap Price Trends: Steady Gains over 1 Month and 6 Months During the past month, UNI posted a 4.77% rise while advancing about 10.18% over six months. A slight weekly drop of nearly 2.90% introduced short-term caution amid a generally upward trend. The price fluctuated between roughly $6.68 and $11.87 during this period, indicating growth despite brief corrections. This showed a market adjusting to minor volatility with mixed trading sentiment. The coin managed to gain over time, highlighting the consistent demand that drives UNI steadily upward. The current price hovers just above $6.68 and around $11.87, with nearby resistance at approximately $14.38 and strong support near $4.00. Bulls display some dominance given the moving average's modestly positive suggestion, although bears are also present with negative momentum signals. The relative strength index at 52.61 indicates a neutral zone, suggesting caution. Traders might focus on price behavior as it approaches the $14.38 resistance while monitoring the $4.00 support zone for bounce opportunities. Positions could be taken with careful stops to evaluate if minor gains can develop into a sustained uptrend or if selling pressure persists. Aave Price Dynamics: Balancing Support and Resistance Aave showed a 9.16% decline over the past month with a noticeable dip in short-term performance. Over the last six months, the coin rebounded by 18.25%, showcasing a recovery that contrasts with the near-term downward trend. Price action during these periods reveals volatility tempered by a broader upward movement. This movement highlights an environment where short dips coexist with potential long-term gains. The current trading range for Aave sits between $233.02 and $313.73, with resistance at $366.30 and a second level at $447.01. Support is found at $204.88 and a secondary level at $124.17. Market indicators show a balanced view, with an RSI of 50.182 and an Awesome Oscillator reading of 9.578. Price action is range-bound, without a clear trend. A dip toward $204.88 may present buying opportunities, while a break above $366.30 could renew bullish momentum. Short-term caution is advised following a recent weekly drop of 3.72%. Traders should monitor these levels for setting stops and assessing breakout potential. Uptrend Amid Volatility in Litecoin’s Market Movement Litecoin experienced a notable rise over the past month with a 16.25% gain while enduring a slight weekly pullback of about 4.37%. Over the half-year period, the coin’s performance trailed with an 8.83% decline, reflecting volatility and mixed sentiment. Price swings suggest cautious optimism among traders as upward movements contrast with longer-term downward pressure. These fluctuations highlight a coin in transition, balancing renewed buying interest against ongoing market challenges. Currently, Litecoin trades within a range of approximately $84.89 to $124.79, with resistance near $143.50 and support around $63.72. The market appears balanced, with mixed signals from price indicators. The Relative Strength Index at 52.32 indicates neutral conditions, while the Awesome Oscillator at 5.85 shows slight bullish activity, countered by a Momentum Indicator of -5.31. Bulls may push toward first resistance if buying sustains; otherwise, a dip could reinforce bearish sentiment. Additional levels at $183.40 and $23.82 mark further resistance and support. Trading ideas could focus on buy zones near support and exits as resistance approaches. Conclusion ARB , UNI , AAVE , and LTC each hold unique promises for growth by 2025. ARB offers a fresh perspective on decentralized finance. UNI is poised with strong fundamentals and an active governance model. AAVE continues to innovate in the lending sector, providing diverse options for users. LTC remains a reliable choice with its established history and ongoing development. Together, these coins present compelling opportunities for those looking toward the future market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Among the contenders, Cosmos and Polkadot stand out. This analysis will uncover which of these two has the potential for remarkable growth this bull run, providing insights into their strengths and where they might lead the market. Cosmos (ATOM) Market Pulse: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels Cosmos experienced a moderate decline over the past month, with prices falling about 7.42%. The coin recorded a slight drop of 1.33% over the past six months. Price action over the last week showed a dip of roughly 3.27%, indicating short-term bearish pressure. Technical indicators reflected this performance, with oscillators and momentum indicators delivering negative readings, hinting at reduced buying strength. While there has been a walk-back in price, the coin has remained within a defined trading range, indicating a market in careful balance between bullish optimism and bearish caution. The trends hint at typical volatility during early altcoin seasons. Current trading sees Cosmos priced between $3.64 and $5.06, with strong support near $3.07 and secondary support at $1.66. Resistance appears at $5.90 and further at $7.31. Oscillators, such as the Awesome Oscillator at -0.048 and Momentum Indicator at -0.089, along with an RSI near 48.92, suggest that bears currently hold influence in this range without clear trending momentum. Traders might consider buying near the support zone for a potential bounce or shorting if price action rejects resistance. Attention to these levels can help guide entries and exits as the market awaits a decisive move. Polkadot Price Update: Key Levels Amid Recent Downtrends Polkadot experienced a steady decline recently, with a one-month drop of nearly 7% and a decline of about 17% over the last six months. Price movement shows a subdued performance as the coin traded between roughly $3.00 and $4.50. The downward trend over the extended period reflects a market environment that has been less favorable, suggesting caution among traders. The price action in these periods indicates that pressure has been consistent, with declines that highlight the challenges faced by the coin in maintaining upward momentum. The current price situation places Polkadot within a range of approximately $3.00 to $4.50. A support level is identified near $2.44, and a second support area exists around $1.00, while resistance is noted near $5.30 with an additional hurdle at nearly $6.73. Technical indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum show slight negatives, and the Relative Strength Index hovers just above neutral, indicating bearish pressure despite a lack of a clear trend direction. Trading ideas could involve monitoring these key levels closely, considering entry points near support if momentum reverses, or planning exits near resistance. The mixed signals suggest that traders should remain cautious and look for a decisive breakout before committing to larger positions. Conclusion ATOM and DOT each have unique strengths in the crypto space. ATOM focuses on ease of connection for different blockchains. DOT emphasizes security and a shared protocol. Both have promising futures, but their success will depend on user adoption and technological advancements. Investors should closely monitor developments in these platforms to make informed decisions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Analysts forecast a significant rise in their value by 2025. Discover the leading contenders poised for growth in the current market landscape. This article unveils the top choices that could offer substantial returns. Stay tuned to find out which coins are primed for impressive gains. Chainlink Steady Momentum with Defined Support and Resistance Chainlink recorded notable gains recently with a one-month increase of 43.46% and a six-month gain of 43.36%. Price levels moved within a range of $13 to $20.55. The weekly change of 16.30% adds to the picture of robust performance over short and medium terms. An impressive monthly advance reflects growing investor interest, while the overall price behavior signals stability and confident market sentiment. The current price action situates LINK in a delicate battleground between bulls and bears. The price currently fluctuates between $13 at its lower edge to $20.55 toward the higher side. Immediate resistance is detected at $24.18, with a second barrier at $31.71. A firm support level exists near $9.12 backed by further cushioning around $1.58. Despite strong bullish activity, the Relative Strength Index at 71.07 indicates the coin might be nearing overbought territory. Traders can expect buyers to push for gains, yet cautious signals from oscillators suggest the upward trend is not firmly set. Strategies may include buying near support and selling at the first resistance. Injective Growth: Steady Gains and Key Levels Sustain Optimism Recent price movements show a 7.69% one-month gain and a 6.02% increase over the past six months. A modest 2.33% rise in the past week reflects a gradual climb in value. Price stability during this period emphasizes a consistent upward movement. Historical trends hint at strong buying interest, with market performance showcasing sustained growth without extreme volatility. Injective currently trades within a range of $10.08 to $16.35, with support at $6.94 and resistance around $19.49. A secondary support at $0.67 and additional resistance near $25.76 shape the coin’s technical outlook. The relative strength index at 53.47 indicates balance, with neither bulls nor bears dominating. Indicators suggest slight bullish sentiment, yet a clear trend is lacking. Traders may consider buying near support levels and planning exits at resistance points, managing positions with tight stops to account for possible shifts in market sentiment. IOTA Price Analysis: Past Volatility and Current Key Trading Levels IOTA experienced a noticeable decline during recent periods with a monthly drop of roughly 10.57% and a six-month decrease of about 6.01%. Weekly performance showed a mild decrease of nearly 0.92%, reflecting uneven moves within a trading range of approximately $0.1391 to $0.2475. Price behavior indicates selling pressure has been present, although occasional recoveries have kept it trading within defined levels. Fluctuations during these periods have set the stage for the current market outlook and highlighted the importance of key technical levels for traders. The current price sits inside a range bounded by support at $0.0895 and resistance at $0.3063, with a secondary resistance noted at $0.4147. Technical indicators show an RSI at 51.80 and a slightly bearish Oscillator reading, suggesting a market without a clear trend. Bears have a slight edge as recent declines continue, yet near-neutral momentum allows for potential bullish pushes if stability is found. Trading strategies may involve testing the lower support for rebounds or taking profits at resistance, with careful monitoring of price reactions at these key levels to manage risk effectively. Conclusion In 2025, several cryptocurrencies show strong potential for growth. LINK is gaining attention for its practical applications. INJ is making headway in decentralized finance. IOTA stands out with its focus on improving technology. These coins are positioned to perform well in the current market conditions.

Demand is significantly outpacing supply.” Related News: Bitcoin Price Drops to $113,000 - Analysis Company Shares Report on What May Happen Next Describing the institutional interest in the cryptocurrency market as “transformative,” Scaramucci reminded that Bitcoin production is limited to only 450 units per day, stating that the supply-demand balance supports the price. Scaramucci also addressed stablecoins, saying he welcomed the state of Wyoming's announcement of its own stablecoin project. He stated that stablecoins would increase demand for the US dollar and provide an alternative to intermediaries like credit cards in payment systems. However, Scaramucci expressed his disapproval of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), arguing that they could be “too intrusive and compromise privacy.” *This is not investment advice.

This strategic decision further solidifies their position in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, demonstrating a bold vision for corporate treasury management. What Does This Latest H100 Group Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for the Market? The recent purchase saw H100 Group acquire an additional 102.19 Bitcoin (BTC). This acquisition was made at an average price of SEK 1,158,467.11, which translates to approximately $120,542 per BTC at the time of purchase. This specific detail, shared by crypto analyst NLNico on X, provides crucial transparency regarding the transaction. This isn’t just a simple purchase; it represents a continued and robust commitment to Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset for the company. This latest acquisition dramatically boosts their total holdings, bringing H100 Group’s cumulative Bitcoin reserves to a remarkable 911.29 BTC. Such a substantial accumulation highlights a clear, long-term strategy by the company’s leadership. It strongly suggests their unwavering confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and its increasing role in a diversified, forward-thinking corporate treasury. Why Are Leading Companies Like H100 Group Investing in Bitcoin? The trend of prominent companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is rapidly gaining momentum across various sectors. Several compelling factors drive this strategic shift towards digital assets: Inflation Hedge: Many financial experts view Bitcoin as a powerful hedge against rising inflation, offering a potential means to preserve purchasing power during periods of economic uncertainty. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin provides an innovative alternative asset class. Including it can diversify traditional investment portfolios and potentially reduce overall risk exposure by not solely relying on conventional assets. Significant Growth Potential: A strong belief persists among investors and corporations that Bitcoin holds substantial upside potential, offering potentially attractive returns compared to more traditional, lower-yield investments. Enhanced Transparency: For publicly traded entities like H100 Group, openly disclosing their H100 Group Bitcoin holdings fosters a high level of transparency that resonates positively with a growing segment of investors. For an innovative health-tech company such as H100 Group, this bold move also signals their commitment to innovation and demonstrates exceptionally forward-thinking leadership. They are not merely focused on pioneering health solutions but are also proactively securing their financial future through modern, adaptive asset management strategies. Navigating the Landscape: Benefits and Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Embracing Bitcoin as a significant corporate asset comes with a distinct set of promising benefits alongside notable challenges that require careful consideration. Key Benefits: Optimized Treasury Management: Holding Bitcoin can potentially yield significantly higher returns compared to traditional, low-interest cash holdings, thereby optimizing the company’s treasury. Market Pioneer Status: This strategy positions the company as a leader and early adopter in integrating cutting-edge financial technologies, enhancing its brand image. Attracting New Investors: Such a move can appeal to a new, tech-savvy segment of investors who are specifically interested in companies with exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Inherent Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and significant fluctuations, which directly impacts the company’s balance sheet valuations and financial reporting. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still developing, creating uncertainties and potential compliance risks for corporate holders. Robust Security Requirements: Safeguarding substantial amounts of Bitcoin necessitates the implementation of highly sophisticated and resilient security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Despite these inherent challenges, H100 Group’s consistent Bitcoin acquisition strategy strongly suggests that they have meticulously weighed these factors. They appear well-prepared and confident in their ability to effectively navigate the complexities associated with holding a volatile, yet potentially lucrative, digital asset. H100 Group’s latest H100 Group Bitcoin purchase is far more than a routine financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement of intent. It unequivocally reinforces the accelerating global trend of corporate adoption of digital assets and highlights a remarkably forward-thinking approach to treasury management. As more and more companies around the world explore and embark on this pioneering path, the institutional embrace of Bitcoin continues to profoundly shape the future of global finance.

He emphasized this point by sharing a document that explicitly mentions both assets as potential beneficiaries of SWIFT’s initiatives. His post read: “CONFIRMED: XRP AND HBAR WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM SWIFT’S LIVE DIGITAL ASSET TRIALS + ONGOING TRANSITION TO ISO 20022.” CONFIRMED: XRP AND HBAR WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM SWIFT’S LIVE DIGITAL ASSET TRIALS + ONGOING TRANSITION TO ISO 20022 Documented. https://t.co/QaoyOR4PQF pic.twitter.com/y04g5JoOyH — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 19, 2025 Details from the Attached Material The referenced document, published by Vanir Assets, explains how SWIFT has been working to connect its network of more than 11,500 financial institutions with blockchain-based assets, including stablecoins, tokenized currencies, and central bank digital currencies. It states that the next phase of these efforts will involve a shift from controlled testing to real-world implementation, working with banking partners in North America, Europe, and Asia. According to the document, participating banks will gain access to digital wallets for settlement, which would allow them to transfer tokenized cash and process payments through systems resembling blockchain architecture. It highlights features such as transaction costs similar to gas fees, shared pricing data, and token-based tracking as mechanisms to improve transparency and efficiency. In its section titled “Why It Matters,” the document notes that most digital asset networks currently operate in isolation, which limits their interaction with the banking sector. SWIFT is positioning itself as a central connector for seamless transactions between banks using both fiat currencies and digital assets. Importantly, the document specifies that “this development could also benefit crypto-related payment networks such as XRP and HBAR , known for fast, low-cost transfers.” It also references SWIFT’s migration to the ISO 20022 standard, which is described as a step that enhances the richness and usability of financial data across borders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for XRP and HBAR SMQKE interprets these references as confirmation that XRP and HBAR are directly aligned with SWIFT’s future developments . By citing the mention of the two assets in the document, he links them to both the real-world trials involving global banking partners and the broader adoption of ISO 20022. His focus is on the fact that this information is explicitly documented, presenting it as clear evidence that these networks stand to gain from SWIFT’s role in modernizing cross-border settlement infrastructure. The combination of live trials, participation from major banks across multiple regions, and the shift to a more advanced messaging standard forms the basis of SMQKE’s claim that XRP and HBAR are positioned to benefit from these ongoing developments.

Despite sell-offs, whales also accumulated $360M XRP during dips, showing ongoing demand and market interest. XRP trades at $2.89 as analysts warn of potential $2.70 support if selling continues. Market Pullback and Current Price The crypto market posted a slight pullback in the past 24 hours ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole. Traders are watching the event closely for policy signals. XRP was trading at $2.89 at press time, with a 24-hour volume of $6.74 billion. The token has lost 4% in the last day and 11% in the past week. The price action has narrowed after a rally in July pushed XRP above the $3.60 mark. Whale Selling and Exchange Flows Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that whales sold about 470 million XRP in the last ten days. On-chain data shows a steep drop in holdings by large wallets during this period, consistent with heavy distribution. Notably, the selling activity has been visible on exchanges. Inflows of XRP to Binance increased through late July and August. The largest transfers reached more than 100 million XRP at a time, coinciding with the shift in price momentum. As of press time, another 11.8 million XRP entered Binance, keeping pressure on the market. Source: CryptoQuant Before the current sell-offs, whale wallets were active on the buy side. Martinez noted that during the previous dip, they accumulated over $360 million worth of XRP. Earlier, they purchased about 320 million XRP, valued at nearly $1 billion, in a three-day span. Meanwhile, these moves suggest that whales remain a key driver of XRP’s supply and demand. Large purchases during periods of price weakness may provide support, while continued inflows to exchanges continue to weigh on short-term performance. Broader Market Outlook XRP has been trading against a backdrop of legal clarity after Ripple’s settlement with the US SEC and recent regulatory measures from the Trump administration. With those developments now absorbed into the market, investors are focused on whale flows and macroeconomic events. Analysts note that if selling continues, XRP could test the $2.70–$2.50 range. If accumulation gains pace and exchange inflows ease, the token may stabilize. Analyst Galaxy added that XRP has been in a five-year accumulation phase against Bitcoin, pointing to potential changes when that cycle ends.

Bitcoin fell below $113,000 to its lowest level for 17 days while Ethereum dipped below $4,100, eroding all of last week’s gains. The market sell-off is in preparation for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday, and is “essentially pricing in a hawkish tone,” said Bitcoin author Jason Williams on Wednesday. Crypto Markets Seeking Confirmation He added that markets now believe rate cuts are no longer a guarantee for September, and if Powell hints that they may not be implemented, the bearishness will likely continue. However, “if Powell comes in soft and leans that rate cuts are likely, we turbo rip,” he said. If there are no rate reductions for September, “it’ll be an ugly 4-6 weeks until we have clarity for October potential cuts.” “Market HATES uncertainty and we are seeing that in the price action right now.” The probability of a Sept. 17 rate cut is still a high 85% according to the CME Fed Watch Tool, which is based on futures markets. However, this could drop sharply if Powell is hawkish on Friday. President Trump, who has been highly critical of the central bank chair, calling him “too late,” said, “There is no inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major rate cut.” BREAKING: President Trump asks for somebody to “inform Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell that he is hurting the housing industry.” pic.twitter.com/jJY4lMg22J — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 19, 2025 “We are in this uncomfortable equilibrium, where we don’t know where things go next,” Gennadiy Goldberg, chief rates strategist at TD Securities, told the Financial Times on Tuesday. “The market wants a bit of confirmation from Powell on Friday as to whether he is open to cutting rates.” A lower interest rate environment means cheaper borrowing and more liquidity available for risk-on assets such as cryptocurrencies. Crypto Sentiment Flickers Crypto sentiment is very volatile and flips in minutes, observed Bitcoin Magazine founder David Bailey, who said : “One of the most hilarious aspects of Bitcoin is sentiment. It flickers like a flame. One moment euphoria, moments later panic. Many Bitcoin have exchanged hands through such emotions.” Meanwhile, Santiment reported that retail traders have “done a complete 180 after Bitcoin has failed to rally and dipped below $113K.” It noted that the past 24 hours have marked the most “bearish sentiment seen on social media” since geopolitical conflict in the Middle East caused panic selling in late June. BTC had recovered slightly to trade at $113,520 at the time of writing as its next direction hinges on Friday’s Fed speech.

Xiaomi’s President, Lu Weibing, said the company’s business model in China could be applied globally, including in Europe. President Lu said the company’s quarterly revenue rose by 31%, riding on the success of its second EV, which was launched during the summer. He mentioned that this helped counter dwindling smartphone demand. However, Lu pointed out that the company was still researching European expansion to prepare for the 2027 entry. Xiaomi delivered more than 81K cars in Q2 2025 to set a new quarterly record, but it is still struggling to meet the domestic demand. The tech company also disclosed that it was concerned about the 48% tariff rate on its exports to Europe, including the base 10% import duty. The exports will also be subject to additional 35% to 38% countervailing levies. The EU imposed these measures in response to what it termed as unfair government subsidies given to Chinese EV manufacturers. Lu says there is no specific product plan yet President Lu said his company did not have a specific product plan yet, but research and preparations were underway for Europe’s expansion by 2027. However, he pointed out that the company’s EV division expects to become profitable in H2 2025 despite recording losses of up to 300 million Yuan (~$41.77M). Ford’s CEO Jim Farley acknowledged that Chinese EV makers like Xiaomi were far ahead in cost, in-car technology, and quality. According to the Cryptopolitan, Farley admitted that the affordability of Chinese EVs had disrupted the industry as their products slowly gained global recognition. President Lu shared a photo on Weibo on July 5, showing the SU7 Ultra with German license plates. He pointed out that this was his company’s first experimental EV to be registered in Europe. However, the founder, CEO, and Chairman of Xiaomi, Lei Jun, said on July 2 that the company would prioritize meeting domestic delivery demand before getting ready for overseas markets by 2027. The company is facing a severe shortage in the local market, with delivery wait times for the SU7 and the YU7 reaching 41 weeks and 58 weeks, respectively. Xiaomi’s EV division delivers over $2B in Q2 revenue According to Xiaomi’s financial report, the company’s EV business generated nearly $2.87 billion (~RMB 20.6B) in Q2 2025, a 13.81% increase from Q1 and a 232.26% increase YoY. The company’s gross margin was 26.4% in Q2, up from 23.2% in Q1 and about 15.4% in the same period in 2024. The company said it would continue advancing its human-car-home strategy despite recording operating losses of $41.2 million in Q2. However, President Lu believes his company’s auto business will turn profitable in H2 2026. The company has invested over RMB 30 billion (~$4.17B) in the past three years, and it hopes to build on the SU7’s market momentum to advance its automaking ambitions. Lu also explained that his company was not interested in price wars, saying that Xiaomi targeted total revenue growth of over 30% in 2025. The Cryptopolitan reported that Beijing stepped in to end the price wars in June, although demand for Xiaomi’s products was strong enough for the company to avoid the brutal price cut chaos that squeezed margins. The company’s overall net revenue almost doubled, cementing its position in the EV industry. Xiaomi’s market value has increased by over $120 billion over the past 12 months. The company aims to deliver 350K units by the end of 2025 and has so far achieved nearly 53% of its 2025 delivery goals. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently said he wanted to purchase a Xiaomi car since the Xiaomi CEO showed him the YU7 SUV back in June. Huang added that Xiaomi cars had beautiful designs and incredible technology.

The collaboration would allow clients to stake Bitcoin and CORE tokens to earn on-chain rewards, without selling their Bitcoin . “This partnership with Hex Trust is a significant step in unlocking Bitcoin’s utility for institutional clients,” said Hong Sun, Core’s Institutional Contributor. “Together, we are accelerating the adoption of Bitcoin yield strategies and creating a more robust and sustainable ecosystem for Bitcoin DeFi.” BTC Staking Expands to APAC, MENA Regions The partnership follows recent Core’s expansion of dual Bitcoin staking in Asia . The firm teamed up with Singapore-based custodian Cobo in May to widen its institutional reach. As of April, Core has surpassed $260 million in dual-staked assets as institutional interest in Bitcoin-based DeFi continues to grow. Further, there has been a strong demand for Bitcoin staking among institutional players. A new study from Maestro noted that staking has emerged as the “core engine of BitcoinFi,” locking up more than 68,500 bitcoins (BTC) for a total value locked (TVL) of $7.39 billion. With Hex and Core’s mutual integration, APAC and MENA-based institutional clients get direct and fully secured access to start generating rewards on their Bitcoin holdings. Additionally, institutions can confidently access sustainable Bitcoin rewards while maintaining full control and security over their assets. “Through our fully licensed infrastructure, we’re delivering secure, high-quality staking solutions for institutions and family offices across the APAC and MENA regions,” said Calvin Shen, Chief Commercial Officer, Hex Trust.

The sudden sell-off followed an extended rally to new all-time highs above $124,000 last week, raising fears of a deeper correction toward the $110,000 support zone. Data from CoinGlass revealed that long positions accounted for the majority of the liquidations, highlighting the overleveraged state of the market. More than 60% of BTC/USDT perpetual contracts remain long-biased, leaving traders exposed to cascading liquidation risks if prices fall further. Bitcoin Technical Patterns Signal Bearish Breakdown Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a rising wedge formation, a pattern often preceding bearish reversals. Analysts warn that a breakdown from this structure could send BTC tumbling as low as $88,000, nearly 26% below current levels. On the daily chart , BTC also completed a double-top pattern at $123,000 with a neckline near $112,000. A sustained move below this neckline could target the $101,000 zone, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Adding to the caution, Bitcoin’s RSI has formed a descending channel, indicating weakening momentum despite recent price gains. Fed Policy and Institutional Buying in Focus Beyond technicals, Bitcoin’s trajectory hinges on upcoming Federal Reserve events. Investors are closely watching the release of Fed minutes and Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium. A hawkish tone from Powell could dampen hopes for a September rate cut, potentially accelerating Bitcoin’s decline. Still, institutional accumulation remains strong. Tokyo-based Metaplanet recently added 775 BTC worth $93 million, while Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased 430 BTC for $51 million. Bitcoin ETFs also saw $547 million in inflows last week, showing ongoing institutional interest even as volatility rises. Could BTC Test $110K Next? While some market watchers view the pullback as healthy consolidation, others warn of a flash crash scenario fueled by excessive leverage and false bullish signals. If bearish patterns play out, Bitcoin could retest $110,000 or lower in the near term, especially if macroeconomic headwinds persist. For now, Bitcoin trades around $115,000, with the next decisive move likely tied to Fed policy updates and investor appetite for risk.

The current conversation among banks centers on how to run a regulated, always-on infrastructure that satisfies strict controls. Ripple, which is already making waves in the custody market with its institutional-grade custody solutions , recently referenced a report that the tokenization market is expected to reach $18.9 trillion by 2033 . The company plans to dominate that market with XRP, and members of the XRP army are excited as they anticipate massive growth for the digital asset. How High Can XRP Go If Ripple Dominates the Tokenization Market Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives), a crypto influencer on X, tied the above opportunity to a clear price path for XRP. Referencing a prediction from ChatGPT, he outlined XRP’s trajectory if the asset can capture the entire $18.9 trillion tokenization market. Digital Perspective’s price prediction lists $10.40 for 2026, $18.00 for 2027, $31.30 for 2028, $54.20 for 2029, $94.00 for 2030, $118.60 for 2031, and $149.70 for 2032, with a final target of $189.00 for 2033. The real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market holds many significant benefits for XRP . This price trajectory shows how much it can grow based on its market dominance. If Ripple tokenize all $18.9 Trillion this is the price appreciation according to ChatGPT. | Year | XRP Price | |——|———–| | 2026 | $10.40 | | 2027 | $18.00 | | 2028 | $31.30 | | 2029 | $54.20 | | 2030 | $94.00 | | 2031 | $118.60 | | 2032 | $149.70 | | 2033 |… https://t.co/WKRKWTPnV8 — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) August 19, 2025 The Roadmap to Triple Digits The projections Digital Perspectives shared outline more than just ambitious figures. It suggests steady momentum over the next few years, expecting double-digit prices next year, before ultimately crossing into the triple-digit range by 2030. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What makes the forecast notable is not just the final number but the implied pace of adoption required to support it. This trajectory suggests institutional tokenization and settlement would need to accelerate significantly between 2026 and 2033, with each year marking deeper integration of tokenized real-world assets and XRP playing a significant role in the market’s evolution. Ripple currently has multiple RWA tokenization projects using XRP across the globe, and as its influence grows in this market, the digital asset’s price is expected to climb. Digital Perspective’s roadmap illustrates what XRP could look like if it captures this entire market. As institutional custody and tokenization infrastructure advance, the possibility of XRP reaching the levels he outlined will remain a central point of interest for investors through 2033.

Key Takeaways: Robinhood sued Nevada and New Jersey regulators, alleging they blocked its event contracts despite federal rulings favoring Kalshi. The company argues regulators are ignoring court orders, creating an uneven playing field in the sports event contracts market. Robinhood is seeking court orders and temporary restraining orders to prevent enforcement actions while its lawsuits proceed. In complaints filed Tuesday , Robinhood said it began offering event contracts in both states after federal judges ruled earlier this year that Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulators could not enforce their bans against Kalshi, which offers contracts regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Robinhood Claims Regulators Creating Uneven Playing Field Robinhood argued that regulators have ignored those rulings and continued to threaten enforcement action, creating an uneven playing field. “If state regulators are permitted to act against Robinhood but not Kalshi, then Robinhood will lose out in the sports event contracts space,” the company said in its filings. The lawsuits follow Kalshi’s own legal battles earlier this year. The prediction market sued both states after receiving cease-and-desist letters over its sports betting contracts, contending that federal oversight by the CFTC preempted state gambling laws. Federal courts sided with Kalshi and barred state regulators from intervening, though both cases remain active. Robinhood now claims the same protection should apply to its derivatives platform, which facilitates trading of event contracts that ultimately settle on Kalshi. These contracts allow users to speculate on outcomes ranging from sports games to elections and are pitched as a way to bring more transparency and truth-resolving mechanisms into markets. Robinhood is not just a trading app anymore and with kalshi it is now building prediction markets on NFL and NCAA games. On paper, it looks like a natural extension. Football is america’s biggest sport so liquidity is guaranteed but the framing is crucial. Robinhood doesn’t call… pic.twitter.com/fHOiJ52EnD — Ignacio Palomera (@MrIPalomera) August 19, 2025 In its New Jersey complaint, Robinhood said it contacted the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement to confirm it could operate under the court’s Kalshi ruling. Officials allegedly refused to commit to standing down and did not respond to multiple follow-up requests for meetings. A similar clash unfolded in Nevada, where Robinhood claims the state’s Gaming Control Board warned it would treat any offering of event contracts as “willful violations” of law, despite a local federal court siding with Kalshi. In both cases, Robinhood has asked the courts to issue orders preventing regulators from acting against it. The company is also seeking temporary restraining orders to shield its business while the suits move forward. Robinhood Faces EU Scrutiny Over Controversial Tokenized Stock Launch Meanwhile, Robinhood has come under regulatory fire in the EU after launching tokenized stock products linked to private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. The Bank of Lithuania confirmed it is investigating the legality and investor disclosures related to these blockchain-based “Stock Tokens,” which launched on June 30. OpenAI publicly disavowed any connection, stating it never approved the tokens and warning investors to be cautious. The controversy escalated when Elon Musk, reacting to OpenAI’s denial , labeled the firm’s equity “fake,” but did not directly address the SpaceX tokens.

In light of this, crypto analyst Doctor Profit has predicted that the Bitcoin price is actually going to fall below $100,000. If this prediction is accurate, then it means that this is only the beginning of the BTC decline, with more crashes expected to happen in the near future. September Will Be Bearish For Bitcoin In an X (formerly Twitter) post, the crypto analyst points out that the Bitcoin price crash is far from done. This is especially as the month of August is racing toward an end after the start of the month had been more bullish than not. With the new month already swimming into view, the analyst expects Bitcoin to break below a major psychological level. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash: $2 Billion In Losses Is Waiting For Traders At This Level Doctor Profit explains that the Bitcoin price correction is expected to continue and will bleed into the month of September. What’s more important is the prediction that Bitcoin will eventually crash below $100,000 in September, suggesting that the month will be dominated by bears. If this happens, it would be the first time since June that the price has crashed below $100,000. So far, the cryptocurrency has spent two consecutive months above the $100,000 level, suggesting that this has become a major support level for the price. Despite this prediction, the crypto analyst does not believe that the bull market is over. If anything, the crash below $100,000 is expected to only be a temporary correction before the move continues. After the crash, Doctor Profit says the bull market will then continue again. Historical Data Supports Bearish Month Doctor Profit’s prediction that the month of September will be bearish for Bitcoin and see the price crash below $100,000 is supported by historical data showing that the digital asset has usually performed poorly for the month. Using data from the CryptoRank website, we can see that 9 out of the last 14 years have seen the Bitcoin price close out the month of September in the red. Related Reading: Key Levels To Watch In Light Of XRP’s Macro Future The month is, on average, the worst in terms of average returns for BTC investors. It shows an average return of -5.58% over the last 14 years, and a median return of -4.43%. This means that the month of September is established as a bearish month for Bitcoin, and if this trend holds, then it is likely that the price will crash again.

As Bitcoin approaches a 6-week low, investors await the minutes of the Fed's July meeting and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech in Jackson Hole. As expectations for a Fed rate cut in September waned, increased profit-taking and expectations of a possible hawkish statement from Powell pushed Bitcoin below $113,000. Major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) also experienced significant declines. Speaking to The Block, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu said that Bitcoin is under pressure due to profit-taking and leveraged liquidations that followed Bitcoin reaching a new ATH earlier this month. Liu stated that investors are currently moving away from risky assets and that he expects consolidation in the short term. Stating that $4,200 is critical for Etheruem, the analyst added that if ETH fails to hold this level, the price could fall as low as 3,900. “Investors are in wait-and-see mode and the market may consolidate until policy clarity emerges. “For Ethereum, $4,200 is seen as a key support level. While efforts to hold this level are ongoing, a breakout could pose a risk of a drop to $3,900.” Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Research, also said the market is dependent on Powell. Chung stated that a moderate trend from Powell could push the cryptocurrency market up, saying: The most important near-term event will be Powell's speech in Jackson Hole this Friday. The market is already expecting a rate cut in September. If Powell says anything contrary to that, expect a sharp correction. However, if he takes a more moderate stance than expected, the market could recover. *This is not investment advice.

He has now turned to the crypto industry for backing as his Senate confirmation process stalls, according to people familiar with the matter. Quintenz was nominated for the chairman position in February this year, but his Senate Agriculture Committee vote was abruptly called off after the White House requested a delay in the voting process. With the Senate now in recess, no progress is expected until September at the earliest. FOX News correspondent Eleanor Terrett reported Tuesday that he has met with industry leaders, citing three people with knowledge of the matter. Trade institutions write plea to the White House According to Terrett’s sources, Trade associations, including the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the Blockchain Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and the DeFi Education Fun,d are preparing to send a letter to President Trump asking for Quintenz’s vote to move forward. 🚨SCOOP: @CFTC nominee @BrianQuintenz has been reaching out to members of the crypto industry for meetings as his nomination remains in limbo, according to three people familiar with the matter. The outreach comes as the White House has stayed silent since pausing his… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) August 20, 2025 “Each of our organizations has had the privilege of knowing and working with Mr. Quintenz firsthand, and we can attest to his deep expertise, sound judgment, proven leadership, and integrity,” the draft letter says. Despite outside endorsements, documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request have raised internal queries at the CFTC. A 166-page release includes emails in which staff members mentioned conflicts regarding potential hires sought by Quintenz’s presumptive chief of staff, Kevin Webb. One email alleges Webb wanted to bring back staff previously cut under “reduction in force” measures. Those concerns have fueled speculation that Quintenz could expand the agency’s staff and budget, a move some say clashes with the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink government operations and cut costs. Quintenz faces industry and political opposition Even though some industry KOLs believe the former CFTC member is the right man for the job, not all voices are behind his appointment. Bloomberg reported that ahead of the postponed vote, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss privately urged the White House to delay the nomination, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity. Kalshi, the prediction market where Quintenz currently serves as a board member, has been pushing to expand into sports betting. This has compelled Congress to discuss whether there would be a conflict of interest letting Quintenz lead the CFTC. That said, he promised to resign from his role at Kalshi if confirmed. Tribal groups, the American Gaming Association, casino lobbyists and the National Council on Problem Gambling submitted a letter to the Senate before the scheduled committee vote, arguing that prediction markets were being used “as a loophole to evade state gambling regulations.” Quintenz served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021 after being nominated by Presidents Obama and Trump, winning unanimous Senate approval. During that time, he chaired the Technology Advisory Committee, which organized the agency’s public discussions on crypto and blockchain technology. It was under his watch that the United States began regulating Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts. He also advocated for the government to balance its oversight and support on digital assets between the CFTC and the US Securities and Exchange Commission . White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said the administration stands behind Quintenz. “ He will help execute President Trump’s mission of making America the crypto capital of the world and we look forward to his swift confirmation ,” she said in a statement.

The impressive performance followed the platform’s significant comeback, which saw it regain most of Solana’s market share after sessions of negative sentiments and intensified competition. Source – SolanaFloor Pump.fun’s recovery is interesting when compared to prior weeks. For instance, its revenue dipped to $1.72 million on August 3, hitting yearly lows. The launchpad’s revival signals reinvigorated activity across the ecosystem, fueled by its market share. Pump.fun reclaims key metrics The revenue surge came as the platform reclaimed dominance in key indicators, including active wallets, bonded coins, and token mints. That shows renewed activity from meme cryptocurrency traders and creators within the Pump.fun ecosystem. The revived momentum comes after the platform struggled, especially after debuting the PUMP native coin. Troubles began when Gate.io suddenly delisted the coin’s page , with the following significant dumps from early backers denting the project’s appeal. Meanwhile, sentiments are improving. Pump.fun relies on community activity, and surged token mints, active wallets, and bonded assets signal a healthy network. Increased token mints indicator amplified creator engagement, whereas active wallets and more bonded tokens mean enhanced user participation and liquidity. Lifetime revenue crosses $800M Pump.fun’s weekly performance has grabbed analysts’ attention. On Dune Analytics, @adam_tehc highlighted that the network has collected fees worth $800,668,932. Notably, the meme launcher generates profits by collecting 1% swap fees on all transactions. Before it launched its decentralized exchange, PumpSwap, Pump.fun charged users when a coin graduated to Raydium after meeting specific conditions. Meanwhile, introducing PumpSwap meant concentrating trader and creator activity in one ecosystem. That has accelerated Pump.fun’s latest revenue growth. Pump.fun copes with LetsBonk competition While Pump.fun dominated meme coin trends during the bullish frenzy that began in 2024, it witnessed growing competition over the past months. LetsBonk.fun, another Solana-based meme platform, launched in April 2025. It displayed significant growth, propelled by the Bonk community and integration with Raydium. Some Pump users even switched to LetsBonk.fun after Solana’s co-founder labelled NFTs and meme cryptocurrencies useless . The community felt betrayed since themed tokens powered SOL performance in the past years. LetsBonk.fun outperformed Pump in graduated assets last month. However, Pump.fun is regaining its edge after multiple efforts, including launching the GFF to propel ecosystem growth . Blockchain researcher Fuel highlighted that Pump.fun now commands over 75% of market share, eclipsing LetsBonk’s 2%, adding: LetsBonk has completely disappeared from the Launchpad market.

Which Altcoins Can Be Considered Securities?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-chairman-paul-atkins-makes-critical-statements-which-altcoins-can-be-considered-securities/,"With the administration of ADB President Donald Trump, a major shift is taking place in cryptocurrencies. While Trump's establishment of a US national Bitcoin reserve is the most obvious example, significant changes are also taking place within established regulatory institutions, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins confirmed a major shift in cryptocurrency regulations, stating that very few tokens should be classified as securities. Speaking at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole, Paul Atkins made statements that contrasted sharply with the views of his predecessor, Gary Gensler. Atkins' statements represent a major shift from those of former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who said the vast majority of cryptocurrencies were securities under the SEC's Howey test standard. At this point, Paul Atkins said that the SEC's “Crypto Project,” which aims to set rules for crypto assets, may affect the institution's approach to cryptocurrencies in the future. Atkins stated that the SEC will no longer automatically treat tokens as securities. Instead, the SEC will review all the details of the token offering and launch. Atkins stated that how a token is sold and the regulations surrounding it are more important than the token itself. “We cannot necessarily treat all cryptocurrencies as securities. The SEC will now proceed with the assumption that the crypto token itself is not a security. The SEC will no longer automatically consider tokens to be securities. At this point, I think there are very few tokens that are securities. Because to me, how a token is sold and the regulations surrounding it are more important.” *This is not investment advice.

They claimed that the laws could lock traditional lenders out of a $2.8 trillion digital asset market. The trade groups, including the Global Financial Markets Association, Institute of International Finance, Financial Services Forum, Bank Policy Institute, and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, sent a letter to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) on Tuesday. The groups asked regulators to “temporarily pause” the implementation of capital rules set to take effect in January 2026. The Basel Committee, made up of regulators and central banks from the world’s major financial hubs, adopted a framework in 2022 to govern how banks should manage and disclose risks tied to crypto exposure, imposing capital requirements and limits on digital asset holdings. Financial policy groups ask BCBS to hold on the legislation for now In the letter, the trade groups propounded that the rules are outdated and overly harsh with their “punitive capital treatments,” which could make crypto activities uneconomical for banks. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Standard Chartered executive Bill Winters said banking institutions feel “left behind by private credit firms” in crypto. According to the groups, this will inevitably push digital assets into less-regulated parts of the financial sector. “ The Cryptoasset Standard’s restrictive qualification standards, combined with otherwise punitive market and credit risk capital treatments, effectively make it uneconomical for banks to meaningfully participate in the cryptoasset market, ” they wrote. The associations mentioned BCBS’s laws have ramified approaches among national regulators. They said policies in 2025 look very different from those in place when the standards were first drafted in 2022. Some jurisdictions, they noted, have chosen not to adopt the most conservative aspects of the Basel standards, such as higher risk weights for assets dependent on whether they are based on permissioned or permissionless ledgers. Others that leaned toward a more pro-innovation stance have not announced any plans or timelines for implementation at all. This inconsistent rollout, the letter read, threatens the success rate of implementing a minimum global standard that levels the playing field, reduces cross-border risks, and prevents financial fragmentation, or in a nutshell, the Basel standards. “Pausing implementation, and conducting an appropriate redesign and recalibration of the Cryptoasset Standard, would further the overall mission of the BCBS,” the letter read. Standards formed from the fallout from crypto company crashes The Basel crypto rules were drafted in response to high-profile failures that almost wiped out the digital asset industry in 2022. The collapse of Luna/Terra and the implosion of FTX left millions of investors facing losses, purportedly caused by widespread misconduct. “T he capital rules were brought in when a majority of players were not from traditional finance or banking, following major crashes like Luna and FTX, ” said Musheer Ahmed, founder of Hong Kong advisory firm Finstep Asia. Under the Basel framework, banks must assign higher risk weights to digital assets compared with traditional holdings. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptos by market capitalization, face a 100% risk weight. Yet, many other tokens fall into the so-called “Group 2” category, subject to a 1,250% risk weight, far higher than requirements for corporate bonds or equities. The associations offered several recommendations to improve the rules, which included eliminating the distinction between permissioned and permissionless ledgers when determining eligibility for lower capital requirements. They also advised BCBS to revise classification conditions to focus on enforceability and settlement finality rather than technical attributes, and to differentiate between regulated and unregulated stablecoins.

SEC Chair Paul Atkins has announced the launch of the President’s Digital Assets Group. The goal is to move away from the old ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach and set clear, workable rules for digital assets. Atkins made the announcement at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium , calling it part of ‘Project Crypto’ and a fresh start for the industry. With President Trump backing the roadmap, the US now looks ready to position itself as a leader in crypto innovation rather than a roadblock. The Bigger Context The President’s Digital Asset Markets Working Group already set out a policy roadmap in July. It urged regulators to help crypto businesses grow while still protecting investors. Atkins said the SEC will follow this roadmap closely, offering tailored exemptions, safe harbors, and fresh disclosure rules for companies working with tokens. Instead of forcing everything into the securities box, the Commission now wants flexible rules. This change could impact everything from ICOs and airdrops to decentralized apps and network rewards. Venture capital firms and advocacy groups like Andreessen Horowitz and the DeFi Education Fund are pushing hard for these reforms, and Atkins seems willing to listen. If he sticks to his promise of focusing enforcement only on fraud and scams, it could open the floodgates for the best altcoins , and new crypto projects like Snorter Token to thrive in the U.S. Spotlight on Snorter Token ($SNORT) Snorter Token ($SNORT) powers Snorter Bot, the fastest, lowest-fee trading bot built natively into Telegram for Solana and Ethereum degens. Instead of juggling multiple apps, Snorter Token turns your Telegram chat into a full trading suite. You can swap tokens, set stop-losses, snipe launches, copy trade top wallets, and even track your portfolio without leaving the chat window. The team designed it for speed because in meme coin chaos, milliseconds matter. With custom RPC infrastructure, $SNORT delivers sub-second execution on Solana, making it one of the quickest sniping bots in the game. Security is also baked in. A closed beta showed an 85% detection success rate for rug pulls and honeypots, with live blacklist scans and alerts when a token turns shady. The economics are just as sharp. While many bots charge over 1.5% per trade, Snorter’s execution fees drop to just 0.85% for $SNORT holders – cheaper than most competitors. That means more of your wins stay in your pocket. Beyond trading, the token also unlocks staking rewards, cross-chain bridging via Portal Bridge, and upcoming support for $ETH, $BNB, Polygon, and Base. In short, Snorter Bot isn’t just a meme-driven gimmick – it’s a multi-chain trading weapon, fine-tuned for degens who want speed, protection, and control. Why Snorter Token Could Be the One to Buy Now let’s talk numbers. $SNORT is still in presale, and you can buy it for $0.1017 . It has already raised $3.2M from early investors. For an early-stage presale, that’s serious traction. And with the SEC preparing to launch the President’s Digital Assets Group to empower crypto projects, the timing looks almost scripted. Regulation is finally shifting toward clarity, and tokens like Snorter stand to benefit from that friendlier environment. Investors are hungry for the next breakout among meme coins and new crypto presales . Snorter Token combines the fun of meme culture with actual product muscle – an edge most presale tokens can only dream of. Add in its lower fees, speed advantage, and community buzz, and you get a project that feels positioned for liftoff. For those searching for the best presale to enter before wider adoption hits, Snorter Token could be the ticket. A Turning Point for Crypto Paul Atkins’ plan for the SEC might be the biggest shift in US crypto history. And for projects like Snorter Token , the timing feels perfect. A fairer playing field, less fear of enforcement, and a huge appetite for new crypto ideas could make $SNORT one of the tokens to watch. This article is not financial advice.

Analyst EGRAG says the token must end August above $3.3 to validate its long-term double bottom breakout. A close could help XRP surge to a range of $7 to $28 in September. XRP traders are watching a critical price level as the month winds down, with analysts warning that only a close above $3.3 in August could trigger the next major upside. After briefly reclaiming a $3.35 high in August, XRP slipped into a downward spiral. The asset lost nearly 6% today, falling to $2.88, bridging its weekly performance to negative 11%. Key Resistance for August Meanwhile, analyst EGRAG stressed that the token must close August above $3.3 to keep its broader bullish structure intact. He pointed to XRP’s breakout from a double bottom (W) formation on the monthly chart. Notably, this double bottom dates back several years. First bottom formed after a sharp fall from $3.84 in January 2018 to $0.1050 in March 2020, followed by a rebound to $1.96 in April 2021. The second bottom appeared after another slide to $0.2879 in June 2022, which later recovered above $2 by December 2024.

On Tuesday, Judge Valerie Caproni of the Southern District of New York ruled against Alexandre, ordering him to repay more than 25,000 investors in what regulators condemned as a “brazen Ponzi scheme.” The order followed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s enforcement action, which sought restitution and disgorgement based on losses that investors suffered after contributing to Alexandre’s scheme. EminiFX and Alexandre to pay $228 million In her ruling, Judge Caproni noted that Alexandre had opposed the CFTC’s motion but failed to provide credible evidence to counter the claims of fraud. The court set restitution at $228.5 million, calculated on investor contributions minus withdrawals, and added $15 million in disgorgement. However, the disgorgement amount will be offset by restitution, meaning Alexandre’s repayment burden centres on making victims whole to the extent possible. The ruling reinforces the court’s earlier finding that Alexandre misled thousands of people by promising guaranteed returns of at least 5% a week through EminiFX, a crypto and forex trading platform. Caproni described his conduct as a deliberate attempt to exploit investor trust, echoing prosecutors’ characterisation of the scheme as calculated and deceitful. What’s next for victims? With the restitution order now in place, the next step for the case is enforcement. The CFTC will oversee the restitution process, ensuring funds are collected and distributed to victims. As of press time, how much investors ultimately recover remains uncertain, as much of the capital Alexandre raised was lost through mismanagement or diverted for personal use. Still, the ruling establishes a legal framework for victims to reclaim some of their funds, supplementing the nine-year prison sentence Alexandre is already serving. How did EminiFX scam victims? Alexandre’s downfall traces back to his promotion of EminiFX between September 2021 and May 2022. He has been accused of luring tens of thousands of investors with promises of passive income through a “secret technology” that supposedly automated crypto and forex trading. He went as far as telling investors their money would double within five months, backing the claim with fake account dashboards that displayed weekly gains that never existed. However, behind the façade, Alexandre invested only a portion of the funds and lost millions on unsuccessful trades. It was later found out that he had siphoned nearly $15 million into his personal account and spent over $150,000 on luxury vehicles, including a BMW and payments toward a Mercedes-Benz. Alexandre was arrested and charged with commodities fraud in May of 2022, to which he pleaded not guilty at first. However, by February 2023, Alexandre had changed his plea, and the court handed him a nine-year federal prison sentence for defrauding thousands of investors. The EminiFX case is the second major crypto Ponzi ruling in US courts this month. Earlier in Seattle, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin, the Estonian founders of HashFlare, received sentences of time served after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The pair had defrauded over 400,000 people through a sham cryptocurrency mining operation that ran from 2015 to 2019 and funnelled more than $577 million in contracts. Judge Robert Lasnik ordered Potapenko and Turõgin to forfeit more than $450 million in assets, including cryptocurrency, real estate, vehicles, and mining equipment, which will be used in a remission process to repay victims.

Rising Ether short trades will trigger a major short-squeeze amid strong demand from institutional investors. President Donald Trump has championed rate cuts, thus rejuvenating a crypto rebound ahead. Ethereum (ETH) price has dropped over 10% in the past seven days that analysts see as a textbook bullish setup for a new all-time high. The pullback to the crucial $4,100 support level is not seen as a weakness, instead as a healthy retest of a former resistance zone, a technical pattern that often precedes a major breakout. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $504 billion, has since closed a CME gap previously formed between $4,096 and $4,192. Popular analyst Crypto Rover noted this is “exactly what we wanted to see for the next leg up,” suggesting the move has cleared the way for a new rally.

The DeFi protocol is forecasted to surge from $0.035 to an ambitious $3.50 in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.035 in presale phase 6. In phase 7, it will be sold at an increased price of 14.29% to $0.04. Existing early beckers who are already invested will get to realize at least a 200% return when MUTM makes its debut on the open market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $14.6 million worth of funds and has over 15400 investors already on board. While ADA and ETH continue their established trajectories, the spotlight is increasingly on Mutuum Finance as it emerges as a high-growth contender in the next wave of decentralized finance innovation. Cardano (ADA) Losing Momentum Amid Mixed Forecasts Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at approximately $0.92, showing signs of slowing momentum despite a modest rebound from recent support zones. Analyst projections for 2025 vary: some cautiously expect ADA to remain range-bound near $1, citing limited DeFi traction and competition from Ethereum and Solana, while others point to a medium-term technical upside toward $1.05–$1.18, contingent on sustained bullish indicators. Despite these mixed signals, investor focus appears drifting toward other emerging opportunities, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is garnering attention in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stage 6 Presale Ongoing Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in presale Stage 6. MUTM tokens are priced at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the previous stage. The next price hike will bring the price to $0.04 in phase 7. Presale is progressing smoothly so far with over 15400 holders and over $14.65 million raised to date, showing good and rising interest in the project. DeFi Lending with a Highly Advanced Dual-Model Architecture Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a P2P and P2C lending protocol through which customers can earn high returns with maximum control of capital. It’s an end-to-end DeFi experience perfectly adapted to the needs of customers and more secure, clear, and flexible than traditional lending products US Dollar–Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be introducing an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. CertiK also certifies and audits the project. Coupled with investors’ dedication to code base transparency and integrity, the auditing assures that the project will actually develop a secure DeFi protocol. The project also initiated a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. Four categories of vulnerabilities are to be rewarded as critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance Token Giveaway Launched Mutuum Finance has started a $100,000 giveaway to grow its community. 10 investors stand to win $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The giveaway, besides acquiring new investors, is an indication that the project is not afraid to do the extra mile to build a long-term community. Mutuum Finance Scores 95.0 Trust Score on CertiK Audit CertiK smart contract audit has deemed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) secure with a trust score of 95.0/100. The project is offering a secure platform to conduct DeFi activities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is connecting new lending capacity with the strength of an ecosystem, and with a vision for the future of DeFi. As Cardano (ADA) struggles to sustain momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing the spotlight with over $14.65 million raised, more than 15,400 investors, and a presale price climbing from $0.035 in Stage 6 to $0.04 in Stage 7. With early buyers already positioned for 200% returns at launch, this is a moment where decisive entries could prove highly rewarding.

By emphasizing Ripple’s role in providing Gemini with a credit line, his post highlighted what many saw as another step toward broader recognition of XRP in mainstream markets. CNBC’s Coverage of Gemini’s IPO Filing The CNBC anchors discussed Gemini’s decision to file for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), noting that the exchange aims to join a growing list of digital asset firms entering public markets. However, for viewers, the more striking detail was Gemini’s reliance on a new credit line from Ripple to support its listing ambitions. The segment pointed out that Ripple has extended a revolving credit line to Gemini, providing support as the company prepares for its IPO. Over a certain threshold, this credit line will be paid out using RLUSD, integrating the stablecoin into this important partnership. This connection stands out as the most notable element of the coverage, positioning Ripple as an active partner in one of the highest-profile exchange listings to date. The acknowledgment gave further weight to the idea that XRP, through Ripple’s involvement, is gaining visibility in mainstream financial discussions .

RIPPLE AND #XRP ARE EVERYWHERE pic.twitter.com/t3Ygh6JbjX — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 18, 2025 Implications for XRP Recognition JackTheRippler’s post went further than repeating CNBC’s coverage. He pointed out that Ripple and XRP are everywhere, reflecting the widely held view among supporters that this partnership represents an opportunity to expand XRP’s reach. By linking Ripple to one of the largest U.S.-based exchanges pursuing a public listing, XRP gains visibility in conversations that reach far beyond the crypto community. Mainstream financial coverage of Gemini’s IPO now includes Ripple, and by extension XRP, placing the asset in front of institutional and retail audiences that may not closely follow token-specific developments. XRP has been gaining recognition as adoption grows worldwide . As mainstream news networks now discuss Ripple, the digital asset’s prominence in U.S. financial circles has potential for further growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Looking Ahead The immediate outcome of the partnership is clear. Gemini will benefit from Ripple’s financial support as it pursues a listing on Nasdaq. However, the broader implications remain to be seen. A formal relationship with Ripple could expand XRP services on Gemini. Gemini recently teased a major XRP-related development , potentially signaling an expansion of this partnership. For XRP holders, the increasing recognition might represent a turning point in mainstream acceptance, and the coming months will show how this partnership impacts XRP’s growth.

The project’s presale has already crossed the $2 million funding mark, with over 150 million tokens sold, putting it among the fastest-growing launches of the year. With entry prices still just $0.005 per token, analysts suggest that a small investment of $250 today could turn into as much as $25,000 if the token hits its $1 launch goal. Ozak AI’s Presale Momentum The pace of Ozak AI’s presale has been nothing short of remarkable. In a market where many new tokens struggle to gain traction, Ozak AI’s combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence has immediately resonated with both retail and institutional investors. The project is now in Stage 4 of its presale, with demand increasing daily. Early-stage investors are already sitting on gains as token prices rise between presale stages, highlighting why those who move quickly in crypto often come out ahead. With 150 million tokens sold, Ozak AI has built a strong foundation of community support, something that has proven essential for long-term sustainability in the crypto world. Many investors see parallels between Ozak AI’s early adoption curve and what Ethereum and Solana experienced in their formative years. The $1 Goal: Turning $250 Into $25,000 At today’s presale price of $0.005, a $250 investment secures 50,000 tokens. If Ozak AI reaches its projected $1 launch price, that initial stake could balloon into $50,000. Even using a more conservative estimate, if Ozak AI only achieves $0.50, investors still see their $250 grow into $25,000—a 100x return. These types of numbers are rare in traditional markets but no longer unheard of in crypto presales. Ethereum’s early adopters grew to become modest investments into lifestyles, converting wealth while it grew from under $1 to several thousand greenbacks, according to Token. Solana’s early buyers experienced comparable outcomes while it skyrocketed from cents to nearly $260 for the duration of the 2021 bull run. Ozak AI, with its AI-powered software, is positioning itself to comply with a comparable trajectory. Why Ozak AI Is Generating Buzz The pleasure around Ozak AI isn’t pretty much presale hype. Investors are drawn to the project’s real-world use cases and its awareness of integrating artificial intelligence into blockchain systems. The token is designed to power AI-driven analytics, predictive equipment, automated trading solutions, and enterprise programs. This position Ozak AI is an unexpectedly increasing sector in which businesses, developers, and governments are increasingly adopting AI-powered platforms. Unlike meme coins that frequently rely on community hype and viral recognition, Ozak AI is anchored in an era-first technique. This balance between real-world utility and strong investor enthusiasm is a key reason why Ozak AI has been capable of standing out in a crowded market. Competing With the Giants It’s worth noting that Ozak AI enters the market alongside crypto’s most established names. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana continue to be dominant players in 2025’s bull cycle. Bitcoin is pushing toward $200,000, Ethereum is focused on $8,000, and Solana is forecast to climb in the direction of $500. These increased levels are dazzling; however, they don’t offer the type of 200x upside ability that Ozak AI does. For new buyers, this creates a clear distinction: the giants supply constant, reliable boom, whilst disruptive beginners like Ozak AI provide the hazard of life-changing returns. Both have a place in a balanced portfolio, but for the ones chasing maximum upside, presales like Ozak AI represent a possibility too large to ignore. From $2M to the Next Phase Crossing the $2 million milestone early in its presale shows that Ozak AI has momentum, strong investor backing, and the credibility needed to attract broader attention. The token’s roadmap includes building partnerships, expanding global awareness through roadshows, and rolling out product integrations that showcase the power of AI within blockchain ecosystems. If Ozak AI continues this pace of growth, it could sell out its remaining presale stages far quicker than expected. This makes timing crucial for investors who want to lock in low entry points before the token reaches public exchanges. Ozak AI is quickly becoming one of 2025’s breakout crypto stories. With $2 million raised, 150 million tokens sold, and forecasts pointing toward a $1 launch target, it’s easy to see why investors are excited. A simple $250 allocation at today’s price has the potential to flip into $25,000 or more, creating a once-in-a-cycle opportunity for early backers. While no investment in crypto is risk-free, Ozak AI combines the best of both worlds—AI utility and blockchain innovation—with presale momentum that suggests significant upside. For investors seeking the kind of explosive returns that defined Ethereum and Solana’s early years, Ozak AI could be the project that delivers.

Ozak AI merges artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, resonating well with both individual and corporate investors, propelling it through its presale phases with increasing valuation. The strong community backing that Ozak AI has garnered parallels the early days of now-major crypto players like Ethereum and Solana, suggesting a robust trajectory for its market acceptance and value growth. Investment Perspective: Maximizing Returns Investing $250 in Ozak AI during its presale could potentially yield returns of up to $25,000, assuming the token reaches its goal price of $1 at launch.

The Unique Appeal of Ozak AI Ozak AI is more than just a cryptocurrency; it's an advanced technological ecosystem designed to enhance predictive analytics and automated trading through AI integration in blockchain. This functionality positions Ozak AI at the forefront of a booming sector poised for exponential growth. Unlike transient trends often seen with meme coins, Ozak AI harnesses genuine utility, creating sustainable interest and long-term viability in the crypto market. Strategic Positioning Amongst Crypto Giants While traditional market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate, they offer comparatively lower growth potential than newer entrants like Ozak AI. For investors looking for a high-risk, high-reward portfolio addition, Ozak AI presents an unprecedented opportunity.

According to Wall Street Journal , Elon has started telling people close to him that he doesn’t want to risk upsetting high-ranking Republicans by splitting the conservative vote, especially not with Donald Trump back in the White House and JD Vance positioned as his likely successor. In private conversations, Elon admitted that going ahead with the party would strain his relationship with Vance, now the vice president. He’s stayed in touch with Vance in recent weeks and has even floated the idea of backing him financially if he runs in 2028. Elon dumped nearly $300 million into Republican campaigns in 2024, and people familiar with the conversations allegedly say he plans to do the same for Vance. Elon backs out of calls and sidelines political party effort In late July, Elon canceled a scheduled call with a group that specializes in getting third parties off the ground, and the Journal said his team told participants the meeting was scrapped because Elon wanted to keep his focus on his companies. That meeting would’ve helped the new party figure out how to get on the ballot in critical states. But instead of following through, Elon and his team stopped reaching out to key organizers and advisers. Even some of his closest political allies from the 2024 election cycle haven’t had any conversations with him about building a new party. Many of those same advisers had helped Elon funnel money into Trump’s re-election campaign through his America PAC, which spent heavily in swing states like Pennsylvania. Republican consultants warned that if those same people were seen helping Elon start a new party, they’d likely get blacklisted by Trump’s circle. That risk seems to have kept most of them from engaging. And Elon hasn’t done anything to bring them back in. The Libertarian Party tried to pitch itself as a ready-made platform, offering to help him avoid starting from scratch. But according to Steven Nekhaila, chair of the Libertarian National Committee, Elon never responded. “It’s almost an eerie silence,” Nekhaila said. “It doesn’t seem like anything has been in action, neither at the state level or at the ground level.” Vance hopes Musk stays close, while Trump and Elon cool off The decision not to move forward, for now, helps Republicans. Third parties tend to bleed votes from major players, and a Musk-backed America Party could’ve drawn support away from Trump allies. That includes Vance, who said earlier this month that breaking from Trump and the conservative movement would be “a mistake.” He told The Gateway Pundit, “So my hope is that by the time of the midterms, he’s kind of come back into the fold.” Trump and Elon were at odds earlier this year after Elon criticized Trump’s spending package and claimed the former president wouldn’t have won without his support, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. At the time, Elon was still working in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He resigned in late May, and amid his public breakup with the president, threatened to support primary challenges against Republicans who backed the spending bill. Since then, both men have dialed it back. Elon stopped criticizing Trump publicly on X, and Trump posted on Truth Social that he wanted Elon and his companies to “thrive,” calling their success a good thing for the country. Trump had previously raised the idea of killing off SpaceX’s federal contracts, but after a review, the administration said most of those deals were too important, especially for the Pentagon and NASA. In fact, SpaceX could now benefit from a new executive order that speeds up rocket launch permits. Meanwhile, others who had shown support for Elon’s party idea haven’t heard anything either. Andrew Yang confirmed he had talks with Elon’s team about the America Party but hasn’t shared any details. Mark Cuban, who supported the idea after Elon’s July announcement, told The Wall Street Journal that he hasn’t had any conversations with Elon or his team since then.

However, analysts now suggest that the crowd’s sudden bearish tilt could create a potential setup that historically favors contrarian investors. A Dramatic Shift in Market Psychology According to data analytics platform Santiment, the mood across crypto communities on social platforms has turned from bullish to ultra bearish, following Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $113,000. Santiment reported that August 19, which saw BTC trading around $112,647 at one point, became the day with the most negative social media sentiment since June 22, when geopolitical tensions triggered a wave of panic selling. The firm’s metrics showed a clear flip, with negative commentary on BTC outpacing positive remarks for the first time in weeks. This type of extreme crowd fear, Santiment suggested, has frequently come just before a market recovery, positing that prices often move in the opposite direction of crowd expectation. This pattern was evident in June when the panic over U.S. airstrikes proved to be an excellent moment to buy the dip, and again in July when continued optimism was followed by a decline. The market intelligence platform is now suggesting that with the crowd seemingly giving up in this latest rout and panic selling, it could be a good sign of an “actual upcoming dip bounce.” “Historically, this negative sentiment is a good thing for the patient traders who have been waiting for an opportunity to buy or add on while there is ‘blood in the streets’ and fear is maximized.” This psychological shift is also reflected in on-chain behavior. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant, BTC holders of 3 to 5 years, who bought during the 2021 cycle, are acting with the impatience of novice traders. Even though they have been classified as long-term holders, their tendency to sell during drawdowns is indicative of weaker hands, and questions are being asked about how they could affect market directions. Analyzing the Price Trajectory Bitcoin’s price action tells the story of this sudden sentiment drop. After establishing a new all-time high of $124,457 just six days ago, the OG crypto has since pulled back by approximately 8.5%. Over the past seven days, BTC has decreased by 4.9%, with its weekly price range fluctuating from close to $124,000 to under $112,000 according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, even with this recent weakness, Bitcoin’s yearly performance is nothing to sniff at, with the asset gaining 87.4% in that time. Furthermore, its nearly 5% weekly loss isn’t as bad as the global crypto market’s collective 8.1% drop in the same period, indicating a relative strength that suggests capital may not be entirely fleeing the ecosystem but simply rotating.

The move marks one of the most significant commitments by a traditional finance firm to real-world asset tokenisation, a technology increasingly seen as the next frontier in global markets. Hedge funds move on-chain According to an exclusive interview with Fortune Crypto, SkyBridge intends to bring two of its funds on-chain through the initiative. The Digital Macro Master Fund, which invests directly in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and Legion Strategies, a fund of funds mixing venture capital stakes with crypto exposure, will both be tokenised. Together, the allocation represents around 10% of the firm’s $2 billion in assets under management. The firm is working with tokenisation provider Tokeny and its parent company, Apex Group, which oversees more than $3.5 trillion in assets. Apex will provide operational support through its Digital 3.0 platform, which manages the issuance, administration, and distribution of tokenised products. Importantly, the tokens will follow the ERC-3643 standard, a framework designed to ensure compliance while allowing investors easier access. Why Avalanche? Avalanche has become a preferred platform for tokenisation projects because of its speed, scalability, and flexible design. The blockchain supports sub-second transaction finality and allows institutions to create customised subnets, making it attractive for both private and public market use. So far, Avalanche has hosted tokenised products ranging from bonds and real estate to mineral rights and structured financial instruments. Bergen County in New Jersey even uses the network to digitise property deeds worth an estimated $240 billion, a programme aimed at reducing fraud and cutting paperwork. With the addition of SkyBridge’s hedge funds, Avalanche’s tokenised asset base is expected to grow from $188 million to nearly $500 million, representing one of the largest single increases in its history. Real-world asset tokenisation is gaining momentum The move comes at a time when interest in real-world asset tokenisation is accelerating across global finance. According to data from RWA.xyz , the tokenised asset market has expanded from $15.8 billion at the end of 2024 to $26.4 billion in early 2025, a jump of more than 64% in less than two months. Private credit accounts for the largest share of the market, followed by tokenised US Treasuries. Major institutions have also entered the space. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, and tokenisation initiatives from Ondo, WisdomTree, and Securitise highlight the growing confidence among asset managers. Other players, such as VERT Capital, are moving to tokenise large pools of debt on competing blockchains like XDC and the XRP Ledger. Scaramucci doubles down on blockchain For Scaramucci, the plan is a continuation of SkyBridge’s early bet on digital assets. The firm disclosed a $182 million Bitcoin allocation as early as 2020 and launched the SkyBridge Bitcoin Fund LP to offer institutional exposure. While setbacks such as the collapse of FTX tested the firm’s strategy, Scaramucci has remained vocal in his belief that blockchain will redefine how capital markets operate. Speaking at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, he framed tokenisation as a practical solution to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure. Scaramucci also described it as a way to improve transparency and liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets, opening new opportunities for investors worldwide.

The August 19 letter argues that the 2022 framework has become obsolete due to rapid developments in distributed ledger technology and the explosion of regulated digital asset markets since its adoption. The coalition’s “Impact of Distributed Ledger Technology in Capital Markets” report highlights how current rules make it “uneconomical for banks to meaningfully participate” in crypto markets, creating a bifurcated financial system where digital assets operate largely outside traditional banking supervision. The groups cite examples like tokenized U.S. Treasury securities receiving punitive 1,250% risk weights simply for existing on public blockchains. Source: The Letter Banking Industry Pushes Back Against ‘Cliff-Effect’ Capital Punishments The associations criticized the Basel framework’s rigid distinction between permissioned and permissionless ledgers, arguing it creates arbitrary “cliff-effects” where otherwise low-risk assets face massive capital requirements. Under current rules, tokenized government securities on public blockchains receive the same punitive treatment as speculative cryptocurrencies despite backing by U.S. Treasury bonds. The letter recommends eliminating permissioned versus permissionless ledger distinctions for Group 1 crypto asset eligibility, noting that risk should focus on the underlying asset rather than blockchain infrastructure. Additionally, the groups propose removing the “infrastructure risk add-on” for Group 1 cryptoassets as unnecessary and inconsistent with technology neutrality principles. Banking groups also challenged the current 1% and 2% exposure limits for Group 2 cryptocurrencies, calling them “too restrictive” and featuring punitive cliff effects that discourage regulated entities from offering crypto services. The restrictions push demand toward non-bank institutions operating outside traditional regulatory oversight. Furthermore, the associations questioned the empirical justification for 100% capital risk weights on Group 2a cryptoassets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. April 2025 data shows these assets trade with higher volumes than many large-cap equities and major foreign exchange pairs, with observed volatility suggesting much lower appropriate risk weights around 54%. Source: The Letter Source: The Letter Concurrently, Wall Street’s crypto embrace accelerates through multiple channels. Major ETH treasury companies recently pitched Manhattan investors on Ethereum as tomorrow’s financial infrastructure foundation, with corporate treasuries now controlling over $28 billion worth of Ether across public companies. Institutional Integration Reshapes Traditional Banking Landscape Earlier in June, JPMorgan launched its JPMD digital deposit token on Coinbase’s Base network, marking the banking giant’s biggest step into public blockchain technology. The fully dollar-backed token targets institutional clients initially, with CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledging the bank’s strategic shift, stating, “we’re going to be in it and learning a lot.” Major banks are also developing both individual stablecoins and collaborative industry-wide digital currencies, though none are expected before year-end. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently confirmed his institution’s stablecoin preparations, describing an anticipated “complex array” of digital currency offerings. However, internal banking concerns mount about stablecoins potentially undermining traditional deposit bases. Federal law requires stablecoin backing funds to be invested in government bonds, providing guaranteed profits to banks while offering depositors no interest. Unlike traditional accounts, stablecoins carry no federal deposit insurance protection. The crypto IPO market has simultaneously exploded, with Circle’s June debut valuing the stablecoin issuer at $35 billion after shares more than doubled. Bullish raised over $1.15 billion in its recent public offering , while BitGo, Grayscale, and Gemini have submitted confidential listing filings, according to Reuters . The @Bullish IPO raises a record $1.15B, a first for a company on the @NYSE using majorly @solana stablecoins for funding. #Stablecoins #Solana https://t.co/SJkNm4kmSu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 19, 2025 Notably, Renaissance Capital’s Matt Kennedy noted in the Reuters report that “ Circle’s trading has really been the biggest green light for the industry ,” with positive regulatory developments and friendly oversight creating powerful momentum for public offerings. Looking forward, the Basel Committee is facing pressure to modernize rules that industry participants argue prevent regulated institutions from safely integrating digital assets while pushing activity toward less supervised entities. The associations’ recommendations aim to create risk-sensitive frameworks that recognize the technological development of Crypto while maintaining financial stability.

In addition, Grayscale (ETHE) saw $18.7 million withdrawn, Franklin (EZET) lost $6.6 million, and VanEck (ETHV) and Bitwise (ETHW) posted smaller outflows, the former cutting $4.8 million and the latter $1 million.

The landscape worsened on Tuesday, even though BTC recovered some ground at first to $117,000. However, the bulls quickly lost their grip on the market, and bitcoin nosedived below $113,000 on Tuesday evening and on Wednesday morning. This became the asset’s lowest price tag in roughly three weeks as fear has taken over . Although it has bounced to almost $114,000, it’s still in the red on a daily scale. Its market capitalization has declined to $2.265 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is still below 58%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView ADA Slumps, XRP Struggles Aside from LINK, which has charted a 3% daily increase, a few other altcoins are with minor gains over the past day, including SOL, TRX, LEO, and TON. In contrast, Ethereum has dropped toward $4,200 after a 1% daily decline. Similar losses are evident from the likes of BNB, DOGE, HYPE, XLM, and SUI. Ripple’s native token has dropped below $3.00, which is considered a crucial support in its bull market aspirations. A 4% decline has pushed the asset to $2.90. Cardano’s ADA has dumped the most from the larger-cap alts, losing over 8% of value and struggling at $0.85. The total crypto market cap has seen over $70 billion gone overnight and is down to $3.920 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The project combines the viral appeal of penguin-themed tokens with Bitcoin’s cultural influence, positioning itself as both a meme-driven phenomenon and a financial opportunity. Unlike fleeting meme coins, Bitcoin Penguins carries a structured presale model, deliberate tokenomics, and a clear roadmap designed to reward early adopters. Ethereum has seen its price extend losses in recent days as part of the broader crypto market downturn, yet large investors appear undeterred. Data from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham reveals that two newly created whale wallets have collectively acquired nearly $200 million worth of Ethereum (ETHUSD) in a single purchase. With institutional capital flowing back into crypto assets, the timing for $BPENGU’s launch couldn’t be more calculated. Presale enters final stretch Bitcoin Penguins’ presale is nearing its blazing end. The presale is set to conclude on August 27. At the heart of Bitcoin Penguins lies its unique 15-stage presale system. Each stage increases the token’s price by 5%, meaning early participants are positioned to lock in significant gains before the token even lists on exchanges. Investors entering at $0.00100 will see a 75% increase by the presale’s conclusion, with the price expected to climb stage by stage, fast, given that each round lasts only 48 hours. The next price rise is scheduled in 23 hours at the time of writing. Hence, the window for entry is narrowing. The listing is confirmed on September 2, and for investors who want to jump into the project, the clock is ticking. As of now, Bitcoin Penguins has raised $3.93 million, with the next price hike scheduled to move from $0.00171 to $0.0018. The token’s community-first allocation strategy further strengthens its appeal. Out of the 10 billion capped supply, 55% is reserved for presale participants, ensuring robust community ownership. Staking accounts for 20%, liquidity 10%, cold storage 5%, airdrops 5%, and charity 2%. Just 3% is allocated to the team and advisors, reducing internal sell pressure—a feature many meme projects lack. Institutional buying is helping altcoin projects What makes Bitcoin Penguins more than just another meme coin is its narrative positioning. The project taps directly into Bitcoin’s legacy while leveraging penguin-themed virality. This dual identity—serious in its Bitcoin association yet playful in its imagery—has caught the attention of both retail traders and industry watchers. As institutional capital rotates back into crypto markets, funds are first drawn to Bitcoin. From there, liquidity often trickles into meme assets that are culturally resonant and community-driven. Bitcoin Penguins sits at this exact intersection, primed to benefit from both Bitcoin’s credibility and the meme coin market’s speculative energy. Even during a downturn in the crypto market, big investors are looking for opportunities. It is evident from Arkham’s report that said wallets sourced approximately $192 million in ETH from BitGo, a well-known crypto trading platform and liquidity provider. This development comes at a time when Ethereum’s price performance has been under pressure, mirroring the broader decline led by Bitcoin. However, unlike cautious retail investors who have slowed their activity, large holders appear to be maintaining confidence in the asset’s long-term outlook. As Bitcoin Penguins nears the finish line in its presale, early investors are poised to reap explosive returns.

50382273,https://cryptonews.com/?p=411371,1755683671,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50382273.jpeg,"From FCA to Binance: Nish Patel on UK Rules, Institutional Appetite, and New Products",https://cryptonews.com/news/from-fca-to-binance-nish-patel-on-uk-rules-institutional-appetite-and-new-products/,"Binance’s UK director, Nish Patel, says Britain is on the cusp of a comprehensive crypto framework that will clarify life for retail users and widen the toolkit for professional investors. In an interview with CryptoNews, Patel—formerly the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA’s) first in-house crypto asset specialist—outlines how the rulebook is evolving and how Binance is positioning itself as the UK moves from patchwork guidance to a fuller regime. Patel’s regulatory résumé is unusual for a crypto exchange executive. At the FCA, he helped “upskill” staff on tracing transactions and the mechanics of Bitcoin, and worked on expanding the Money Laundering Regulations (MLRs) perimeter to capture crypto firms. He also assisted early authorisations, including the gateway that allowed the first UK crypto-asset firm approvals. That vantage point now shapes how he reads the UK’s trajectory now. A Two-Track Rulebook: Retail vs Professional The biggest change so far is the financial promotions regime that took effect in October 2023. In practice, it draws a bright line between retail and professional audiences: strict marketing limits and consumer protections for the former; far fewer constraints for the latter. Amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) are moving in parallel through consultations and discussion papers. Patel expects that process to culminate within the next 12 months in what he calls a comprehensive “UK version of MiCA”—not identical to the EU’s package, but comparable in scope because the UK is choosing to amend existing statutes rather than pass a single omnibus law. “We’re focused on proactively working with the regulator. Frameworks in the UK are becoming clearer, and we’re progressively opening up — as shown by our recent announcement for UK professional investors,”said Patel. “Professional investors have access to more opportunities than retail consumers, and to be clear, the upcoming UK regime will apply only to retail consumers,” adds Patel. Binance’s UK Playbook: License-First, Pros-First Patel characterises Binance’s approach as license-first wherever rules are clear, pointing to the company’s global roster of regulated venues and to leadership experience in jurisdictions that wrote early crypto frameworks. The UK, he says, is now moving onto that list. The promotion regime remains “very strict” for retail clients, he notes, because the FCA views them as most exposed to harm. Professional investors—institutions and high-net-worth clients who can evidence expertise and resources—aren’t subject to the same marketing constraints, which leaves room for more complex products. That is the lane Binance is using in the UK for now. Institutions, Staking—and the 12–24 Month Outlook On the institutional side, Patel explains that the UK retains deep trading talent even as some holding companies sit offshore for tax reasons. He also draws a sharp distinction with the EU: MiCA’s treatment of stablecoins and its preference for segregated order books are pushing some institutions to restructure. By contrast, UK policymakers have signalled they want domestic institutions to retain access to global order books to ensure best pricing. That, Patel contends, is making the UK more attractive to professional investors looking for execution quality. Staking—so contentious in the United States— is one place the UK has already moved to clarify. Patel cites a January 8, 2025 order from HM Treasury that exempted staking from the Collective Investment Schemes Order. In effect, that removed a major legal ambiguity and enabled broader availability of staking services to professionals, with retail to follow only if and when firms obtain the right permissions under the coming regime. Binance’s own staking footprint, he says, is sizable: Binance’s Ethereum liquid staking token, WBETH, commands 20% of the global liquid staking market — representing over $9 billion in value. Circulating supply has surged 18% in the past month, the fastest growth among major providers. On Solana, BNSOL — Binance’s fully in-house liquid staking token — is now the second-largest SOL LST globally, with around $1 billion in TVL and over 150,000 Earn users. (Figures were provided by the company.) Looking ahead 12 to 24 months, Patel expects three shifts. First, a full UK crypto regime “as comprehensive—or more so—than MiCA,” potentially including the regulation of crypto lending, which he notes is outside the EU package. Second, continued expansion of products available to qualifying professional users, because the policy intent and eligibility tests for that segment are already defined. Third, overdue for retail: a long-standing framework spelling out what can be offered, how it can be promoted, and what disclosures and safeguards must accompany it. Patel explains the UK was not a first mover, adopting a more conservative, stepwise approach that has tracked developments in the United States. But he argues the second-mover path is now accelerating as the government and regulator crystallise consumer-protection priorities while trying to keep institutional market plumbing competitive. For retail users, the near-term reality is stricter promotions, more warnings, and fewer products until the new regime lands. For professional investors, the opposite is true: more access and optionality, provided they meet the tests. Exchanges will have to live in both worlds at once, aligning licensing and product design to each audience. That, in essence, is Binance’s bet in Britain: build for professionals now, prepare for retail later, and match the cadence of a regulator that is finally writing the chapter it deferred for years.

Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, who said in 2018 that Bitcoin was more likely to fall to $100 than to rise to $10,000, has admitted he was wrong. “BTC is more likely to fall to $100 than to reach $100,000 in the next decade,” Rogoff told CNBC in an interview in early 2018. “Because BTC is used for money laundering and tax evasion and doesn't function as a transaction medium. If regulations start coming in worldwide, the price will collapse.” However, Rogoff admitted that he was wrong in a post on his X account, citing the lack of effective regulations for cryptocurrencies, the unexpectedly high rate of adoption, and the inaction of regulatory bodies as the main reasons behind his erroneous prediction. “About ten years ago, I was the Harvard economist who said Bitcoin was more likely to hit $100 than $100,000. What did I miss? 1-I was overly optimistic that the US would come to its senses regarding sensible cryptocurrency regulations; I was wondering why policymakers would want to facilitate tax evasion and illegal activities. 2- Secondly, I did not foresee that Bitcoin would compete with fiat currencies as the preferred medium of transaction in the twenty trillion dollar global underground economy. 3- Third, I did not anticipate that regulators, and especially the chief regulator, would be holding hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency, given the obvious conflict of interest.” *This is not investment advice.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After dropping nearly 10% over the past week and printing one red candle after another, Bitcoin is finally showing early signs of a possible rebound, with the token up almost 1% intraday today. Still, the prevailing sentiment in the market is that Bitcoin could head lower for a deeper pullback, and this concern isn’t unfounded. After all, on the daily chart, Bitcoin has broken below the 50 EMA, with a considerable gap until the next major indicator-based level, the 200 EMA. That said, a deeper pullback isn’t necessarily bearish. Many seasoned investors anticipated some cooling once Bitcoin slipped just under the $125K level. The encouraging factor here is that Bitcoin now sits on top of a strong support level – the previous resistance at $111K, which triggered the last major breakout. This has since flipped into support, and the August rally confirmed its strength, making it a critical level to watch. So, while short-term bearishness is understandable, the long-term picture remains firmly bullish. For many, this dip could present exactly what it often does in bull cycles – a buying opportunity.

In 2025, Dogecoin stands shoulder-to-shoulder next to Bitcoin. One is the first cryptocurrency, while our doggo friend is widely recognized as the first meme coin. Launched in 2013, $DOGE is up by over 39,000% today, looking at a price of over $0.22 and a trading volume in the billions of dollars. If anything, Dogecoin proves that ‘anything is possible’ in crypto, and even underdogs can become industry giants. With endorsements from industry moguls like Elon Musk and official investment vehicles like the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, $DOGE seems to be going nowhere but up. Click to learn more about Maxi Doge Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Dogecoin’s bodybuilder cousin chugging Red Bull and scalping cryptos at 3AM in the morning. Embodying full-send chaos and pump potential 2.0, $MAXI is for degen traders who don’t hesitate and keep diamond hands on some of the riskiest plays. While meme coins are a dime a dozen, Maxi Doge is max-commitment, max cojones, and aiming for legend status in the memecoin land. Simply put, if rat poison squared took form, it would probably look like Maxi Doge. And this meme coin is still in presale. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Dogecoin and doge-related projects and meme coins, you’re in the right place.

Today’s Dogecoin Technical Analysis After a fantastic July, Dogecoin investors lost some of their optimism as the token took a sharp U-turn in August. Since then, $DOGE has struggled under persistent bearish pressure, attempting to reclaim recent highs and push past strong resistance levels, including the top of a major descending triangle pattern. The good news is that Dogecoin appears to have found strong allies in the form of key support levels. The most important is an upward-sloping trendline (blue line), which the token has respected faithfully over the past couple of months. This very trendline powered both the July rally and the brief rebound in August. If $DOGE continues to hold here, the setup could support a 35-40% bounce. Adding to the case, today’s daily candle is also interacting with the 100 EMA and 200 EMA, both acting as crucial support zones. Together, these levels strengthen the argument that Dogecoin may be gearing up for another attempt at recovery. Dogecoin’s Unpredictability Sends Traders to Maxi Doge August 20, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Dogecoin’s 2025 journey has been a paradox of meme-fueled volatility and growing institutional interest. Despite trading at $0.212 , down 9.88% in the week, DOGE continues to attract major players like Bit Origin, which committed $500M to a DOGE treasury in July. A 75% chance of spot ETF approval and increased regulatory clarity have also boosted its legitimacy. And yet, Dogecoin remains highly reactive to social media, with Elon Musk’s X integration sparking a 17% surge in 48 hours and a playful D.O.G.E. tweet causing a 13% jump in 15 minutes, before plummeting back again. Dogecoin’s capriciousness has traders rotating into newer meme coins with stronger fundamentals. The Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale offers zero-tax trading, staking rewards, and a community-first launch, with no insider allocations. While DOGE wrestles with its identity, Maxi Doge is built for performance, making it a smarter play in today’s meme coin evolution. Learn how to buy Maxi Doge in presale. Trump-Linked Firm Bets Big on Dogecoin Mining Empire, from $XDOG to $MAXI August 20, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Thumzup Media, a firm with ties to the Trump family, is acquiring Dogehash Technologies to create the world’s largest Dogecoin mining operation. “Unlike many companies that simply used their cash to buy cryptocurrency, we have invested in mining infrastructure. By owning and operating our own fleet of ASICs, we generate revenue directly from production, creating an ongoing, sustainable source of Dogecoin,” — Dogehash Head Parker Scott The merged entity will trade under the ticker $XDOG, and mark Thumzup’s pivot from marketing into full-scale digital asset infrastructure. This move follows a $50M fundraising round and a board-approved $250M allocation for crypto holdings, including Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Solana. As legacy capital pours into Dogecoin infrastructure, it validates the broader meme coin category. With its zero-tax trading, staking rewards, and community-first launch, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) offers a fresh alternative for investors seeking utility-driven meme assets in this rapidly legitimizing space.

Bitcoin Conviction Buyers Are Stepping In, But Profit Takers Have Also Surged In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about the how the supply associated with the various Bitcoin behavioral cohorts has changed with the latest price decline . The analytics firm has divided investors into these groups based on their behavior. First, here is a chart for the supply of the “First Buyers,” who are holders who have bought the cryptocurrency for the first time: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin First Buyers have seen an increase from 4.88 million BTC to 4.93 million BTC during the past five days. This suggests that some fresh demand has come into the cryptocurrency alongside the dip. That said, these inflows aren’t anything too massive, reflecting just a 1% rise in the cohort’s supply. A group of investors that have seen a more substantial jump in their holdings are the Conviction Buyers, reflecting the part of the market that tends to step in during price drawdowns to buy. These holders have lived up to their name in the latest decline as well, raising their supply by 10.1% from 0.93 million BTC to 1.03 million BTC. It’s also apparent in the chart, however, that the accumulation level is still muted compared to the surge in the Conviction Buyers’ supply back in April. As Glassnode explains, the trend suggests “this dip is too shallow for strategic buying, or investors remain hesitant.” Buying isn’t the only thing that follows price declines. A segment of the investors also participate in panic selling . More specifically, loss taking tends to go up after drawdowns. The behavioral cohort that tracks this selling is the Loss Sellers group. Below is a chart that displays how the supply of these investors has changed recently. “Loss Sellers spiked +37.8% (63K → 87K $BTC) over the past 5 days,” notes the analytics firm. “Still, compared to earlier this year, realized losses remain contained – suggesting few investors are panicking.” Interestingly, the dominant sellers during this plunge have actually been the Profit Takers. Their supply has gone up by 5.4%, which is the largest spike in 2025 so far. Thus, it would appear that some holders have decided to exit from the market with their gains.

Related Reading: Analyst Says Shiba Inu’s $0.000010 Support Could Trigger Major Bounce Reports show Cardano’s market cap climbed to $33 billion, edging out TRON at close to $33 billion and Dogecoin at $32 billion. ADA was trading at $0.9225, rising 0.35% on the day and posting a 16% gain over the last week when this report was made. Cardano Climbs Past Dogecoin And TRON The shift came amid a broader bout of volatility across the crypto market. Based on reports, global market cap briefly peaked at $4.17 trillion on August 14, when Bitcoin surged to an intraday high of $124,388. MARKET: Cardano $ADA has flipped DOGE and TRON in market cap, currently it’s the #8 largest cryptocurrency in the world. Road to #3. 🏆 pic.twitter.com/5FgelJypIR — Cardanians (CRDN) (@Cardanians_io) August 19, 2025 That strength did not last long; the market corrected and by press time total capitalization sat around $3.88 trillion while Bitcoin traded near $115,259, down 5.5% from the top. Those swings helped rearrange the top 10 as investors chased short-term moves. Community Reaction And Price Moves Cardano touched the $1 mark again on August 14 and the social channels lit up. Founder Charles Hoskinson posted a lighthearted GIF to mark the moment, and traders flagged the recovery as a sign that buyers were back in force for at least part of the rally. The renewed attention came after long stretches where development milestones didn’t always translate to price action, and the August jump showed how quickly sentiment can change. Analysts Point To Higher Targets Several analysts shared bullish forecasts as ADA rose. Javon Marks said ADA had not yet hit its “minimum target,” setting a near-term goal of $1.20 and a longer-term level of $2.91 — a move that would equal roughly a 210% rise from the price quoted above. Other market voices noted a golden cross on ADA’s daily chart and argued that technicals support further gains. Some analysts even floated the idea that ADA could move toward $3 if momentum remains.

Analyst Points To Gold’s Playbook Short-Term Forecasts And Technicals According to current Cardano price predictions cited in reports, ADA could increase by 27% and reach $1.195464 by September 18, 2025. Market sentiment is listed as Bullish and the Fear & Greed Index read 56 (Greed). Over the past 30 days Cardano recorded 17/30 green days (57%) and showed 8.57% volatility. Those figures suggest steady positive sessions mixed with meaningful swings — a pattern that can reward active traders but also brings risk.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Outshines SHIB in Utility,https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-invest-in-for-passive-income-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"As the market matures, investors are rotating from pure narrative plays into assets that can pay them for participating. Passive income, on-chain revenue, and clear token mechanics are the new filter. Shiba Inu (SHIB) still commands massive community energy, but for holders who want yield tied to real platform activity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping into the spotlight. Shiba Inu (SHIB) SHIB earned its place in crypto history by turning a meme into a global movement. It’s liquid, widely listed, and supported by an engaged community and ecosystem efforts like Shibarium. That said, the core holder experience remains largely price-dependent. There’s no native mechanism that channels protocol revenue directly back to SHIB wallets, and returns tend to rely on market cycles, burns, or external incentives rather than on-chain income credited to holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) takes the opposite approach: it’s built to distribute value from day-to-day protocol use. The platform is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where users lend and borrow without intermediaries. When assets are deposited, users receive mtTokens, interest-accruing receipts that can be moved, used as collateral, or staked. A portion of platform fees is regularly used to buy MUTM on the open market; those purchased tokens are then redistributed to mtToken stakers. Net effect: activity funds rewards, rewards drive demand, and demand supports price, without inflating supply. For illustration, when an mtToken pool averages 10–15% APY over a year, a $10,000 deposit could earn roughly $1,000–$1,500. This structure is exactly what income-focused holders have been asking for. Head-to-head: SHIB vs. MUTM Both projects can coexist, SHIB delivers culture and reach; MUTM delivers a yield engine. The difference lies in the mechanics. SHIB’s demand drivers are community, listings, and broader sentiment. MUTM’s drivers are measurable: borrow activity, fee generation, recurring buy-backs, and staking flows. One is momentum-first; the other is cash-flow-linked. For portfolios built around passive income and capital compounding, that linkage is a major advantage. It means holders don’t have to wait for a market narrative to turn; they can earn while the platform is used. Why analysts and whales are leaning toward MUTM Coverage of presales and early DeFi launches has begun to cluster around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for three reasons: Price positioning with a defined launch: The token is offered at $0.035 in its current phase, with a $0.06 launch price already set. That locks in a clear price advantage for early buyers and reduces uncertainty around the first day of trading. Sustainable tokenomics: Rewards are financed by protocol activity, not emissions. Fee-funded buy-backs that are redistributed to stakers create a consistent loop of demand without bloating supply, precisely the model that tends to hold up when markets chop. Growing early participation: Reported presale totals exceed $14 million with 15k+ holders, and large wallets have been entering in visible blocks (e.g., $225k in 24-hour inflows recently). Big addresses typically prefer revenue-backed designs and fixed launch terms because they scale better as liquidity deepens. Add to this: a beta platform slated to go live at token launch, a completed security audit (95/100), and a $50,000 bug bounty with tiered rewards (Critical/Major/Medium/Low). There’s also a $100,000 giveaway split among ten winners, which is driving engagement heading into listings. What a realistic path could look like The near-term setup is straightforward: presale entry at $0.035, a defined listing at $0.06, and a platform that immediately channels activity into fee revenue and buy-backs. When adoption scales with listings and the lending markets deepen, analysts tracking early DeFi launches have floated $1 as a first major-cycle milestone. To make that concrete: a $1,000 allocation at $0.035 secures 28,000 MUTM. Marked at $0.06 on listing, that’s $1,800 before any post-launch move. When the token tags $1, the position would mark $28,000. The reason these predictions keep circulating is the alignment between usage, fees, buy-backs and then staking rewards, which provides a rational path for value accrual. MUTM in a Nut-Shell Shiba Inu will likely remain a cultural pillar with deep liquidity and unmatched reach. But for investors whose primary goal is passive income tied to real activity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the cleaner thesis: fee-funded buy-backs, non-inflationary rewards, and a product designed to pay participants for being part of the system. With the presale still under $0.04, listings approaching, and whales positioning early, MUTM makes a compelling case as the best crypto to invest in for passive income right now, especially for readers who want their holdings to work even when the market takes a breather.

But with over 400,000 channels churning out crypto content, finding the right one(s) can be draining. That’s where we come in. In this article, we’ll give you 10 of the best crypto YouTube channels of 2025. By the end, you’ll have found trustworthy ones to complement your learning and investment needs. Why Follow Crypto YouTube Channels? Before diving into our list of YouTube cryptocurrency channels to follow, let’s explore the key reasons for doing so. Benefits of Learning Through Video Videos break down complex topics like blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi), or trading strategies into digestible visuals, making it easier to grasp and retain technical concepts. Again, YouTube is free and available 24/7, allowing you to learn at your own pace. Unlike static articles, videos are interactive, thus engaging users more while catering to their different learning styles. Comments sections further foster discussions and connections with others in the crypto space. Real-Time Updates & Market Insights YouTube creators often post updates on price movements, regulatory changes, or project developments, helping you stay current with the crypto market. Similarly, traders and analysts provide real-time chart breakdowns, technical analysis, and predictions, offering actionable investment insights. Through this medium, creators highlight new tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or DeFi protocols, giving you early exposure to emerging opportunities or risks. The videos also capture the crypto community’s mood, which can influence your trading or investment decisions. Educational vs. Entertainment-Only Content Some channels dive deep into topics like wallet security, smart contracts , or fundamental analysis. This way, they empower viewers with knowledge to make informed decisions. Meanwhile, others prioritize hype, memes, or speculative predictions to attract views. While entertaining, the latter may lack substance or promote risky behavior. So, it’s good to find a balance by choosing channels offering reliable information while keeping content lively. Look for creators who cite sources, avoid overhyping, and disclose potential biases. How We Chose the Best Channels To identify the best YouTube crypto channels for beginners, we assessed them against the following four criteria: Content Accuracy & Credibility A misinformed investor is doomed, so we stressed content accuracy when settling on our list. We focused on channels showing a deep understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. These fact-check their content, cite reputable sources, and avoid sensationalized headlines. Production Quality & Presentation Style Clear audio, sharp visuals, and an engaging delivery can make all the difference when learning complex topics like blockchain, DeFi, or NFTs. Thus, we looked for top crypto YouTube channels that explain concepts in plain English and use catchy animations, charts, and infographics. Frequency of Uploads In our quest for the best YouTube cryptocurrency channels to follow, we prioritized those with a steady upload schedule. We did so aware that a consistent stream of new content ensures subscribers receive timely market updates, tutorials, and analysis. Despite frequency being a major listing factor, we didn’t stress it over quality. As such, we picked channels with both attributes. Community Engagement & Transparency The best creators cultivate genuine connections with their audiences. That’s why we went for channels whose hosts answer viewer questions, respond to comments, and are open about sponsorships or partnerships. Such transparency builds trust, while active engagement creates a community where traders can freely exchange ideas and insights.

Choosing the Right YouTube Channels for Your Goals Crypto YouTube Channels differ in so many ways. So, your goals play a big part in deciding the one to follow. Here are a few pointers to guide you in that decision. For Long-Term Investors Look for crypto YouTubers focusing on macro trends, fundamental analysis, and risk management. These creators often break down market cycles, project fundamentals, and portfolio strategies for weathering volatility. It’s a big bonus if they cover regulatory updates and emerging adoption trends. For Day Traders To catch short-term market moves, seek channels offering technical analysis, chart pattern breakdowns, and trading psychology tips. The best ones use real-time market data, clearly explain setups, and avoid overhyping speculative coins. Be wary of those pushing “guaranteed” calls. For DeFi Enthusiasts DeFi-focused channels explore yield farming, staking strategies, lending protocols, and governance tokens. Look for creators who test platforms and share step-by-step walkthroughs, security best practices, and honest risk assessments for such a dynamic sector. For Blockchain Developers Developers should follow channels that dive into coding tutorials, smart contract development, blockchain architecture, and project case studies. The most valuable ones balance theory with hands-on coding sessions, keeping you updated on new frameworks, tools, and security standards. Common Pitfalls to Avoid When Following Crypto Influencers Following crypto influencers is a great way of keeping tabs on the highly dynamic crypto market. But it comes with its challenges, as the pitfalls below show: Sponsored Content Without Disclosure Some crypto projects pay influencers to promote their products as “genuine” investment opportunities subtly. This creates a false sense of trust and objectivity among those influencers’ followers. The problem is that such shifty endorsements often mask ​weak business models, unproven teams, or unfeasible products, as popular YouTuber Paul Logan’s fiasco demonstrates. Thus, unwitting investors commit funds to an unprofitable project to their detriment. So, how do you save yourself from such crypto scams ? First, distrust content that’s overwhelmingly positive and lacking critical analysis. Also, be wary of influencers known for promoting new, unknown projects promising you the moon. Hype-Driven “Pump and Dump” Content Unscrupulous crypto influencers can create excitement around low-cap or new tokens through promotional campaigns that inflate prices temporarily. They push content with an urgent language, unrealistic price predictions, and claims about “once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.” These schemes create the fear of missing out (FOMO), pumping the price. The influencers and their associates then dump (sell) their holdings at the peak, leaving followers with worthless or significantly devalued tokens. Some red flags to watch out for include promises of guaranteed returns, pressure to buy, promotion of tokens with no clear utility or development team, and coordinated messaging across multiple accounts. Blindly Following Trade Calls Many crypto influencers offer specific trade calls, telling their followers when to buy or sell a particular coin. This practice could ruin you financially, as their “calls” might be based on guesswork, flawed technical analysis, or even be part of a larger pump-and-dump scheme. Luckily, it’s easy to know if someone is pushing you to this kind of risk. Their tell tale signs are promises of guaranteed returns or “easy” profits. Understand that successful trading requires proper market analysis, risk management, and personal financial planning, skills that copying someone can’t replace. So, instead of blindly following calls, use influencer content as one data point among many in your research process. Tips to Get the Most Out of Crypto YouTube While the crypto YouTube space has its share of risks, it’s also a powerful tool for learning and staying current. Using it with the following suggestions will make a more knowledgeable and confident investor. Cross-Verify with Multiple Sources Don’t treat any single video as the ultimate truth. Instead, seek out other creators’ views, read articles from reputable crypto news sites, and check out analyses of renowned crypto analysis platforms. This cross-verification helps filter out misinformation and hype, as several independent sources corroborating the same information/analysis give you greater confidence in its accuracy. Combine Video Learning with Reading Whitepapers A project’s whitepaper is its blueprint; thus, it is the best way to understand a crypto asset’s underlying mechanics and utility. Its details allow you to make informed investment decisions, rather than relying on an influencer’s potentially simplified or biased summary. So, when a creator discusses some protocol or token, treat their explanation as a starting point and follow up by reading the original whitepaper. Likewise, check the project’s GitHub repository and review its official roadmaps and tokenomics. Engage with the Community for Deeper Insights The comment sections and live chat features of crypto YouTube channels contain valuable insights from experienced community members. Here you’ll find crypto investors and builders, offering perspectives complementing or challenging the creator’s content. Moreover, crypto projects usually have communities on platforms like Discord, Telegram, or Reddit. Joining these groups offers you a direct line to a project’s ecosystem. You can ask questions, see how the developers interact with the community, and understand the project’s overall health and engagement.",Deep Dive - Crypto|Web3 & Market Insights,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-20 10:05:55

Key Levels to Watch,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/what-happens-if-bitcoin-drops-below-110k-key-levels-to-watch,"Bitcoin’s resilience is once again being tested as traders eye the critical $110K level. While BTC has delivered steady gains over the past six months, recent slips highlight the possibility of a deeper pullback. A drop below $110K could reshape market dynamics, influencing sentiment across the broader crypto sector. This article explores the key levels investors should watch, the potential scenarios that could play out, and which coins may be positioned to weather volatility and capture upside. Alongside market insights, we highlight how Outset PR equips crypto and blockchain projects with strategies to stand out in uncertain conditions. Bitcoin's Steady Stance with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is currently fluctuating between around $115k and $121k. It has been slightly slipping lately, showing a small drop over the past week and month. Despite this, Bitcoin has still managed a nearly 20% climb over the past six months. The coin is facing a nearby resistance level at $126k, with potential growth if it breaks through this barrier. On the flip side, its nearest support lies just above $112k, providing a cushion. If it surpasses the second resistance at $133k, Bitcoin may climb even higher, potentially gaining over 10% from its current range. Though the market shows mixed signals, Bitcoin's long-term trend hints at more growth ahead.

Other coins are showing fast gains, hinting at rising excitement. Many want to know which coins are leading and what this could mean for smaller tokens in the coming days. Momentum is building and investors are watching for more surprises. Ethereum (ETH) Source: TradingView Ethereum now trades between 4165 and 4791. The coin is almost flat this week with a 0.10% uptick. Over the past month it has burst ahead about 17.7%. Shift the lens to 6 months and the rally stands near 56%. The trend looks north, yet the recent stall shows traders pausing. The 10-day average at 4309 sits under the 100-day line at 4440. The dip sets price near short-term value territory. RSI near 35 and a single-digit Stochastic suggest sellers may be tired. MACD is negative but easing. All this hints that downside energy is fading as the market hugs the 4165 floor. If bulls grab control, ETH could test 5105, a climb of roughly 10% from the ceiling of the current band. A break there opens 5730, about 20% above today. Lose 3853 and a slide toward 3228 looms, nearly 25% below the midpoint. Momentum tilts to a bounce, yet buyers must lift price above 4440 to unlock the next leg up. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Cardano (ADA) Source: TradingView ADA just logged a 16.95% jump in the past 7 days, topping its 8.92% gain over 30 days and echoing a 16.80% rise in 6 months. The coin now trades in a tight 0.81 to 1.07 band as traders probe both limits. Market mood is cautious but not dull. The 10-day moving average sits at 0.92 while the 100-day is 0.94, showing little long-term drift. RSI at 39.29 and stochastic at 25.71 hover near oversold levels, hinting that sellers may be tired. MACD reads slightly negative at ‑0.0044, so momentum is flat. Support rests at 0.66 and deeper at 0.41. Resistance looms at 1.17 and then 1.42. If buyers clear 1.07 and pierce 1.17, ADA could climb another 15% to 1.25 and later test 1.42, a 33% leap from now. Losing 0.81 opens a path to 0.66, a 20% slide, and a break there could drag it to 0.41, wiping 50% off today’s level. The tight averages and low RSI tilt odds toward an upside test, yet the coin must close above 1.17 to unlock a fresh rally. SPX6900 (SPX) Source: TradingView SPX6900 fought a sharp pullback. Like many memecoins , the token slid about 21.6% in the last 7 days and 23.1% over the month, yet it still sits 118% above its spot six months ago. It now moves between 1.24 and 1.89, sitting just under the ten day average of 1.41 and the hundred day average of 1.49. Momentum markers near 38 on strength and a single digit stochastic hint at oversold mood. The nearest floor lies at 0.97. If sellers press, a dip toward that zone would shave roughly 30% from today's mid-range quote. A deeper slide to 0.3212 would wipe another 65%. Bulls, though, see room for a snapback. A climb to the first ceiling at 2.27 would mean a gain of around 45%. Clearing that wall opens a path to 2.92, or near 90% upside. Short term pressure favors more churn or a brief flush, yet the outsized half-year surge shows buyers still lurk. If price can reclaim the hundred day average and close above 1.50, the chart tilts higher and 2.27 comes back into play. Failure to hold 1.24 raises the chance of a fast slide toward 0.97 before any fresh rally. Conclusion ETH, ADA, and SPX look strong, but XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth by mixing sports passion, meme buzz, and community control, placing XYZ at the front of the bull run.

Backed by strong H1 2025 results, with $209 million in revenue (up 20% year-on-year) and $170 million in profit, the measure is designed to enhance scarcity and drive long-term value for $MBG token holders. Since its debut on July 22 across MultiBank.io, MEXC, Gate.io, and Uniswap, $MBG has surged to seven times its listing price, quickly becoming one of the most closely followed tokens globally. Under the program, $MBG will be repurchased from the open market and permanently removed from circulation. The framework projects up to $58.2 million in buybacks within the first year and a cumulative $440 million over the initial five years. The Group describes the initiative as both a celebration of its H1 results and a gesture of gratitude to its worldwide client base. “This is our way of thanking our customers and community for their trust,” said Naser Taher, Founder and Chairman of MultiBank Group. “We’ve established a solid foundation in traditional finance, and the rapid adoption of $MBG proves we’re equally ready to lead in digital assets. The token burn program is just the beginning, and we have more major announcements on the horizon.” The $MBG token powers MultiBank’s four-pillar ecosystem: MultiBank TradFi: The Group's traditional CFD powerhouse, which generated $362 million in revenue last year, allows traders to use $MBG for reduced fees and enhanced platform features.

Treasury Turns to Stablecoins as Lifeline,https://coinpaper.com/10599/debt-crisis-averted-treasury-turns-to-stablecoins-as-lifeline,"Quick Highlights Treasury Secretary sees stablecoins as future buyers of U.S. debt, especially short-term bills GENIUS Act requires stablecoins to be fully backed by liquid assets like T-bills Tether alone holds nearly $100B in T-bills — crypto meets fiscal policy Stablecoins Targeted as New Treasury Buyers In a surprising pivot that underscores how deeply crypto has entered mainstream finance, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is eyeing stablecoins as a new cornerstone buyer of government debt . According to the Financial Times , the Treasury has held early talks with leading stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle to encourage them to expand their U.S. Treasury holdings. With federal borrowing costs climbing and foreign demand softening, Washington may now look to the booming stablecoin industry as an unlikely lifeline. GENIUS Act Unlocks Stablecoins as Major Buyers of T-Bills The recent GENIUS Act , signed in July 2025, gave stablecoins long-awaited legal clarity. The law requires stablecoins to be backed 1:1 by high-quality liquid assets like U.S. Treasuries and cash. This means every digital dollar must directly support demand for government debt. Analysts say it’s a clever two-for-one: it protects stablecoin users by tying tokens to the safest assets, while at the same time expanding the buyer base for U.S. debt. Former Fed economist Julia Coronado noted: “Stablecoins could become a structural source of demand for T-bills. It’s not just about crypto—it’s about broadening the Treasury’s investor base.” Tether & Circle Gigantic Holdings Could Shift the U.S. Yield Curve Stablecoins already punch above their weight in bond markets. By early 2025, Tether was holding nearly $100 billion in short-term Treasuries , making it one of the largest non-sovereign buyers in the world. A recent academic paper found that for every 1% increase in Tether’s share of Treasury bills, 1-month yields could drop by 6.3 basis points , saving Washington roughly $15 billion annually in interest costs . With the stablecoin market projected to grow from $250 billion to $2 trillion , that effect could become systemic. Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) and PayPal’s PYUSD are also expected to significantly increase their Treasury exposure. Stablecoins Lower Costs But May Raise Risk in Turmoil Not everyone is convinced this experiment will be risk-free. While stablecoins can reduce government borrowing costs, they may also concentrate financial risk . If a major stablecoin were to lose its peg or face redemption pressure, issuers could be forced to dump Treasuries in bulk—potentially causing a spike in yields and rattling the broader financial system. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has warned of such “cliff-edge dynamics” in past reports. Even Bessent himself has admitted that regulation must strike a balance: strong enough to protect stability but flexible enough to allow innovation. How Stablecoins Became the Dollar’s Digital Lifeline Stablecoins began as a niche solution for crypto traders who needed a dollar substitute. But in 2024, they processed over $28 trillion in payments , outpacing Visa and Mastercard. Global banks are paying attention. Deutsche Bank predicts stablecoins could “reshape the contours of sovereign debt markets” within the decade. Meanwhile, the IMF has urged caution, highlighting risks of dollar dominance expanding through private stablecoins. The irony is striking: what started as an alternative to traditional banking may now become a pillar of U.S. fiscal stability . Will Crypto Save Uncle Sam — or Backfire in a Panic? Treasury’s bet on stablecoins is bold. If successful, it could expand liquidity, lower interest costs, and cement the U.S. dollar’s dominance in digital form. But the risks remain: dependence on crypto markets could expose U.S. debt financing to shocks never before seen in traditional bond markets. For now, Bessent seems confident. With record deficits and strained investors, Washington may have little choice but to welcome stablecoins into the Treasury family.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-20 11:38:11

Backed by strong H1 2025 results, with $209 million in revenue (up 20% year-on-year) and $170 million in profit, the measure is designed to enhance scarcity and drive long-term value for $MBG token holders. Since its debut on July 22 across MultiBank.io, MEXC, Gate.io, and Uniswap, $MBG has surged to seven times its listing price, quickly becoming one of the most closely followed tokens globally. Under the program, $MBG will be repurchased from the open market and permanently removed from circulation. The framework projects up to $58.2 million in buybacks within the first year and a cumulative $440 million over the initial five years. The Group describes the initiative as both a celebration of its H1 results and a gesture of gratitude to its worldwide client base. “This is our way of thanking our customers and community for their trust,” said Naser Taher, Founder and Chairman of MultiBank Group. “We’ve established a solid foundation in traditional finance, and the rapid adoption of $MBG proves we’re equally ready to lead in digital assets. The token burn program is just the beginning, and we have more major announcements on the horizon.” The $MBG token powers MultiBank’s four-pillar ecosystem: MultiBank TradFi: The Group's traditional CFD powerhouse, which generated $362 million in revenue last year, allows traders to use $MBG for reduced fees and enhanced platform features. MEX Exchange (Institutional ECN): This is a $23.7 billion institutional-grade hybrid FX and crypto ECN for emerging markets. $MBG automates settlement, reduces counterparty risk, and enables smart contract-based margin and delivery versus payment (DvP). MultiBank.io (crypto exchange): Regulated across multiple jurisdictions, including the UAE and Australia, the platform offers both spot and leveraged trading. $MBG unlocks reduced costs along with additional utilities such as launchpad access, staking, and token participation opportunities. MultiBank.io RWA: Built on Mavryk’s layer-1 blockchain, this division stems from the world’s largest real-world asset (RWA) tokenization initiative to date, a $3 billion real estate deal with MAG Lifestyle Development. $MBG holders receive fee discounts and early entry to projects. Together, these four pillars are fueling MultiBank’s expansion, momentum that is also reflected in the Group’s growing community of more than 396,000 members on Telegram and over 280,000 followers across its X channels. With more than two million clients, 17+ financial licenses across five continents, and an unblemished compliance record since 2005, MultiBank Group is accelerating its blockchain and DeFi infrastructure to deliver more value-driven initiatives in the months ahead.

Headlines screamed of a “dump,” with over 50,000 BTC ($548 million) shifted in the past week alone. At face value, it looks like Wall Street’s biggest Bitcoin ETF custodian is unloading coins, but the reality is far less dramatic. What’s happening with IBIT Data shows 8,668 IBIT-linked Bitcoin transactions over the past week, with BlackRock’s ETF balance dropping from 562,000 BTC to 511,978 BTC. Individual transfers often ranged around 300 BTC ($35 million each), with larger chunks, such as a 196.55 BTC move worth $22.9 million also spotted. On-chain dashboards captured the movement clearly: balances in BlackRock’s wallet fell in a step-like pattern as assets rotated between addresses. BlackRock: A total of 8,668 IBIT Bitcoin ETF transfers took place. Over the past week, BlackRock carried out 50,375 BTC ETF transfers, bringing its balance down to 511,978. pic.twitter.com/RHyEegO7su — CDD Stamp (@CDDStamp) August 20, 2025 Internal wallet shuffling Despite the dramatic optics, these flows are routine ETF operations. Custodians frequently shuffle coins between cold storage, hot wallets, and counterparties for security and liquidity. Unless BTC is moving directly to exchanges, it does not signal imminent sell pressure. In fact, IBIT still holds all Bitcoin backing investor shares. The fund’s AUM remains intact, this was about wallet management, not liquidation. The timing, however, couldn’t be worse for sentiment. Bitcoin is trading at $113,500, down 5% on the week, as broader risk markets retreat. Traders spooked by the “BlackRock dump” narrative may have amplified the downside, even though fundamentals haven’t changed. Millions in Bitcoin moving from BlackRock’s wallet sounds dramatic. But the real signal to watch is exchange inflows, that’s where true sell pressure emerges. Transfers deeper into custody point to long-term holding, not dumping.

The massive withdrawals, recorded on Tuesday, marked the second-largest daily outflows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs this month, underscoring growing investor caution after weeks of volatile price swings. Fidelity, Grayscale Lead Heavy Withdrawals as Crypto ETFs Face $945M Redemptions According to data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered $523 million in net redemptions, excluding data from Invesco’s BTCO, which has yet to be published. Fidelity’s FBTC bore the brunt with $246.9 million in outflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC lost $115.5 million. Source: SoSoValue Funds operated by Bitwise, Ark Invest, and 21Shares also reported significant outflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the industry’s largest and most closely watched vehicle, reported zero flows for the day, signaling a pause from the dominant player. Ethereum ETFs were not spared, with investors pulling $422.3 million in total. Fidelity’s FETH fund recorded the largest single-day loss with $156.3 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s ETHE, which shed $122 million. The Grayscale Mini Ethereum Trust also lost $88.5 million. The redemptions marked the second-heaviest day of outflows for ether ETFs since their launch earlier this year. Source: SoSoValue The heavy withdrawals come at a time of heightened uncertainty across global markets, with institutional investors trimming risk ahead of key macroeconomic data releases. Bitcoin, which touched a record high of $124,000 just last week, has since tumbled nearly 8% , sliding as low as $112,000 on Wednesday. The broader crypto market followed suit, shedding 1.5% in value to $3.9 trillion. Ethereum dropped 1.2% to $4,162, while XRP fell 3.2% to $2.90, and Solana also moved lower. Bitcoin slid under $113K, dragging the crypto market 1.5% lower to $3.9 trillion as traders booked profits ahead of Powell’s Jackson Hole speech. #bitcoin #JacksonHole https://t.co/jWIc1BA34L — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 20, 2025 Daily flow data highlights the increasingly volatile sentiment. Just last week, on August 14, spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $230.9 million in inflows, their strongest buying activity of the month. Yet, within days, those gains flipped to outflows, including -$121.8 million on August 18 and -$141.4 million on August 15. Source: SoSoValue Cumulative inflows into Bitcoin ETFs still stand at a strong $54.85 billion, with total assets under management at $150.9 billion. However, that figure is down nearly $5 billion from a peak earlier this month, reflecting the pressure of profit-taking. Ethereum ETFs have displayed a similar pattern. July and early August saw surging demand, with inflows frequently exceeding $400 million a day and peaking at $729 million on August 13. That surge pushed cumulative inflows from $7.2 billion to over $11 billion in just two weeks, fueling Ethereum’s rally above $4,300. Source: SoSoValue But since mid-August, the tide has turned, with consecutive days of withdrawals signaling a cooling in sentiment. Even so, cumulative net inflows for Ethereum ETFs remain strong at $12 billion, and daily trading volumes of around $2.7 billion suggest institutions remain heavily engaged in the market. The turbulence has also spilled into the derivatives market, where overleveraged positions have been wiped out en masse. Data from Coinglass shows that more than 128,000 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours alone, with total losses reaching $450.7 million.

Long positions accounted for more than $373 million of the total, underscoring the risks of leveraged bullish bets during periods of heightened volatility. Analysts say the latest correction reflects both the intensity of profit-taking after Bitcoin’s record-setting rally and the natural cooling that often follows surges in institutional inflows. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio climbed to 21% last week, indicating that most holders were sitting on significant unrealized gains, which in turn created strong incentives to sell. BlackRock and Fidelity Control Over 75% of Bitcoin ETFs Market Despite the consecutive crypto ETF outflow, data from CryptoQuant shows that as of August 17, 2025, the funds collectively hold 1.25 million BTC, the highest on record, underscoring continued institutional demand. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominates the sector with 748,968 BTC, or nearly 60% of all ETF-held Bitcoin. Source: CryptoQuant Alongside Fidelity’s FBTC, which holds 199,798 BTC, the two funds control more than three-quarters of the market. Their rapid accumulation has reshaped the competitive landscape once defined by Grayscale. Grayscale’s GBTC, which at its peak held over 620,000 BTC, now sits at 180,576 BTC. While still relevant, it has been overtaken by Wall Street heavyweights that are setting the pace for institutional adoption. The focus has shifted from monitoring GBTC’s outflows to tracking the buying momentum of IBIT and FBTC. Meanwhile, Ether ETFs have gained momentum, with Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noting they turned Bitcoin into the “second best” crypto asset in July. He said Ether ETFs packed “a year’s worth of flows into six weeks,” boosted by stablecoin legislation and a clear narrative around Ethereum’s role as a “killer app.” Ether ETFs Turn Bitcoin Into 'Second Best' Crypto Asset in July.. new from @SirYappityyapp and myself who awarded Ether ETFs as our ETF of the month for July.

Although small compared with this year’s record inflows, the losses reflect caution amid falling prices.

Key Takeaways: AMTD firms proposed a crypto-for-stock swap letting investors exchange Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, BNB, and USDC for newly issued shares. The program is pitched as a bridge between crypto and equities. Market reaction was mixed, with AMTD shares up slightly while AMTD Digital and TGE declined. The initiative, unveiled Tuesday , involves AMTD IDEA (AMTD), AMTD Digital (HKD), and The Generation Essentials Group (TGE). Under the plan, holders of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether (USDT), Binance’s BNB, and USD Coin (USDC) could exchange their tokens for stock, with pricing determined at prevailing market values through mutual agreement. Allocations could be distributed across the three issuers. AMTD Pitches Crypto-to-Equity Bridge for Investors The firms described the program as a “conduit and effective means” to diversify portfolios, positioning it as a bridge between digital assets and the traditional equity markets. The proposal also covers American depositary shares (ADS), giving participants exposure to U.S.-traded securities tied to foreign issuers. AMTD highlighted its broader ecosystem as part of the offering. Headquartered in France with operations in Singapore, the group runs businesses in media, marketing, investments, and hospitality. TGE owns fashion title L’Officiel and The Art Newspaper, alongside entertainment ventures and premium properties. The companies said these assets would be leveraged to deliver VIP experiences, financial education, and leisure opportunities alongside the stock issuances. Despite the ambitious framing, the announcement left many details unresolved. No timeline, investor eligibility criteria, issuance caps, lockup periods, or custody and settlement mechanics were disclosed. The firms stressed that the statement was not an offer or solicitation. Market reaction was mixed. AMTD shares rose 1.9% on the day, while AMTD Digital and TGE fell 3.5% and 6.2% respectively, according to Google Finance data.

Questions remain over how the program would be structured legally and whether it would involve registered offerings, private placements, or offshore transactions. The companies have yet to clarify if U.S. investors would be eligible to participate. Interest in Crypto Listings Surges AMTD’s move comes amid heightened investor interest in crypto listings. Circle’s June debut saw shares surge nearly 10x from the $31 offering price before settling at $149. Earlier this week, institutional exchange Bullish more than tripled from its $37 IPO price on its first trading day, closing near $70 on Friday. Several other crypto firms, including OKX, Grayscale, and Kraken, have either hinted at or initiated plans to go public. Meanwhile, listed industry leaders like Coinbase and MicroStrategy have recently hit multi-year highs. The IPO push comes as the regulatory climate shifts in favor of digital assets. Since President Trump’s return to office in January, the SEC has dropped most cases against crypto firms. The Trump administration has also advanced its pro-crypto agenda with a series of policy and regulatory moves. President Trump signed an executive order urging regulators to remove barriers that prevent 401(k) plans from including alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies.

Alexandre, who exploited his position within his church and the Haitian community, defrauded over 25,000 investors of $262 million while promising guaranteed weekly returns of 5% to 9.99% through non-existent “roboassisted advisor” technology. The civil judgment follows Alexandre’s criminal conviction and n ine-year prison sentence for commodities fraud in July 2023. Alexandre diverted at least $15 million in investor funds to personal accounts, purchasing luxury cars, including a BMW, while his trading platform lost money during 24 of its 30 weeks of operation. Source: Court Document From Church Pulpit to Federal Prison Through Fraudulent Investment Club Alexandre marketed EminiFX as an “ investment club ” offering easy access to cryptocurrency and forex trading using advanced technology that never existed. The unregistered operation attracted tens of thousands of investors between September 2021 and May 2022 through promises of doubling investments within five months. The scheme’s fraudulent nature became apparent through court findings that EminiFX experienced net losses exceeding $49 million despite reporting astronomical returns. Even during its best-performing week, when Alexandre claimed 9.98% returns, actual performance reached only 2.28%. Alexandre’s recruitment strategy heavily exploited his religious position and community standing within the Haitian church network. He enlisted congregation members to help recruit EminiFX investors, leveraging sacred trust relationships to expand the fraudulent operation across ethnic and religious communities. The fake technology claims centered on a “Robo-Advisor Assisted Account (RA3)” that Alexandre promoted as his “trade secret.” CEO of cryptocurrency and forex trading platform sentenced to nine years in prison for $240 million scheme to defraud investors https://t.co/z3zqdIfs1F — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) July 18, 2023 He refused to explain the technology’s workings while guaranteeing it would generate consistent weekly profits through automated trading algorithms. Court documents revealed Alexandre used $155,000 in investor funds to purchase a BMW for himself and spent an additional $13,000 on luxury car payments to Mercedes-Benz. His misappropriation totaled at least $15 million transferred from investor accounts to personal banking and investment accounts. The Ponzi structure became evident as approximately $34 million in withdrawals to earlier investors came from the same commingled pool containing new investor contributions. Many participants withdrew more than their original deposits, while later investors lost everything when the scheme collapsed. Alexandre’s guilty plea in the parallel criminal case established his liability through collateral estoppel, with admissions that reported return figures “were not based on investment returns” and that the promised technology remained non-existent throughout operations. Massive Financial Damage and Regulatory Response The court determined that over eight months of operation, EminiFX collected more than $262 million from tens of thousands of investors while losing money consistently. The scheme’s brief duration contrasted with its massive scale and devastating financial impact on victims. Alexandre’s criminal sentencing in July 2023 included nine years of imprisonment and orders to pay more than $213 million in restitution. The civil judgment added $228.6 million in restitution jointly imposed on both Alexandre and EminiFX, with Alexandre facing an additional $15 million disgorgement for personal enrichment. An equity receiver appointed by the court gained exclusive control over EminiFX assets and developed distribution plans approved in January 2025. CFTC Faces Enforcement Credibility Questions Amid Gemini Controversy The Alexandre judgment comes as allegations have been uncovered from crypto exchange Gemini accusing the CFTC of conducting vindictive “lawfare” campaigns prioritizing career advancement over legitimate regulation. @Gemini files complaint accusing @CFTC of 7-year ""lawfare"" campaign based on false whistleblower claims from discredited former COO who facilitated $7.45 million fraud then sought revenge. #Gemini #Cftc https://t.co/b01m83a4BG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 18, 2025 In June, Gemini filed a complaint with the CFTC Inspector General alleging that enforcement lawyers “selectively and unfairly weaponized” federal law during a seven-year investigation that originated from false whistleblower allegations made by former employee Benjamin Small, who was terminated for facilitating a $7.45 million fraud scheme. Despite a 2022 arbitrator ruling that found Small “fraudulently procured his employment” and “lied repeatedly,” the CFTC continued pursuing Gemini while taking no action against him.

The STH RP, which reflects the average acquisition price of coins moved within the past 155 days, is a key metric for gauging near-term investor positioning. Bitcoin has historically treated the STH RP level as support during bull markets, often retesting it during corrections of 20% to 30% before resuming upward momentum. Since February, BTC has consistently held above this level, with the most recent test in April marking the cycle low at $76,000, a move that coincided with market stress following the announcement of President Trump's new tariffs. Realized Price (RP ) itself, which reflects the average acquisition price across the entire coin supply, has also continued trending upwards. This increase, alongside the rise in STH RP, signals that investors are actively accumulating coins at progressively higher prices, reinforcing structural support for the market. In fact, over the past seven days, both the RP and STH RP have risen by more than 1%, underscoring continued inflows and conviction among buyers. These dynamics reflect an important backdrop for the current correction: while short-term volatility has pressured price action, the rising cost basis of investors suggests that new capital continues to enter the market at elevated levels, absorbing selling pressure and maintaining bitcoin’s longer-term bullish structure.

The first few episodes drew almost no attention. Kotzman had no background in journalism, and his only prior podcast experience was appearing on a friend’s show to discuss his private placement fund. The turning point came a few weeks later, when he interviewed Ryan McGinnis of the Quant Bros — a podcast often seen as the earliest outlet dissecting the bitcoin investment strategy of a company called MicroStrategy (MSTR) . That episode about the company now renamed Strategy, released in early October, racked up 50,000 impressions within half a day and showed Kotzman the potential of his format. The sudden spike was a turning point. What began as a hobby quickly evolved into ""Bitcoin Treasuries,"" a media and events platform Tim now runs with Ed Juline, who previously held roles at Strategy and MARA Digital Holdings (MARA). Together, they are building a space where corporations, investors and service providers can access information that, until recently, was fragmented or opaque. Closing the Information Gap The Quant Bros podcast had already highlighted a key shift in the bitcoin landscape: the information asymmetry around corporate bitcoin treasuries. The idea behind these treasury companies is simple: Buy bitcoin in the open market and hold it as a reserve on the balance sheet. However, there are many nuances related to the process, and the pace at which treasury companies pop up can be overwhelming for investors. The duo realized early on that while Strategy’s (and other subsequent treasury companies') disclosures were public, few outlets contextualized them for a wider audience. In traditional finance and even in crypto, media companies cover earnings, balance sheets, and macro events. But with bitcoin treasury companies, what was missing was clear explanation of their metrics, valuation, and strategic approach. Kotzman and Juline saw the opportunity and built their business around it. As Juline put it, “In bitcoin, you have new players every day, and no clear way to know who to trust. That’s the gap we’re trying to fill.” The AI angle Their approach mirrors bitcoin’s own grassroots trajectory. Just as the largest cryptocurrency spread among the unbanked and early adopters through word of mouth, their work has grown organically through social media, building reach and influence one connection at a time. Rather than launching with mainstream coverage, Bitcoin Treasuries grew from retail interest amplified by social media. Recent shows have attracted millions of viewers across X and YouTube, underscoring how quickly digital distribution can scale conversations. Distributing and sorting through such a large amount of information isn't easy. That's where artificial intelligence (AI) came in. “In one digital conference, I interviewed 42 people in 21 hours,” Kotzman said. To make sure the interviews don't go stale, Kotzman had to move fast, using AI. “AI tools helped us cut and share highlights almost instantly. That’s what takes a conversation from a few hundred people to hundreds of thousands globally.” Reimagining Events The duo also holds events to feed the appetite for information about bitcoin treasuries. Just don't call them conferences. Their first in-person event, named "" Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference ,"" will be held in New York on Sept. 17. Headlined by Strategy’s Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the architect of the Tyson Corner, Virginia-based company's bitcoin buying policy, the event is structured as a town hall rather than a stage of panels. “No slides, no canned speeches,” Juline said. “It’s about letting the audience challenge thought leaders directly.” According to the duo, interest has been global, with attendees registering from Australia, Dubai, Mexico, Switzerland and the U.K. For Kotzman and Juline, this is proof of concept. “Bitcoin is international by nature,” Kotzman noted. “Our job is to connect that community and get useful information into the right hands.” A lasting role Neither sees Bitcoin Treasuries as a short-term play. Advisory work has become an extension of their media presence, linking mid-sized firms with investment banks, custody providers, lawyers, and partners they otherwise might not find. “Big institutions can call Saylor,” Juline said. “Smaller ones can’t. That’s where we come in.” The bigger scope, though, is about distribution. The combination of social media algorithms, AI-driven content production, and a growing appetite for bitcoin knowledge has allowed the two enthusiasts to become essential middlemen to build something lasting in less than a year. “It feels like we tripped into this,” Kotzman said. “But really, it shows how powerful these new tools are. If you hit the right message at the right moment, the whole world can tune in overnight.”",Finance|Bitcoin|Interviews|Digital Asset Treasury|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-20 11:52:58

A key driver of top-line growth was $69.5 million in revenue from the external sale of proprietary SEALMINER A2 rigs, proving the vertical integration thesis is working. The headline net loss of $147.7 million was largely driven by non-cash, fair value changes on derivative liabilities, not a direct drain on core business operations. Bitdeer maintains a strong liquidity position with $299.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $169.3 million in crypto assets, supported by recent convertible note proceeds. Q2 results are in for Bitdeer (NASDAQ: BTDR ). While net loss deepened compared to a year ago, and was a deviation from last quarter's net profit, the results show a company that is deliberately sacrificing short-term profitability in favor of an aggressive, long-term growth strategy. Breaking into hardware manufacturing isn't easy, and I think the main highlight for BTDR investors should be the significant strides the company has made so far, such that sales revenue from ASIC miners were a key driver for Q2’s top line. Here are some of the Q2 earnings figures precis: revenue came in at $155.6 million, with cost of revenue at $142.8 million. Gross margin was squeezed lower at 8.2%, and adjusted EBITDA was $17.3 million. Q2 revenue was a record for Bitdeer, up 57% YoY and 122% sequentially. The cost of revenue also jumped 91% YoY and 136% sequentially. The jump in cost of revenue could be linked to the higher operating and manufacturing expenses that have come with the production of ASIC hardware. The cloud mining segment saw a complete collapse, contributing almost nothing to the top line in Q2. Bitdeer’s record-breaking revenue was not a fluke but a direct outcome of the successful strategic pivot to a vertically integrated model (which began in earnest last year) with the sale of proprietary ASIC miners and a rapid expansion of self-mining operations as the primary drivers. I believe Q2 could be seen as an inflection point, and a repeat of such performance moving forward would be likely sustainable. I'm not saying Bitdeer will always mirror Q2’s triple-digit revenue jump every quarter moving forward, considering seasonality that comes with ASIC shipments and even Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining price volatility influencing the sales from mining, but I believe the company might have found a sustainable ground for its long-term sales revenue mix. SEAL chips and miners release roadmap (Bitdeer) My previous coverages of BTDR in the past year have anchored mostly on the SEALMINER roadmap, from first initiating coverage on BTDR in January last year with a Buy rating based mainly on the company’s vertical integration strategy, the high allocation to R&D, and the prospects the company’s proprietary SEAL chips and SEALMINERs presented. The stock has seen a healthy rally since then and is still currently up over 100% despite volatility in Bitcoin’s price for most of last year. The latest top-line boost as a direct outcome of the vertical integration strategy, with revenue finally materializing from SEALMINER sales, means the initial Buy thesis which was mainly anchored on that vertical integration was correct, and I believe that there is still room for BTDR as a long-term hold in a crypto-stocks portfolio. My latest coverage back in June highlighted the declining sales across all of the company’s segments in Q1 (which was the negative) and then the initial traction from external SEALMINER sales (which was the positive). Despite the “mixed bag” results in Q1, I went a bit contrarian and maintained a Buy rating. And in this piece I’m reiterating a Buy rating despite the deepened net loss in Q2, and here’s why. Looking Beyond The Headline Net Loss The headline net loss does not tell the full operating story. The reported net loss of $147.7 million was mainly driven by non-cash, fair value changes on derivative liabilities, which included a $75.4 million loss from convertible notes and a $15.8 million loss from Tether warrants. This is not a direct cash drain from core business operations. Bitdeer maintained a strong liquidity position as of quarter-end. It held $299.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $169.3 million in crypto assets. Bitdeer also issued $330 million in convertible notes in June, with an option for an additional $45 million. I believe the operational results in Q2 still validate the vertical integration thesis I’ve held on to since initiating BTDR coverage. The company's self-mining hashrate surged to an average of 14.2 EH/s in Q2. It continued to grow, reaching 22.3 EH/s by July . This was possible because the company successfully produced and deployed its own SEALMINERs. The company sold and shipped 5.3 EH/s of A2 rigs to external customers in Q2 alone, with an additional 0.6 EH/s recognized in July. This is proving to be not just a theoretical pipeline. It shows growing ASIC market share and customer acceptance that extended into Q3. Bitdeer’s mining hardware sales cadence is starting to form. We are on track to achieve our previous target of 40 EH/s of self-mining hashrate by the end of October. Furthermore, wafer supply allocation at our foundry has improved and we expect to exceed this target by year end. This will put us on par with the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners in the world. As we continue to scale, our fleetwide energy efficiency will also improve, delivering better mining margins and operating leverage - Haris Basit, Chief Strategy Officer, during the Q2 earnings call . With external sales ramping, Bitdeer’s in-house capacity and fleet efficiency are inflecting at the same time. Bitdeer's fleet efficiency improved from 31.6 J/TH to 25.7 J/TH. That was a noteworthy 18.7% step forward. Fleet efficiency improvement drops unit power costs and expands operating leverage in a way that compounds with scale. With the ongoing efficiency gains and hashrate scaling at the same time, breakeven levels are likely to get more resilient. This makes the self-mining segment less fragile against Bitcoin price cycles (at least until the next Bitcoin halving which is about three years away). Management expects to reach 40 EH/s by late October with possibility of surpassing that target by year-end if wafer allocation improves. They’d be deploying the new mining rigs from their proprietary SEALMINER A3 machines, hence the hashrate sscale progress hinges on their silicon wafer supply. Q2 balance sheet (Bitdeer) Working capital is another piece of the story that looks different once you dig in. Inventory rose to $208.8 million (up from $64.9 million a year ago) and prepayments to $465.2 million. While these numbers look heavy, they are a direct reflection of Bitdeer’s proactive strategy of making advanced payments to suppliers and stocking wafers, chips, and work-in-progress inventory to support mass volume production of the proprietary ASIC miners. The company is stacking wafers, chips, and work-in-progress inventory to support both self mining ramp and the external SEALMINER shipments. This ties up cash in the short term, but also reduces supply chain risk in a tight foundry cycle and secures visibility for both sales and hashrate expansion. I think Bitdeer also benefits from a structural advantage that might be ignored by most of the market. Management can shift ASIC output between external sales and internal self-mining to match cycle conditions. This lets the company maximize gross profit per wafer, not just per unit shipped. Q2 showed both channels working together with self-mining revenue at $59.3 million and external SEALMINER sales at $69.5 million. The company also reallocated machines from its expiring cloud hash rate contracts to its self-mining operations. This is a structural edge over miners who rely on only a single business model, or who have pivoted to high performance computing [HPC] hosting but have not seen an equally significant revenue mix from that segment compared to that from self mining operations. In May, we achieved a key milestone by signing the Letter of Agreement with AEP Ohio for the second phase of power at the Clarington site. This LoA advances the final stages of the contracting process for the full 570 MW of capacity. Critically, this document was executed before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio issued a ruling to classify data centers under an industry-specific billing structure. This new structure would have imposed substantially higher collateral requirements and minimum demand charges. Locking in our position ahead of this monumental regulatory shift allows us to proceed with plans for the full build out of this strategic data center with significantly lower cost structure. - Haris Basit, Chief Strategy Officer, during the Q2 earnings call. There is also an overlooked benefit in how Bitdeer positioned its U.S. expansion. The Letter of Agreement (mentioned during the Q2 earnings call) for the Clarington site in Ohio was signed before new state data-center billing rules that would have imposed higher collateral and demand charges. The timing protects Bitdeer’s cost structure and leaves the door open for HPC hosting and AI cloud services pivot at the site, which would add another non-Bitcoin mining revenue stream on top of the existing power base. Finally, Bitdeer’s product roadmap adds more optionality for the company. The SEALMINER A3 are in the final stages of mass production and are expected to launch next month. Then tape-out for the SEALMINER A4, when the chip design will be sent to a semiconductor foundry for manufacturing, is planned for Q4 2025. The A4 targets a breakthrough efficiency of approximately 5 J/TH at the chip level. If the SEALMINER A4 lands near this J/Th target, I believe it will widen the efficiency gap between Bitdeer’s self mining efficiency and that of several other miners. It will also potentially expand the pricing umbrella for external sales. And this could potentially lift both hardware margins and self-mining returns. In all, Bitdeer’s aggressive roadmap is supported by clear capex visibility through the power and datacenter infrastructure build-out that management has embarked on so far this year. Q2 Capex spend was around $106 million. But on the output and capacity side of it, Bitdeer has energized 361 MW of datacenter capacity year-to-date, bringing total available electrical capacity to 1.3 GW, with a goal of over 1.6 GW by year-end. And this keeps management’s 40 EH/s target and beyond by year end very feasible. Risks The risks facing Bitdeer at this juncture are familiar to growth investors and are tied to Bitdeer's vertical integration strategy and proprietary hardware manufacture. They include inventory obsolescence from next-generation hardware cycles, supply chain bottlenecks from wafer or chip shortages, and volatility in Bitcoin’s price that directly affects the economics of both self-mining and external hardware sales. Execution risk on the SEALMINER roadmap also remains, as delays or underperformance on the A3 or A4 rigs could hurt market confidence. Takeaway Q2 shows that Bitdeer is moving from concept to execution in its vertical integration strategy. The meaningful sales recorded from SEALMINER A2 units are an early proof point that the model works. On top of that, the company’s self-mining is also scaling, with a feasible 40 EH/s target before year end. Efficiency has also improved from 31.6 J/TH to 25.7 J/TH, and the rollout of the A3 rigs and the planned tape-out of the A4 SEALMINER means further efficiency gains and potential margin expansion are still ahead. The balance sheet, bolstered by cash, crypto, and convertible note proceeds, is structured to fund growth at scale. The risks of inventory exposure and Bitcoin volatility look better defended with the efficiency gains, secured wafer allocation, and a broader revenue base that now includes both hardware sales and expanding self-mining output. On these bases, I believe the Buy rating for BTDR remains warranted, and the vertical integration thesis remains intact.",BTC-USD|BTDR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-20 11:53:11

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-chairman-paul-atkins-says-few-cryptocurrencies-can-be-considered-securities-here-are-the-details/,"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins reiterated that he is taking a more moderate approach to cryptocurrency regulation compared to the previous administration. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins: “Very Few Token Securities” Atkins noted that only a “very small number” of crypto assets could be considered securities. “The token itself is not a security, and probably not. In my opinion, very few tokens are securities. The key here is how the token is packaged and presented to investors,” Atkins said at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium on Tuesday. This announcement follows the SEC's launch last month of its “Project Crypto” initiative, which Atkins described as aiming to “modernize securities laws” and move American financial markets on-chain. This project stands in sharp contrast to former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's approach, which defined the majority of crypto assets as securities. “A new era has begun for the crypto industry. We are committed to innovation, and we now want to embrace it,” Atkins said. In a post from his X account, he added, “We must create a framework that protects crypto markets from future regulatory abuse.” The project has also received positive feedback from industry analysts, with Bernstein describing the initiative as “the boldest and most transformative vision ever put forth by an SEC chairman,” while Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said Project Crypto could be the investment roadmap for the next five years. *This is not investment advice.

The attacker sold 9,631 ETH at an average rate of $4,562 and got $43.9 million DAI. Then they reentered the market with $8.64 million DAI, buying 2,109.5 ETH as prices declined. They currently hold 14,436 ETH and 35.29 million DAI, valued at $94.63 million. Radiant Capital Hacker executes profitable ETH swing trading EmberCN, an analyst, tracked the Radiant Capital hacker who utilized stolen money as a trading tactic to earn profits. The hacker sold 9,631 ETH worth on average $4,562 with a profit of 43.937 million DAI alone last week. That was when Ethereum made local highs before the market correction. Source: X post by EmberCN The hacker had been waiting for ETH price pullback in the past few days before implementing the buyback strategy. With $8.64 million DAI in the last hour, they bought 2,109.5 ETH for $4,096 per token. It is a $466 price difference per ETH between buy and sell orders achieving massive arbitrage profits. Current portfolio investments include 14,436 ETH tokens and 35.29 million DAI, with a total value of $94.63 million. The original October 2024 heist was worth around $53 million. The trading plan is like that of experienced market makers, who short at resistance areas and long on support bounces. Volatility in the price of ETH during the range of $4,562 to $4,100 provided perfect conditions for swing trading gains. October 2024 attack netted $53 million The Radiant Capital attack occurred on 16 October 2024 and resulted in an estimated $53 to $58 million loss from user funds. Hackers accessed Radiant’s multisignature wallet system, which was built around a 3-of-11 model requiring three of eleven signers to sign transactions. The hackers were able to steal three private keys, precisely hitting the threshold to access. They were able to update smart contracts and siphon funds from the protocol treasury. Attack planning commenced weeks prior to deployment with buggy contracts rolled out on October 2, 2024. This 14-day attack planning gave attackers time to test systems and strategize extraction techniques. The timing indicates deliberate planning as opposed to opportunistic exploitation.

The new system of illicit-activity alerts, which has been building behind the scenes under the management of TRM Labs, is now officially operational under a broad coalition of law enforcement agencies, exchanges, analysts, individual crypto sleuths and digital assets issuers. Exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase and Kraken have joined issuers and freelance investigators to share real-time information about bad actors, potentially offering an answer to several government efforts to clamp down on costly abuses, TRM announced on Wednesday. As U.S. regulators and Congress actively write legislation and new rulebooks to remedy what's arguably the industry's worst reputational challenge — anti-money laundering controls — TRM Global Head of Policy Ari Redbord said the bad guys are getting ""faster and faster."" ""We need this ecosystem to be locked down, and we need it to be locked down in real time,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview. As long as North Korean hackers can rip off more than $1 billion and launder it faster than the industry can respond, the crypto ecosystem is in trouble, Redbord said. The massive recent theft from the Bybit exchange served as a wakeup call. 'Real-Time interdiction' Beacon, which has already started work identifying a few cases that TRM couldn't yet discuss, is designed as a ""real-time interdiction network"" where membership is non-commercial and doesn't require any existing business relationships between members. The system is supposed to quickly highlight addresses connected to threats and trigger alerts to block bad actors from cashing out illicit assets from scams, frauds, hacks and criminal activity. “There’s no program like Beacon Network,” said Valerie-Leila Jaber, global head of anti-money laundering at Coinbase, in a statement. “It’s a true early-warning system that helps us identify and freeze illicit assets so law enforcement can recover them."" The network's inaugural membership features the prominent exchanges and also includes such names as Robinhood, Ripple, Crypto.com, OKX, Poloniex, Anchorage Digital and payments firms PayPal and Stripe. The list of involved companies is extensive and represents the vast majority of global crypto activity, though missing from the current list are leading stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle. And while TRM assures that most of the key law enforcement entities in the U.S. and around the world are participating, the company said it's unable to name them just yet, apart from the Australian Federal Police. There's some precedence in the realm of traditional finance (TradFi) for public-private intelligence sharing about bad actors , including at the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which runs the FinCEN Exchange for trading information. Automated The crypto sector's project doesn't have a dedicated staff beyond the compliance and investigative personnel already at the involved companies, led by TRM's Chris Wong, an ex-FBI crypto investigator . The network will rely on automation for round-the-clock alerts and transaction delays, which will be followed up by human investigators. The automation is necessary, Redbord said, because the bad actors seek to strike when they're least likely to be spotted. ""They don't sleep, and they know exactly when we are sleeping,"" he said. President Donald Trump has directed his administration to make crypto a top policy priority, and it recently issued a report and recommendations on how to tackle that task, including a directive ""encouraging domestic and cross-border information sharing, greater participation in sharing programs by digital asset financial institutions and improved information sharing between digital asset and traditional financial institutions."" The current draft of a U.S. Senate bill to regulate the crypto markets includes a section on illicit finance that also considers a path for agencies to ""securely share information about potential illicit finance violations and threats and emerging risks."" And the recently passed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act spurred the U.S. Treasury Department to open a comment period this week encouraging the public to submit new ideas for addressing illicit crypto usage. ""This is absolutely the answer to how we can do anti-money laundering and illicit finance investigations way better in crypto,"" Redbord said. He said the network will also delve into artificial intelligence to analyze so-called ""pig butchering"" networks and criminal cartels to potentially be able to anticipate their strategies. And it'll tap independent crypto sleuths such as ZachXBT to raise their own flags. ""There's no ZachXBT for TradFi,"" he said.",Policy|Ari Redbord|TRM Labs|Money Laundering|Regulation|Coinbase|Binance|illicit finance|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-20 12:00:00

The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) traded 1.5% lower on a 24-hour basis, pointing to broad market weakness. The CoinDesk 80 Index (CD80) of next-largest tokens fell 1.4%. Traders are looking to the release of the minutes from the last Federal Reserve policy meeting, scheduled for later Wednesday, while emphasizing the importance of tracking the Treasury General Account, the U.S. government's account with the Fed. The Treasury is in the process of rebuilding the TGA balance, which may pose a risk to asset prices. In key news, Point72 Asset Management and ExodusPoint Capital Management disclosed equity stakes in crypto payments firm Alt5 Sigma on Monday, according to Bloomberg. Derivatives Positioning Leveraged crypto futures bets worth $448 million have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. Most were longs, which means significant bullish leverage has been cleared from the market. Open interest in BTC, DOGE and XRP has declined, indicating that the price drop has yet to trigger a surge in new bearish bets. Meanwhile, LINK, HYPE and SUI have seen increases in open interest, while OI has held flat in ETH, according to data source Coinglass. Perpetual funding rates for most major cryptocurrencies continue to remain mildly positive, indicating a bias towards long positions. The opposite is the case for ADA and XMR. Solana futures open interest on CME remains elevated near record highs above 4.6 million SOL, with the annualized three-month premium rising to 16% from 12% last week. The uptick indicates bullish capital inflows. BTC open interest is beginning to recover, now at 145.76K BTC, the highest since late July. Premium remains below 10%. In ETH's case, the premium again faded the spike above 10%, with open interest approaching the 2 million ETH mark. On Deribit, short-dated (one-week) and near-dated (coming months) BTC and ETH puts continue to trade at a premium to calls, reflecting concerns about downside risks. Flows over the OTC network Paradigm featured increased activity in put options tied to bitcoin and ether, with activity across outrights, spreads, and calendar spread strategies. Token Talk Solana token issuance platform Pump.fun has crossed $800.6 million in lifetime revenue, Dune data shows, mostly from its 1% swap fee, with daily intake averaging over $1 million. This puts it among a small list of platforms earning high revenues in the crypto space. Pump originally collected fees when tokens “graduated” to Raydium, but now earns from its in-house DEX, PumpSwap. The model has proven sticky despite competition. LetsBonk briefly overtook Pump in graduated tokens last month, driven by its Raydium LaunchLab integration and Bonk community push, but lost ground as top memecoin deployers migrated back to Pump. Pump’s token ICO last month raised $600 million in 12 minutes, with the platform now running buybacks above market price to stabilize trading. This is indicative of how the launchpad has become an asset in itself. In contrast, LetsBonk revenue has collapsed to under $30,000 a day from around $1 million earlier this month, showing the volatility of memecoin platforms competing for flow. New entrant Token Mill is trying to stand out with a “King of the Mill” mechanism in which fees are used to buy and burn the highest-volume token every 30 minutes. The aim is to gamify volatility as a growth loop. Solana, meanwhile, lost its crown as the dominant memecoin chain to Coinbase's Base, which has tied token issuance into decentralized social media via Zora. On Monday, Base hosted nearly 58,000 new memecoins versus 33,000 on Solana.",Markets|Markets|market analysis|Derivatives|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-20 12:00:00

The crypto exchange revealed the details of this agreement in its IPO filing, with the amount expected to be used to finance some costs that may arise during the public offering. Details Of Ripple’s Agreement With Gemini In its IPO filing with the SEC, Gemini revealed that it entered into a credit agreement with Ripple in July. Under the agreement, the crypto exchange can make lending requests of no less than $5 million each, and up to an aggregate commitment amount of $75 million. Furthermore, the initial commitment of $75 million can be increased or decreased from time to time, subject to the attainment of certain metrics that both parties have agreed on. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Says Next Project Is ‘Production Ready’, What Is It? However, the aggregate commitment of the credit agreement between Gemini and Ripple cannot exceed $150 million, meaning that is the maximum credit that the crypto exchange can request from the crypto firm. Once Gemini exceeds the initial commitment of $75 million, then it will need to make lending requests in the form of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which the crypto firm has to consent to. Gemini revealed that all its lending requests under the Ripple credit agreement must be secured by collateral. It shall also bear an interest rate per annum of 6.50% or 8.50% and must be repaid in USD. Although some details were redacted, the crypto exchange indicated that it has also received some amount from Ripple under the agreement. With this, Ripple has become a major backer for Gemini’s IPO, which is expected to take place soon. Notably, the crypto exchange’s financials in the IPO show that it posted net losses over the quarters that span back to March 2023. In just the first half of this year alone, Gemini has recorded a net loss of $282 million. Details Of The Gemini IPO With Ripple’s backing, Gemini plans to offer shares of its Class A common stock, although it has yet to reveal how many shares will be available in the IPO. The crypto exchange has yet to provide details on how much these IPO shares are likely to sell for each. However, it revealed that it has applied to list these Class A common stock on the Nasdaq stock market under the symbol “GEMI.” Related Reading: Ripple CTO Says XRP Ledger Has Been Battle-Tested To Power World’s Financial System Furthermore, the lead underwriters for the Gemini IPO are Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, with support from other firms such as Morgan Stanley and Cantor. Gemini’s IPO plans follow the successful execution of crypto exchange Bullish’s IPO, in which the exchange raised $1.15 billion after selling its shares for $37 each. Gemini will be looking to record similar success, considering the massive crypto demand among traditional finance (TradFi) investors.

With the convenient experience of “mining anytime, anywhere”, it has quickly attracted a large number of XRP (Ripple) holders and become a new trend in the crypto mining industry. Why do XRP holders favor Ripplecoin Mining Mobile Cloud Mining? Easy mining, anytime, anywhere Ripplecoin Mining ‘s mobile-optimized features allow users to mine without a computer, using only a mobile app or browser. Whether commuting, traveling, or taking a break, XRP holders can monitor their earnings and adjust their strategies at any time. Low investment threshold and flexible solutions The platform offers a variety of mining plans, ranging from small deposits as low as 40 XRP to high-yield long-term contracts, to meet the needs of different users. Newcomers can try short-term mining first, then increase their investment once they become familiar with the model, reducing the cost of trial and error. Stable returns, higher than traditional financial management Compared with bank savings or traditional financial products, Ripplecoin Mining’s cloud mining returns are more attractive, especially during periods of XRP price fluctuations, where stable mining returns can effectively hedge market risks. Secure and transparent, computing power can be verified Ripplecoin Mining uses enterprise-level mining machine hosting, and computing power data is available on the chain. Users can monitor the operating status of the mining machine in real time through their mobile phones to eliminate the problem of “false computing power”. A new option for XRP holders: earning income without selling coins As one of the world’s leading crypto assets, XRP has attracted a large user base due to its widespread use in cross-border payments and high-speed transaction performance. However, due to price volatility and regulatory uncertainty, many investors struggle to achieve stable returns by holding the cryptocurrency for the long term. Ripplecoin Mining’s mobile cloud mining model provides XRP holders with a new passive income channel: without having to sell XRP assets, you can open a cloud computing power contract and obtain substantial returns every day. Ripplecoin Mining: Start mining with your phone One of the biggest highlights of Ripplecoin Mining is its fully mobile mining support. Users only need to: Register an account and receive free mining start-up funds from the platform ; Use XRP or mainstream cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.) to activate the computing power contract; Select an appropriate contract period (e.g. 2 days, 15 days, 40 days, etc.); Daily income is automatically settled into your account and can be withdrawn or reinvested at any time. Examples of some popular mining contracts: Trial Contract: $100 investment, 2-day term, daily return $5, return $110 at maturity Classic Hashrate: $500 investment, 5-day term, daily return $6.5, return $532.5 at maturity Classic Hashrate: $1500 investment, 10-day term, daily return $20.25, return $1702.5 at maturity Classic Hashrate: $5300 investment, 15-day term, daily return $77.38, return $6460.7 at maturity Advanced Hashrate: $11,000 investment, 24-day term, daily return $178.2, return $15,276.8 at maturity Advanced Hashrate: $98,000 investment, 40-day term, daily return $2107, return $182,280 at maturity For more contract options, please refer to the Ripplecoin Mining contract page: https://ripplecoinmining.com User reviews “I used to just sit my XRP in my wallet and watch it fluctuate. Now, through Ripplecoin mining, I earn XRP every day. My principal is safe, and I also get extra cash flow.” —David M., a long-term XRP investor from Canada “The Ripplecoin Mining app is incredibly easy to use; I learned how to use it in just minutes. Even crypto newbies can easily start earning money.” —Lucy J., a digital asset manager in Singapore Conclusion For every XRP holder, Ripplecoin Mining is more than just a mining platform; it’s a tool for converting idle digital assets into stable daily returns.

50387252,560192,1755691252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50387252.jpeg,Is The Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Completely Broken Or Will The Rally Continue?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-4-year-cycle-broken/,"A number of developments have led to speculations that the established 4-year Bitcoin cycle that has often predicted when the bull and bear market starts and end has ended. If this is the case, it would mean that price action will not go as expected. Just as it seems there was a premature start to the bull market, it is possible that there would be a premature start to the bear market as well. Developments That Threaten The 4-Year Cycle The 4-year cycle coincides with the Bitcoin halving, which happens every four years when block rewards for miners are cut in half. Historically, the bull market has only begun after the Bitcoin halving is completed, with the BTC price hitting a new all-time high a year after the halving. Then, the bear market follows after all-time high levels and continues until the next halving. This has been the case for the last three cycles, until 2024, when everything changed. The year 2024 was the last halving year, and the expectation was that the Bitcoin price would hit new all-time highs a year later, in 2025. However, with the advent of Spot Bitcoin ETFs , which were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024, the BTC price exploded and soared to new all-time highs months before the scheduled halving. As the year progressed, so did the BTC price, and after the halving was completed on April 20, the price pushed forward. By December 2024, the price had already crossed $100,000, almost doubling the value of its $69,000 all-time high from the previous cycle. Not only are Spot Bitcoin ETFs driving the BTC price, but there was also the entrance of Bitcoin treasury companies . This was started by Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy), which started buying BTC in 2020. Fast forward to 2025, and the company now holds over $74 billion worth of BTC, with the latest buy of 430 BTC announced on Monday. Given the entrance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and over 100 Bitcoin treasury companies, none of which have existed in previous cycles, it seems BTC has now entered into uncharted territory. This could effectively end the 4-year cycle with billions of dollars pouring into the market at an unprecedented rate. What If The Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Is Still Intact? Frank Fetter, a quant at Vibe Capital Management, has expressed what could be next if the Bitcoin 4-year cycle is intact. As he points out, traditionally, there has been an average of 1,060 between Bitcoin making a bottom and then making a top in the bull market. Currently, BTC is only approximately 1,000 days from its 2022 bottom, meaning there are still a couple of months to go. This could mean that there is some runway left for Bitcoin to hit new all-time highs before the next bear market rolls around. “If the traditional four-year cycle continues, the next 100 days could be interesting,” Fetter stated.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin 4 year cycle|Bitcoin Cycle|Bitcoin Halving|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 12:00:52

Wall Street analysts, led by Bitwise CIO Matthew Sigel, expect BTC price to rally to new ATH before the end of year. Traders have a high conviction of a 25bps Fed rate cut in September amid executive pressure. The fleet of United States spot Bitcoin ETFs has officially reached a new all-time high, with total holdings surging to a landmark 1.25 million coins. The meteoric growth, which now sees the ETFs holding more BTC than Satoshi Nakamoto’s fabled 1.1 million coin stash , is being driven by Wall Street titans BlackRock and Fidelity.

The second-largest cryptocurrency is now up nearly 30% year-to-date, testing bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance in a way not seen since late last year. This time, however, ether is taking market share rather than ceding it, the report said. Spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a surge of demand. Cumulative net inflows now top $13 billion, up from just $2.6 billion in April, analysts Alex Saunders and Nathaniel Rupert wrote. As ETF balances grow, flows are playing a more direct role in price dynamics, the analysts said. Ether treasury firms have also joined the bid, with large purchases beginning in May. Their collective holdings now hover near $10 billion at current market values, while the equity valuations of these companies have expanded alongside ether’s rally, the report noted. Blockchain data shows large wallets accumulating ether while smaller investors trim exposure. Ether balances on centralized exchanges continue to decline, signaling a shift of supply back on-chain. This dynamic could be amplifying the latest leg higher, creating a squeeze-like effect, the report added. While the rally has been sharp, the bank's analysts caution it isn’t purely technical. On-chain activity has picked up, reinforcing the move with stronger fundamentals. Combined with a macro backdrop that resembles a “goldilocks” environment, neither too hot nor too cold, ether's resurgence could have legs, particularly with supportive regulatory signals and bullish narratives in play.

Detailed by XRPgenerationale on X, this breakdown played out exactly as market data confirmed: a firm U.S. dollar and rising yields spooked risk appetite; whale movements into exchanges flooded fragile order books; and heavy leverage magnified the decline into a cascade. Macroeconomic Headwinds Set the Stage The trigger came from traditional markets. Hotter inflation data and muted rate-cut expectations emboldened the U.S. dollar and pushed yields higher, sapping support for risk assets—cryptocurrencies being among the first to react. In such a climate, dip-starters held back, making the market increasingly vulnerable to a downside push. Most people see red candles and scream manipulation. Here’s the cleaner read on why the market crashed today: 1/ Macro shock Hotter inflation and soft rate-cut odds tightened financial conditions. Stronger USD + higher yields = risk assets wobble first. pic.twitter.com/MR7ifgAqRl — XRPGENERATIONALE (@XRPGENERAT) August 19, 2025 Liquidity Constraints Turn Pitch into Plunge Already fragile, the crypto market’s structure accelerated the move. Weekend and off-hour trading saw thin liquidity across exchanges, meaning even moderate sell orders punched through key levels. Indeed, on-chain data flagged surging whale deposits to exchanges ahead of the slide—injecting excess supply just when depth was weakest and prompting a swift collapse. Derivatives Explosion and Forced Liquidations Derivatives positioning added fuel. Elevated open interest and overcrowded longs created a tinderbox: once the price dipped, forced liquidations spread rapidly across XRP and other alts. Simultaneously, clustered gamma exposures near vital strikes prompted dealers to hedge by selling spot and futures , intensifying the bleed. Cross-Asset Correlation Amplifies Pain XRP’s drop didn’t happen in isolation. As equities declined and the dollar strengthened, cross-asset systematic strategies triggered widespread deleveraging. With crypto increasingly tethered to broad financial flows, XRP’s correction was part of a larger domino effect.

Without fresh catalysts, even good news failed to elicit sustainable demand, leaving the market stuck in downward momentum until positions reset. Market Snapshot Fresh data underscores the severity of this move: according to CoinMarketCap , XRP is trading around $2.89, down approximately 4.13 % over 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of about $7.1 billion, and a market capitalization of $171.9 billion. These figures point to high activity amidst declining prices—typical of a forced unwind rather than a calm, distribution-led decline. What May Signal a Change in Tide The recovery path hinges on measurable indicators: a decline in derivatives funding rates, renewed stablecoin net issuance, and mounting spot inflows would suggest stabilization. Rising funding after an initial bounce, conversely, would warn that leverage remains exposed. On-chain flows—especially exchange balances and open interest trends—should be watched closely to gauge lasting strength. Final Thoughts The breach below $3 wasn’t the handiwork of a single culprit, but rather the product of macro tightening, liquidity thinness, structural vulnerabilities, and leveraged derivative dynamics. As XRPgenerationale astutely observed, this was a classic cascade—not manipulation. Traders who weather the storm should wait for clear data-backed resets before re-entering.

The firm issued a statement late Tuesday on X, rejecting allegations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had opened an inquiry into its activities or those of Isaac, who was accused of being part of its executive team. ALT5 Sigma has been made aware of reports in the press and on social media. For the record: Jon Isaac is not –– and never was –– the President of ALT5 Sigma and he is not an advisor to the company. The company has no knowledge of any current investigation regarding its activities… — ALTS (@ALT5_Sigma) August 19, 2025 “For the record: Jon Isaac is not, and never was, the President of ALT5 Sigma and he is not an advisor to the company,” the post read . “The company has no knowledge of any current investigation regarding its activities by the US SEC.” The statement was intended to distance ALT5 from an article published by news agencies, The Information and Coinpedia, that linked the company’s $1.5 billion fundraiser, also linked to WLFI, to possible insider dealings. Jon Isaac refutes reports of SEC probe Shortly after ALT5’s post, Isaac himself responded on X, denying he held an executive position with the company or faced an investigation. “ Setting the record straight on reports from Coinpedia and The Information: I am NOT the president of ALT5 Sigma and I am NOT under SEC investigation mentioned in these reports,” he wrote. Isaac went on to say that he is the chief executive of Live Ventures Incorporated, a Nasdaq-listed firm trading under the LIVE ticker, and said any regulatory issues involving Live had been disclosed in public filings. “ I took over ALT5’s predecessor company, years ago, in a hostile takeover. I am a big believer and supporter of ALT5 Sigma, want nothing but the best for the company, and am a large shareholder owning over 1 million shares in ALT5 ,” the post concluded. Reports mention Isaac was part of $1.5 billion treasury deal According to The Information, Isaac’s name appeared in filings that showed earnings inflation and insider share sales following ALT5’s $1.5 billion treasury deal to purchase WLFI tokens. The transaction was flagged because of its links to World Liberty Financial . ALT5 entered into a private placement agreement alongside a registered direct offering, covering 100 million shares at $7.50 each, a price structured in accordance with Nasdaq rules. Isaac has profusely denied holding any position within the company, but a December disclosure showed the firm engaged him under a two-year consulting agreement that began in March 2024. He advised the financial institution on several matters, including but not limited to financial restructuring, client acquisition, and product development. The documents seen by The Information states that he made weekly update calls to ALT5’s management. The arrangement included a $540,000 promissory note, which Isaac later converted into 465,753 ALT5 Sigma shares, along with accrued interest, in December. The crypto firm’s shares slid 10.5% on Tuesday to $10.48, according to Yahoo Finance, before falling further, now trading at $5.39 in US Wednesday pre-market session. Politicians slam Trump family ties to WLFI ALT5 Sigma’s connections to the Trump family have been the talking point for critics of the President’s family business, both in financial and political circles. Eric Trump joined the company’s board during the latest funding round, and Zach Witkoff, the chief executive of World Liberty Financial and son of Trump ally Steve Witkoff, was named chairman of ALT5’s board of directors, Cryptopolitan reported on August 13. Attorneys for the firm have lambasted a “fundamentally flawed” inquiry led by liberal Senators Richard Blumenthal and Maxine Waters, who claim there is a conflict of interest in the ties between the firm and President Donald Trump’s digital asset venture WLFI.

The sell-off comes after markets briefly rallied Tuesday on the back of talks held in Washington between U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and senior European officials, according to CNBC . By 8:20 a.m. in London, the Stoxx 600 index was already down 0.3%, with every major European sector in the red. This followed Tuesday’s green session, when markets initially responded positively to the outcome of Trump’s White House meeting with Zelenskyy and a bloc of European leaders. But that enthusiasm didn’t carry into Wednesday, especially for the defense sector, which was already losing ground the day before. The Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index shed another 0.9% in early trading, after already dropping 2.6% during Tuesday’s session. Germany’s Rheinmetall fell 1.8%, and Hensoldt was down 1.9%. In the UK, Rolls-Royce lost 1.9%, while Qinetiq dropped 2%. These names were among the weakest in the index, despite the fact that Rheinmetall had been one of the top performers in the DAX earlier in the year. Diplomacy triggers retreat from defense names “Speculation about a diplomatic breakthrough meant that European assets saw some sizeable moves [on Tuesday], particularly those most affected by the conflict,” said Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a Wednesday morning note. The weakness in defense came as markets digested hotter-than-expected U.K. inflation data , which showed consumer prices rising 3.8% in the year to July. The print initially pushed the British pound higher against the U.S. dollar, before it erased gains and settled flat. Long positions on European gas futures were also getting wiped out. In the last five weeks, net-long bets on Dutch gas futures dropped over 50%, the steepest five-week decline since February, just as storage across the region filled up fast ahead of winter, easing supply fears that spiked earlier in the stockpiling season. Gas futures and inflation fears collide with debt pressure Last week, gas futures fell to their lowest in over a year. Still, European gas prices are trading above pre-crisis levels from before the Russia-Ukraine war that began three years ago. At the start of the stockpiling season, traders were worried. Storage was low, and new geopolitical tensions, including a surge in fighting in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, kept prices elevated. But now, the sentiment has flipped. Funds are pulling out, storage is strong, and prices are falling. This energy unwind is happening alongside deeper issues in global debt markets. Investors are warning that the world has entered a phase of “fiscal dominance,” where central banks face mounting pressure to keep interest rates low, not to manage inflation, but to help governments manage their exploding debt burdens. That pressure is loudest in the United States, where Trump is calling on the Federal Reserve to cut rates in order to reduce interest payments on the national debt. Central banks in Japan, the UK, and across Europe are also being squeezed. In America, the gap between two-year and 30-year Treasury yields has widened to levels not seen since early 2022. Short-term yields are falling on expectations of rate cuts, while long-term yields remain high, driven by market concerns about inflation and future debt loads. In the UK, the picture is even worse. 30-year gilts are now yielding 5.6%, the highest in over 25 years. By comparison, 30-year U.S. Treasuries are around 4.9%. The spike reflects how tight things have gotten. Government borrowing continues, but the cost of carrying that debt is putting both central banks and financial markets under serious pressure.

This represents a significant shift from earlier positions, with Federal Reserve Chair Michelle Bowman openly urging banks to participate. She shared at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium on August 19 that she believes that if banks stay on the sidelines, innovative blockchain technology will move on without them, making the traditional banking sector less relevant in the long run. To support this, the Fed has even removed ‘reputational risk’ from its bank supervision guidelines, which should make banks more comfortable working with legal crypto companies. Bowman advocates for a new era where banks are active participants in the digital asset space, not just cautious observers. A Fresh Approach to Crypto Regulation Bowman laid out a new plan with four key principles to guide the Fed’s approach. First is regulatory certainty, which aims to give banks and crypto firms clear rules so they know where they stand. This helps them invest in new technology without the fear of sudden rule changes. Next is tailored regulation, meaning supervisors should look at each case individually instead of using a rigid one-size-fits-all approach. Third is consumer protection, which ensures that all digital asset products follow existing laws to protect customers from unfair practices. Finally, American competitiveness is all about making sure the U.S. remains a global leader in financial technology. Bowman believes that by creating a supportive regulatory environment, the U.S. can attract the best talent and innovation. To top it all off, the Fed is even going to let its staff hold small amounts of digital assets to gain a hands-on understanding of the technology. This new mindset shows that the Fed is no longer viewing crypto as a threat, but as a potential partner in building a more modern and efficient financial system. And if we’re talking about efficiency, we have to mention Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , one of the best crypto presales out there. Unlock Bitcoin’s True Potential Bitcoin is a legend, no doubting that, but if we’re being honest, its old-school tech has some issues. Transactions can be slow, fees can be sky-high, and it can’t handle the latest innovations like DeFi apps or NFTs. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to change that. It’s a new Layer 2 network acting like a superhighway built right on top of Bitcoin. It lets you send money and use apps at blazing speeds with tiny fees, all while keeping the rock-solid security of the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) transforms Bitcoin from a slow and steady tortoise into a powerful, flexible, and speedy hare of a platform for all sorts of new users. It tackles Bitcoin’s biggest flaws head-on, from its limited transactions per second to its lack of native smart contract support. By moving transactions off the main chain and settling them later, Bitcoin Hyper offers a real solution for high-volume cases, finally making Bitcoin practical. Don’t miss your chance to buy $HYPER now for $0.012765 . Hurry, as a price increase is coming in the next 2 days! Check out our guide to help you through the buying process . The Best of Both Worlds: Bitcoin Meets Solana Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has a killer feature that sets it apart: it uses the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Bitcoin gives you the ultimate security, and the SVM gives you the ultimate speed. By combining them, Bitcoin Hyper allows developers to build super-fast, scalable smart contracts and dApps that can handle thousands of transactions per second, something that was impossible on native Bitcoin. A decentralized Canonical Bridge makes it super easy and safe to move your $BTC to the Hyper network and back again. The $HYPER token is the fuel for this whole ecosystem, used for paying transaction fees, earning rewards through staking, and even having a say in how the project runs. It even offers you passive rewards just for staking your tokens, currently sitting at 101%, but this is a dynamic rate that alters throughout the presale, so get in early to secure the highest return. It’s the perfect mix of Bitcoin’s legendary trust and Solana’s groundbreaking performance, creating a brand-new playground for innovation. In our price prediction , we think it could reach $0.32 by the end of this year, seeing a massive ROI of 2406% if you invest now. Crypto’s New Dawn: A Call to Action The Federal Reserve’s policy shift isn’t just a headline; it’s a green light. By telling banks to embrace crypto and removing ‘reputational risk,’ the Fed signals a new era of mainstream adoption. The tectonic shift validates the purpose of projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which are building the bridges between traditional finance and the decentralized future. Bitcoin Hyper isn’t just a new token; it’s a key part of infrastructure built to address Bitcoin’s biggest issues and keep it relevant in today’s financial system. The merging of regulatory support and technological innovation creates a strong flywheel effect. Projects already leading the way, like Bitcoin Hyper, could see significant benefits. As the financial world shifts, it’s time to do your own research and observe how the landscape is evolving. The future isn’t approaching; it’s already here, driven by innovation.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 12:16:03

Analyst Xaif Crypto links the transfer to intensifying ODL flows after the SEC’s green light for XRP, reinforcing confidence in Ripple’s payment rails and hinting at a pivotal shift in XRP’s role in global finance. The scale of this transaction signals renewed institutional demand for real-time XRP liquidity. Ripple’s ODL, built on XRP as a bridge asset, thrives on fast, low-cost transfers, and with fresh regulatory clarity, institutions appear more confident in moving large holdings through its liquid ecosystem, a shift that could redefine global liquidity flows. Here are three key implications of this development: Institutional Confidence Restored : The SEC’s supportive stance, formal or informal, may represent a breakthrough for institutional investors wary of regulatory ambiguity. This XRP movement could be the first of many bold transactions, as institutions recalibrate their strategic asset allocations toward XRP-enabled cross-border operations. ODL Gains Traction : XRP’s primary utility in facilitating real-time cross-border payment flows positions it as a logistical backbone for institutional liquidity operations. Increased ODL usage could reinforce the XRPL’s role in global remittance corridors, fostering a virtuous cycle of adoption. Market Dynamics to Watch : A transaction of this scale has the potential to nudge XRP’s broader market narrative, be it through price impact, network activity, or liquidity dynamics. While speculative ripple effects remain uncertain, the sheer visibility of such a move could invigorate broader confidence in XRP-driven infrastructure. Why Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Believes Amazon and Uber will Use XRP Brad Garlinghouse is doubling down on a bold vision: giants like Amazon and Uber will one day run payments on XRP. Far from empty rhetoric, his case rests on three accelerating 2025 trends, enterprise pilots gaining traction, strategic infrastructure scaling, and fading regulatory hurdles, making large-scale corporate adoption more credible now than ever before, as highlighted by crypto pundit John Squire. First, Ripple is shifting from proofs-of-concept to real enterprise collaborations. Amazon Web Services (AWS) already features Ripple case studies, and teams have openly explored how XRP can accelerate settlement and liquidity across merchant and cloud services, clear signs that Amazon is testing tangible integration scenarios, not just talking points. Secondly, Ripple is building the infrastructure needed for adoption at scale. In 2025, it unveiled major acquisitions to deliver institutional-grade custody, prime broking, and stablecoin rails, including the $1.25 billion Hidden Road prime-broker deal and the planned purchase of Rail, a stablecoin payments firm. These moves position Ripple to handle corporate treasury, marketplace payouts, and cross-border settlements seamlessly, eliminating many of the operational hurdles companies like Amazon or Uber would face. Thirdly, regulatory risk, which is the biggest hurdle for Fortune 500 treasurieshas eased. Since mid-2025, Ripple has shifted away from cross-appeals toward direct regulatory engagement, a move Garlinghouse says clears the path for mainstream financial integration. With legal uncertainty reduced, corporate risk committees are now more likely to approve pilots using tokenized liquidity. Therefore, for giants like Amazon and Uber, the case for XRP is practical, such as instant cross-currency settlement, lower FX, and float costs on global payouts like driver earnings and vendor settlements. Garlinghouse isn’t suggesting they’ll ditch fiat overnight, but that they’ll pilot tokenized settlements where efficiency wins, and Ripple is building the secure, auditable infrastructure to make it possible. Conclusion Garlinghouse envisions a turning point where XRP evolves from a trader’s asset to an enterprise-grade payments solution. With infrastructure maturing, regulatory barriers easing, and corporations demanding faster, cheaper settlement, Ripple is positioning XRP to drive the next wave of digital commerce, with Amazon and Uber likely among the first real-world test cases. Meanwhile, the transfer of 200 million XRP worth $601 million is more than a routine on-chain move, it’s a clear signal of rising institutional momentum. With the SEC’s green light easing regulatory barriers and ODL adoption accelerating, XRP is positioning itself as a cornerstone for real-time global payments.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-20 12:16:16

Is SOL About to See a Major Price Spike as Bullish Bets on Solana Stablecoins for $1.15B Capital Raise?,https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-season-on-is-sol-about-to-see-a-major-price-spike-as-bullish-bets-on-solana-stablecoins-for-1-5b-capital-raise/,"SOL has dipped to $181 today, with the cryptocurrency market as a whole falling ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole meeting later this week. This means that the Solana price has now fallen by 8.5% in the past week, while it’s also down by 5% in the last 30 days. These are disappointing percentages, but there are reasons to believe that the coin will recover strongly in the medium- and long-term, with crypto-exchange Bullish announcing yesterday that it will raising $1.15 in Solana-based stablecoins. This is a massive vote of confidence in Solana and its ecosystem, and when combined with its recent momentum and its fundamentals, it points to a very promising long-term SOL price prediction . Altcoin Season On? Is SOL About to See a Major Price Spike as Bullish Bets on Solana Stablecoins for $1.15B Capital Raise? Announcing the move yesterday, the exchange explained that it will receive the proceeds of its hugely successful IPO in stablecoins, with “the vast majority minted for Bullish on the Solana network.” Bullish has arranged to receive $1.15 billion of proceeds from its recently completed initial public offering in stablecoins, which represents a historic step for the use of stablecoins in an initial public offering in the United States. https://t.co/hh9i22RS9I — Bullish (@Bullish) August 19, 2025 Commenting for Bullish’s press release, Solana Foundation President Lily Liu framed the announcement as a hugely significant moment in Solana’s relatively short history. She said, “Bullish’s use of stablecoins in its IPO merges public market infrastructure with blockchain rails, and highlights Solana’s unique position to power a new era of market efficiency and innovation.” However, as positive as the announcement is for Bullish, Solana and crypto more generally, it coincided with a disappointing day for markets, which have suffered amid fears that the Fed may once again refuse to budge on interest rates. But if we look at Solana’s chart, we see that it’s nearing a bottom, and may rebound again very soon. For instance, its relative strength index (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have both turned negative today, nearing a point where they will have nowhere else to go but up. Source: TradingView What we also see is that a bullish pennant has been forming since mid-July, setting SOL up for a big move in either direction. Given that the coin is still down on its ATH, and given its recent positive news, it’s highly likely that this move will be upwards. Assuming that the Fed’s meeting this week brings positive news, the SOL price could pass $200 again next week, before reaching $300 in Q4. Wall Street Pepe Beats Market with 10% Jump It’s not only Solana-based stablecoins that have proven popular in recent months and years, but also Solana-based meme tokens. In fact, meme coins have been one of the key ingredients in Solana’s growth, with the blockchain commanding the lion’s share of meme token trading volume . It continues to witness new coin launches on a daily basis, and one exciting new addition to its chain is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE), an Ethereum-based coin that’s launching a SOL-based version of itself.

At $0.00005375, it’s actually up by just over 250% since the end of May, making it one of the best-performing tokens over this period. Its gain today has followed from the news that it’s launching a Solana-based version of its coin, which investors can buy directly from its official website before launch. They can buy the Solana-based version of the coin either with fiat or crypto, or by depositing their holdings of the Ethereum-based version. Wall Street Pepe is planning a variety of exchange listings to coincide with the launch, something which could boost its price substantially in the coming days and weeks. And it will also burn its Ethereum-based supply in proportion to the amount of Solana-based tokens it sells, helping to maintain its price.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are attempting to establish an interim low around $113,000, but the effort appears weak in terms of both price and volume. So far, the bounce has been barely notable, with upside capped above $114,000. Additionally, volumes have stayed low relative to what we observed during the early Tuesday drop, as seen on the hourly chart. The weak bounce is consistent with bearish momentum signals, as the 50-, 100-, and 200-hour simple moving averages (SMAs) are aligned in descending order and trending downward. On the daily chart, prices have convincingly broken below the rising trendline support, signaling a shift from bullish to bearish momentum. Both the longer-term MACD histogram (50,100,9) and the more commonly used MACD (12,26,0) are showing increasing negative momentum, with deeper bars below the zero line. Therefore, the odds appear to be stacked in favor of a continued move lower. The first level of support is $11,982, from which the market turned higher on Aug. 3. The 100-day SMA is seen at $11,053. If these levels are taken out, the focus would shift to the 200-day SMA at $100,484. A convincing move above the 50-day SMA at $116,033 would negate the bearish outlook.

The company now generates revenue from staking its $300M SUI holdings, but future revenue opportunities remain uncertain and depend on execution. Risks include shareholder dilution and the speculative nature of crypto assets, especially with shares trading at a premium to NAV. Given the early-stage and premium valuation, I rate MCVT as a Hold and recommend monitoring future quarters for clarity on the Treasury model. Mill City Ventures III, Ltd. ( MCVT ) had an unexpected rally in its stock price this summer. MCVT 1M Price History (Seeking Alpha) Up about 4X over the past month, MCVT is another company that has adopted a crypto treasury strategy, this time for SUI ( SUI-USD ). Not even a full month into it, a lot remains to be seen. For now, the premium to NAV precludes a Buy rating. Old Business Prior to the shift, MCVT was a Minnesota-based, non-bank lender. They primarily made money by issuing high-interest, short-term loans. Portfolio of Investments (2024 Form 10K) With a small base of capital, these loans were usually just invested in a handful of positions. Similarly, they didn't generate significant revenue. Income Statement (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) For the six months ended June, this year and last, investment income only came to about $1.7M, up about $1M after operating expenses. MCVT's market cap of $599M market cap therefore cannot be explained by small-scale, compound interest. Shift To SUI Treasury The rally in MCVT's price occurred upon the announcement of a $450M private placement of new shares at $5.42 per share. A $500M equity line was also announced at the start of August. Already, MCVT is the biggest it's ever been. In the first release, they explained their purpose with these moves: “We're launching at a pivotal moment when both institutional crypto and AI are reaching critical mass — creating significant opportunities across blockchain infrastructure,” said Stephen Mackintosh , the proposed Chief Investment Officer of Mill City and General Partner at Karatage. “We believe that Sui is well positioned for mass adoption with the speed and efficiency institutions require for crypto at scale, plus the technical architecture capable of supporting AI workloads while maintaining security and decentralization.” In essence, the move was something like a SPAC merger, but the legacy lending business will remain in operation. This capitalization occurred with funds from Karatage, which has had a strategic partnership with Mysten Labs, the group that created the SUI network. The other half of the funds came from the Sui Foundation, which is independent from the Sui network but whose mission is to promote it. August 11 Press Release As recently as August 11, the company announced that they had purchased 81.8M SUI. With just over $300M in SUI, nearly all of which is being staked, the company is currently producing SUI yield with it. This yield is about 3%, which the company says comes to about $26K daily. The logic of the transition is simple: it hopes to generate revenue from staking as well as investment returns from its SUI holdings over time. Future Outlook SUI makes the SUI network (a blockchain platform similar to Ethereum) run, covering transaction fees and giving holders voting power proportionate to their holdings, which can dictate how the network runs and evolves over time. These two things give it potential to grow in value over time. As the primary holding now, this would benefit MCVT over time. Beyond the revenue of its staking, it remains to be seen how much MCVT (or any crypto treasury) can leverage its large position into other revenue opportunities. One might hope that, being a non-bank lender, they have the insight to create financial products based on crypto. It will take future quarters to consider what revenues they are capable of making, but 3% of their recent holdings is about $9.5M in SUI, plus any interest on their USD cash position. With their Q2 results , the company expressed the following about the shift: SUI is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain designed to deliver the scalability, speed, and security required to power decentralized applications and real-world crypto use cases across finance, gaming, artificial intelligence, stablecoins, and more. Its horizontally scalable architecture, low-latency finality, and secure, developer-friendly design, position it as a leading infrastructure platform capable of handling real-world scale. As institutional and consumer adoption accelerates, SUI offers the potential to enable a wide range of transformative digital experiences and create long-term value opportunities for Mill City and its shareholders. If we look at other crypto treasuries as a model, there is risk of shareholder dilution, given the equity line that was established. Convertible securities, that come with a fixed-income obligation for MCVT, may also be introduced. At this moment, the potential for peculiar financing is one of the greatest risk factors that I can foresee, beyond the speculative nature of a crypto asset. I think one needs a good entry price, ideally at or below NAV. During their announcement on August 11, they noted shares traded at a premium to NAV, a ratio of about 1.15. SUI vs. MCVT Recent Returns (Seeking Alpha) If we look above, MCVT has appreciated considerably, while SUI has not. The premium, therefore, has increased. For now, dips below $5.50 suggest a move into undervaluation. With more financing likely on the horizon, the exact NAV at any given moment will be a moving target. Investors looking for an entry price should keep that in mind. Conclusion With it being early, it's tough to be too cautious or optimistic about it. I put the stock in a fair value range and think a neutral Hold rating is best at this point. It's worth watching as Q3 and Q4 finish and release their results to get a better idea of everything they have in mind with the Treasury model.",MCVT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SUI|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-20 13:22:06

Geraci, President of The ETF Store, said earlier today that the regulatory environment is “nearly ready” for more spot crypto ETFs, including XRP. “Full regulatory framework should be in place for spot crypto ETFs. Spot ETH ETF staking approval any day now. Clarity Act now in Senate. Remainder of the year should be wild,” he wrote in a post on X. Cryptopolitan had previously reported about the SEC extending its decision on the 21Shares Core XRP Trust beyond the August 20 deadline, granting itself an additional 60 days. The new ruling date is set for October 19, within which the regulator said would allow it to review public comments and assess any regulatory concerns under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Several firms in line for approval The delay periodically set back applications from Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton, which all have pending XRP ETF filings under review. Each is now expected to receive a final answer within days of each other in mid to late October. If the current schedule holds, Grayscale’s filing could receive a decision by October 18, followed by 21Shares on October 19, Bitwise on October 20, and Canary Capital and WisdomTree between October 24 and October 25. Market analysts expect the SEC to treat these applications in a consistent manner, as it has done with previous reviews of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs . Community members following the process believe that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, could be first in line. Analyst and regulatory perspectives Nate Geraci supported his sentiment, saying the policy shift in America’s financial regulation will fast-track institutional investments in crypto. Earlier, before his ETF projections, he shared comments made by Michelle W. Bowman, Vice Chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve, during her speech at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025. Comments today from *Fed Governor* Bowman on banks, regulators, & crypto… “Change is coming” “It is essential that banks & regulators are open to engaging in new technologies and departing from an overly cautious mindset” Read this. Shift towards crypto is happening *fast*. pic.twitter.com/TdL6liBPhc — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 20, 2025 “ Change is coming. Bank regulators are taking important steps to create a framework for digital assets and the adoption of blockchain technology within the banking system. These steps will promote accessibility to banking products and services by removing supervisory impediments that have stood in the way of bank relationships, ” Bowman said. She mentioned that US regulatory circles believe innovation and oversight are not inherently at odds. “We stand at a crossroads: we can either seize the opportunity to shape the future or risk being left behind,” Bowman continued. Meanwhile, US Senator Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said on Tuesday that as many as 18 Democrats could support the Senate’s version of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. At the SALT conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Scott said, “I believe that we’ll have between 12 and 18 Democrats at least open to voting for market structure.” He added that opposition from lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren are “a real force to overcome.” Congress has already passed the GENIUS Act , signed into law by President Donald Trump, which provides rules for stablecoins. But industry participants are waiting on market structure legislation that will determine how the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) divide oversight of digital assets, including spot crypto markets.

The project has already raised $3.9m, with daily inflows accelerating as investors scramble for the last available tokens. Fueling the frenzy is its viral weekly 1 BTC giveaway. Each prize is drawn through a provable on-chain lottery, with yesterday’s win going to a Thai entrant. Now, only one Bitcoin remains in the jackpot, setting the stage for a fierce rush as the countdown ticks down. https://twitter.com/BitcoinPenguins/status/1957796091916644515 The crypto market definitely ramping up for altcoin season 2025, with the altcoin season index rising steadily and the Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding BTC (TOTAL2) eyeing a breakout to new all-time highs. Historically, the hottest new meme coins have led the biggest pumps and 2025’s breakout theme is penguins. Pudgy Penguins’ token PENGU already proved it with a 500% rally between June and July. Now, with altseason kicking off, Bitcoin Penguins is lining up for an even bigger run through Q3 and Q4, pulling in both the PENGU crowd and die-hard Bitcoin holders. Capitalizing on the penguin hype from Pudgy Penguins Pudgy Penguins debuted in the market as a collection of Penguin-themed NFTs in July 2021, and the project launched the PENGU token on the Solana blockchain in December 2024. They made strategic partnerships with Walmart, Target, and Walgreens to build global appeal using toys, plushies, and apparel. As a result, Pudgy Penguins blew up among meme coin traders and now has a market cap of over $2 billion. After its meteoric rise, Pudgy Penguin continues to develop strategic partnerships and claims this is just the beginning of its penguin empire. Pengu Morning This is just the beginning. https://t.co/Klun7H3chs — Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) August 14, 2025 However, PENGU no longer holds the same upside potential as it did earlier this year due to its large market cap. Despite that, more meme traders are being drawn towards the penguin meta. The emerging project Bitcoin Penguins is filling this gap with its undervalued presale token, BPENGU, and absorbing the rising demand to skyrocket in the upcoming bull cycle. Investors flock to Bitcoin Penguins for another penguin-led rally As Pudgy Penguins continues to propel the penguin meta to new highs, Bitcoin Penguins is cleverly leveraging its popularity. The Bitcoin Penguins community is expanding rapidly, with thousands of new buyers joining daily. In just three weeks, the presale has already pulled in $3.9m. Early participants aren’t just waiting for a listing. They’re earning. BPENGU can be staked in dynamic pools offering between 50% APY for a 1-month lock and 100% APY for a 3-month lock, giving investors passive income even before trading begins. The flash presale launched at $0.001, and by stage 12 the price has already climbed to $0.00171. With only one week left until the presale closes and a September 2nd listing confirmed, this is the final window to ride the penguin meme wave into 2025.

Low-cost, lightning-fast transactions on Little Pepe solve Ethereum’s well-known congestion and gas issues. And as the heir apparent to Pepe’s market dominance, Little Pepe could welcome an ever-expanding world of meme coins. It all comes at a time when the meme coin market is on the rise, and frog-related tokens have built their own niche worth $5.65B . $LILPEPE Presale Becomes Top Meme Coin to Buy Now LILPEPE’s presale closed its Stage 10 early as investors poured into the project, raising the total from the presale to well over $22M. The $LILPEPE project touts zero trading taxes, anti-bot protections, and a $777K giveaway. It arrives just as $PEPE, $BRETT, and other frog coins sustain sizable market share. Pepe ($PEPE) is among the most liquid meme coins, with a multibillion-dollar capitalization and frequent bursts of volume; it’s down over a quarter in August. Brett (Based) ($BRETT) broke out in 2024, a major player on Coinbase’s Base chain. It reached its all-time high of $0.23 at the beginning of December 2024. $BRETT is still a flagship for Base meme coins. Turbo ($TURBO) holds a $280M market cap, significant even for a meme coin, with a persistent presence in the frog subset. A Frog Sector with Real Weight Frog-themed meme coins remain a significant slice of the market: the category shows an aggregate market cap of roughly $5.65B. Within that cohort, $PEPE holds about $4.36B in value, while $BRETT (Base) trades near $0.05 with a market cap around $490M. One top-50 token and several mid-rank ones before the sector gives way to small-cap coins at the bottom of the list. Still, the overall market cap of the sector is impressive enough. And performance for many of the individual tokens, while down recently, has nevertheless surged in 2025. That follows broader market trends – Interest in even the best meme coins has ebbed and flowed throughout 2025 with periodic rotations into the segment and sentiment-driven spikes. It’s a market niche ripe for a contender to challenge $PEPE for his crown. Enter Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), a token offering more than Pepe ever could. What Little Pepe Is Building Unlike most meme tokens that launch on existing chains and absorb gas costs, Little Pepe is rolling out an EVM-compatible Layer-2. Little Pepe chain boasts zero buy/sell taxes on the $LILPEPE token. The project’s whitepaper outlines a 100B total supply with 26.5% allocated to presale, 30% to chain reserves, 13.5% to staking & rewards, and 10% each to liquidity, DEX allocation, and marketing. Ultra-fast, secure, and cheap – Little Pepe is the perfect chain for building a meme coin empire. The project even features anti-sniper (anti-bot) protections and a native launchpad intended to give new tokens a fairer start. Liquidity gets locked when tokens launch, preventing a common scam where devs snag all the tokens overnight. A CertiK smart-contract audit and a preliminary CoinMarketCap pag e help advance the sale. There’s also the significant $777K giveaway. The terms are simple – a minimum $100 presale entry plus social tasks – and winners are announced on the project site. 10 lucky winners from the community will each receive $77K in $LILPEPE. The Little Pepe Pitch Little Pepe’s pitch is that infrastructure (an L2), not just a likable mascot, can help the token compete when meme coin volumes surge. Lower fees, tax-free trading, and anti-bot rails may appeal to retail traders who were priced out by gas or burned by launch snipers in prior cycles. $LILPEPE has room to grow, big shoes to fill, and the ambition to do it.

EminiFX raised $262 million in just eight months by promising unrealistic weekly returns through fake robo-trading technology, while Alexandre siphoned millions for personal use. EminiFX Collapse Leaves Founder Owing Millions A federal judge in New York ordered Eddy Alexandre, the founder of the defunct crypto platform EminiFX, to pay more than $228 million in restitution after ruling that the company operated as a Ponzi scheme that defrauded tens of thousands of investors. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a summary judgment against Alexandre and EminiFX, with US District Judge Valerie Caproni holding them jointly liable for $228.5 million in restitution and Alexandre personally responsible for an additional $15 million in disgorgement. Case ruling (Source: CourtListener ) The decision was made after more than three years of legal battles and comes just over a year after Alexandre pleaded guilty to commodities fraud in a parallel criminal case. For this case, he is serving a nine-year prison sentence and was separately ordered to pay $213 million in restitution. Press release from the US Attorney’s Office EminiFX launched in 2021, and quickly drew in more than 25,000 investors and raised $262 million in just eight months by promising weekly returns of up to 9.99% through a so-called “Robo-Advisor Assisted Account” that allegedly deployed automated crypto and forex trading strategies. In reality, the platform sustained losses of at least $49 million and never implemented the trading technology it claimed to use. Prosecutors found that Alexandre misappropriated at least $15 million for personal expenses, including luxury cars, credit card bills, and large cash withdrawals. Investor payouts were also made using funds from new participants. The civil ruling ensures that payments toward restitution will offset the disgorgement obligation, minimizing overlap in financial penalties. A court-appointed receiver has been overseeing the recovery and distribution of assets since 2022, and partial payouts to victims began earlier this year following court approval of a distribution plan. The case sheds some light on the ongoing risks facing investors in the crypto sector, where scams, hacks, and fraud schemes are still running rampant.

While the long-term bullish structure remains intact, ETH has now pulled back into a critical support area. The key question is whether buyers can defend this zone or if a deeper correction is on the horizon. ETH Price Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, Ethereum has clearly entered a corrective phase, with selling pressure and profit distribution weighing on momentum. This decline has pushed the asset toward the $4K psychological support, which also aligns with the channel’s midline, making it a pivotal level for trend continuation. If buyers successfully defend this zone, ETH could consolidate before attempting another push higher. However, a decisive breakdown below $4K would likely expose the next key support around $3.5K, where the previous swing low and the channel’s lower boundary converge. Despite the current retracement, the broader uptrend remains valid, though momentum has cooled significantly. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ethereum recently performed a classic liquidity hunt, sweeping above resistance before reversing sharply and breaking below recent higher lows, an early indication of a potential market structure shift. Currently, the price is stabilizing around the $4K region, which also coincides with the multi-month ascending uptrend line. This confluence makes $4K a crucial battleground between bulls and bears. For now, ETH is effectively range-bound between $4K and $4.8K, with liquidity clusters concentrated at both extremes. Until a breakout occurs, the market is likely to remain in a sideways consolidation phase. That said, a sudden bearish breakdown below $4K could trigger a cascade of liquidations, flipping the broader bullish outlook into a bearish scenario. Onchain Analysis By Shayan The Ethereum network is experiencing a severe imbalance in its validator dynamics, with a historic surge in validator exits and a sharp decline in new entries. As of August 20, 2025, more than 916,000 validators are queued to exit, the largest exit queue ever recorded. Unlike previous short-lived spikes, this trend has been accelerating over the past two months, signaling that it is more than just a temporary fluctuation and instead reflects deepening concerns among stakers. This development carries significant on-chain implications. Validators leaving the network regain access to their 32 ETH deposits plus accrued rewards, a considerable portion of which is likely to flow back into circulation. If even part of this ETH is directed toward selling, it could introduce substantial supply-side pressure on the market. In effect, the rapidly expanding exit queue acts as an early warning signal of mounting downside risks. Without a corresponding wave of new demand to absorb the unlocked ETH, Ethereum may face a period of heightened volatility, where the market struggles to balance the incoming supply. This setup increases the likelihood of short-term downside pressure, potentially undermining the broader bullish structure unless staker sentiment improves or new buyers step in decisively.

This is Oracle’s biggest push yet into artificial intelligence infrastructure, and it’s reshaping the company’s future in the global cloud market. The contract with OpenAI includes over 5 gigawatts of compute power, enough to run millions of homes, and the facilities are set to be online as early as summer 2026, with full completion targeted by early 2027, according to Bloomberg . Oracle’s site in Shackleford County, Texas will run entirely on gas generators, burning more than $1 billion per year to stay operational because local power infrastructure can’t deliver what’s needed. The site is being developed by Vantage Data Centers, owned by DigitalBridge, and will hit 1.4 gigawatts in capacity, making it one of the largest in the world. These builds are reportedly optimized for training and running advanced AI models, a process that requires thousands of Nvidia GPUs , extreme cooling, and nonstop power. Oracle bets everything on cloud after years of internal battles Oracle’s push into AI cloud started after a long stretch of confusion and failed projects. Back in 2008, Oracle’s co-founder and current chairman Larry Ellison called cloud computing “complete gibberish.” For years, he resisted the change because Oracle’s traditional database business, which sold on-premise licenses, was highly profitable. But as competitors like Amazon and Salesforce started eating into Oracle’s base, Ellison changed course. Through the 2010s, Oracle ran two competing internal projects to get into cloud. One was led by Thomas Kurian, who launched a product in 2012 that flopped. Another group pushed a “bare metal” approach, where customers don’t share servers. That idea won Ellison’s support and became Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Kurian left in 2018 and now runs Google Cloud. OCI’s design helped Oracle grow in countries where big players hadn’t expanded yet. It also appealed to customers who didn’t want to share infrastructure. Oracle’s salespeople promoted lower prices and simpler product offerings while mocking AWS’s sprawling catalog and side projects. AWS pushed back, saying more customers choose them because of “unmatched choice, pace of innovation, security, and reliability.” Inside Oracle, getting CEO Safra Catz on board was tough. She worried about cloud’s low margins and huge upfront costs. But once TikTok came knocking, everything changed. The ByteDance-owned company, under scrutiny in the U.S. over ties to China, needed a domestic cloud partner. Oracle was seen as a politically safe pick due to its national security background and Republican ties. In 2022, TikTok announced that all U.S. traffic would flow through Oracle servers. Oracle’s growth hinges on Clay Magouyrk’s division and OpenAI’s demand Clay Magouyrk, a blunt and aggressive executive who once told another Oracle leader their decision was “f—king stupid” back in 2021, is now leading OCI. Magouyrk joined OCI early after a stint at Amazon and moved Oracle’s cloud operations to Seattle, outside the traditional Silicon Valley bubble. The division, nicknamed “Sparta,” offered better pay and copied Amazon’s practice of firing low performers often. Today, 23,000 employees report to him. Magouyrk was promoted to president in June 2025, and many inside the company believe he could eventually take over from Ellison, who is now 81. Magouyrk himself said on the Modern CTO podcast, “Sometimes you look back and say — I’m not sure that I was entirely qualified at each step of the way. But it seems to have worked out so far.” Oracle has poached over 600 Amazon workers in the last two years, helped by Amazon’s strict return-to-office policy. Oracle still allows hybrid and remote setups, which is appealing to cloud engineers. Oracle has also signed cloud deals with Zoom and Uber, while serving Nvidia, which uses Oracle for both internal projects and its own cloud services. Nvidia rents capacity from an Oracle GPU cluster in Japan and another site being built on Batam Island in Indonesia. Oracle is also in talks with Meta and Elon Musk’s xAI for future capacity deals.

By letting Sui smart contracts natively control assets across other blockchains, Ika unlocks entirely new design spaces for builders. Why it’s only possible on Ika + Sui Ika’s zero-trust MPC network, with its novel 2PC-MPC cryptographic scheme, integrates directly with Sui, turning Sui into a global coordination layer for secure, programmable cross-chain actions - without bridges, wrapped assets, or custodians. Sui builders can now orchestrate native assets from Bitcoin, Solana, EVM, and more, opening entirely new product categories rather than incremental upgrades - and while always keeping the user in control. ""These use cases are extraordinary, and they highlight Sui’s role as the global coordination layer for Web3 and beyond"" said Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at Mysten Labs. ""With Ika, Sui developers can now orchestrate assets and logic across ecosystems in ways that were never before possible."" Breaking New Ground Across Categories The first wave of Ika RFP highlights twelve projects that push into design spaces only Ika + Sui can unlock, for example: 1. Reinventing Finance with Native Assets Ika enables DeFi primitives that work directly with assets like BTC and ETH, without wrapping or custodians. A Zero-Trust Multi-Chain Lending Protocol that allows borrowers to post a native asset such as BTC (or even an entire account holding a staking position) as collateral to borrow any other native asset e.g. a stablecoin on Solana, all enforced by Sui smart contracts. A Programmable Native Bitcoin DeFi Layer that turns Bitcoin into a programmable asset, enabling lending, swaps, and yield strategies natively. 2. Redefining Ownership and Marketplaces Ika extends what can be transferred, traded, and valued across chains. An Account Marketplace goes beyond tokens, enabling the secure transfer of entire blockchain accounts - from gaming wallets to governance positions. A Revenue Stream Marketplace tokenizes future cash flows from protocols or validators, opening new markets and new financing models and opportunities for on-chain income. 3. Next-Gen Infrastructure for Users, DAOs, and AI By enforcing rules at the dWallet level, Ika + Sui make new models of coordination possible. Wallet-as-a-Protocol (WaaP) lets any application integrate onboarding and signing without custodians, decentralizing the popular WaaS model by implementing it on Sui with Ika.

BTC extended its losses for a third consecutive day, dipping below $115,000 and falling to an intraday low of $112,600 before recovering to reclaim $113,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 1%, trading around $113,656. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $4,200 as market sentiment worsened. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $4,070 before rebounding and moving to its current level of $4,181. Ripple (XRP) registered a substantial decline over the past 24 hours, down nearly 5% around $2.88. Solana (SOL) is marginally up, trading around $180, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 2%, trading around $0.212. Cardano (ADA) plunged over 8% in the past 24 hours, while Chainlink (LINK) is marginally up, trading around $24.52. Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) registered notable declines, while Toncoin (TON) traded in positive territory, up almost 2%. Banking Lobby Urges Lawmakers To Change GENIUS Act The US banking lobby is concerned about interest-bearing stablecoins and their supposed challenge to existing financial systems. The Banking Policy Group (BPI), an advocacy group for the banking industry, has written a letter to Congress stating that stablecoins present a risk to the existing credit system and urging regulators to close loopholes in the GENIUS Act. Prominent members of the crypto ecosystem have long argued that stablecoin issuers must be allowed to offer interest. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong had said that interest-bearing stablecoins would give users more control over financial products. However, Andrew Rossow, policy and public affairs attorney, believes the novelty of on-chain interest means problems like solvency, liquidity, and investor protection aren’t straightforward. “Claims of ‘easy compliance’ overlook the complex realities of ensuring proper reserve backing, Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer, and prudential oversight simultaneously.” The BPI called into question a loophole in Sec. 4(a)(11) of GENIUS, prohibiting stablecoin issuers from paying any type of yield or interest (cash, tokens, or other considerations) solely in connection with holding, use, or retention of such a payment stablecoin. While this section seems to ban yield-bearing stablecoins, Aaron Brogan, founder of crypto-focused law firm Brogan Law, says that many believe it does not ban deals between exchanges and issuers. Brogan stated, “The ability for other firms, like exchanges, to allow interest on stablecoins is based on factors other than ‘holding use or retention’ as mentioned in GENIUS. The word ‘solely’ in the GENIUS Act is a powerful legal limiter, and it does mean that if there is any other basis for the deals, they probably don’t qualify. So, while GENIUS is “written to appear quite complete, the prohibition on interest is probably actually relatively porous.” Fed Official Says Staff Should Be Allowed To Hold Crypto Federal Reserve Vice Chair for supervision Michelle Bowman believes staff from the US Central Bank should be allowed to hold a small amount of crypto to help them understand the technology. Speaking at a blockchain event in Wyoming, Bowman said the regulator should consider letting staff hold crypto and other digital assets so they can develop a working understanding of its underlying technology. “We will soon be establishing a framework for supervising issuers of these assets. There’s no replacement for experimenting and understanding how that ownership and transfer process flows.” Fed Staff and their spouses are barred from holding cryptocurrencies or dealing with products, including ETFs and shares in cryptocurrency companies. The Fed tightened rules on investments in 2022 after it was revealed that three top officials had unusual trading activity while the regulator took steps to support the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bowman stated that such restrictions on staff members could become a barrier to recruiting and retaining examiners with the necessary expertise. “I certainly wouldn’t trust someone to teach me to ski if they’d never put on skis, regardless of how many books and articles they have read, or even written, about it.” She also urged regulators to drop their “overly cautious mindset” and be less skeptical of new financial products. Republicans Expect Democratic Support On Key Bill A senator leading efforts to establish a digital asset market structure has said he expects bipartisan support for the US crypto market structure bill. Speaking at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole, Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott said he expected some Democrats to support Republicans on the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, after the passage of the GENIUS Act. Scott stated, “We had 18 Democrats vote for the GENIUS Act. I believe that we’ll have between 12 and 18 Democrats at least open to voting for market structure, a far more complicated piece of legislation, and the forces against it [...] it is a real force to overcome.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market continued to tumble as investors went into risk-off mode. The flagship cryptocurrency slumped to a low of $114,703 on Monday before settling at $116,286, down 1.02%. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price dropped nearly 3% to $112,856. The current session sees BTC up almost 1%, trading around $113,846. Analysts believe the drop below $114,000 is a worrying sign, stating that current price action was “not a sign of strength.” Long positions, which are already undergoing a squeeze, added another $116 million to their liquidation tally. Meanwhile, data from CoinGlass showed bids accumulating around the $112,000 mark. Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, stated, “TLDR: The $107k - $110k range is coming into focus. This is not a sign of strength for $BTC. The downward pressure is palpable, but bulls are trying to find their footing.” The analyst flagged $110,950 as a potential support barrier. Material Indicators also identified a $25 million liquidity band around $105,000, which could protect against a deeper market rout. “This bid liquidity does not look like it aims to get filled. It was placed to increase liquidity upward. If it fails to accomplish that and price reverts, I expect it to get rugged or moved before it gets filled.” Analysts have also flagged a growing divergence between institutional demand and price action. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have registered continuous inflows despite weakening on-chain signals. CoinGlass noted in its analysis, “With profit-taking on the rise, the sustainability of institutional flows and renewed buyer conviction in both spot and futures will determine whether this contraction stabilizes into fresh upward momentum or extends into deeper consolidation.” BTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $116,683. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline to $116,492. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309. BTC reached an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. Despite the positive start, it lost momentum and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to cross $123,000 and settle at $123,365. Source: TradingView BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, crossing $124,000 and reaching $124,533. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 4% to $118,389. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell nearly 1% and settled at $117,436. The flagship cryptocurrency steadied itself over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Saturday and Sunday to settle at $117,488. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $114,703 on Monday. However, it recovered to reclaim $116,000 and settled at $116,286, ultimately registering a 1.02% drop. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC plunged nearly 3%, slipping below $113,000 and settling at $112,856. However, it has recovered during the ongoing session, with the price up almost 1%, trading around $113,939. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has recovered during the ongoing session, as it looks to recoup its losses. The altcoin started the week in the red, dropping 3.58% on Monday and settling at $4,316. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price fell 5.54% to $4,076. However, ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, up 4%, and is trading around $4,238. Meanwhile, Tom Lee, the Chairman of BitMine, has predicted a drop to the $4,075 range before a subsequent rally towards $5,000. Lee’s prediction comes at a time when ETH holders are wondering if the rally has peaked after it reached $4,783 last week. Investors are worried about a decline below $4,000. However, current price action could be a healthy pullback before another rally. Recent price action suggests growing selling pressure from ETH whales, retail investors, and ETFs. Despite price weakness, Ethereum ETFs continue to register strong inflows. ETH ETFs control approximately 6.5 million ETH worth around $27.5 billion in assets under management. Corporate treasury companies, including BitMine, are also aggressively accumulating ETH. Meanwhile, an Ethereum whale has opened a $16.35 million long position on ETH using 25x leverage, making a bold bet that the current downtrend is over. The position is already in profit, with ETH trading around $4,232. The whale could add over $163,000 in profit with only a 1% increase from current levels. Data from Kingfisher supports the timing of the whale’s entry, showing a dense cluster of short liquidations above $4,300–$4,360. The position means that ETH does not need a breakout to validate the trade. Instead, a move into the $4,336 zone could generate millions in unrealized profits. ETH started the previous week in positive territory, rising 2.52% on Friday to cross $4,000 and settle at $4,010. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH registered a marginal decline on Sunday, settling at $4,251. Price action remained subdued on Monday as the price registered another marginal decline. However, it rebounded on Tuesday, rising nearly 9% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,589. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as ETH rose over 3% to $4,745. Source: TradingView ETH lost momentum on Thursday as selling pressure returned. As a result, it fell 4.11% to $4,551. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price dropped 2.34%, slipping below $4,500 and settling at $4,444. Price action was mixed over the weekend as ETH registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rising 1.13% on Sunday to settle at $4,476. Despite ending the weekend positively, ETH was back in the red on Monday, dropping 3.58% to a low of $4,229 before settling at $4,316. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price fell 5.54% to $4,076. However, ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, with the price up nearly 4% at $4,229.

Buyers retained control over the weekend as the price rose 1.80% on Saturday and 1.52% on Sunday, crossing $180 and settling at $182. Despite the positive weekend, SOL was back in the red on Monday, dropping over 4% to $174. Bullish sentiment returned on Tuesday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 10% to cross $190 and settle at $191.

By combining humor with structured design, Pepe Dollar represents one of the most practical presale crypto projects on today’s market.

While they take different approaches, each provides clarity and security within its presale model. Pepe Dollar emphasizes token scarcity, payment functionality, and ecosystem integration, marking it as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. PEPETO, on the other hand, focuses on infrastructure tools, staking rewards, and education, appealing to users who value Web3 accessibility. Together, they highlight the diversity of token presales shaping 2025. Both projects add depth to the growing crypto presale list, giving users more transparent and purposeful choices in a market often filled with short-lived hype. Conclusion: Pepe Dollar ($PEPD) and PEPETO in the Crypto Presale Space The rise of presale crypto tokens reflects how meme culture and decentralized finance continue to overlap. Pepe Dollar and PEPETO show two paths forward—one built on cultural rebellion with structured burns, the other focused on tools, staking, and cross-chain features. Both projects reflect the qualities people seek when they buy presale crypto: transparency, audited contracts, and active communities. They represent different aspects of growth in cryptocurrency presales, but together they stand as examples of meaningful development. For those reviewing the crypto presale 2025 landscape, Pepe Dollar ($PEPD) and PEPETO appear frequently in discussions of the top presale crypto projects.

Positioned as a settlement layer for PayFi, DeFi, and GameFi, the platform promises near-instant transactions at a fraction of a cent through its dynamic state sharding architecture. With India’s developers at the forefront of adoption, Shardeum is betting on locally built, globally scalable applications. In this conversation with Invezz, Nischal Shetty, Co-Founder and President of Shardeum, discusses early learnings from the mainnet launch, solving fundamental payment challenges, and shaping the future of Web3 payments from India to the world. Invezz: Since the mainnet launch, what early adoption trends or unexpected challenges have you observed that have influenced your roadmap? Since launch, we’ve focused on establishing Shardeum as the go-to new layer 1 blockchain for building PayFi, Defi and GameFi products, the settlement layer for PayFi, with particularly strong adoption from Indian developers building for local markets first. We’re seeing teams create Indian alternatives to global DeFi products, from decentralized exchanges to lending protocols designed for India’s unique income patterns. What’s been encouraging is watching developers shift from trying to compete globally on day one to building for the Indian market first. One team migrated their “pump.fun for India” concept to Shardeum, where friends can launch meme tokens for their local communities, something that wouldn’t work on global platforms where they lack the social networks to provide initial momentum. Our biggest unexpected learning has come from Unstablenet, where we’ve stress-tested not just technical performance but also culturally relevant use cases. The feedback has been instrumental in optimising for the high-volume, low-value transactions that characterise emerging market usage patterns. Invezz: In your view, what is the single biggest infrastructure gap in on-chain payments today, and how is Shardeum addressing it differently from other Layer 1 networks? The biggest infrastructure gap in on-chain payments today is the inability to scale without sacrificing affordability or decentralisation. Most Layer 1 networks have a fixed capacity. When transaction demand surges, their only lever to maintain performance is to increase fees. This makes them unsuitable for high-volume, low-value transactions like micro-payments, retail settlements, or machine-to-machine payments. Shardeum solves this through dynamic state sharding. Our network automatically adds more shards as new nodes join, which means throughput scales linearly while fees remain predictable and low. This design ensures that whether you’re processing 1,000 or 10 million transactions a second, the cost and speed stay consistent. It’s the difference between a road that jams during rush hour and one that instantly adds new lanes whenever traffic increases. By maintaining both decentralisation and efficiency, Shardeum enables payment use cases that other blockchains can’t support sustainably, from real-time remittances to high-frequency DeFi trades without high pricing. Invezz: Srinivasan previously discussed mainnet delays and the technical work behind dynamic state sharding . Now that the network is live, how has that architecture performed in real-world conditions, particularly for high-frequency payment use cases? Dynamic state sharding has performed exactly as intended, consistently delivering sub-second finality and linear scaling in high-frequency payment scenarios such as merchant batch settlements and gig worker payouts. Much of that reliability stems from the groundwork we laid with Unstablenet, our public stress-test network, where we simulated real-world payment spikes, shard rebalancing, and validator coordination before mainnet deployment. In production, we’re still very early. We have a token-only mainnet, and early usage has helped us make it more robust. But true usage will emerge when we ship smart contracts from testnet to the mainnet, which we aim to do in a few months post the testing phase. Invezz: EVM compatibility is a core part of Shardeum’s strategy. How are you seeing developers leverage this to build payment-focused applications, and can you share examples where this compatibility has directly reduced go-to-market friction? Shardeum’s EVM compatibility means developers can build with familiar tools while focusing on what really matters, serving Indian users with products built for their specific needs. Instead of learning new languages or rebuilding from scratch, teams can replicate proven concepts and localise them. A near-term example we’re excited about would be if an Indian team could adapt a proven DeFi lending protocol for the local market, reusing audited core smart contracts while localising the UI, integrating compliant UPI/on-ramp flows, and, crucially, designing incentives so early Indian users might earn governance tokens and a share of fees. With focused support, a team like this could plausibly go from concept to a limited pilot in under three weeks. We’re exploring partnerships with ~5–10 high-calibre Indian development teams to make efforts like this possible, offering infrastructure, hands-on guidance, and co-marketing. The aim is straightforward: when Indians build and adopt these protocols early, more of the upside can accrue locally rather than flowing to platforms built elsewhere. That’s the real promise of EVM compatibility: it lowers technical barriers so developers can focus on serving their communities. Invezz: One of Shardeum’s promises is near-instant payments at a fraction of a cent. How do you see this impacting cross-border payments and microtransactions in markets like India, where cost sensitivity is high? In cost-sensitive markets like India, our sub-cent transaction costs unlock entirely new economic models. For cross-border payments, where traditional fees range from 3-7%, we make even small remittances commercially viable. But the real opportunity is deeper. India has over 20 million people using crypto exchanges, but fewer than 20,000 actively use blockchain products. That’s because existing DeFi platforms weren’t built for Indian users or use cases. When we enable Indian developers to build products specifically for this market – whether it’s micro-lending for gig workers or instant settlement for small merchants – we’re not just reducing costs, we’re creating wealth. More importantly, when Indians participate early in Shardeum-based protocols, they receive governance tokens and fee-sharing rewards. A group of friends providing liquidity to an Indian-built DEX earn from every trade. Early adopters of Indian lending protocols gain ownership stakes. This transforms financial services from something you pay for to something you own and profit from. The technical capability is just the foundation. The real impact comes when millions of Indians move from being consumers of foreign financial platforms to owners of locally-built alternatives. Invezz: PayFi integration is aimed at enabling both micro and macro payments natively on-chain. What specific merchant or consumer segments are you targeting first, and how are you approaching user education and trust-building? We’re targeting segments where Indians can build for Indians first, then expand globally. This includes grocery stores, small merchants, and gig platforms where even marginal fee savings significantly improve thin margins. On the consumer side, we’re focusing on freelancers, creators, and developers who need fast, affordable cross-border payments. Our approach to trust-building starts with backing Indian developers who understand local needs. We help them build products with features like escrow and dispute resolution designed for the Indian market dynamics. When users interact with platforms built by people who understand their context, trust develops naturally. We’re also using Unstablenet to let merchants and early users test payment flows risk-free before mainnet deployment. But beyond technical trust, we’re building community trust. When Indians see other Indians succeeding – not just using but owning and profiting from these platforms – adoption accelerates. The goal isn’t just user education; it’s wealth creation. We want Indian merchants and consumers to understand they’re not just getting better payment rails, they’re becoming stakeholders in the next generation of financial infrastructure. Invezz: In the earlier interview, there was a mention of balancing decentralisation with performance. How are you incentivising validators and community participants to ensure the network scales without compromising on decentralisation? We’re making validator participation as open and rewarding as possible without sacrificing payment-grade performance. Hardware requirements are kept intentionally low so individuals, small businesses, and operators in emerging markets can run nodes, not just large data centres. This keeps the network geographically diverse, community-driven, and resistant to centralisation risks. Validators who help ensure smooth PayFi operations are directly rewarded for their contributions. Unstablenet, our public test network, is another key enabler. It allows new validators to train under simulated high-load conditions, refine their setups, and gain hands-on experience before moving to mainnet. This ensures that as we scale, we grow a technically prepared and globally distributed validator base. Invezz: Looking ahead, what role do you see Shardeum playing in the global Web3 payments ecosystem over the next 3–5 years, especially as regulatory frameworks for digital assets evolve in key markets? This isn’t just about building another blockchain – it’s about ensuring India leads in decentralised finance rather than remaining consumers of systems built elsewhere. Over the next 3-5 years, Shardeum will be the platform where emerging market developers build financial infrastructure for their own communities first, then export globally. As regulatory frameworks mature, especially in India, we expect to see the first generation of crypto-native protocols creating significant wealth distributions to their early users and community members. These won’t be speculative gains, but earned rewards for building and using decentralised financial infrastructure. Our vision is that by 2027, several Indian-built DeFi protocols on Shardeum will have millions of users and billions in value, with much of that wealth staying in the hands of Indian developers and early adopters. When that happens, the West will come to study what we’ve built here, rather than the other way around. The autoscaling architecture ensures we can handle this growth without pricing out the communities we serve. But the real differentiator is our commitment to making sure Indians don’t just use Web3 products; they own them. Invezz: Beyond payments, which adjacent sectors or use cases do you see as natural fits for Shardeum’s autoscaling architecture, and how are you prioritising these opportunities in the near term? We see strong potential in sectors where payments are both the core function and the primary scaling challenge, such as DeFi, NFTs, Remittances, high-volume in-game asset trades, machine-to-machine micropayments, and real-time supply chain settlements. These are natural fits for Shardeum’s autoscaling architecture because they require instant finality and predictable low fees, even under sudden spikes in activity. In the near term, we’re using Unstablenet to stress-test these scenarios before they hit mainnet. Developers can simulate everything from gaming transaction bursts to IoT-driven payment flows in a risk-free environment, allowing us to fine-tune performance parameters. This ensures that when these use cases go live, they’re not just possible; they’re production-ready from day one.

Company leaders said roughly 200 AI features are in development to help patients, clinicians, and insurers. On Tuesday, Judy Faulkner, Epic’s 82-year-old CEO, leaned into the science-fiction theme, stepping out in a purple wig, neon green shoes, and an iridescent vest reminiscent of Buzz Lightyear from “Toy Story.” Speaking to thousands of health-care executives in an 11,400-seat underground auditorium, she described a plan to match human judgment with machine support. As reported by CNBC , Faulkner said, “We are combining the intelligence and curiosity of the human being with the investigative capabilities of gen AI.” Epic ranks among the country’s biggest private tech firms and is widely recognized for its electronic health record (EHR) platform. An EHR keeps a patient’s medical history in digital form and is continually updated by clinicians; the technology underpins much of today’s U.S. care delivery. Epic’s software competes with Oracle Health (formerly Cerner). According to the company, its products are used by 280 million Americans, and many patients know Epic through the MyChart portal. Last week, Epic introduced MyChart Central, which will let patients log in to MyChart with one set of credentials instead of maintaining a separate username and password for each health system they visit. Faulkner said the update should also ease work for providers. “You’ll spend less time handling patient calls and resetting passwords,” she said in her keynote. “Demographic changes like address need to be added only once.” Epic’s Emmie AI assistant will guide patients in MyChart portal Epic is adding a built-in helper for patients as well. The always-on Emmie assistant will answer questions about lab results, propose appointment times and suggest screenings that patients can discuss with their doctor. Over a three-hour program, Faulkner and other executives also introduced two more assistants, Art and Penny, and walked through features planned for the next year and beyond. Art is aimed at clinicians and is designed to act as an active AI colleague, the company said. It will anticipate information a doctor might need, surface trends such as blood pressure over time, update a patient’s family history and place orders. Art will also draft clinical notes , a closely watched capability ahead of the event. So-called AI scribes, automated documentation tools, capture visit notes in real time as clinicians conduct and record encounters, provided the patient agrees. Interest in scribes has grown as healthcare leaders try to reduce burnout and administrative work. The space has drawn sizable venture backing, with firms like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare securing hundreds of millions. Epic leverages long-term Microsoft partnership with AI focus Epic says it is co-developing the AI charting capability alongside Microsoft . The companies have worked closely for roughly two decades, and Microsoft’s DAX Copilot product is already popular within the scribing market. “We’re proud to be collaborating with Epic to explore how we can bring our core Dragon ambient AI technology to Epic’s new AI Charting capability to further improve care delivery,” Joe Petro, corporate vice president of Microsoft Health & Life Sciences said in a statement. Penny focuses on the business side of care. Epic said the assistant can generate appeal letters for denied insurance claims and help speed medical coding by serving up suggestions. Faulkner said those two features are already live. Epic said it is building a set of proprietary foundation models, called Cosmos AI, based on this data, and launched the Cosmos AI Lab to help researchers and data scientists learn more. Executives said the models could be used to predict a timeline of potential medical events, such as readmission risk or a future heart attack.

XRP is holding in a critical range, with $2.70 as key downside support and $3.10 as the breakout level. Analyst Crypto Henry notes that a decisive move above $3.10 with strong volume could ignite fresh bullish momentum. XRP is trading at $2.88 after slipping below the psychological $3 mark. According to Crypto Henry, $2.70 is a crucial support zone, having served as both resistance and support in past cycles. A breakdown below this level could trigger deeper retracements into lower liquidity areas. On the flip side, Henry emphasizes the importance of $3.10 as the immediate hurdle for bulls. A sustained move above this resistance, particularly if accompanied by strong trading volume, could ignite a momentum shift. Such a breakout would suggest renewed confidence among investors and may trigger a wave of buying pressure from both retail traders and institutions watching the charts. Market psychology also plays a significant role at these levels. Analysts argue that $2.70 represents a “line in the sand” for XRP holders, with many seeing it as a last stand for maintaining bullish structure. Conversely, $3.10 carries symbolic weight, as breaking this barrier could pave the way toward retesting XRP’s previous highs around $3.30 and beyond. Gemini Taps Ripple for Pre-IPO Credit Line: XRP Liquidity Takes Center Stage Gemini’s S-1 filing unveils a strategic $75M credit line from Ripple Labs, expandable to $150M upon milestones. Draws start at $5M with 6.5–8.5% interest, and amounts beyond $75M can be borrowed in Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, placing it alongside USDT and USDC as a top-tier settlement option. Ahead of its Nasdaq debut as ‘GEMI,’ Gemini faces steep financial headwinds—a $282.5M H1 2025 loss and falling revenue. Its Ripple credit line isn’t equity funding but a strategic liquidity cushion, ensuring flexibility and stability through the IPO. As a result, market experts like Xaif Crypto are quick to highlight this pivotal development by stating , “Wall Street is waking up when exchanges choose XRP liquidity before going public, you know the tide has turned.” Once a quiet contender, Ripple’s RLUSD is now poised for institutional adoption. Offering it as an optional borrowing currency adds legitimacy and visibility within regulated financial rails, positioning Ripple to expand beyond remittances into the treasury operations of major market players. Even without drawing funds, Gemini’s agreement with Ripple shifts the narrative. As markets embrace crypto-native tools, this deal signals XRP liquidity’s rising prominence, setting the stage for opportunity ahead of Gemini’s IPO. Conclusion Gemini’s partnership with Ripple goes beyond a pre-IPO safety net, it marks a shift as institutions embrace XRP liquidity. With RLUSD moving from niche use to mainstream relevance, this deal strengthens Gemini’s IPO positioning and highlights XRP’s growing role in bridging traditional finance with crypto. Meanwhile, traders are eyeing XRP’s volume and price action as it consolidates.

Key Takeaways: Blockchain.com expands board with top finance leaders, adding ex-KPMG CEO Timothy Flynn and Klaviyo CLO Landon Edmond. The firm’s board now has nine members, reflecting expertise across Wall Street, fintech, and Web3. IPO momentum in crypto markets grows, with Circle, Bullish, and others recently going public. The move adds another layer of financial expertise as the company positions itself for a potential public listing, according to a Wednesday report from Fortune . Flynn, who also served as a director at JPMorgan, described Blockchain.com as “a trusted bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy.” Blockchain.com Adds Flynn, Klaviyo’s Chief Legal Officer to Board The company also appointed Landon Edmond, Chief Legal Officer of e-commerce platform Klaviyo, to its board. With these appointments, Blockchain.com’s board now stands at nine members, which President Lane Kasselman said reflects experience “spanning from Wall Street to Web3.” The expansion comes as crypto firms see renewed investor appetite, with industry heavyweights Circle and Bullish recently going public, and Kraken also rumored to be exploring an IPO. Founded in 2015, Blockchain.com was among the first companies to provide widely distributed crypto wallets, alongside its popular Blockchain Explorer, a tool used globally to track transactions across Bitcoin and other blockchains. The firm later diversified into exchange services and crypto payments. Today, its operations are divided into three main areas: retail wallets, institutional services for hedge funds and asset managers, and an asset management arm that includes venture capital, high-frequency trading, and digital treasury services. Blockchain.com was last valued at $7 billion in 2023. While the firm declined to comment on IPO timelines, the recent hiring of a CFO and COO earlier this year, coupled with the board additions, underscores its readiness to tap public markets. Kasselman emphasized that the company’s strategy is to build credibility across both traditional finance and digital assets. Blockchain.com’s IPO plans come amid heightened investor interest in crypto listings. Circle’s June debut saw shares surge nearly 10x from the $31 offering price before settling at $149.

50391229,560958,1755698446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50391229.jpeg,Trump-Linked Crypto Company ALT5 Pushes Back On SEC Probe Rumors,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-linked-crypto-company-alt5-pushes-back-on-sec-probe-rumors/,"ALT5 Sigma and Jon Isaac both moved quickly to deny a rumored probe conducted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, but the paper trail gives investors reason to ask questions. Reports this week tied Isaac to alleged earnings inflation and insider share sales connected to ALT5’s $1.5 billion treasury deal with US President Donald Trump’s crypto platform, and the market reacted sharply. Company And Exec Deny Any Investigation According to posts on X, ALT5 Sigma – a new investment partner of the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial – said hours after the rumors that Jon Isaac is not a current or former president or adviser and that it is unaware of any SEC investigation into the company. ALT5 Sigma has been made aware of reports in the press and on social media. For the record: Jon Isaac is not –– and never was –– the President of ALT5 Sigma and he is not an advisor to the company. The company has no knowledge of any current investigation regarding its activities… — ALTS (@ALT5_Sigma) August 19, 2025 The Information first published the investigation claims on Tuesday. SEC Records Show A Consulting Link A December SEC filing paints a more connected picture. According to that filing, ALT5 entered a two-year consulting agreement with Jon Isaac in March 2024. Isaac also posted on social media, denying claims that he is the president of ALT5. He said he is not under investigation. Setting the record straight on reports from @CoinpediaNews and @theinformation : I am NOT the president of ALT5 Sigma and I am NOT under SEC investigation mentioned in these reports. I am the CEO of Live Ventures Incorporated (NASDAQ: LIVE), a publicly traded company. Any SEC… — Jon Isaac (@Jonisaac702) August 19, 2025 The same filing shows Isaac held a $540,000 promissory note that he later converted, plus interest, into 465,753 Sigma shares on Dec. 23, 2024. Past SEC Action Adds Context Reports have disclosed that the SEC filed a civil complaint against Jon Isaac in 2021, naming Live Ventures and JanOne. The complaint alleges inflating earnings, backdating contracts and using a nominee account to hide stock sales. Isaac and the companies denied wrongdoing, and that case remains active in federal court in Nevada. That prior action helps explain why fresh rumors about a probe would spread quickly and rattle investors. Company Backer Isaac is currently CEO of Live Ventures and still holds more than 1 million Sigma shares, which reports value at over $5.48 million. He has said he continues to buy ALT shares and describes himself as a supporter of the company. Live Ventures records list Tony Isaac, Jon’s father, as ALT5’s president and chairman, while ALT5’s own website lists Tony Isaac as a director.

Now, community members can use ERC-20 token balances to take part in governance, or choose quadratic voting to prevent large holders from dominating the process. With $12 million in backing from major industry players and plans for a new Layer-3 chain, the Shiba Inu network is setting itself up for broader adoption and a stronger role in the Web3 space. Revamped Doggy DAO: Stronger Voting And Fairer Governance The Shiba Inu ecosystem’s governance body, the SHIB Doggy DAO, has rolled out a redesigned voting framework that makes participation more inclusive and secure. Until now, governance proposals have relied heavily on Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) staking, which limited flexibility and created risks of majority attacks. Related Reading: What’s Next For XRP After Crashing Below $3? Analyst Answers With the update, community members can now vote directly with their ERC-20 token balances. Token holders no longer need to stake assets to have a say in governance, making it easier for more of the SHIB Army to join decision-making. At the same time, quadratic voting adds another layer of protection. In this system, the cost of gaining extra voting power rises steeply, making it nearly impossible for wealthy holders to control outcomes. Instead of being restricted to one fixed model, they can now pick the governance method that best suits their proposal. Whether it’s staking, direct token balance voting, or quadratic voting, the flexibility allows for better alignment between the nature of the decision and vote counts. Shibarium’s Bigger Vision: Identity, Layer-3, And TREAT Token While improving governance is a significant achievement, Shiba Inu’s developers have even bigger plans for the future of the network. Work is already underway on an identity-based voting system that will give each person just one vote, regardless of how many tokens they hold. The voting system closes the gap between whales and small holders, guaranteeing everyone has an equal voice. Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes 1,000% Increase To Reach $2.55 ATH This Cycle The team wants to launch a new Layer-3 chain next year and has raised $12 million from backers like Polygon Labs and Animoca. The upcoming chain will run on Shiba Inu’s newest token, Treat (TREAT), which rewards Web3 activities. TREAT is already listed on major exchanges like MEXC, Bitget, and Gate, signaling growing interest and adoption. Beyond TREAT, other tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem will also play distinct roles. Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) and DogeKiller (LEASH) will serve different on-chain functions, helping power the multi-token system that supports Shibarium. The new governance model connects to the bigger Web3 trend of digital identity. Shibarium has a Karma points system that measures reputation and trust across the community. By tying voting to identity and reputation, Shiba Inu moves to a safer, more trusted system that helps it grow to one billion users.

According to him, while an alt-season surge could push XRP into the $10–$20 range, a utility-driven run — fueled by real-world adoption and large-scale settlement use — could elevate the token to between $100 and $1,000. As of report time, XRP trades at $2.88, with a circulating supply of roughly 59.42 billion tokens. This gives the asset a market capitalization in the low hundreds of billions. These figures are essential to understand because any significant price increase must be weighed against the sheer scale of the circulating supply. The Scale of BarriC’s Projection Applying today’s supply to BarriC’s targets highlights the magnitude of his prediction. At $100 per XRP, the market capitalization would be close to $5.94 trillion. At $1,000, it would soar to about $59.42 trillion. $XRP during alt season – $10-$20 $XRP during a utility run – $100 – $1,000 — BarriC (@B_arri_C) August 19, 2025 For comparison, this would surpass the entire current market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined many times over. Analysts often use this arithmetic to illustrate how transformative a “utility run” would have to be, requiring enormous global capital inflows. What a Utility Run Entails The idea behind BarriC’s projection is not rooted in speculation alone. Instead, it envisions XRP serving as a global settlement asset — a bridge currency for cross-border payments, institutional liquidity, and treasury operations. If XRP were to secure significant adoption in financial rails, the demand dynamics would shift drastically. Velocity, custody requirements, and liquidity reserves could reduce the circulating supply available for trading, amplifying price pressure. Recent analyses echo this, noting that a utility-driven rally could make triple-digit valuations conceivable under the right conditions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risks and Counterarguments Critics argue that such projections underestimate the scale of capital required. A $1,000 XRP implies a market capitalization far larger than the GDP of most nations, raising questions about feasibility. However, supporters counter that traditional market-cap calculations may oversimplify the mechanics of utility-driven assets, where token velocity and liquidity design can alter effective supply and demand. Ultimately, reaching those levels would require profound adoption, regulatory clarity, and integration into global financial infrastructure. Final Outlook BarriC’s forecast pushes the debate beyond short-term speculation, compelling analysts and investors to consider what genuine utility adoption would mean for XRP. While $100 to $1,000 remains a bold and long-term vision , the discussion underscores a key truth: XRP’s ultimate trajectory depends less on speculative cycles and more on whether it secures a role as a cornerstone of global payments and liquidity.

Chart Hints at Major Rally,https://cryptopotato.com/sui-bounce-imminent-chart-hints-at-major-rally/,"TL;DR SUI holds strong support at $3.30 with a triangle pattern signaling potential breakout above $4.20. Analysts watch $3.17 pullback level before a possible surge toward $5.40, $6.01, and $7.15 targets. Despite bullish charts, the drop in futures interest and TVL dips suggest cautious market sentiment. Price Moves Within Bullish Pattern SUI is showing a familiar setup on the charts. The token is trading near $3.47 and holding above a rising support line that has been in place since April. On the 2-day chart, the price action has formed an ascending triangle. This type of setup often appears before a move higher. Analyst Jonathan Carter shared that the token is finding strong support near $3.30, which is the lower edge of the triangle. He pointed out that this level has held several times, suggesting buyers are still active in this range. The upper boundary of the triangle stands near $4.20. This level has limited price moves since early summer. #SUI Triangle Support Holding Like a Boss The token is finding strong support at the ascending triangle lower border on the 2D timeframe‍ Triangle pattern + support retest = breakout setup building Bounce targets: $4.20 $4.80 $5.37 This is accumulation disguised… pic.twitter.com/eDWRMqwN1Z — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) August 20, 2025 If the price breaks above $4.20, Carter noted three levels to watch: $4.80, $5.37, and potentially higher. These levels are based on the size of the triangle and past price reactions. The trading volume data indicates that it is more active near the current price. Beyond $4.20, it becomes a possibility that may enable faster price movement in case that threshold is broken. Remarkably, the 50-day average is flat, indicating no significant trend, and the RSI is at around 45, indicating a balance between buying and selling pressure. Pullback May Come Before Breakout Another analyst, Ali Martinez, shared a daily chart using Fibonacci tools. He expects a pullback toward $3.17 before any breakout. This level lines up with the 0.618 retracement level and the rising trendline. His chart outlines a path where SUI could bounce from $3.17 and move toward $4.20, then aim for higher targets at $5.40, $6.01, and $7.15. These are drawn from past price swings using Fibonacci extensions. Sentiment Weakens Despite Technical Setup Data shows that traders are becoming more cautious. Open interest in SUI futures dropped from $2.66 billion in late July to $1.82 billion now, according to CoinGlass. This points to reduced trading activity. The Sui network has also seen a drop in activity. DeFiLlama reported a 2% dip in total value locked (TVL), bringing the figure to $2.02 billion. These changes reflect cooler sentiment across the ecosystem. Source: DeFiLlama Additionally, SUI was recently listed on Robinhood, making it available to US traders. This came after a deleted blog post caused early speculation. Despite the listing, the token fell. This move goes against the usual pattern where listings often lead to price gains. The listing is part of Robinhood’s effort to expand its crypto offerings. SUI is the native token of the Mysten Labs Layer-1 blockchain. The post SUI Bounce Imminent?

The move marks its lowest point in three weeks and extends a sharp reversal from the all-time high of $124,457 set on August 14, leaving the cryptocurrency down 9.3% from last week’s peak. BTC has broken below its 1D 50-day moving average ( MA ) for the first time in two months, triggering short-term jitters, though it remains comfortably above the 200-day SMA. The daily Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has fallen to 40, a level that marked major lows in both August and June. Despite the pullback, according to cryptocurrency analyst TradingShot , Bitcoin’s current structure resembles a fractal (a recurring chart pattern that mirrors previous phases in price and momentum) from its 2020 cycle. In fact, both the RSI and price action now look similar to late 2020, when BTC began its steep climb. BTC 2024 vs 2020 sequence. Source: TradingShot/Tradingview Back then, BTC’s rebound set the stage for its run toward $60,000. Analysts suggest today’s setup could play out in the same way, potentially supporting a move toward $150,000–$170,000 before the current cycle ends. Short-term correction risk Other analysts remain cautious. Master Ananda highlighted Bitcoin’s failure to break through the $122,524 resistance level, calling it a double-top bearish signal. He identified the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $102,077 as a key support zone, with potential downside toward $100,000 if selling pressure accelerates. Temporary support has appeared at $112,000, but Ananda doubts it will hold. He expects the correction to run its course within days before Bitcoin stabilizes and resumes its longer-term uptrend. BlackRock ETF flows spark alarm Adding to the bearish sentiment, on-chain trackers this week flagged large Bitcoin transfers linked to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). The ETF’s wallet balance appeared to fall by 50,000 BTC ($548 million) over the past week, sparking fears of a mass sell-off. Data shows 8,668 IBIT-linked transactions, with coins shifting between addresses in chunks ranging from $22 million to $35 million. In reality, the flows were routine custodian shuffles between cold storage, hot wallets, and counterparties for liquidity. All investor assets remain fully backed, and no Bitcoin was sold to exchanges. Featured image via Shutterstock.

With the price clustering at $835 in August 2025, investors are asking where BNB will be in the next ten years. Analysts are divided, but most believe its fundamentals indicate long-term strength. Meanwhile, investors looking for high-potential investments are turning to fresh crypto presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is expected to rise 9,300% over the next altseason bull run . Analysts anticipate unstoppable growth in the near future. Considering the continued favorable market conditions, BNB may enter the $900-$1,000 zone by the end of 2025. A breach of the psychological $1,000 mark would be the significant trigger of the bullish trend and precondition the valuations within the next years. 2027-2030 Forecast In the late 2020s, investors expect the BNB price to keep increasing, supported by the expanded adoption of BNB Chain and the growing usability of BNB in DeFi. Expectations continue to be focused in the range of $1,000 to $1,100 through 2027, with broader ranges of $1,600 through $2,500 out to 2030. This viewpoint assumes that Binance can continue to be the king of the crypto exchange market and the creator of innovations in the field. The Current State of BNB BNB continues to stay far above $800, and buyers have successfully defended critical support levels several times. Three powerful reasons are propelling its growth: the emergence of real-world applications, institutional adoption, and Binance’s deflationary token-burn scheme. All of these factors contribute to scarcity while also creating strong demand, which is the foundation of long-term value. 2025-2026 Outlook Experts foresee steady progress in the near future. If market conditions remain favorable, BNB might reach $900 to $1,000 by the end of 2025. Breaking the psychological $1,000 barrier would provide a major boost to bullish sentiment, opening the path for higher valuations in the following years. 2027-2030 Forecast Analysts anticipate that the value of BNB will rise over time as the BNB Chain and utility in DeFi become more widely used. The estimates vary from $1,000 to $1,100 in 2027 and $1,600 to $2,500 in 2030. This prediction requires that Binance continue its supremacy in the cryptocurrency exchange market by driving innovation throughout the ecosystem. 2030-2035 and Beyond After 2030, price projections are more speculative. According to conservative models, modest growth to about $1,350 by 2035 is likely, whereas higher projections indicate that BNB may surge to $4,000-$5,000 should mass adoption and innovative capabilities also pick up pace. These levels will require the BNB Chain to be able to compete against competitors such as Ethereum and Solana. A New Contender Takes the Spotlight As BNB continues its stable growth trend, there is increased speculative investing in newer ventures such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. As funding milestones are broken faster than ever, analysts believe it will bring rewards in line with the initial days of SHIB when numerous crypto millionaires were minted. According to some forecasts, an upside can reach 9,300% in the current cycle, so even a modest investment now will bring super gains prior to reaching the top of the cycle. This kind of amazing potential, as pointed out by several analysts, is what has driven many investors to diversify outside of the majors to seize explosive potential. Factors That Will Shape BNB’s Future Several key elements will influence how far BNB can go: Regulation : Clear, favorable rules could supercharge adoption, while restrictive measures could drag growth. BNB Chain Development : Continuous upgrades, Layer 2 solutions, and dApp expansion will drive demand. Competition : BNB must continue to innovate to hold its edge over Ethereum, Solana, and new challengers. Market Cycles : Like all cryptos, BNB’s fortunes are tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum’s broader market trends. Conclusion BNB’s future in 10 years looks promising due to its utility, scarcity, and institutional needs. The question of whether it will remain stable at the $2,000 level or reach $5,000 by 2035 will be determined by execution, competition, and worldwide adoption. Meanwhile, investors seeking explosive ROI will find MAGACOIN FINANCE to be a fantastic high-reward alternative as the altseason heats up. The two reflect quite distinct risk-reward possibilities, but they combine to highlight the broad range of possibility in the future of cryptocurrency.

To do this, it has listed its native utility token, $MBG. The launch successfully took place on July 22. The move is notable due to the sheer scale of the company’s traditional operations. Founded in California in 2005, the firm serves over 2 million clients across more than 100 countries and operates through more than 25 offices globally. It reports a daily trading turnover that exceeded $35 billion as of April 2025 and an annual trading volume that surpassed $4.5 trillion in 2024, with 29B combined asset value. Citing a debt-free balance sheet and audited 2024 revenues of $362 million, the group is now stepping into the volatile crypto market, aiming to build a new, regulated ecosystem from the ground up. What is the $MBG Token? According to the project’s white paper, the $MBG token will function as a utility asset across a four-part ecosystem. This structure attempts to connect the company’s existing financial infrastructure with crypto-native platforms. The four pillars include: MultiBank FX (TradFi): The Group’s established platform for traditional finance, offering access to over 20,000 stocks and 55 currency pairs, access to commodities and Forex markets. MEX Exchange: A planned institutional Electronic Communication Network (ECN) for both TradFi and crypto assets, which has been independently valued at $23.7 billion by Arthur D. Little. The project aims to become the first institutional crypto ECN by 2026 and projects it will handle over $460 billion in daily volume within five years. MultiBank.io: A regulated exchange for spot and derivatives crypto trading, which has passed security audits with a perfect 10/10 score from blockchain security auditor Hacken. It is regulated by authorities, including the UAE’s VARA and Australia’s AUSTRAC. MultiBank.io RWA: A marketplace for tokenized real-world assets. The platform aims to democratize access to previously illiquid markets, allowing investors to enter premium real estate assets with as little as $50. The $MBG token will be used for practical functions like paying for transaction fees, staking and accessing user rewards. Its tokenomics include a deflationary buyback-and-burn program funded by platform revenues, with a long-term goal of removing up to 50% of the total token supply from circulation. $3 Billion Push into Real-World Assets The group’s timing taps into a surging market interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a sector that reportedly grew 17% to $14 billion in April 2025. This move is solidified by a recently signed $3 billion agreement with UAE-based real estate giant MAG and blockchain infrastructure firm Mavryk to tokenize a portfolio of ultra-luxury real estate. The properties, which include The Ritz-Carlton Residences, Dubai, Creekside, and Keturah Reserve, will be offered as fractional investments on the MultiBank.io RWA platform. Talal Moafaq Al Gaddah, senior executive vice chairman of MAG, emphasized the token’s importance in the deal, stating that “the $MBG token provides ecosystem utility, including trading discounts, early access to properties, and a deflationary buyback-and-burn model.” The regulatory legacy of Multibank In its communications, MultiBank Group has placed significant emphasis on its regulatory background, drawing a contrast with the often-unregulated nature of the crypto space. The firm holds 17 financial regulatory licenses across jurisdictions like Australia’s ASIC, Germany’s BaFin, and Cyprus’ CySEC and has maintained an unblemished compliance record since 2005. This emphasis on a regulated framework directly addresses persistent issues that have hindered wider crypto adoption by traditional financial players, such as the lack of institutional trust and high counterparty risks. According to MultiBank.io CEO Zak Taher, the company’s strategy is to apply its experience from regulated markets directly to Web3. “Our approach is to build on a foundation of compliance and trust,” he commented, referencing the group’s established history. This focus on a regulated framework appears central to the company’s bid for legitimacy and success in the competitive crypto market. The industry will be watching the launch to see if this traditional, compliance-first approach can carve out a significant space in the world of decentralized finance.

On July 22, the company introduced its native utility token, $MBG, marking a significant milestone in its strategic expansion. Established in 2005 in California, MultiBank Group has grown into a global powerhouse serving over 2 million clients in 100 countries, supported by an extensive network of 25 offices worldwide. The Group's operational prowess is reflected in its staggering daily trading turnover, which stood at $35 billion as of April 2025, and an annual trading volume of over $4.5 trillion in 2024. The decision to step into the highly volatile crypto market is backed by a debt-free balance sheet and a formidable revenue of $362 million in 2024, audited and confirmed. The Group's vision involves constructing a fully regulated cryptocurrency ecosystem from scratch. The $MBG Token and Its Ecosystem The $MBG token, as detailed in the project's white paper, is designed as a utility asset integral to a four-part ecosystem that aims to synergize its existing financial infrastructure with innovative crypto-native platforms. MultiBank FX (TradFi): This pillar continues the Group's legacy in traditional finance, providing access to an extensive array of stocks and currency pairs, along with commodities and Forex markets. MEX Exchange: This upcoming platform is expected to become the first institutional crypto Electronic Communication Network (ECN) by 2026, with an ambitious daily trading volume target of over $460 billion within five years. MultiBank.io: This regulated exchange caters to both spot and derivatives crypto trading and has been lauded for its security, achieving a perfect score from Hacken, a blockchain security auditor. MultiBank.io RWA: This platform will allow for fractional investments in premium real estate assets, making it easier for investors to enter markets that were previously out of reach. The token's utility spans various functions such as paying for transaction fees, staking, and accessing user rewards. The token's economics include a deflationary buyback-and-burn mechanism, aiming to reduce up to 50% of the total token supply, enhancing its value over time. Investing in Real-World Assets: A $3 Billion Initiative The surge in market interest for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, which saw a 17% increase to $14 billion in April 2025, has positioned MultiBank Group at the forefront of this trend. A pivotal development in this area is the partnership with MAG and Mavryk, aiming to tokenize $3 billion worth of luxury real estate. Properties such as The Ritz-Carlton Residences and Keturah Reserve will be available for fractional investment through the MultiBank.io RWA platform, highlighting the $MBG token's role in providing benefits like trading discounts and early property access. Emphasizing Regulatory Trust MultiBank Group's long-standing commitment to regulatory compliance is set to be a cornerstone of its cryptocurrency venture. Holding 17 financial regulatory licenses from respected bodies such as ASIC in Australia and BaFin in Germany, the Group leverages its regulatory expertise to ensure a secure transition into the crypto domain. Zak Taher, CEO of MultiBank.io, emphasized the strategic move to replicate regulated market practices within Web3, aiming to foster trust and compliance in the new digital landscape. The financial community and crypto enthusiasts are keenly watching this traditional financial entity's foray into decentralized finance, anticipating how its regulatory-first approach will perform in this innovative sector.

The study, built on expert interviews and regional analysis, identifies systemic barriers to Latin American capital markets, ranging from relatively high fees and complex bureaucratic hurdles, to limited market depth and low financial literacy. These barriers are seen as contributing to the difficulties experienced by entrepreneurs and investors from accessing fair, efficient capital markets in the region. The Report identifies a phenomenon of “liquidity latency” in the region, which refers to the current obstacles and inefficiencies in traditional LATAM capital markets that have slowed the flow of capital and hindered investment. Factors that have contributed to this include high fees, complex regulations, and limited market participation. Structural issues including working hours, technological barriers, high start-up costs, and bureaucratic and regulatory hurdles have also been identified as posing challenges to business and investment growth in the region. The Bitfinex Securities Market Inclusion Report includes analysis, findings and experts from eight different Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, México, Panamá and Perú. Tokenisation is presented as offering a solution to the “liquidity latency” issues identified in Latin America. Tokenised assets digitise ownership of bonds, equities or funds, by issuing tokens on a blockchain, where each token corresponds to a share or unit of the fund. This structure allows for decentralised ownership and management together with multiple other advantages such as accessibility, transparency and efficiency. By reducing issuance costs to as little as 2-4% of capital raised, cutting listing times to 60-90 days, and enabling fractional ownership, blockchain-based securities can make investing dramatically more inclusive and efficient. “Tokenisation represents the first genuine opportunity in generations to rethink finance,” said Jesse Knutson, Head of Operations at Bitfinex Securities. “It lowers costs, accelerates access, and creates a more direct connection between issuers and investors.” With regulatory advances in countries like El Salvador, Argentina, and Brazil, the report suggests Latin America is uniquely positioned to embrace tokenised markets. In 2021, for instance, El Salvador became the first country to recognise Bitcoin as legal tender, and despite recent changes in the law, digital asset technology remains firmly entrenched in the country’s economy. In 2023, El Salvador passed the Digital Assets Issuance Law (LEAD), creating a fully regulated framework for the tokenisation of assets. Bitfinex Securities calls this not only a financial shift, but a broader socio-economic chance for the region to overcome historical barriers and drive growth. As indicated in the Report, tokenisation technology could improve accessibility for both businesses seeking capital and investors through lowering the cost of investing and raising capital, accelerating the pace of listings, and providing greater efficiency, accessibility and democratisation of investment, and expanding financial inclusion. Tokenisation could open a brighter opportunity for the region, and the Report underscores and dive into these possibilities.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick raised the idea under a broader push to rebuild manufacturing in the US, a central goal of President Donald Trump’s agenda. On Tuesday, Lutnick said the government is looking for an equity position in Intel under the program created during former President Joe Biden’s administration. He now aims to extend that approach to other firms, a White House representative and another source said. The move comes after a number of unusual arrangements between Washington and U.S. firms As reported earlier by Cryptopolitan , the administration allowed Nvidia to sell the H20 AI chips to firms in China while the United States takes 15% of the sales. The Pentagon is also set to turn into the biggest shareholder in a mining company in order to increase the production of rare-earths. Critics say such steps increase corporate risk tied to political decisions and could expose taxpayers if investments sour. Much of the $52.7 billion in CHIPS Act funding has yet to be disbursed to companies, including Micron, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung, and Intel. Two sources of Reuters have mentioned Scott Bessent is also involved in the US CHIPS Act talks, though Lutnick is leading the effort. The Commerce Department mainly looks after the CHIPS funding. The sources said Lutnick has pressed the equity concept and that Trump supports it. Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary said earlier that Howard Lutnick is working on an Intel deal that would give the government a 10% stake. “The president wants to put America’s needs first, both from a national security and economic perspective, and it’s a creative idea that has never been done before,” – Karoline Leavitt. In a CNBC interview, Lutnick said Washington wants a return on its “investment.” “We’ll get equity in return for that … instead of just giving grants away,” he said. Trump has also stated earlier that he wanted to end the CHIPS act. Lutnick’s remarks came a day after SoftBank invested in Intel Just a day earlier, SoftBank Group decided to put in $2 billion in tech firm Intel, which was also reported by Cryptopolitan . Intel has been struggling and failing to compete with other major tech firms due to management issues. He contrasted the new approach with earlier practices. “The Biden administration literally was giving Intel money for free and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies just giving the money for free, and Donald Trump turned it into saying, ‘Hey, we want equity for the money. If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action for the American taxpayer,” Lutnick said. The plan is drawing scrutiny abroad. Adviser to South Korea’s president, Kim Yong-beom, said the affected companies and his government had not been informed of such a proposal. He said foreign chipmakers such as Samsung need “predictability” for U.S. investments. An official from Korea’s chip-making industry said that semiconductor firms may find it difficult to accept equity stakes from the U.S. government. The official warned some might hold back or postpone projects unless Washington offers more incentives, such as larger funding. In Taiwan, Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei was asked in Taipei whether the U.S. could seek a stake in the chipmaker TSMC. He said the ministry would discuss the possibility with TSMC, which he added is privately held rather than state-owned. “We will also discuss with the National Development Council, as it is a shareholder of TSMC. We will thoroughly understand the underlying meaning of the U.S. Commerce Secretary’s remarks, but this will require some time for discussion and assessment,” Kuo said.

Traders Split,https://cryptopotato.com/will-aave-hit-600-or-fall-to-230-traders-split/,"TL;DR AAVE is holding above range lows with traders watching for a breakout toward $600. Daily chart shows an M-pattern forming, with a possible short-term target near $230. Balance of Power remains negative, but fading red bars suggest weakening selling pressure. Price Action and Current Structure Aave (AAVE) was trading around $290 at press time, with a slight gain of 1% over the last 24 hours. The asset has pulled back by nearly 10% over the past week. At present, AAVE is consolidating just below the mid-range zone between $320 and $340. CryptoAmsterdam has shared a weekly chart showing that AAVE is holding above its earlier range low entries. It also outlines a recent higher high, and the current consolidation may be forming a higher low. A break above mid-range could push AAVE toward the $600 range high, where traders would then look for a possible breakout into new levels. // $AAVE > Consolidating below the mid-range > Still one of my DeFi/Stablecoin narrative spot bets > Holding on to my entries at the range lows > Aiming for the range high zone, then into price discovery. https://t.co/Ggif6Er8pv pic.twitter.com/2IMm9prJ5o — CryptoAmsterdam (@damskotrades) August 20, 2025 Over the last few years, AAVE has moved through several phases. After a strong rally, it entered a deep decline, followed by a long period of sideways movement between $50 and $120. The move out of that range shows a possible shift away from accumulation. Aave is a major protocol in the DeFi space. It runs a non-custodial lending system and continues to hold a large portion of the market. Based on DefiLlama data , Aave’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is currently at around $36 billion, which makes up close to half of the entire DeFi lending market. Last week, its TVL reached $40 billion, marking a new all-time high. Bearish Setup on Short-Term Chart On the daily chart, analyst Ali Martinez pointed to a possible double top forming. This M-shaped pattern often points to a short-term top. If the pattern plays out entirely, AAVE could drop toward $230. The asset recently dropped to $285.89, after failing to move past the $330 level. Support around $278 is being watched. If that level breaks, the following zones to watch are near $250 and $244. Moving Averages and Volume Signal AAVE is now trading above the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) at $288, but just under the 50-day SMA, which is at $294. This shows that the short-term trend is undecided. Buyers will need to hold above $288 and push through the $294 area to regain momentum. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the Balance of Power (BBP) indicator is at -19.09, showing that sellers still have control. The red bars are smaller than last week, which may suggest that the pressure is fading. Traders are watching for a flip back into positive, which could confirm a recovery if resistance breaks.

The token traded within a tight $0.01 band, marking a 4% spread between its session high and low, as traders adjusted exposure across alternative digital assets. Analysts highlighted the $0.24 level as a key point of resistance, where buying momentum faded and downward pressure intensified. The most pronounced activity came during the final hour of trading on August 20, when volumes surged to 85.82 million HBAR. Market observers noted that the token tumbled to $0.23 before staging a modest recovery into the close, a pattern that underscored the elevated volatility. The heavy turnover during this window suggests sellers were dominant, creating short-term weakness and testing key support levels. Between 13:45 and 14:06, more than 3.8 million tokens changed hands, coinciding with the sharpest part of the decline. Prices briefly dipped to session lows before bouncing, as buying interest re-emerged to stabilize the market. By the final minutes, HBAR recovered enough to close near $0.23, signaling that while downside risks remain, short-term support is holding for now. Technical Indicators Analysis Token declined 3% from opening price of $0.24 to closing price of $0.23 over 23-hour institutional selling period. Trading range of $0.01 represents 4% spread between absolute session high and low. Resistance level established around $0.24 where institutional buying interest diminished significantly. Support level emerged near $0.23 with retail buying providing technical floor. Elevated volume of 85.82 million during final hours confirms institutional distribution patterns. Volume exceeded 3.8 million during peak selling period between 13:45-14:06 indicating coordinated liquidation. Final 14 minutes showed technical recovery from $0.23 support level suggesting retail buying interest.

In an industry where high volatility is the norm, WBT’s steady trajectory offers an alternative for investors who value predictable growth and practical benefits. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have seen multiple dramatic price cycles over the past few years, WBT’s movements have been notably more measured. This isn’t by chance — it’s the result of a deliberate economic design, combined with its role as the native coin of the Whitechain blockchain and deep integration within the WhiteBIT exchange ecosystem . Stability by Design WBT has a fixed maximum supply of 400 million coins. At launch, half of that was locked in the treasury with a controlled release over roughly three years, ensuring a gradual supply increase rather than sudden market shocks. The weekly buyback-and-burn mechanism is another stabilizing factor. WhiteBIT commits 33% of trading fee revenue and 5% of other fees to repurchase and burn WBT, gradually reducing total supply with a long-term target of 50% reduction. This consistent deflationary pressure helps support price stability and long-term value growth. Consistent Performance in a Volatile Market Since its public launch at $1.90, WhiteBIT Coin has grown by over +2200%, reaching $45.94 as of August 15. In June 2025, it achieved an all-time high of $52.27, and as of early August, it remains stable in the $42–$47 range. With a market capitalization exceeding $6.2 billion, WBT ranks among the top 35 crypto assets globally by market cap. According to TradingView data , WBT’s daily volatility frequently stays below ~1%, while BTC and ETH often move several percent in a single session. Even during Bitcoin’s downturns in late 2024 and early 2025, WBT maintained its levels, highlighting its defensive qualities in a risk-driven environment. Real Utility Driving Organic Demand Holding WBT within the WhiteBIT ecosystem comes with tangible advantages: On Main Balance — up to 100% maker fee discount and up to 80% taker fee discount In Holding — higher referral rewards (up to 50%), free ERC20/ETH withdrawals, free AML address checks, monthly WBT rewards based on WB Soul level, bonuses on USDT deposit plans, multiple deposit addresses, access to Launchpad, and reduced margin/borrowing fees The integration extends beyond the platform. The WhiteBIT Nova debit card, launched in 2024, offers cashback in WBT and BTC, creating everyday use cases and sustaining demand that isn’t purely speculative. Outlook WBT’s track record over three years demonstrates that stability in crypto is achievable when supply, utility, and demand are aligned. With its deflationary mechanics, platform-wide integration, and growing adoption, WhiteBIT Coin is positioned to remain a dependable choice for both retail and institutional participants looking for long-term, utility-backed exposure in the crypto market.

Eschewing the typical high-volatility path of its peers like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), WBT has focused on delivering a stable and utility-driven experience to its users. WBT's journey began with a clear economic design aimed at sustainability and stability. This approach is deeply integrated into its roles as the foundational currency of the WhiteBIT exchange and the Whitechain blockchain, fostering a robust ecosystem accessible via WhiteBIT . The Architectural Blueprint of Stability The foundational supply strategy of WBT involved capping the total issuance to 400 million tokens, with a significant portion securely locked away to control the circulation and mitigate abrupt market fluctuations. Sustaining its market value, WhiteBIT implements a weekly buyback-and-burn strategy, using up to 33% of trading fee revenues to purchase and permanently retire WBT tokens. This deflationary tactic is designed to enhance value over time by reducing the overall supply by a targeted 50%. Manifesting Stability Amid Market Turbulence From an initial price point of $1.90, WBT has seen a remarkable ascent, with its value increasing by more than 2200% to a high of $52.27 in June 2025, before stabilizing around $45.94 up to August. Despite the broader market's ups and downs, WBT's price has remained relatively stable, a testament to its resilience and strategic market positioning. Currently, its robust market cap of over $6.2 billion ranks WBT among the top 35 crypto assets globally . Even during significant market downturns, WBT's volatility has often remained under 1%, as per TradingView data , contrasting sharply with the multiple percentage shifts commonly seen in other major cryptocurrencies. A Utility-First Approach WhiteBIT Coin's utility reaches beyond mere speculative value. Users within the WhiteBIT ecosystem enjoy numerous benefits, including significant discounts on trading fees, enhanced referral rewards, waived withdrawal fees for certain cryptocurrencies, and even cashback benefits through the WhiteBIT Nova debit card. Up to 100% discount on maker fees and substantial reductions on taker fees when trading on the main balance. Additional perks for holding WBT include higher referral bonuses, free ERC20/ETH withdrawals, and exclusive rewards programs. Launched in 2024, the WhiteBIT Nova debit card further extends the utility of WBT, offering practical benefits like cashback in WBT and BTC, thereby integrating cryptocurrency use into everyday financial transactions. Forward-Looking Statements The preceding three years have solidly positioned WhiteBIT Coin as a model of what stability can look like in the cryptocurrency world. With its strategic supply control, broad utility, and growing user adoption, WBT is poised to continue its role as a valuable digital asset for diverse market participants.

China is reportedly considering authorizing the use of stablecoins backed by local currencies, according to the latest Reuters report . The move would mark a sharp policy turnaround after Beijing banned cryptocurrency trading and mining in 2021.The proposal is part of a strategy to strengthen the yuan’s role in international finance. The State Council is set to review and could approve the roadmap later this month, according to the report. The plan is to expand global use of the yuan and counter Washington’s accelerating push for stablecoin dominance.Beyond the council review, China’s top leadership will hold a study session by the end of August. That meeting will specifically focus on the yuan’s internationalization and the potential role of stablecoins.Senior leaders are expected to provide policy guidance, specify how the tokens should be integrated into business, and determine clear rules for their position in trade and finance, the report added.Challenging U.S. Dollar DominanceThe shift comes at a time when the United States is entrenching its dominance in digital currencies . Dollar-pegged stablecoins already account for the bulk of the $275 billion global stablecoin market.Washington has also moved to formalize its lead. President Donald Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act, which aims to promote USD-backed tokens worldwide.By comparison, China’s currency has been losing ground. The yuan accounted for just 2.88% of global payments in June, its weakest share in two years. The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, controlled nearly half of international transactions, according to SWIFT data.For Beijing, the stablecoin strategy is to close that gap, positioning the yuan as a digital rival to the U.S. dollar.Laying the Regulatory GroundworkTo avoid destabilizing its financial system, China is crafting a detailed framework for the rollout. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), with other regulators, will be tasked with defining rules, assigning responsibilities, and setting targets for yuan use abroad.According to sources, the plan will also include mechanisms to manage risks such as capital flight, speculative flows, and cyber vulnerabilities. Officials see this as essential to ensuring that stablecoins complement, rather than undermine, existing monetary policy.Hong Kong and Shanghai as Launch PadsTwo financial hubs will serve as launch pads for the project. Hong Kong, which introduced a stablecoin ordinance on August 1, will play a key role in offshore issuance. A PBOC advisor has already floated the idea of a Hong Kong-based yuan stablecoin to bypass capital restrictions.Meanwhile, Shanghai is building an international operations hub for the digital yuan. Together, these two financial centers will accelerate both domestic trials and offshore applications of yuan-backed stablecoins.International Push and SCO SummitChina’s global ambitions will also feature at the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin. The summit, scheduled for August 31 to September 1, could see Beijing discuss the use of yuan stablecoins for cross-border trade and settlement.Chinese exporters have already embraced dollar-backed stablecoins for faster international transactions. By introducing a yuan alternative, Beijing hopes to wean them off the dollar and accelerate the adoption of its own currency in global commerceChallenges That RemainDespite the enthusiasm, China faces steep hurdles. Its strict capital controls limit the free movement of money across borders, raising questions about how a yuan stablecoin could function on a truly global scale.Analysts warn that unless Beijing loosens some restrictions, yuan-backed tokens may struggle to compete with the liquidity and flexibility of dollar-based stablecoins.Still, the broader significance is clear. By embracing stablecoins, China is signaling that it no longer views crypto technology purely as a threat but as a strategic asset in the global currency race.",Market|Latest Stablecoin News Today,EN,0,0,ASIA|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-08-20 15:59:13

From established tokens breaking through resistance to advanced blockchain models unlocking new opportunities, investors are spotting setups that could define the next bull cycle. Cardano is breaking out of long consolidation with strong technical signals, Aptos is gaining traction despite pullbacks, and Litecoin is drawing in big institutional buyers. Yet the spotlight falls heavily on BlockDAG, where presale pricing and massive ROI forecasts have fueled intense early demand. Each project highlights a unique strength, from scalability and governance to adoption and utility, making them contenders for both quick trades and long-term strategies. Below, we break down why these coins could dominate portfolios in 2025 and why timing your entry could prove decisive. 1. BlockDAG: 36x ROI Presale Gains Speed BlockDAG’s presale is accelerating quickly, with its early-access advantage fading fast. Currently in Batch 29, BDAG is priced at just $0.0276, yet its projected post-listing value is $1, offering a potential 36x ROI for those moving early. Having raised over $378 million toward a $600M target, the pace suggests batches could sell out faster than expected. Unlike hype-driven coins, BlockDAG delivers a hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work framework that ensures lightning-fast, scalable transactions without losing decentralization. Adoption is already impressive, with 19,300 ASIC miners sold and more than 2.5 million users mining through the X1 mobile app. Developers are preparing dApps, tools, and integrations before mainnet launch, ensuring real-world use from day one. The urgency is clear: when Batch 29 closes, the price rises, instantly cutting into early-bird margins. For those searching for the next breakout crypto, BlockDAG looks set to dominate 2025 headlines. Delay too long, and the price could be ten times higher. 2. Aptos: Building Steady Bullish Momentum Aptos continues to build steady momentum, trading near $4.77, up around 10.5% for the week. While it saw a 3.4% dip in the last 24 hours, open interest remains strong, showing traders are holding rather than exiting. APT stays above its short-term EMAs, keeping bullish sentiment alive as it works to retest the 100- and 200-day EMAs. Price forecasts vary, but some analysts see highs of $15.55 by year-end. Backed by steady upgrades and strong community activity, Aptos secures its place among the best altcoins , particularly for those seeking both technical and ecosystem-driven upside. 3. Cardano: $1 Breakout Signals More Upside Cardano has surged to a five-month high, breaking $1 after a long 250-day consolidation. This breakout, driven by a classic bull flag pattern, lifted ADA by 10.7% in just 24 hours. Analysts point to further upside, eyeing $1.60–$1.75 in the near term, supported by strong buying volumes and rising market confidence. Notably, more than 15 billion ADA are being held long-term, reinforcing Cardano’s place among the best altcoins by proving deep investor commitment. With strong technical momentum and robust on-chain fundamentals, ADA appears primed for a continued rally, with potential to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the short run. 4. Litecoin: Institutional Demand Fuels Growth Litecoin is gaining quiet momentum, fueled by significant institutional backing. MEI Pharma recently committed $100 million into LTC at an average entry of $107.58, now valued around $115 million, showing strong confidence from major players. Currently trading around $122–$123, LTC is up more than 37% over the past month, despite a modest pullback. Technical signals remain bullish, with tightening supply adding extra upward pressure. With growing demand from both retail and institutions, Litecoin is one of the best altcoins to watch, potentially setting new multi-month highs in the sessions ahead. Best Altcoins to Watch Closely 2025 could become a defining year for digital assets, and the best altcoins featured here all show compelling reasons to watch closely. Cardano’s breakout highlights renewed strength, Aptos is steadily climbing, Litecoin is attracting institutional attention, and BlockDAG offers a presale with outsized upside potential. Although risk is always part of crypto markets, aligning with projects that mix strong fundamentals, promising technicals, and adoption momentum improves the odds of success. Short-term traders may find opportunities in rapid moves, while long-term investors could benefit from broader adoption cycles. As sentiment improves and major players expand ecosystems, the chance to secure early positions in the best altcoins for 2025 is narrowing. Moving before the crowd may decide whether you’re riding the wave, or watching it pass. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Although the meme coin leader is down by about 12.8% in the past seven days, it has managed to stay above $0.21. This resilience is highlighted as a higher low on the 5-day candlestick timeframe chart, and according to a technical analysis by crypto analyst Javon Marks, Dogecoin’s next major move may be far larger than most expect. Technical Setup Points To $0.6533 Breakout According to a technical analysis shared on the social media platform X by crypto analyst Javon Marks, Dogecoin’s price action has created another higher low on the 5-day candlestick timeframe. The most recent higher low is part of a trend that has created a series of higher lows since 2024. Related Reading: 4-Year Cycle Says Dogecoin Price Will Reach $1, Here’s Why The pattern of higher lows suggests that buying pressure is outweighing selling pressure, even in times of market weakness. Furthermore, it means Dogecoin is creating new price floors after each rally and subsequent rally, which strengthens the case for a continuation rally. In this case, the two most recent rallies were in the middle of July when the Dogecoin price broke above $0.27, and another rally in August when it touched $0.25 very briefly. Despite the correction that followed both rallies, the candlestick chart indicates that these lows were higher than previous highs and corrections. Now, according to Javon Marks, the immediate breakout target has been identified at $0.6533, which would represent a gain of more than 170% from the current price level. This target is derived from the technical setup of the holding breakout structure that Dogecoin has been playing out for many months. $1.25 Comes Into Play After Breakout If Dogecoin were to reach the $0.6533 breakout target, it would be its strongest bullish rally since early 2021. However, it would still fall short of its all-time high of $0.7316. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Crash Could End Soon With A Roadmap For $5 The analyst further predicted an even more ambitious scenario. Once the $0.6533 breakout target is achieved in this scenario, Dogecoin could extend its rally towards $1.25. Such a move would confirm a major shift in its long-term trend and create more consistent higher highs and higher lows across the 5-day candlestick timeframe chart and above the much-anticipated $1 price level. A rally of this magnitude would not only confirm Dogecoin’s standing as the leading meme cryptocurrency but also reintroduce its price action into breaking multiple all-time highs. It would also translate to a 490% surge from the current price level. Nonetheless, the first step is for Dogecoin bulls to convert its higher-low structure into a decisive breakout. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2131, down by 2% in the past 24 hours.

However, Anthony Scaramucci remains confident that BTC will recover from the ongoing downtrend and surge to a new high of $180,000 and beyond in 2025. Scaramucci Keeps $200,000 Bitcoin Year-End Target Alive Despite the robust downward movement in price, many analysts are still optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential in the short term, predicting a move to new all-time highs. Anthony Scaramucci , founder of SkyBridge Capital and a long-time Bitcoin advocate, has reignited bullish hopes as he recalled his end-of-year BTC prediction. During an interview on CBNC posted by Altcoin Daily on the X platform, Anthony Scaramucci maintains that BTC is on track to reach between $180,000 and $200,000 by year-end. The founder’s prediction is backed by tightening supply dynamics, boosting institutional adoption, and growing global recognition of Bitcoin as a hedge asset. According to Scamaracci, Bitcoin remains bullish in any scenario, expressing his hopes that United States President Donald Trump will pick the mama bear fed. His belief reflects an increasing number of well-known investors who think that Bitcoin’s next leg higher could be much more explosive than prior cycles. When asked about the base and most bullish case for BTC, Scaramucci started by highlighting the current state of the market. “I think what is happening now is lots of consolidation and institutional adoption ,” he stated. Years ago, BTC’s price action was mostly driven by retail adoption and CEOs working in the layer 1 blockchain space. However, this trend has started to shift towards the institutional level over time, as large corporations accumulate the crypto king at a substantial rate. A Transition Of BTC Ownership Ongoing In The Market The founder has pointed to the robust performance of BlackRock’s Bitcoin Spot ETF , the IBIT, which has attracted a wide range of retail and institutional investors. While institutional adoption is increasing, Bitcoin whales continue to offload their holdings. Scaramucci considers this pattern a crucial development, declaring it a shift in ownership. “I just think it is a function of buying in only 450 Bitcoin being made by the network per day,” he added. During this shift in ownership, the founder noted that demand for the flagship asset has surpassed issued supply or the overall available supply of BTC in the market. Considering these developments, the founder is confident that BTC still has room for more growth, potentially reaching his bullish target between $180,000 and $200,000 this year. This bold prediction suggests the current pullback is likely a healthy correction before another explosive move. Even though many other companies and analysts foresee a much higher target for Bitcoin by this year’s end, Scaramucci remains firm with his prediction, calling it a cautious price target.",Bitcoin News|Anthony Scaramucci|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BlackRock|BlackRock’s Bitcoin Spot ETF|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CBNC|Donald Trump|IBIT|SkyBridge Capital,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 16:00:24

50395228,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79396,1755705909,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst to XRP Holders: The Signal Now Says Buy,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-the-signal-now-says-buy/,"Ali, a respected chart analyst on X, has once again captured attention with a bold technical signal on XRP. In his latest post, he declared, “XRP looks ready to bounce!” while sharing a TradingView chart that showcased a completed reversal pattern. The analysis came with a reminder that the same methodology had accurately timed a recent market top, giving weight to the claim that the market may now be flashing a strong buy opportunity . The Chart and the “9” Signal The chart Ali shared displayed XRP’s recent price action against Tether, with candlesticks tracing a steady downtrend. The standout feature was the circled “9” candle at the recent low, marked with an upward arrow. This notation reflected the culmination of the TD Sequential indicator, a system designed to identify points of exhaustion in a trend. The presence of a “9” suggests that selling pressure may have peaked, setting the stage for a potential rebound. Ali’s post underscored that the same indicator had previously called the top, reinforcing the reliability of the signal in short-term scenarios. $XRP looks ready to bounce! After perfectly timing the top, the signal now says BUY. pic.twitter.com/NBbQuXd7RG — Ali (@ali_charts) August 20, 2025 Why the TD Sequential Matters Developed by Tom DeMark, the TD Sequential is a widely followed tool in technical analysis. It aims to spot moments when trends are overstretched and due for either a pause or a reversal. A completed nine-count in a downtrend often signals seller exhaustion, opening the door for buyers to step back in . While it is not a guarantee of a full trend reversal, many traders treat it as an early signal to prepare for a tactical bounce, especially when combined with strong risk management. Market Conditions Around the Signal At the time of Ali’s post, XRP was trading just above $2.90, reflecting heavy volatility after recent declines. Market data showed trading volume surging during the downturn, a sign that capitulation may have been underway. This aligns with the idea that when sellers exit en masse, it can create the conditions for a sharp rebound. Other analysts monitoring XRP also pointed to the same short-term TD buy signal, adding credibility to Ali’s observation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Supporting On-Chain Indicators Beyond price charts, on-chain data indicated heightened activity among XRP wallets during the selloff. Such behavior is often interpreted as a transfer of assets from weaker hands to stronger ones, suggesting accumulation at lower levels. Historically, these conditions have sometimes preceded relief rallies, further supporting the notion that a bounce could be imminent. What Traders Should Consider While Ali’s call highlights a potentially bullish setup, it also comes with caveats. Traders watching the signal may consider placing tight stop-loss orders just below the recent low to protect against further downside. Confirmation through higher highs, increased volume, and sustained buying pressure will be critical in validating the move. Without these signals, the “9” could mark only a temporary pause rather than the start of a full recovery. The Takeaway Ali’s analysis offers XRP holders a compelling reason to pay attention. By successfully timing the prior top and now flagging a completed TD Sequential buy signal, his post has given the market a fresh focal point. Whether the signal evolves into a sustained rally or simply a short-lived bounce will depend on how price action develops in the coming sessions, but for now, XRP watchers have a clear technical marker to guide their next moves.

The research firm explained that although this step may seem like a routine transaction for the market, it coincides with one of the most fragile liquidity environments of the last decade. It was noted that the $550 billion NPL rollover in 2023 was absorbed by the Fed's over $2 trillion reverse repo facility, strong bank reserves, and high foreign demand for Treasury bonds. However, according to Delphi Digital, none of these buffers exist today. Related News: Analytics Firm Warns: If Bitcoin Falls Below This Level, Fear and Pessimism Could Be Triggered in the Market The Fed's continued quantitative tightening (QT), the near-exhaustion of reverse repos, banks constrained by capital rules and losses, and the withdrawal of many foreign investors from China to Japan are all increasing market pressure. Therefore, every dollar the Treasury borrows this fall will be directly withdrawn from active market liquidity. The report also highlights risks for cryptocurrency markets. It notes that during periods of liquidity shortages, high-beta assets (e.g., ETH and similar altcoins) tend to experience sharper losses compared to BTC. It also notes that if the supply of stablecoins in particular shrinks, ETH and risky assets could be further pressured during the TGA rollover period. However, it also notes that structural inflows from ETFs or corporate treasuries could offset these risks. Delphi Digital argued that if the stablecoin supply expands, the NPL increase can be better absorbed compared to previous cycles, but if the supply contracts, the liquidity withdrawal will be reflected in the markets more quickly and strongly. *This is not investment advice.

In a Tuesday letter to the Senate Banking Committee, the crypto organizations argued that the bankers’ proposals prioritize shielding banks from competition over protecting consumers, potentially stifling innovation in the crypto industry. Crypto advocates say the banking lobby recommendations will only undo compromises reached after extensive negotiations. They argued that if Congress approves their requests, it would skew the market toward banks and suppress innovation. They further commented, “Payment stablecoins are not bank deposits, money market funds, or investment products, and thus they are not regulated similarly. Unlike bank deposits, payment stablecoins are not used to fund loans.” In their letter, the groups also drew attention to Section 16(d), a clause that banking groups want to eliminate. It lets state-chartered bank subsidiaries operate stablecoin businesses across state borders without further licensing requirements. They stated that scraping would only reintroduce the fragmented regulatory environment that undermines interstate commerce. They also countered suggestions that stablecoin yields might pull deposits away from community banks, noting that a July 2025 analysis by Charles River Associates found no substantial link between the two. Banks warn GENIUS Act loophole could divert $6.6 trillion from traditional lending As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , several banking institutions, including the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), have petitioned Congress to amend the GENIUS Act, warning that an existing loophole risks constraining credit for U.S. consumers and businesses. The banking groups have explained that although the GENIUS Act blocks issuers from offering yields, it fails to impose the same restriction on exchanges or affiliates. Thus, they believe some issuers can exploit this loophole and channel yields through exchanges. They even cautioned that the rule gap may result in deposit outflows of up to $6.6 trillion from the conventional banking system. The banks also cited their worries that the yield-bearing stablecoins could displace deposits, threatening the core mechanism by which banks fund loans through interest-driven savings accounts. They also explained that stablecoins are “fundamentally different” from bank deposits since they do not fund lending activities or invest in securities to produce yields; therefore, a systemic shift toward them could create vulnerabilities in the U.S. credit system. Ethena’s sUSDe has the most payouts with $30.71 million in the last 30 days Market data illustrates the scale of yield-bearing stablecoins. Analysts like Will Beeson, a former Standard Chartered executive and now founder and CEO of Uniform Labs, believe the GENIUS Act’s restrictions on yield-bearing stablecoins will expedite the flow of capital into tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). To date, yield-bearing stablecoins have paid out more than $800 million in returns to holders, according to a StableWatch report. Additionally, over the past 30 days, Ethena’s sUSDe dominated payouts with $30.71 million, while Securitize’s BUIDL delivered $8.39 million and Sky Ecosystem’s sUSDe $6.78 million. The stablecoin market’s $288 billion valuation remains just a sliver of the Fed-reported $22 trillion U.S. money supply. Meanwhile, major financial industry groups are urging global banking regulators to abandon proposed new rules for cryptocurrencies and, in a letter, warn that the measures could end up blocking banks from the $2.8 trillion digital asset market. On Tuesday, eight influential trade associations, including the Global Financial Markets Association and the Institute of International Finance, wrote to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to request a “temporary pause” on the rollout of standards related to crypto that were supposed to take effect in January 2026. The coalition warned that the “punitive capital treatments” in the rules would make crypto operations “uneconomical” for banks, which could force the sector to the fringes of the regulated financial system.

The move into fresh territory near $124K cooled back toward $112K, where price is now basing. This consolidation phase is seen by traders as a healthy reset, backed by steady institutional flows and a friendlier macro backdrop. As BTC builds structure for its next leg higher, capital is already scouting where to add torque once the leader pauses, and that’s where Pepeto (PEPETO) steps in. Bitcoin price prediciton and setup: clear levels, clear target Bitcoin recently tested fresh highs near $124,480 before cooling back toward $112,000, where it is now consolidating. Traders say this pause is driven by steady institutional demand, easing regulations, and softer Fed policy. The setup has analysts pointing to $130K as the next upside target. Institutional flows picked up after President Trump signed an order opening crypto to 401(k) retirement accounts, while a weaker US dollar and falling rates have added fuel. These shifts are giving analysts more confidence in the $130K call as August approaches. From a technical view, getting back to the $116K level, and holding above that zone will keep the bullish structure intact and leaves room for another breakout. With volatility still high, desks stress the bigger picture: the trend remains pointed higher, and Bitcoin’s path toward $130K is alive. Why rotation matters now Yes, Bitcoin still shows signs of heading toward $130K, but in the meantime its grip on the market is slipping. BTC dominance has dropped below 60%, down from over 65% just months ago, a shift that often marks the start of altcoin season. When Bitcoin consolidates and dominance fades, capital typically rotates into faster-moving names, especially presale tokens, where the highest upside sits. That’s why investors hunting for high-risk, high-reward exposure are eyeing Pepeto (PEPETO). With brand recognition, real Ethereum-based tools, and audited on-chain traction, Pepeto stands out as the presale that can capture the flow once altcoin momentum builds. Pepeto (PEPETO): Ethereum memecoin with real rails Most meme tokens pop then fade; Pepeto is built to last. Running on Ethereum mainnet, it ships real tools now: PepetoSwap for zero-fee trades, a native cross-chain bridge, and current staking rewards near 242% APY. There’s no waiting on roadmaps, buyers get live, working products on day one. At $0.000000148 per token, the presale gives early entrants clean exposure before listings widen demand. JOIN PEPETO’S PRESALE NOW Presale snapshot: fast traction, strong backing The presale’s traction is hard to miss. $6.2 million+ is already in, and a 100,000+ community is pushing reach and activity. Audits by SolidProof and Coinsult validate the contracts, and a live demo of PepetoSwap proves delivery over hype. Total supply is fixed at 420 trillion, a familiar meme baseline paired with clear, public tokenomics. As each stage lifts the price, the lower entry window keeps shrinking. For More Details, Visit: https://pepeto.io Why Pepeto outshines rivals Pepeto (PEPETO) wins because the meme sits on real rails. Zero-fee swaps build volume, the bridge smooths cross-chain moves, and staking tightens float while paying holders. That combo is pulling in whale wallets early and stoking fresh Tier-1 listing chatter. While others lean only on buzz, Pepeto blends culture with infrastructure, making it 2025’s most complete crypto presale. Price framing for fast readers At today’s presale price, the path to PEPE-style current levels ($0.00001219) maps to almost 100× from here. That math turns a $10,000 early investment into $1,000,000, the seven figures dream, if Pepeto’s listings and usage extend. The setup is there. The window is now. Disclaimer : To buy PEPETO, make sure to use the official website: https://pepeto.io/ As the listing draws closer, some are attempting to capitalize on the hype by using the name to mislead investors with fake platforms. Stay cautious and verify the source. Final call: best crypto to buy now Pepeto is emerging as more than just another presale, it represents a shift in what meme tokens can be. By grounding its brand power in real infrastructure, it signals that meme culture and utility no longer have to be separate lanes. Its exchange demo proves execution, its audits prove transparency, and its community proves that the story is already spreading far beyond early chatter. As Bitcoin consolidates and dominance slips, attention naturally rotates into higher-beta plays that can capture fresh inflows. That’s where Pepeto stands out: it takes the energy of meme trading and channels it through rails that actually scale. In a market where most projects either fade or overpromise, Pepeto is quietly building staying power. For investors scanning 2025’s presale field, Pepeto isn’t just another speculative bet, it’s the one that blends culture with credibility. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, the window is open, but it won’t stay wide for long.

Mutuum Finance phase 6 presale is still running with the token price at $0.035. The investors who invest in the token today can look forward to getting their investment back with a minimum of 500% in the upcoming few months. MUTM presale has surpassed over $14.65 million in funding and also had over 15400 token holders since its inception. With its decentralised lending market innovation, Mutuum Finance is starting to resemble a project that some are predicting will be bigger than XRP in 2025. XRP Market Update XRP is currently trading for $3.00, and market commentators have noted that roughly 94% of holders are in profit following its recent pump. Although such strength is an indication of resurgent buying pressure within the token, it also invites the possibility of profit-taking, especially if XRP breaks below the $3.05 support level, paving the way for an even more gloomy pullback. Such a caveat notwithstanding, institutional demand and assertive regulatory progress are still in command of market sentiment and prospects for comparison with upcoming projects like Mutuum Finance. Presale Stage 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has managed to onboard more than 15,400 investors with a total of more than $14.65 million raised in presale. The project is currently in phase 6 of presale at $0.035 today. Mutuum Finance Bug Bounty Now Open Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. It’s a four-level reward i.e., critical, major, minor and low under which each risk level is being rewarded. It is another point which indicates Mutuum is a frontrunner in building trust in terms of good infrastructure as well as good security. Mutuum Finance Giveaway: $100K Reward Mutuum Finance is having a $100,000 giveaway . 10 of them win $10,000 MUTM. It’s their live give-away for the new investors of the project, but also the side-experiment of the project to build long-term and loyal community. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance takes a two-model approach in achieving ultimate flexibility and efficiency with Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models of lending. Peer-to-Contract employs self-executing smart contracts that automate the lending process without the need for any human interaction. They are designed to function with variable market rates with an interest rate constructed from then-prevailing demand and supply. Middleman does not exist in Peer-to-Peer model, and the lenders interact directly with the borrowers. Peer-to-Peer model is common in meme coins. 2025 is the year of old and new altcoins. XRP is a stable and secure growth play, risk-minimizing investor wager. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a phase 6 presale growth opportunity pick at $0.035, twin-lending model, future USD-pegged stablecoin contender, with aggressive community promotions such as a $100K giveaway and a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Ripple (XRP) remains in its high price zone at $3.00, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming the high-flying sub-$1 alternative. Already at Stage 6 at $0.035, the presale has already topped $14.6 million, added more than 15,400 holders, and set early investors on course for at least 500% profit on launch. Underpinned by a two-lending DeFi platform, a $100,000 community bounty, and a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty, MUTM has strong fundamentals with compounding adoption. Specialists now foresee it has the potential to surpass XRP’s 2025 performance. Invest in MUTM tokens today before Stage 7 launches the price to $0.04.

It has a $33.5 billion market cap and trades for $0.22 as of August 2025, ranking among the top cryptocurrencies. This price is well below its all-time high of $0.74 in May 2021, but increased institutional interest and continual upgrades suggest a new price spike. However, astute investors should also consider Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a new meme coin that many say might outperform Dogecoin by 35x. Dogecoin to Rally Past $0.70 as DOGE Bulls Eye Comeback The past few years have been quite a ride for Dogecoin. Yet, its path forward still looks promising for a move beyond the $0.70 mark. The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, launched in January 2025, offers bigger investors a smoother entry point. By allowing institutions to invest in DOGE without purchasing it, demand can increase without the usual friction, potentially giving the price a boost. On top of that, the Dogecoin Foundation just launched the “Dogebox” project. This is all about making DOGE work better in real life—think payments, remittances, and more. By beefing up the technology behind it, they’re pushing the coin toward everyday use that regular people and companies can easily tap into. Talk is heating up that Dogecoin might soon be a payment option on X, the platform that used to be called Twitter. Recent tweaks show Dogecoin logos and a few shoutouts, hinting the coin could be folded into the platform’s payment system. Given Elon Musk's strong backing of both X and Dogecoin, it seems more plausible that he could integrate Dogecoin into the X app as a unique, in-demand feature in the near future. If that happens, the coin’s reach—and its price—could go way higher. Price Predictions for Dogecoin Analysts are becoming increasingly bullish about Dogecoin, despite the price remaining relatively low. In the short term, they expect DOGE to hit $0.25 by August 2025. By the end of the same month, it could even climb to between $0.28 and $0.30. Looking further ahead, the outlook gets even brighter. Experts predict Dogecoin could reach $0.70 by December 2025, thanks to more institutional money flowing in and fresh use cases being built for the token. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A New Meme Coin for Huge Upside While Dogecoin still has room to run, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is stepping up as the next meme coin that could run 35x. The coin is brand-new to the meme coin scene, and during its presale, it has already snagged over $19.5 million, selling 12.8 billion tokens along the way. With a presale price of just $0.0020, investors get a prime shot before it goes live on major exchanges. Why Little Pepe Could Outshine Dogecoin Little Pepe is already winning hearts with 31,000 holders and whales dropping $5,000 to $9,000 on big buys. That tells you folks believe in it. Like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu before it, Little Pepe thrives on memes and a community that pushes it viral across social feeds. When the crowd gets loud, coins get legs. What puts Little Pepe a step ahead is its Certik audit. That means the smart contracts have been professionally checked, which keeps the bad actors away and calms investors who remember how risky unverified coins can get. A safe contract is a happy wallet. Little Pepe’s tokenomics are built for the distance. Liquidity, marketing, staking, and rewards all get their piece of the pie. Here’s the slice breakdown: 26.5% for presale, 10% locked in liquidity, 30% for the chain’s own stash, 10% on decentralized exchanges, 10% to keep marketing fresh, and 13.5% saved for staking and rewards. Best of all, 0% tax means you keep every bit of growth that comes your way. Giveaway and Growing Interest Little Pepe is getting everyone involved with a big $777,000 giveaway: 10 winners will each snag $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. When you mix that excitement with strong presales, you get a lot of chatter that makes traders sit up and pay attention. If sentiment stays hot and the token hits exchanges, the price could really jump. Final Thoughts: Dogecoin vs. Little Pepe—Which 2025 Winner? Dogecoin might push toward $1 or $1.50 down the line, but Little Pepe (LILPEPE) looks even sweeter for anyone hunting huge wins in the meme coin game. The token keeps picking up speed, and early backers could see a 35x play, making Little Pepe one of the hottest coins to follow right now. Whether you’ve traded for years or you’re just curious, Little Pepe makes a strong case to ride the meme coin wave. Its low price today, loyal community, and solid token model suggest that big milestone. 2025 could be the year it blows past the starting line.

Although this is below its peak of $0.74 in May 2021, the scene is set for a potential surge, buoyed by institutional interest and technological advancements. Alongside, the new entrant Little Pepe (LILPEPE) promises potentially even greater returns, sparking interest among investors looking for the next big meme coin. The Revitalization of Dogecoin In the evolving crypto space, Dogecoin has shown resilience and adaptability. The launch of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust in January 2025 has provided a more accessible investment route for large-scale investors, mitigating the usual complexities of direct cryptocurrency purchases. This strategic move is expected to bolster Dogecoin's market presence significantly. Enhancements in Dogecoin's utility through projects like ""Dogebox"" are making it more viable for everyday transactions, such as payments and remittances. These initiatives aim to integrate DOGE more comprehensively into everyday financial activities, potentially increasing its adoption and value. Speculation about its integration into X (formerly Twitter) as a payment method, supported by hints of Dogecoin symbols and mentions on the platform, further fuels optimism about its financial trajectory. Potential Price Milestones for Dogecoin Market analysts project a short-term increase in Dogecoin's price to $0.25 by the end of August 2025, with potential to reach $0.70 by December 2025. These predictions hinge on continued institutional investment and expanding use cases for the token. Unveiling Little Pepe (LILPEPE) While Dogecoin progresses, Little Pepe is making waves in the meme coin arena. The coin's presale success, raising over $19.5 million by selling 12.8 billion tokens, demonstrates significant market excitement and potential for growth. Advantages of Investing in Little Pepe The early adoption phase for Little Pepe looks promising with its robust tokenomics and security features like a Certik audit, which ensures a safer investment landscape. Significant investments from cryptocurrency whales, evidenced by transactions ranging from $5,000 to $9,000 , reflect growing confidence in its financial prospects. To further fuel investor interest, Little Pepe has announced a $777,000 giveaway, divided among 10 lucky winners, which is bound to keep the community engaged and invested in the coin's success. Conclusion: Dogecoin and Little Pepe in the Crypto Race of 2025 As Dogecoin aims to solidify its position and breach the $1 mark, Little Pepe appears poised for a potential explosion in value, serving as a testament to the dynamic and speculative nature of meme coins in the cryptocurrency market. For both seasoned traders and new investors, these coins present intriguing opportunities and challenges as they evolve through 2025.

The online post showed multiple transactions detailing over 600 purchases of corporate, municipal, and state-issued debt. U.S. Office of Government Ethics revealed 22 pages of forms detailing the transactions made by the U.S President. The sum of purchases made accounted for over $100 million across different transactions. The filing, however, does not provide precise dollar figures; rather, it just lists broad ranges of value for each transaction. U.S Office of Government Ethics discloses Trump’s financial activities Political rivals and critics have continuously raised questions about potential conflicts of interest since Trump took office. According to the U.S federal law, the President, Vice President, and senior government officials are required to periodically disclose their financial transactions to the Office of Government Ethics. The recent disclosure has shown that Trump has invested a lot across a broad range of debt issuers. The bond has been bought from the government, local entities such as gas and water districts, hospital authorities, corporate bonds, and school boards. Multiple American companies have been involved in the transactions, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Meta, Qualcomm, The Home Depot, and T-Mobile USA. According to the filing, Trump purchased bonds between $500,000 and $1 million from T-Mobile, UnitedHealth Group, and Home Depot in February and between $250,000 and $500,000 from Meta during the same month. Business entities and government departments generally use bonds to refinance existing obligations, increase liquidity, or fund new projects. Invested parties receive interest payments over the life of the bond in addition to the principal payable when the bond matures. The purchases revealed by the Office of Government Ethics show how much officials serving in office can have in terms of financial reach. The holdings owned by the President have been subject to scrutiny by watchdogs and opponents, saying they could be influenced directly by changes in policies under his administration. The office of the President has not yet responded to the matter despite several attempts from media agencies to get a quote. Trump’s $100 million bond investment draws watchdogs’ attention Trump, in his defence, has previously said that all his investments are consolidated under a trust that his children manage. Despite the comment, revelations from earlier filings submitted earlier this year have shown that the proceeds of such investments flow back to him. For instance, the June disclosure revealed that he retains a significant amount of financial assets tied to his business interests. American federal law excludes the President and Vice President from specific conflicts of interest that may apply to other officials. Historically, modern Presidents who came before Trump have chosen to divest their private holdings before taking office. Trump’s approach has drawn the attention of watchdogs and political opponents, but he remains within the bounds of the rule of law. According to Forbes , the President’s net worth was $2.1 billion in 2020 before leaving office for his first term in 2021. His current net worth is around $5.5 billion, with growth attributed mainly to recent ventures and business activities while in office. The disclosure shows that the purchases have been scattered across multiple entities, both public and private, with no single area of concentration.

Each carries a unique story, with traders weighing the balance between potential momentum and proven fundamentals. Stellar’s price outlook is shaped by an inverse head and shoulders formation that could trigger a bullish breakout if it clears the $0.50 mark. Bittensor’s targets focus on the $420 resistance level, with analysts pointing to $1,000. Cold Wallet sits in a different category. At Stage 17, priced at $0.00998 with more than $6.3 million raised, it still holds over 3,400% ROI potential against its $0.3517 launch price. Unlike setups that rely on sentiment, its cashback and fee rebate model creates measurable growth from day one, offering an equity-style entry into a live, revenue-ready platform. Stellar Approaches Key Breakout Zone at $0.50 Stellar is building a bullish setup as its chart develops an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a classic formation that often signals a strong breakout. Price action has been steadily recovering from July lows and is now pressing against the neckline near $0.50, a decisive level that could define its next move. Technical indicators are aligning with the bullish case. RSI holds near 59, MACD shows a positive crossover, and moving averages support continued strength. If Stellar closes above $0.50, projections point toward $0.77, positioning XLM as a potential top mover in the altcoin market. Bittensor Tests $420 With Eyes on $1,000 Bittensor is trading near $398 with strong momentum as it approaches the critical $420 resistance. A confirmed breakout above this level could unlock a rally toward $1,000, with checkpoints at $485, $500, $615, and $700. Current support is firm between $365 and $370, while deeper demand sits near $320 to $325. The token has grown 1.65% in the past month with $183 million in trading volume, reflecting steady interest. Analysts highlight $500 as a crucial level; clearing it could accelerate momentum toward $700. With buying pressure and AI-driven demand rising, TAO is positioned as a contender for major gains. Cold Wallet’s Stage 17 Presale Creates Rare Equity-Like Entry Cold Wallet is being treated less like a speculative utility token and more like early equity in a platform that already generates revenue. Its structure is built on cashback rewards and fee rebates, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where every user action drives value back into the token. With more than $6.3 million secured during presale, that cycle has already moved from theory to practice, showing that the model is working in real time. At the current Stage 17 price of $0.00998, Cold Wallet still offers entry at sub-cent levels. This compares with its confirmed listing price of $0.3517, which represents a potential ROI of over 3,400% for those securing allocation now. Each advancing stage reduces the gap between presale pricing and market valuation, leaving fewer opportunities for buyers to capture outsized upside. What makes this moment significant is the precision of timing. Stage 17 remains one of the last chances to access pricing that looks more like an early seed round than a retail listing. Once presale transitions to launch, the entry point will no longer reflect early equity-style multiples but rather market-driven repricing. Cold Wallet has positioned itself as a structurally advantaged play, blending proven adoption with revenue-ready mechanics. For those seeking exposure to both growth and utility, Stage 17 represents one of the most compelling presale setups of 2025. Moving Ahead Once speculation fades, the difference between these projects becomes clear. Stellar’s outlook relies on chart confirmation, and Bittensor’s targets hinge on clearing key psychological levels. Both have potential, but both remain tied to sentiment and momentum. Cold Wallet is already proving its utility with a cashback and fee rebate system that drives demand with every transaction. With $6.3 million raised and Stage 17 still priced at $0.00998, it offers equity-like access at sub-cent levels. This positions buyers in a project where adoption is real and the ROI pathway is already defined.

It’s earned through timing, consistency, and presence when it matters most. XRP is capturing attention with a surge in open interest, while Stellar’s recent technical signals have traders on alert for more downside. Both reflect shifting momentum, but only one project is actively recognizing early participation before the spotlight fully hits. Cold Wallet stands apart by rewarding users not after the fact, but during the build. Its Crystal Vault rank tracks live engagement, referrals, and on-chain actions, proving who helped shape the foundation. For those eyeing the best long term crypto investment, that kind of recognition speaks volumes. Crystal Vault Isn’t Just a Rank , It’s Proof You’re Building Cold Wallet’s Future Crystal Vault is more than a title. In fact, it’s a live metric of real influence within the Cold Wallet ecosystem, and it’s already active before the project even hits exchanges. Unlike other platforms that reserve recognition for post-launch hype, Cold Wallet is rewarding users now. As a result, those who interact with the app, bring in referrals, and actively engage with the vault mechanics are already climbing toward this elite rank. According to the Cold Wallet, Crystal Vault reflects “refined mastery and extensive vault influence.” Importantly, this rank can’t be bought. It must be earned through meaningful action. To that end, Cold Wallet is quietly recording every user interaction during its presale phase, rewarding those who are not just investing, but participating. Every referral, every vault move, every on-chain action feeds into your trajectory toward this milestone. This isn’t a symbolic gesture. Rather, it’s Cold Wallet’s way of defining who helped shape its foundation before it caught mainstream attention. Currently, with $6.3 million already raised in crypto presale , and CWT selling at just $0.00998 in stage 17, early backers have a unique opportunity to build long-term position and recognition ahead of the $0.3517 launch price. Recognition of XRP’s Momentum Builds as Open Interest Soars XRP has turned heads with its soaring open interest, passing the $3 billion mark after a period of subdued activity. This development, signals renewed conviction from traders and lays the groundwork for a potential XRP price rally. Consequently, with more leveraged positions entering the market, expectations are mounting for a decisive move, upward if bullish sentiment persists, or downward if sentiment turns. Traders recognize this open interest surge as more than technical data. Instead, it’s a badge of market engagement and belief in XRP’s near-term trajectory. Because of this, the buildup of speculative interest may well provoke further volatility. All eyes now track whether this activity evolves into a breakout or triggers sharp reversals, underscoring XRP’s role as a focal point for those attuned to early shifts in momentum. A Stark Signal from Stellar: A Recognized Shift into a Stellar XLM Bearish Outlook Stellar opens with technical alarms screaming caution. A death cross has formed on short-term charts, and exchange inflows are now positive, both pointing to mounting selling pressure. Together, these signals crystallize into a clear Stellar XLM bearish outlook that few can ignore. At present, sellers have seized control, driving price lower and edging toward key support zones near $0.29 to $0.26. Every measure, from moving averages to net flows, aligns to warn that Stellar is flirting with deeper downside. Support holds only if buying interest returns with conviction. Otherwise, XLM appears poised to test more critical levels. For those watching closely, this isn’t noise, it’s a credential of market commitment. In essence, the bearish structure on view now stands as recognition that short‑term pressure is intensifying. Crystal Vault Sets Cold Wallet Apart from the Rest Short-term movements can capture attention, but long-term value is often tied to recognition. While XRP eyes a potential rally and Stellar signals caution, neither offers a system that tracks and rewards user contribution during the build. Cold Wallet does. Its Crystal Vault rank is already active, rewarding those who refer, engage, and shape the platform in its earliest stage. That level of transparency and acknowledgment before launch gives Cold Wallet an edge. For anyone looking for the best long term crypto investment, it’s not just about timing the market, it’s about being recognized for helping build what’s ahead.

According to sources familiar with the matter, this move aims to strengthen the global role of the Chinese yuan. If approved, the move is significant toward increasing the international use of China’s currency and reducing reliance on the US dollar. Yuan-Backed Stablecoins at the Forefront of Global Financial Innovation Notably, China intends to discuss its plans at the upcoming Tianjin Summit later this month. This important event will see Chinese officials present a strategy for increasing the use of the yuan in international markets. The plan will outline goals for the global use of the yuan, define roles for domestic regulators, and provide guidelines for managing financial risks associated with the use of digital currency. Unlike unstable cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are digital tokens tied to a stable asset, in this case, the Chinese yuan. They facilitate fast, cheap, and more secure cross-border transactions. These stablecoins are also a useful option for international trade and finance. Experts view this development as a response to the ongoing dominance of the US dollar, which accounts for the majority of global reserves and trade settlements. By utilizing blockchain technology and regulated stablecoins, China will make the yuan a strong option as a reserve currency, most especially in developing markets and digital economies. China Forges Ahead in Crypto Innovation The Republic of China has enjoyed remarkable advancements in its crypto sector. China’s development of the digital yuan and its effort in exploring blockchain technology showcase its commitment to driving innovation in cryptocurrency. Recall that the digital yuan, a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) of the People’s Republic of China, demonstrated impressive growth in transactions. Last year, it was announced that the CBDC surpassed popular stablecoins USDC and USDT in activity, achieving a transaction volume of over $1 trillion, equivalent to 7 trillion yuan. China’s Growing Interest in Stablecoins and RWAs Interestingly, Chinese government officials are paying more attention to stablecoins and real-world assets (RWAs). Some government officials have started to explore how these tools can be used to support financial innovation, improve payment systems, and promote the digital economy. This suggests that while China remains cautious about cryptocurrencies, the country is not completely closing the door on blockchain and digital assets .

The majority of proceeds from the IPO included multiple stablecoins such as USDC, EURC, and Ripple USD (RLUSD), which Ripple issued on the XRP Ledger. A Landmark IPO Settled In Stablecoins Bullish officially closed its IPO on August 14, 2025, with its shares now trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the BLSH ticker. Jefferies coordinated the IPO as the billing and delivery agent by minting, converting, and delivering stablecoins across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Most of the IPO proceeds went into USDC, one of the most widely used stablecoins. A portion of the funds was also received in EURC and Ripple USD (RLUSD) , further diversifying the settlement mix. Once collected, the stablecoins were transferred into custody under Coinbase, which now exclusively manages these assets on behalf of Bullish, a custodial setup that reflects the need for safe storage in large transactions and the importance of robust crypto systems for managing substantial funds. Ripple’s RLUSD And The Future Of Stablecoin Integration Several stablecoins were used in the IPO, but Ripple’s RLUSD took the spotlight. Using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger showed its growing role in major financial deals. For Ripple, this key moment proves its stablecoin can manage large transactions in leading capital markets. Bullish executives are vocal about why they structured the IPO this way. Bullish’s CFO, David Bonanno, called stablecoins one of the practical use cases in digital assets. According to him, Bullish uses stablecoins for global transfers thanks to their speed and safety, and to him, the IPO is proof of their increasing value to large institutions. He highlights the company’s collaborations with stablecoin issuers like Ripple, saying its infrastructure and liquidity help drive new ideas and growth. Coinbase, now responsible for holding the IPO proceeds, also sees this as a turning point. The Vice President of Institutional Product at Coinbase, Greg Tusar, says the milestone is proof that stablecoins are changing financial systems in real time. He says recent steps in regulation, including the GENIUS Act, give NYSE-listed companies like Bullish the confidence to embrace digital asset solutions. Tusar added that more straightforward rules and strong custody options have created the groundwork for stablecoins to transform the way businesses and everyday people use money. Bullish’s IPO and Ripple’s RLUSD highlight the growing link between crypto and traditional finance. What was once seen as a speculative asset class now provides the rails for a historic Wall Street transaction, with stablecoins proving they are more than just a tool for crypto traders . As Bullish begins its journey as a publicly traded company, its reliance on stablecoins , particularly RLUSD, could become a blueprint for how other institutions approach capital markets in the years ahead.",Ripple|bullish|Bullish IPO|Bullish news|ripple|ripple news|Ripple price|Ripple RLUSD|RLUSDT|RLUSDT news|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP Ledger news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|XRP|WALLET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 18:00:47
50399507,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=807323,1755712850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50399507.jpeg,Ethereum Treasury Boom Drives Demand: Can The Market Handle The Risks?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-treasury-boom-drives-demand-can-the-market-handle-the-risks/,"Ethereum is undergoing a correction after weeks of strong momentum, but institutional adoption is quietly reshaping the market’s long-term dynamics. According to CryptoQuant, the popular “Crypto Treasury Strategy,” long associated with Bitcoin, has now entered the Ethereum ecosystem. Over 16 companies have already adopted this approach, collectively holding 2,455,943 ETH worth nearly $11.0 billion. This significant allocation has effectively locked away a sizable portion of ETH, reducing available supply on the open market. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Historic Short Interest: Rally Could Trigger Massive Liquidations The treasury movement mirrors Bitcoin’s playbook, where corporations strategically accumulated BTC as a reserve asset. However, Ethereum presents important differences. Unlike Bitcoin’s hard-capped supply of 21 million, ETH has no fixed maximum. Instead, its supply dynamics are shaped by network activity and the burn mechanism introduced with EIP-1559. While these mechanics can create deflationary periods, Ethereum’s total supply still increased by about 1 million ETH (~0.9%) over the last year. This duality presents both opportunity and risk. On one hand, institutional holdings reduce liquid supply and reinforce Ethereum’s role as a strategic asset. On the other hand, variable issuance means that during periods of low network activity, supply growth could accelerate, diluting scarcity effects. As Ethereum tests key demand levels, the treasury strategy may prove pivotal in shaping its next major trend. Ethereum: Treasury Concentration And Leverage Risks According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, Ethereum’s recent treasury adoption trend carries both opportunities and risks. On one hand, institutional treasuries have locked away billions in ETH, reducing available supply on the market. However, the structure of these holdings also presents concentration risks. For example, BitMine Immersion Technologies, which has openly stated its goal of controlling 5% of all ETH, currently holds just 0.7%. The next largest holder, SharpLink Gaming, manages only 0.6%. This means treasury adoption is still concentrated among a few players. If one or two large holders were to offload their reserves, the market could face sharp price shocks. Beyond spot accumulation, leverage is another growing factor. CryptoQuant highlights that ETH futures open interest has climbed to around $38 billion. This level of leverage means that large swings in price can trigger cascading liquidations. In crypto markets, leverage is synonymous with volatility. The fragility of this setup was evident on August 14, when a wipeout of just $2 billion in open interest led to $290 million in forced liquidations and a 7% drop in ETH’s price. This event underlines how quickly things can spiral when liquidity is thin and leverage is high. Spot selling alone isn’t driving volatility—leveraged positions magnify every move. In this context, Ethereum’s treasury adoption may secure long-term demand, but concentrated holdings and growing leverage remain key vulnerabilities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Flip To Losses For First Time Since January ETH Testing Critical Liquidity Levels Ethereum’s price action on the 3-day chart shows that after rallying to a local high near $4,790, ETH entered a correction phase but remains well above key moving averages. Currently trading around $4,227, the price has retraced from its peak but is still holding the broader bullish structure. The 50-day SMA ($2,687), 100-day SMA ($2,838), and 200-day SMA ($2,912) are all trending upward, reflecting strong underlying momentum. Importantly, ETH is trading significantly above these long-term averages, confirming that the bullish trend remains intact despite the pullback. The strong bounce from below $3,000 earlier in the summer marked a decisive reversal after months of consolidation, setting the foundation for the latest breakout. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,350 Liquidity Pool: Can Demand Hold? If bulls manage to hold the $4,200–$4,100 support zone, ETH could retest resistance near $4,790 and potentially move into price discovery. Conversely, failure to maintain this level could see a retest of the $3,800–$3,600 range. The coming sessions will be critical in confirming whether Ethereum resumes its uptrend or enters a deeper correction.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) aims for a $30B–$50B market cap that could bring strong gains and lift its ecosystem tokens. Avalanche (AVAX) is showing strength on charts after breaking out of long-term resistance, with price goals pointing toward $120. But Cold Wallet (CWT) is doing what others often fail to do, delivering adoption before launch. Its $6.2 million presale already counts over 2 million users from Plus Wallet. At Stage 17’s $0.00998, far above Stage 1’s $0.007, the locked-in $0.3517 listing keeps the ROI window wide open, for now. Shiba Inu Targets $50B Market Cap For Rally Shiba Inu’s team member Lucie shared that SHIB needs a $30–$50 billion market cap to unlock a major price rally. This could lift tokens like BONE, LEASH, and TREAT along with it. Sitting near $7.6B now, SHIB would need a 295%–558% surge to reach that target. If SHIB pulls it off, the “halo effect” could drive value across its ecosystem. With the total crypto market eyeing $4.1 trillion, talk of an altcoin season is growing. For SHIB believers, this setup feels like a big moment. Avalanche Market Outlook Aims As High As $120 Avalanche (AVAX) just broke out of a descending channel and is bouncing off long-held support dating back to 2023. This move, backed by its 50-week moving average, suggests momentum may last. The first target sits near $30, with higher moves toward $55 and even $120 possible. Its symmetrical triangle chart pattern supports one of AVAX’s strongest bullish setups in months. Traders are watching if AVAX can close above resistance, which would confirm its next rally stage. With strong technicals and long-term potential, AVAX looks like a solid altcoin risk-reward play. Cold Wallet Presale Hits $6.2M As Stage 17 Stays Active Cold Wallet’s presale isn’t crawling, it’s racing ahead. While many projects spend weeks chasing attention, Cold Wallet has already secured $6.2 million with over 740 million tokens sold. Stage 17 is still open at $0.00998, though the clock is ticking. With a fixed listing price of $0.3517, the upside is real and measurable, not dependent on guesswork. From its Stage 1 price of $0.007, each tier has moved closer to the listing, steadily narrowing ROI for latecomers. Its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition brings 2 million active users on day one, solving adoption before launch. Every transfer, swap, or transaction within Cold Wallet instantly rewards users with cashback, giving it immediate use beyond speculation. Whales are already circling, and supply is shrinking fast. With over 740 million tokens gone, the move to Stage 18 could mark the end of bargain entries. This presale is unique; it’s not about waiting for future features, it’s about using them right now. At this speed, waiting could mean missing the clearest upside play in months. Cold Wallet’s ROI Window Is Closing Quickly Shiba Inu’s upside relies on hitting its huge market cap goals. Avalanche depends on maintaining its breakout momentum. Both have potential, but Cold Wallet offers something different, clear ROI math and working utility. From $0.007 in Stage 1 to $0.00998 today, every tier trims the 3,428% ROI gap to $0.3517. With $6.2 million raised, whale watching, and 740M+ tokens sold, the window is closing fast. Cold Wallet combines live cashback rewards, a built-in user base, and confirmed listing value. The choice is simple: act now or watch one of 2025’s strongest ROI chances pass by.

50399689,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79430,1755713159,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SWIFT’s Best Choice Between Ripple (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) Goes Viral,https://timestabloid.com/swifts-best-choice-between-ripple-xrp-and-hedera-hbar-goes-viral/,"Coin Bureau drew attention this week to a report from Vanir Assets highlighting that SWIFT, the backbone of global interbank messaging, is working to bridge traditional finance with blockchain. The conversation quickly went viral, as the post spotlighted XRP and HBAR as leading contenders in reshaping cross-border payments. With SWIFT modernizing its infrastructure and institutions testing tokenized value flows, the debate over which blockchain best fits the future of payments has gained new urgency. Why SWIFT’s Blockchain Shift Matters Now SWIFT is in the midst of its largest technical overhaul in decades: the migration to ISO 20022. This global standard, designed to enrich financial data and improve interoperability, will complete its MT/ISO coexistence phase by November 2025. SWIFT TO CHOOSE RIPPLE OR HEDERA? Vanir Assets reports that SWIFT is working to bridge traditional finance with blockchain, highlighting $XRP and $HBAR as leading contenders in the global payments space. pic.twitter.com/CPziul6fR2 — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) August 20, 2025 The transition not only updates how banks communicate across borders but also lays the foundation for integrating tokenized assets and digital currencies. By aligning with ISO 20022, blockchain networks capable of structured, machine-readable payments could plug directly into the global banking system. This is why XRP and HBAR are being flagged in market conversations as serious contenders. XRP and HBAR in the ISO 20022 Context Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Hedera Hashgraph both rank among the projects considered compatible with ISO 20022-style data frameworks. This compatibility is not cosmetic; it minimizes the friction of translating between old systems and new distributed ledger technologies. In practice, this means faster integration and fewer barriers for institutions adopting tokenized value settlement. XRP’s core design focuses on instant settlement , liquidity provisioning, and bridging currencies across corridors. Ripple has long promoted XRP as a tool to solve pre-funding and liquidity shortages in cross-border payments — a problem that banks and payment providers continue to grapple with. HBAR, on the other hand, offers a different value proposition. Its hashgraph consensus delivers fast throughput and predictable fees, while its governing council, composed of global corporations, aims to provide enterprise-grade stability. Hedera is marketed not only for payments but also for tokenization, supply chain tracking, and micropayments — offering a broader use case for institutions looking beyond remittances. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SWIFT’s Experiments and Institutional Tests While market speculation often frames this as a race, SWIFT’s public trials suggest a more nuanced picture. The organization has been experimenting with tokenization and multi-chain interoperability, running pilots to demonstrate how tokenized assets can move across permissioned and public blockchains. Importantly, these trials are exploratory; SWIFT has not endorsed any single token but is instead studying frameworks for interoperability and compliance. Institutions participating in these tests are weighing factors that go beyond technical throughput. Regulatory clarity, governance structures, and cost models will all shape whether XRP, HBAR, or other platforms are integrated into future settlement rails. The Road Ahead The viral discussion sparked by Coin Bureau reflects the growing anticipation around SWIFT’s next moves. The question of whether Ripple’s XRP or Hedera’s HBAR becomes the preferred choice for global payments highlights the different strengths of both projects: XRP’s focus on liquidity and settlement efficiency versus HBAR’s governance-driven enterprise model. In reality, the outcome may not hinge on a single “winner.” SWIFT’s mission is interoperability, and both XRP and HBAR could play roles in the evolving financial ecosystem. For now, the excitement lies in the recognition that blockchain is no longer a theoretical experiment but a serious candidate for reshaping the future of money movement.

Here are the highlights from the meeting minutes: Many officials said it could take time for the full impact of the tariffs to be seen. Some members are concerned about high asset values. The majority believe that the risk of inflation outweighs the risk of employment. Several participants noted that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be too far from neutral. The authorities' real GDP forecasts for 2025-2027 were similar to those prepared for the June meeting. Almost all attendees at the Fed's July meeting agreed that keeping the benchmark interest rate between 4.25% and 4.50% would be appropriate. Participants assessed that the impact of customs duties on commodity prices has become more pronounced, but their overall impact on the economy and inflation is not yet clear. Some participants stated that it would be more appropriate and possible to adjust monetary policy rather than waiting for the full impact of tariffs on inflation to become clear. Most officials believe Fed policy is in an appropriate position. Participants also noted that it will take time to more clearly understand the magnitude and persistence of the impact of higher tariffs on inflation. Participants who opposed leaving interest rates unchanged thought that inflation was unlikely to be sustainable and expressed concern about employment risks. Some participants said that if we leave aside tariff factors, inflation levels would be close to target. Authorities are closely monitoring the growth of stablecoins and the risks associated with them after the passage of the Genius Act. Many officials predict that economic growth will slow in the second half of the year. The Bitcoin price reacted as follows after the document was released: At the FED's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on July 29-30, a decision was made to keep interest rates constant, but two senior officials opposed this decision and requested a rate cut. Less than 48 hours after the meeting, employment data released confirmed Bowman and Waller's concerns. Labor Department data showed that job creation in July was well below expectations, the unemployment rate rose, and labor force participation fell to its lowest level since late 2022. Even more striking was the downward revision of data for May and June, wiping out more than 250,000 jobs. This development severely damaged the narrative of a strong labor market. President Donald Trump, angered by the data, fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Related News: Binance Makes New Airdrop Announcement: Quota Filled Within Minutes - May Reopen Following the minutes, all eyes turn to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. It remains to be seen whether Powell will join those who advocate for interest rate cuts to protect the weakening labor market or align with members concerned about inflation. This will be Powell's final Jackson Hole speech, as his term expires in May next year. *This is not investment advice.

With the community searching nonstop for the top meme coins to buy now for September, three projects have emerged as clear standouts—Arctic Pablo Coin, Dogecoin, and Dogwifhat. Arctic Pablo Coin has captured investors’ imagination with its adventurous presale, themed around Pablo’s icy expeditions into Earth’s hidden realms. Add in massive staking rewards, community competitions, and weekly token burns, and it’s easy to see why whales are loading up on $APC. Meanwhile, Dogecoin continues to prove its staying power as the “people’s coin,” backed by global adoption and a strong fan base. And then there’s Dogwifhat ($WIF), the Solana-based meme coin that has gone viral thanks to its cultural dominance and massive trading volumes. This lineup of coins reflects where hype meets utility, where culture meets capital. For investors seeking the top meme coins to buy now for September, these three names deserve serious consideration. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) – The Whales’ Favorite Among the Top Meme Coins to Buy Now for September In the heart of icy frontiers, a fearless adventurer named Arctic Pablo journeys across frostbitten landscapes, unlocking mystical treasures tied to Earth’s hidden mysteries. Each presale location represents a new discovery—from ice caves to forgotten islands—inviting the community to join in a gamified adventure that’s unlike anything in crypto. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a story-driven phenomenon that merges myth, adventure, and wealth creation. The narrative has captivated crypto whales, many of whom are pouring capital into $APC to secure early-stage positions before the presale concludes. Pablo’s journey has now reached the 37th location (Ice Ice Baby)—a special bonus stage where investors receive 200% bonus coins on every purchase by using the exclusive bonus code BONUS100. Arctic Pablo Coin currently trades at a presale price of $0.00088, with over $3.5 million already raised. The project’s listing price is set at $0.008, which translates into an ROI of more than 809% for those entering now. Analysts predict a price surge to $0.1, which would boost ROI past an astonishing 11,263%. Early whales who joined back at the start of Pablo’s journey have already secured gains above 5,766%. Consider this: an investment of $75,000 today nets 170,454,000 APC tokens, which could grow into a portfolio worth $1,363,632 once the token lists at $0.008. That doesn’t even include the upside potential if Pablo hits $0.1. To ensure long-term sustainability, unsold tokens from each presale location are burned weekly on the Binance Smart Chain. This deflationary system permanently reduces supply, creating scarcity that supports future price growth. The total supply of Arctic Pablo Coin is 221.2 billion APC, with 50% allocated to the public presale, ensuring broad community access. 25% is locked in liquidity, guaranteeing stability, while 15% (33.18 billion tokens) is set aside for staking, offering investors an attractive 66% APY. 20% supports ecosystem growth, 10% is reserved for community rewards and referrals, and 5% is allocated to the team, locked for one year to ensure alignment with long-term goals. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Arctic Pablo Coin is more than a meme; it’s an experience. With weekly price increases, token burns, massive bonus rewards, and whale-friendly ROI, it embodies the top meme coins to buy now for September . Its storytelling vibe bridges myth and money, turning $APC into a must-watch presale for September 2025. 2. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – The Classic That Refuses to Fade Dogecoin is the original meme coin that continues to dominate headlines. Launched as a joke in 2013, it’s now a staple of the crypto landscape with billions in market cap. From Elon Musk tweets to sponsorships of NASCAR drivers, Dogecoin has cemented itself as a cultural and financial force. Whales continue to accumulate DOGE for one simple reason: utility. Its integration with Tesla payments, social tipping, and potential X (Twitter) ecosystem use cases keep it relevant in a sea of short-lived meme projects. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Dogecoin earned its spot as one of the top meme coins to buy now for September because of its lasting community support, global recognition, and whale accumulation patterns. While newer coins spike on hype, DOGE continues to hold value as the OG of meme crypto. 3. Dogwifhat ($WIF) – Viral Energy on Solana’s Backbone Dogwifhat, or $WIF, is the meme coin born on Solana that’s become a social media juggernaut. Featuring a simple Shiba Inu dog wearing a knitted hat, WIF has captivated younger investors and meme lovers across TikTok and X. Its strength lies in culture: $WIF is viral energy packaged into a token. Dogwifhat currently trades at $2.75 and commands a market cap north of $2.7 billion, placing it among the top meme coins by valuation. Whale wallets on Solana have been loading up on $WIF, betting on continued cultural dominance and meme-driven market rallies through Q4 2025. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Dogwifhat made the cut as one of the top meme coins to buy now for September because of its viral dominance, Solana-powered ecosystem, and whale-backed momentum. It blends culture, community, and crypto speed into one potent package.

Arctic Pablo leads with a storytelling presale, massive ROI potential, and whale-friendly bonus codes. Dogecoin proves its staying power with global recognition and adoption, while Dogwifhat fuels viral energy with Solana’s speed.

But a new coin with a low price is getting a lot of attention. Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a new EVM Layer 2 chain, is now in its presale stage and costs only $0.0020. It might go up 50 times before SOL hits $300 and ETH hits $6,000. Why Little Pepe Might Be the Next Big 50x Game Little Pepe isn't just another meme currency; it's a whole Layer 2 blockchain made exclusively for the meme economy. The project is ready to take over a market that is ready for change because it has very low fees, breakneck transaction speeds, and sniper bot protection. LILPEPE stands out from other buzz currencies that don't last long because it prioritizes fair trading and community growth. If SOL can keep making constant double-digit increases and ETH can keep moving toward $6,000, then a project like LILPEPE, which starts with a bit of market valuation, has a lot of room to grow. This means it may increase even more. Tokenomics Made to Last There are only 100 billion LILPEPE tokens available, and they are evenly distributed to support both growth and sustainability. There is 26.5% for presale, 30% for chain reserves, 13.5% for staking and rewards, and 10% each for marketing, liquidity, and CEX/DEX reserves. It's important to note that there is no tax on buying or selling, which means that holders will keep the most value. This transparent and open tokenomics structure avoids the problems that come with inflationary supply models. It gives long-term investors a strong base for price growth. CertiK Audit for the Best Security Trust and openness are crucial for investors to feel good about their money. LILPEPE is verified on CertiK as having completed the full audit with one of the leading security certifications in the blockchain space. This audit confirms the safety of the smart contracts as well as ensures that the project is compliant with the given industry standards. In a market where scams and rug pulls happen all the time, this stamp of approval gives you a significant advantage over your competitors. Stages of Price and Momentum Before the Sale LILPEPE is now at Stage 11 of its presale, and the price per token is $0.0020. The following stage will raise the price to $0.0021. Early investors are already capitalizing on the progressive price hikes, which reward those who engage sooner. With millions already raised toward its $22.3 million target, the presale’s progress suggests strong community interest and market demand. Huge $777K Giveaway LILPEPE is giving out $777,000 worth of tokens to 10 lucky winners to get the word out. Each winner will get $77,000 worth of tokens. This marketing campaign not only gets people talking about it, but it also encourages more people in the community to become involved, which are two critical things that help meme coins go viral. Listing on CoinMarketCap and getting more attention LILPEPE has already made it onto CoinMarketCap (CMC), which is a crucial step for a new crypto project. This makes things clearer, makes it easier for possible investors to keep track of things, and gives the company a more substantial presence in the market. Being exposed on CMC often leads to a big surge of new buyers. How to Get In on the Presale Joining the LILPEPE presale is straightforward: Set Up Your Wallet: On the Ethereum network, you can use MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund using ETH or USDT - You’ll need ETH for gas expenses, even if buying with USDT. Connect to the Official DApp - Visit LittlePepe.com and click “Connect Wallet.” Choose a payment option: either ETH or USDT. Enter the amount you want to buy and click ""confirm."" Claim Tokens After the Presale: You can claim your LILPEPE tokens after the presale concludes. Conclusion Solana and Ethereum are still blue-chip cryptocurrencies with steady rising momentum. Still, their huge market capitalization makes it less probable that they will achieve significant increases in the short term. Little Pepe, on the other hand, mixes meme culture with real blockchain use, security through a CertiK audit, good tokenomics, and growth during the presale. The path to 50x gains is much easier for just $0.0020, especially with its fast-growing community and big marketing push. LILPEPE could be the way to go for investors who want to make big profits before the next bull wave peaks.

DOGE Could Repeat 2024’s Rally and Surge to $0.80,https://cryptopotato.com/rounding-bottom-doge-could-repeat-2024s-rally-and-surge-to-0-80/,"TL;DR Dogecoin shows a rounding bottom with a converging triangle, and $0.29 remains the breakout level to watch. Whales added 680 million DOGE in August, signaling accumulation despite ongoing concerns of a 51% attack. Thumzup Media’s acquisition of Dogehash aims to expand capacity and create a leading Dogecoin mining platform. Current Price and Technical Setup Dogecoin (DOGE) was trading near $0.21 at press time, with a daily turnover of about $3.1 billion. The token declined by 2% in the past 24 hours and by nearly 14% weekly. Despite the drawdown, there are signs that a move is brewing. Crypto analyst Crypto Zeinab pointed to a rounding bottom forming alongside a converging triangle. Resistance sits near $0.29, a key level that, if broken, could push DOGE toward $0.49 and possibly $0.80 later in the year. A similar setup in 2024 saw the price rally from $0.18 to $0.49. $DOGE is showing a pattern similar to 2024. It’s forming a rounding bottom & if it breaks $0.29, it could rally like last time from $0.18 to $0.49. A converging triangle is also forming, which means a breakout might be coming. If the pattern repeats, we could reach $0.80 in Q4. pic.twitter.com/ZhUQ8LRyGf — Crypto Zeinab (@CryptoZeinab) August 20, 2025 A separate view from Galaxy showed DOGE continuing its long-term cycle of accumulation and breakout phases. Since 2014, the meme coin has repeated a structure of sideways trading, followed by rapid upward moves, and then corrections back into new bases. According to Galaxy, DOGE is in its third major accumulation stage, echoing the run-ups seen in 2017 and 2021. Price action on the monthly chart shows a steady rise along support, which has historically been the early phase before broader market interest returns. Security Concerns and Whale Activity DOGE came under pressure after the Qubic blockchain community voted to direct hashpower at Dogecoin for a possible 51% attack. Qubic previously targeted Monero, raising worries of similar disruption. The news coincided with weaker derivatives positioning, as DOGE futures open interest slipped 4% to $3.23B, according to Coinglass data. Even with these risks, accumulation continued. Large holders added about 680 million DOGE in August, suggesting that whales are positioning for longer-term exposure despite near-term volatility. Mining Expansion Through Acquisition In corporate news, Thumzup Media Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed firm, confirmed plans to acquire Dogehash, a North American mining company focused on Scrypt assets like Dogecoin and Litecoin. Dogehash owns approximately 2,500 ASIC miners and is likely to increase its capacity by the end of the year. The merged operation is projected to become one of the biggest Dogecoin mining networks globally, enhancing the industrial-scale infrastructure of the network. The post Rounding Bottom?

This Upper Boundary Retest Could Set The Stage For $268,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-is-not-dead/,"Solana (SOL) has once again stepped into the spotlight as analysts weigh in on its potential price trajectory. Despite recent volatility and declines, a new technical analysis suggests that the altcoin could be gearing up for a major move that could see its price skyrocket to around $268. Ascending Triangle Reveals Solana Next Targets For months, the price of Solana has been trading sideways despite hitting an all-time high of $293 in January 2025. Due to the prolonged volatility and price fluctuations, many had presumed the popular altcoin dead. But the charts suggest otherwise. Related Reading: Ethereum Leads $3.75 Billion Crypto Inflows, XRP And Solana Join The Party Jonathan Carter, a crypto market technician on X social media, has highlighted a compelling structure on the Solana daily chart, pointing out that the altcoin’s price is currently retesting the upper boundary of a long-formed Ascending Triangle. According to Carter, this retest comes after a previous false breakout, which initially trapped bulls and sent Solana back into consolidation. This time, however, the setup appears more promising, with SOL finding consistent support along its ascending trendline while gradually settling against resistance. Carter noted that Solana’s daily structure shows clear resistance zones around the $180 – $185 levels, which have capped price advances several times throughout the year. A confirmed bounce from the region could open the door for SOL to reclaim higher targets at $205 and $225, with an eventual breakout setting up a run toward $268. With the altcoin currently sitting at $181, a surge to these upper targets would represent a solid increase of 13.26%, 24.31%, and 48.07%, respectively. Based on the analyst’s chart, the presence of the 100-day Moving Average (MA) just below current levels provides additional confirmation for a potential bullish reversal. At the same time, volume patterns suggest growing interest in accumulation. For now, Carter highlights that Solana’s price remains range–bound between $165 and $190. However, the tightening structure of the Ascending Triangle signals that a breakout may be near. If buyers manage to defend the current zone, Solana’s recovery could become potentially stronger, particularly considering its history of sharp rallies once market conditions improve and resistance levels are cleared. Short-Term Pullback Before Rally? In other news, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also shared insights on Solana’s price action, predicting that the altcoin may experience a temporary pullback before staging its next rally. His 8-hour chart, posted on X, suggests that SOL, currently trading above $181, could face downside pressure that brings the price closer to $160. Related Reading: The Multiple Opportunities Of Solana Amid Push To Break $200 This projected correction would not necessarily invalidate Solana’s bullish thesis; instead, Martinez asserts that it could present an opportunity for strategic buyers to accumulate before the next upward leg. The analyst identifies the $160 region as a key support area where buyers will likely prevent further price declines. In this context, Solana’s projected weakness could act as a springboard for a stronger rebound.

While BTC’s price has fallen sharply, investors are demonstrating robust interest in the asset, especially on Binance. Binance Records Rising Spot Demand In the midst of growing volatility around Bitcoin, a positive trend has been observed among BTC investors on Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. The investor mood was reported by Darkfost, a market expert and author, in a post on the X platform after examining the Binance Spot Vs Futures Dominance metric. Presently, Bitcoin’s spot market on Binance is showing renewed strength, with demand for the flagship digital asset picking up once again. With spot demand rising sharply again, this suggests that investors are regaining interest and are taking advantage of the chance to buy BTC at the current price. Despite recent market volatility, this increase in spot demand not only indicates fresh purchasing pressure but also demonstrates rising confidence that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory is still intact. Addressing misconceptions among market players or investors, Darkfost has stated that the rise in spot demand does not mean it is dominating. Rather, the average spot-to-futures ratio has risen to a level that is significantly higher than its normal range. It is worth noting that Binance ‘s spot/futures volume ratio has averaged over 0.22 since 2019, which means that for every $1 invested in spot, almost $4 flowed into futures. In the meantime, Darkfost has broken the development into two key factors. These include Rising spot demand on Binance and the declining futures volumes. According to the on-chain expert, this is a very positive indication in general. This is because positive movements typically endure longer when a market is bolstered more by spot demand than by speculation on derivatives , as observed in early and late 2023. BTC Whales And Sharks Are Accumulating Outside Binance, Bitcoin investors are still demonstrating robust demand, especially whales and sharks. Santiment, a leading market intelligence and on-chain data analytics platform, has revealed a notable buying pressure among these investors. Amid the BTC pullback from its all-time high , key whales and sharks went on a buying spree, while retail investors offloaded their coins. With prices down by at least -6.22% since August 13th, wallet addresses holding between 10 BTC and 10,000 BTC purchased about 20,061 more coins. Data shows that this group of investors has acquired over 225,320 BTC since March 22, indicating strong conviction in the asset’s prospects. During this period, there has been a significant relationship between the holdings of this group and the direction of future price movement for most of the last five years.",Bitcoin News|binance|Binance Spot Vs Futures Dominance Metric|Binance's Spot/Futures Volume Ratio|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Spot Market|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Darkfost,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 19:00:24

The drop, led by a slump in car and auto parts shipments, reflects the growing strain from persistent trade frictions. Government figures released Wednesday showed total exports fell 2.6% from a year earlier in financial terms, the sharpest decline since Feb 2021, when shipments slipped 4.5%. The fall exceeded a median prediction for a 2.1 percentage decline and marked a 3rd straight monthly slide after a 0.5 percentage decline in the month of June. Regardless of the dip in value, export volumes have remained steady as many firms have avoided big price increases, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, Takeshi Minami said. “But they would eventually have to pass on costs to U.S. consumers, and that would further hamper sales in the coming months,” he said. U.S. tariffs weigh heavily on auto exports Sales to the U.S. weakened. Exports in July dropped 10.1 percent compared with a year ago, as automobiles dropped 28.4 percent and auto parts dropped 17.4%. In volume terms, car shipments fell only 3.2%, indicating that prices reduced and efforts to absorb extra levies have partly cushioned flows. Tariffs have been at the center of the shift. In April, the U.S. imposed 25% duties on cars and car components and warned of 25% tariffs on most other Japanese goods. Washington and Tokyo later reached an agreement on July 23 that cut tariffs to 15 percent in return for a U.S.-bound Japan’s investment package worth $550 billion. Even with that agreement, the tariff on automobiles remains far above the pre-tariff 2.5%, keeping pressure on leading carmakers and suppliers. Trade balance turns negative as imports shrink Exports to other key markets were also soft. Data shows that shipments to China fell 3.5% from a year earlier. Imports shrank as well. Total imports in July slipped 7.5 percent from a year before, relative to market expectations for a 10.4 percent fall. In comparison, July marked a six-month high for China’s rare-earth magnet exports, according to a recent report by Cryptopolitan . The trade balance swung to a shortfall of 117.5 billion yen ($795.4 million) in July, versus a projected surplus of 196.2 billion yen. The latest trade numbers came after separate figures last week showed stronger-than-expected gross domestic product growth in the April-June quarter, supported by resilient exports and capital spending. Economists noted that the robust export reading in GDP reflects differences in how price changes are counted in the two reports. Even so, Minami said the economy has avoided the worst scenario so far. “As the tariff deal has at least reduced uncertainties, the Bank of Japan is likely to resume rate hikes as early as in October,” he said. Japan, the world’s fourth-largest economy, relies heavily on overseas demand, and the steeper U.S. levies have filtered through to its auto industry. The data suggest companies have shielded buyers through discounts and absorbing costs, but such steps may be even harder to sustain if trade frictions persist this autumn.

Each presents a different pathway, but the contrast between them is beginning to shape a clearer picture of where value may truly lie. Hyperliquid is pressing toward $50, supported by $5 million in daily buybacks and the strongest fee revenue across all blockchains. Ethereum, meanwhile, is signaling a rare technical alignment that could trigger a breakout if it successfully clears the $4,850 resistance barrier. Cold Wallet enters from a different angle. With over $6.4 million raised, a $0.00998 Stage 17 price, and more than 2 million users integrated through a $270 million acquisition, it avoids the adoption delays that stall most projects. Its cashback and fee rebate loop channels real transactional activity into token value, creating one of the clearest opportunities in this cycle. HYPE Edges Toward $50 With Buybacks Driving Strength Hyperliquid (HYPE) is trading around $47 after bouncing strongly from its August low of $34. The chart is now focused on the $50 mark, which stands as the previous record high. Analysts suggest a breakout here could pave the way toward $100 over the coming months, giving HYPE one of the strongest setups in the market. Market data reinforces this outlook. Open interest has climbed 5% to $2.02 billion, while daily trading volume surged 19% to $2.59 billion. With $5 million in buybacks funded by network fees, steady demand is adding weight to the rally. ETH Approaches $4,850 Resistance With Bullish Setup Ethereum (ETH) is exhibiting a rare technical alignment across multiple timeframes, indicating a potential for renewed upside. Indicators like the Stock RSI and MACD have shifted from extreme lows, suggesting that selling pressure has eased while buying strength is emerging. Whale accumulation reaching record levels further signals confidence among large holders. ETH’s dominance and ETH/BTC pairs are also reflecting stronger trends. The challenge remains the $4,850 all-time high, which represents the final key resistance. A decisive breakout could put ETH into open price discovery, while failure here may lead to short-term consolidation. Cold Wallet Secures $6.4M as Stage 17 Price Signals Rare Entry Point Cold Wallet is rewriting the expectations of a presale by eliminating the usual adoption lag. Instead of waiting months for traction, it secured a $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, instantly onboarding over 2 million active users into its ecosystem. This guarantees real network activity from the very first day, positioning Cold Wallet as one of the few projects to enter the market with utility already established. At its core, the project operates on a cashback rewards and fee rebate structure that turns every transaction into value for holders. This design creates a loop where activity drives demand, and demand strengthens token value. With more than $6.4 million raised and 750 million coins already sold, this loop is no longer a concept on paper but a measurable reality backed by numbers. Stage 17’s presale pricing of $0.00998 appears increasingly undervalued when compared to its confirmed listing price of $0.3517. That pricing gap represents a potential 3,421% ROI for those entering at this stage, highlighting how rare it is to find such favorable conditions in a presale. Few projects can claim a live user base and immediate spending incentives before launch. Most tokens face the challenge of fighting for relevance after launch, but Cold Wallet begins with adoption, liquidity, and real usage. This makes the current window less of a gamble and more of a calculated opportunity. In a crowded presale market filled with uncertainty, Cold Wallet stands out as one of the clearest risk-reward plays available in 2025. Quick Breakdown While Hyperliquid’s short-term momentum and Ethereum’s bullish chart signals point toward potential breakouts, both remain dependent on clearing critical resistance before confirming their next move. Cold Wallet enters this conversation differently, starting with adoption, liquidity, and revenue-linked mechanics that other projects usually struggle to build long after launch. With Stage 17 priced at $0.00998 against a confirmed $0.3517 listing, the 3,421% ROI window is striking. More importantly, the system is already active, with over 2 million users feeding demand through real transactions. Cold Wallet transforms presale speculation into operational certainty.

The analyst noted that while XRP slipped below its .382 Fibonacci retracement at $2.96, the token has not broken down past the critical .5 level at $2.77. This dynamic positions the $2.77 mark as a potential double-bottom support and a major buying opportunity. XRP’s current price action has settled into a tight range between $2.96 and $2.77. The market tested the .382 retracement but failed to hold, leaving $2.77 as the next key defensive line. As of report time, XRP is trading $2.92, holding above the 50% retracement. This price stability underscores that the macro structure has not broken down, and the potential for a bullish continuation remains in play. The Fibonacci levels now act as the battleground for sentiment. A reclaim of $2.96 would tilt momentum back to the bulls, while a break below $2.77 could open the door for a deeper correction. XRP Holds Macro Plan Despite Dip – $2.77 Could Be a Major Buy Opportunity! In my last update, I highlighted the importance of $XRP holding its .382 retracement at $2.96. The market did lose that support, but #XRP has not printed a new low below the .5 retracement at $2.77,… pic.twitter.com/En2l0jhD70 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) August 20, 2025 Technical Signals and Market Sentiment Momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest that both Bitcoin and XRP still have room for further downside tests, but selling pressure is weakening. For XRP specifically, RSI readings remain neutral, indicating space for upward recovery once buyers step in. This aligns with CasiTrades’ view that the current pause is less about market exhaustion and more about building a foundation for the next impulsive move. If XRP retests $2.77 without breaking lower, it could create a textbook double-bottom pattern — a bullish reversal signal with strong historical reliability. Bitcoin’s Role in the Next Move As always, Bitcoin’s trajectory holds significant weight for altcoin performance. BTC is currently hovering around $113,000, with analysts pointing to $112,000 as a potential short-term floor. Should Bitcoin dip slightly lower, XRP could retest its $2.77 support. However, if BTC stabilizes or begins building its expected Wave 2 recovery, the path for XRP to reclaim higher resistances would strengthen. Importantly, the analyst maintains that XRP’s long-term target of $4.80 remains valid as Bitcoin completes its corrective phase. The expectation is that large-cap altcoins, including XRP, could lead the next rally even as Bitcoin consolidates. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Outlook for Traders and Investors For now, the market outlook hinges on the $2.77–$2.96 zone. A strong hold at support, followed by a breakout above $2.96 and then $3.21, would confirm XRP’s reclaim of its consolidation range. This would likely pave the way toward macro targets as momentum strengthens. CasiTrades urges flexibility and patience, noting that while short-term volatility is unavoidable, the macro bullish structure remains intact. For disciplined traders, the current setup may represent one of the most attractive accumulation zones seen in recent weeks, provided risk is managed appropriately. Final Take XRP’s current consolidation reflects a moment of balance between cautious sellers and accumulating buyers. As CasiTrades highlights, the $2.77 support could prove to be a pivotal launchpad. If this level holds and XRP reclaims resistance at $2.96, the macro plan remains firmly on track, with higher targets such as $4.80 still within reach. For investors eyeing the next big move, the coming days around these support levels may define the next chapter in XRP’s bullish journey.

These 2 Altcoins Are Just Beginning Their Parabolic Runs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-the-ripple-xrp-bull-run-over-as-price-drops-below-3-these-2-altcoins-are-just-beginning-their-parabolic-runs/,"The crypto market is buzzing as the price of Ripple drops below $3, leaving investors questioning whether the long-standing XRP Price rally is finished. Yet, while some see the end of one story, analysts spotlight new projects in a parabolic ascent. In particular, Layer Brett’s presale is catching fire, with claims that $LBRETT could be the next 100x altcoin as the crypto bull run 2025 heats up. With the presale live and a surge in attention toward Layer 2 crypto and meme token trends, the stage is set for explosive moves. Ripple’s recent momentum: Is the XRP price bull run over? Ripple has long been a fixture in the top ranks of trending cryptocurrencies, and its recent dip below $3 has sparked debate. The XRP Price currently fluctuates between $3.02 and $3.09, with a market cap near $170 billion. Still, the Ripple ecosystem benefits from bullish regulatory shifts, such as the SEC’s leadership change and optimism surrounding future partnerships. Analysts remain divided, with some forecasting a conservative $2.2 and others eyeing a return to the $4.5–$15 range. Ongoing token unlocks and robust trading activity keep Ripple among the top altcoins, yet the search for the next big crypto intensifies. Chainlink’s surge in the DeFi landscape Chainlink has proven its resilience during recent market volatility. The Chainlink token, trading at $24.23 with a $16.4 billion market cap, has climbed over 42% in the last month, outperforming many altcoins. Its key role as an oracle provider for DeFi coin projects anchors its value, with growing demand. As more DeFi platforms and Layer 2 blockchain protocols turn to Chainlink, investor confidence surges. The buzz around Chainlink as the next big crypto and top gainer crypto is palpable, positioning it as a fundamental building block in the best crypto to invest in. Layer Brett: Where meme meets mechanism Layer Brett is not just another memecoin; it is a purpose-built, Ethereum Layer 2 project fusing viral culture with real blockchain utility. The $LBRETT presale, live at $0.004–$0.0042, offers a rare early entry for those seeking the next 100x altcoin. Unlike meme tokens stuck on congested chains, Layer Brett delivers lightning-fast, near-instant transactions and ultra-low gas fees by leveraging Ethereum Layer 2 scaling. Staking rewards reach a staggering 7500% APY for early backers, making it a top DeFi token contender. Layer Brett is a community-first project, emphasizing transparent tokenomics, gamified staking, and major incentives—including a $1 million giveaway and seamless onboarding through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. What makes Layer Brett different from other meme tokens Layer Brett sets itself apart from traditional meme coins by combining meme energy with genuine scalability, staking crypto, and Layer 2 blockchain functionality.

Unlike other projects that rely solely on hype, Layer Brett introduces decentralized governance and real-world blockchain use cases, all while keeping costs low for everyday users.

The dip raises critical questions: is this a temporary setback in ETH’s long-term rally, or the start of a deeper correction? Traders are closely watching whether Ethereum can stabilize and rebuild momentum toward the $5,000–$5,100 resistance zone, a key level that could determine the coin’s next major move. Ethereum on the Rise: Eyes Set on Breaking $5,100 Barrier Source: tradingview Ethereum is trading between $4,165 and $4,791, showing a mixed pattern. While it has recently dipped over 8% in the past week, there's been a decent gain of almost 12% over the past month. With a strong six-month growth of over 53%, ETH is pushing toward its nearest resistance level at $5,105. If it manages to break past this, the $5,730 mark could be the next target. The current support stands at $3,853, providing a safety net for traders. As indicators fluctuate, investors are hopeful for a sustained upward trend, eyeing potential new highs in the upcoming months. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent pullback highlights the market’s sensitivity to large supply events, but its broader trajectory still shows resilience. With support levels holding near $3,850 and strong momentum over the past six months, ETH remains in a position to challenge its $5,100 resistance. If bulls succeed, a breakout toward $5,700 could follow, reaffirming Ethereum’s role as a key driver of the next leg in the crypto rally. For now, traders are balancing caution with optimism, watching closely to see if this dip transforms into another launchpad for growth.

But the next generation of tokens is here, armed with better utility, stronger tokenomics, and viral momentum. In 2025’s meme coin renaissance, four projects might outpace SHIB’s growth potential and deliver life-changing returns. Here are the 4 coins to watch right now: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) : Meme coin meets blockchain innovation, with viral presale momentum and bot-proof tech. Dogwifhat (WIF): Viral Solana sensation with fresh hype from a record-breaking hat auction. Rekt (REKT): An NFT-born cultural coin with explosive multi-platform utility. Pump.fun (PUMP): Meme coin launchpad leader with an aggressive buyback program and 77% market dominance. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Tech That Could Outrun SHIB’s Legacy Little Pepe isn’t just another frog. It’s the first sniper-bot-proof Layer 2 blockchain built mainly for meme coins. This unique design levels the playing field for launches, eliminating unfair bot sniping and ensuring retail buyers get a fair shot. Currently in Stage 11 of its presale, LILPEPE has raised $19.32 million and sold 12.75 billion tokens. Each token now costs $0.002, a 100% gain from its Stage 1 price of $0.001. The launch is locked in at $0.003 with a $300M market cap, and with only 26.5% of supply in presale, liquidity is set to be tight post-launch. Momentum is surging thanks to several key moves: CoinMarketCap listing: Millions of traders can now track $LILPEPE in real time. CertiK audit completed: Security validated, building investor trust. Upcoming top-tier CEX listings: The list includes plans for the world’s largest exchange. $777K giveaway: Driving viral participation and community buzz. Even ChatGPT 5.0 search trend data from June to August shows Little Pepe outpacing PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in user interest, cementing it as one of the most discussed meme coins of 2025. With a fair launch vesting schedule (0% at TGE, 3-month cliff, 5% monthly release) and meme-first branding backed by anonymous veterans who’ve built top market performers, $LILPEPE has both the tech and cultural firepower to challenge SHIB’s long-term dominance. In an unprecedented bull year, a 1000x target doesn’t seem far-fetched. Dogwifhat (WIF): Meme Power with Iconic Branding Dogwifhat remains one of Solana’s most recognizable meme coins, and it just got a fresh injection of hype from the $800,000 sale of the original WIF hat to a crypto enthusiast. The auction made headlines across X (Twitter) and crypto news outlets, sparking a sentiment reversal after weeks of price stagnation. The token’s ability to leverage cultural moments keeps it relevant in a crowded meme market. Despite prolonged consolidation, it recently broke above the $1 mark. WIF’s community strength and branding could set it up for a significant rebound. Dogwifhat Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Analysts believe that in a best-case 2025 bull cycle, WIF could push into the $10–$15 range if it sustains narrative momentum and breaks its current resistance zones, especially with the emergence of more branded collectibles and cultural tie-ins. This will move it above the SHIB market valuation. Rekt (REKT): NFT Culture Meets Meme Coin Energy Born from the popular Rektguy NFT series, REKT is more than just a meme token. It’s a multi-platform cultural project with NFTs, art, and even Rekt Drinks, which sold out in 48 hours. Its blend of humor, branding, and product integration gives it a broader appeal than most meme coins. In August 2025 alone, REKT surged 280%, with a market cap of $518M. Price predictions for the year range from $0.00000277 to $0.000003366, which could represent triple-digit gains from current levels. Rekt Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko With an active, engaged community and Ethereum and Base L2 presence, REKT’s upside in a raging bull cycle could be massive. If meme liquidity increases, REKT could flip $500 into a fortune in a meme mania scenario. Pump.fun (PUMP): The Meme Coin Launchpad Titan Pump.fun dominates the meme launchpad sector with a 77% market share, issuing 73.6% of Solana’s meme coins on August 11 alone. The platform recently executed a $33 million token buyback, representing 0.729% of total supply, boosting price and investor confidence. PUMP Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The buyback initiative and relentless market share expansion position PUMP as the infrastructure leader for meme token creation. As Solana continues to draw meme projects, Pump.fun’s role as the go-to launchpad could see exponential fees, volume, and token value growth. If meme season roars back to peak frenzy, PUMP’s market dominance could drive a 10x+ move, making it one of the most leveraged bets in the sector. Conclusion: Beating SHIB Won’t Be Easy, But These 4 Have a Shot Timing, community, and relentless meme culture built SHIB’s early success. Little Pepe, Dogwifhat, Rekt, and Pump.fun brings something different: tech-first security, cultural branding, cross-platform reach, and launchpad dominance. For investors aiming to turn $500 into a life-changing portfolio play, Little Pepe stands out for its combination of disruptive blockchain tech, presale momentum, and CMC-verified visibility.

Vantage Data Centers announced on Tuesday that JPMorgan and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group are leading the debt financing of its upcoming $25 billion Texas data center campus with the backing of local politicians like Republican state governor Greg Abbott. The campus is being touted as part of Texas’ heavy investment in AI technologies. “Everything is bigger in Texas, and that includes innovation and technology,” said Abbott on Tuesday. The financing is proof that Wall Street has gone all in on the AI arms race, as it reflects the speed at which funds are being raised to build properties that big tech companies rely on to power their artificial intelligence models. Wall Street is rapidly raising funds to power AI models According to sources familiar with the proceedings, private capital groups Silver Lake and DigitalBridge plan to commit an extra $3 billion in combined equity financing to support the building of the data center campus, and it is expected to be among the world’s largest upon completion. The campus will house ten data centers, the first of which is expected to be finished mid-2026, while the rest will have been built by the end of 2028. Vantage came into existence in 2010, thanks to an initial investment from Silver Lake, after which it started operations with a data center it acquired from Intel. Sureel Choksi, a Silver Lake executive, played a pivotal role in the proceedings and was appointed chief executive of Vantage in 2013. Under Choksi, Vantage grew rapidly into a global data center juggernaut, initially focused on building data centers to support the cloud computing operations of large tech groups. However, more recently, it has been building properties with more advanced specifications targeting the booming AI market. Vantage was sold in 2017 to DigitalBridge, a private capital group focused on digital infrastructure technologies, for around $1 billion. However, in 2024, Silver Lake reinvested in Vantage by co-leading a $9.2 billion financing alongside DigitalBridge. Big Tech companies are turning to large investment funds to finance new data centers The financing deal JPMorgan and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group are planning to underwrite is being discussed as America’s biggest technology companies turn to large investment funds to provide the funds they need to rapidly develop new data centers to avoid breaking the bank. Examples of tech companies doing this include xAI, Meta, and Blue Owl. Elon Musk’s xAI has reportedly raised $10 billion of debt and equity since July to support the construction of its data centers in Tennessee, and has reportedly met with private credit lenders to raise even more billions. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has also teamed up with investors to raise $29 billion of debt and equity for its own AI projects. It is reportedly nearing a deal with private investment firm Blue Owl and bond giant Pimco, although it has also had talks with Apollo Global Management and KKR. Blue Owl has already helped finance a $15 billion project for Oracle and OpenAI in Texas. The State continues to attract data centers due to its relatively low electricity costs. All this interest in data centers has analysts convinced that demand for them will continue to climb alongside the AI market, which relies heavily on such infrastructure.

It might sound a bit wild, but honestly, it could be both crazy and totally possible at the same time. For a while, Ethereum struggled, especially with Solana taking over last year. ETH was kind of in the shadows, and people were frustrated with the lack of upgrades. But it seems like Vitalik is finally paying attention and getting back to work. Things are shifting now, and Ethereum is looking pretty strong. Over the last 30 days, ETH has surged over 15%, recently hitting a local high of $4,700. That’s a level we haven’t seen since 2021, back when the crypto market was way smaller. Source: Sharplink on X SharpLink (SBET), one of the key players driving Ethereum’s recent surge, is still stacking up on ETH . Right now, it’s holding more than 740K ETH, which is worth over $3.1B at current prices. Ethereum Price Prediction: Price Nearing All-Time High – $10,000 Possible? Source: ETHUSD / TradingView ETH has finally flipped that $4K resistance into support after being rejected at that level for over three years. Now, the price bounces hard every time it hits close to that $4K mark. Right now, ETH is testing the resistance again at $4,350 (Blue Line), where it’s been rejected before. This could mean a breakout’s coming soon, but if it can’t push past that level, we might see a pullback to the $4K support (Red Line). The RSI is sitting at a neutral level of 55, which opens the potential for a breakout. The MACD is also showing some bullish indicators: the MACD line (blue) is above the signal line (orange), and there are some nice green bars on the histogram. Based on this Ethereum price prediction, ETH still looks bullish in the long term and will only improve. Just keep an eye on that support level and the overall market momentum; we could see a retest of $4K. How Is the Ethereum Ecosystem Anyway? The Ethereum ecosystem and DeFi have been on fire these past couple of weeks, especially with all the new coins and utility popping up on Base. And of course, memecoins are making their comeback. OG memecoins like Pepe saw some massive price jumps as Ethereum picked up steam again. This has sparked a fresh wave of smart whales hunting for new memecoins to cash in on. Maxi Doge got in the spotlight, quickly grabbing all the attention. The Next Big Memecoin On Ethereum? Maxi Doge Presale Breaking Numbers Maxi Doge in the spotlight. This new Dogecoin-inspired memecoin just launched its presale and has already crossed over $1.3M. Maxi Doge features a jacked “gym bro” version of Doge who’s obsessed with high-leverage trading. It fully embraces meme culture instead of trying or pretending to have some serious utility or fundamentals. Even though it downplays its utility, looking closer, Maxi Doge does offer some community-focused features, like staking and user contests, which could help keep it relevant for a long time. Around 40% of the total tokens are up for grabs in the public presale, and there’s no private sale or insider deals, so no worries about whales dumping once it hits high-tier exchanges. They’re also offering a staking program for MAXI holders, with presale buyers able to snag up to 223 % annual yield. Basically, you can lock up your MAXI and start earning rewards before the presale even wraps up. Early believers might cash in big and end up making the most of it. Head to the Maxi Doge website to follow smart investors and join the presale. You can make your purchase using ETH, USDT, BNB, or even a credit card.

With Bitcoin’s halving now behind us, attention is shifting toward projects that balance strong narratives with real blockchain fundamentals. Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have already established themselves with proven communities and solid track records, but a new contender, Pepeto (PEPETO), is emerging as the altcoin that merges meme energy with genuine infrastructure. Having already raised more than $6 million before its launch, Pepeto is positioning itself as one of the defining tokens of this cycle. Pepeto (PEPETO) — Meme Culture with Real Utility PEPETO is quickly standing out as the flagship presale of 2025. At just $0.000000148, a $10,000 allocation secures over 68 billion tokens, setting up early investors for a potential seven-figure position once Tier 1 exchange listings begin. With more than $6 million already raised and staking rewards at 242% APY during presale, Pepeto has become a magnet for major capital inflows. What sets Pepeto apart is its focus on substance rather than hype. PepetoSwap enables zero-fee trading, cutting costs for active traders, while PepetoBridge ensures safe cross-chain transfers without third-party risks. Backed by a transparent token model with no team wallets, no trading taxes, and audits completed by Coinsult and SolidProof, Pepeto delivers tangible value while maintaining the viral momentum of meme culture. Pepeto Tokenomics: Designed for Stability and Growth Pepeto’s tokenomics are structured to ensure fairness and long-term sustainability. 30% is allocated to the presale, ensuring early liquidity and broad access. 30% is reserved for staking, maintaining high-yield rewards that encourage strong holder commitment. 20% is assigned to marketing, fueling global adoption and visibility. 12.5% goes to liquidity, keeping trading activity on exchanges smooth and efficient. 7.5% is dedicated to development, funding constant upgrades and new features. This balanced allocation ensures steady project growth, continuous rewards for the community, and stable liquidity across every stage of its expansion. Cardano (ADA) — Secure but Slow to Evolve Cardano has long been recognized for its academic rigor and strong focus on scalability and security. Its introduction of smart contracts expanded its potential use cases, while its loyal community remains one of the most steadfast in crypto. However, Cardano’s measured pace of delivering new features often leaves it behind faster-moving narratives, making it a better option for long-term investors rather than those seeking rapid gains during the current bull cycle. Solana (SOL) — Speed with Ongoing Risks Solana continues to rank among the fastest blockchains, offering low-cost transactions that appeal to NFTs, DeFi projects, and token launches. The resurgence of meme coins on its network has reignited retail enthusiasm, with institutional interest also returning. Yet its history of multiple high-profile outages has shaken long-term confidence. Coupled with frequent pump-and-dump token activity and increasing competition from other high-performance chains, Solana’s future growth remains questioned. BUY PEPETO NOW FROM THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE Final Takeaways In today’s market, timing determines opportunity, and Pepeto offers more than just another presale. It provides a unique chance to secure an early stake in a project that fuses meme culture with real products and sustainable tokenomics. While Cardano and Solana have already priced in much of their upside, Pepeto delivers the kind of asymmetry that can redefine a portfolio. At $0.000000148, with over $6 million raised and staking rewards of 242% APY live in presale, Pepeto stands out as one of the sharpest setups for 2025. For whales, the equation is simple: a $10,000 entry today has the realistic potential to grow into a million-dollar return as Pepeto climbs stage by stage. This is not just another altcoin it is the one that could lead the next bull run. Disclaimer: To buy PEPETO, use only the official website: https://pepeto.io .

This indicates that long-term investors feel more confident. At the same time, short-term holders are leaving the market, often selling at a loss after the recent market correction. Dogecoin On-Chain Fundamentals Are Still Strong According to on-chain data , only 9% of Dogecoin investors who bought in the last 30 days are making a profit. This drop indicates that many short-term traders are selling their coins. This capitulation event was discovered some days ago, with approximately 271 million DOGE sold at a loss. Notably, this selling is happening due to price fluctuations, leading to what experts call a forced transfer of wealth to stronger investors. Whales with between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE purchased over 330 million DOGE at a discount. This raised their total holdings to 26.73 billion. The data also shows that Dogecoin’s on-chain fundamentals are still strong, even as interest from everyday investors declines. Key measures like network activity, transaction volume, and wallet growth remain steady, indicating that long-term investors are preparing for a future increase. Dogecoin ETF Could Be on The Horizon There is no doubt that the original dog-themed memecoin has seen numerous hype-driven rallies over the years. Recently, Grayscale Investments filed a proposal to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will track the price of DOGE memecoin. If regulators approve the submitted proposal, it would allow investors to access it in a regulated way through traditional stock exchanges. This would give Dogecoin a bigger place in the mainstream crypto market. Meanwhile, Grayscale revealed that it is renaming its Grayscale Dogecoin Trust to the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF. As reported by TheCoinRise, shares of the new Digecoin fund are set to be listed on NYSE Arca under the symbol GDOG. However, the proposal is still pending the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval. The Strategic Role of Dogecoin Dogecoin, created in 2013 as a lighthearted payment system by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, has evolved to become the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Recall that China-based pork processor turned Bitcoin miner Bit Origin has officially launched its crypto treasury strategy by purchasing 40.5 million Dogecoin . This marked a significant pivot in its evolving business direction. Bit Origin’s CEO Jiang stated that the decision to adopt Digecoin for its treasury was due to the token nearing an “inflection point” for micropayments. This is driven by renewed developer interest and broader institutional momentum toward tokenization .

Once touted as a rising Layer 1 project, its recent performance has sparked debate: is Kaia simply consolidating before a rebound, or losing its edge in a crowded L1 field? With resistance levels approaching and traders weighing risk against long-term potential, KAIA finds itself at a crossroads that could determine whether it’s a hidden gem for 2024 or a fading bet. Kaia (KAIA) Faces Resistance as It Aims for New Heights Source: tradingview Kaia's price is currently bouncing between about $0.142 and $0.172. It's near a key resistance point at $0.187, which is a challenge for bulls aiming for a break. If it pushes past, the next target is around $0.217. This would mark a potential increase of close to 27% from its current higher range. On the flip side, the support level sits at roughly $0.128. Over the past month, the price fell over 16%, but it managed a 10% rise over six months. With a middling RSI and Stochastic readings, Kaia seems to hold potential for gradual growth towards surpassing resistance levels. Conclusion Kaia’s struggle around $0.14 reflects both near-term weakness and long-term opportunity. The $0.187 resistance remains the key barrier to unlock further gains, with $0.217 as the next milestone if momentum builds. Meanwhile, strong support at $0.128 offers a cushion for cautious traders. Though short-term charts show mixed signals, KAIA’s steady six-month growth and position in the Layer 1 sector leave room for a potential comeback. For investors willing to take a contrarian view, Kaia still holds the chance to emerge as one of the year’s overlooked L1 plays—if it can finally break through resistance and reclaim market confidence.

Those two were Governor Christopher Waller and Governor Michelle Bowman, who both voted to lower the benchmark interest rate, arguing that the labor market was cooling faster than expected. The rest of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) disagreed, voting to keep the rate steady between 4.25% and 4.5%, where it has been locked since December 2024. This was the first time in more than 30 years that multiple Fed governors dissented in a rate decision. The split showed growing tension inside the Fed as policymakers face pressure from the White House to respond more aggressively to economic slowdowns. Trump, who regained the presidency in January 2025, has publicly criticized Chair Jerome Powell, calling him “a loser” and “stupid,” and continues to demand rate cuts to stimulate growth. The meeting summary made it clear that while officials saw threats on both sides of their dual mandate, inflation and employment, most of them believed it was still too risky to start cutting rates. The minutes said, “Participants generally pointed to risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate, emphasizing upside risk to inflation and downside risk to employment.” However, “a majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two risks,” while “a couple saw downside risk to employment as more salient risk.” Tariffs and inflation uncertainty cloud Fed’s rate path Tariffs were a major point of discussion in the meeting. Trump’s latest wave of trade actions , particularly on China and European goods, created additional inflation concerns inside the central bank. “Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants pointed to the uncertain effects of tariffs and the possibility of inflation expectations becoming unanchored,” the Fed minutes said. Officials admitted there was “considerable uncertainty” about how strong or lasting the impact of the tariffs might be. Internally, the Fed’s own staff described economic growth during the first half of 2025 as “tepid,” even though the unemployment rate remained low at the time of the meeting. But some participants saw early signs of weakness building in the jobs market and in consumer spending data. Several Fed officials noted that “some incoming data pointed to a weakening of labor market conditions,” and warned that the “downside risk to employment had meaningfully increased.” The discussion happened just two days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released fresh payroll figures. Those numbers showed job growth in July remained weak, and previous months—June and May—were revised sharply downward, confirming that the labor market had softened more than initially believed. The minutes also noted that if inflation were to stay elevated while the labor market kept weakening, the Fed would face “difficult tradeoffs.” Rate decisions going forward would depend on “each variable’s distance from the Committee’s goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.” Trump tightens grip on Fed as Powell prepares Jackson Hole speech The July meeting minutes were released two days before Powell is expected to deliver a major speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole conference in Wyoming. Powell’s address is expected to offer hints on the Fed’s short-term direction on interest rates, as well as how the board views long-term policy options going into 2026. But Powell isn’t just facing pressure from the markets. Trump is stacking the Fed with his own picks . Governor Adriana Kugler resigned earlier this month, giving Trump another opening to fill the board with an ally. The president has already gone after Governor Lisa Cook, demanding her resignation over accusations of mortgage fraud tied to federal housing loans she received for real estate in Georgia and Michigan. Powell’s term as Fed Chair ends in May 2026, but he can legally stay on as a board governor until 2028. Even so, Trump and his economic team have begun floating names to replace him. The White House has identified 11 candidates, a mix of former and current Fed officials, economists, and Wall Street strategists.

In previous instances, this indicator has offered a reliable context for market turning points. Bitcoin Market at Crossroads According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis, SOPR remained under 1 in early 2023, which reflected widespread losses among short-term sellers and a depressed market environment. By early 2024, it consistently climbed above 1, and at times hit 1.2, capturing a wave of profit-taking as Bitcoin surged past $70,000. The following year brought a phase of indecision, as the SOPR oscillated around breakeven, similar to the tug-of-war between bullish momentum and correction risk. Now, the latest reading indicates the market is again at a crossroads. A steady move above 1 would imply short-term holders are selling into profits without exhausting demand. This could essentially pave the way for a run toward $120,000 to $130,000. However, a dip below this level could indicate renewed stress with investors selling at a loss. Such actions could drag prices back toward $95,000-$100,000. What makes the current setup notable is the absence of extreme profit-taking or loss-cutting. CryptoQuant explained that this zone has often preceded decisive breakouts or breakdowns. As such, traders are effectively waiting for confirmation of direction, while SOPR’s neutrality keeps the market balanced. Broader market data shows Bitcoin caught in a tug-of-war between speculative leverage and institutional accumulation, each pulling prices in different directions. Speculation vs. Real Demand On one side, speculative activity has surged to near-record levels. For instance, Open Interest across exchanges climbed past $40 billion, a figure close to all-time highs. Meanwhile, positive funding rates further reveal a strong long bias, as whales and short-term traders are aggressively betting on continued upside. This optimism, however, comes with fragility. When leverage is skewed so heavily to one side, even a modest price decline can trigger a cascade of forced liquidations. This could send Bitcoin into sharp, short-lived corrections. Such volatility has been a recurring feature whenever speculative positioning runs ahead of market depth. On the other side, long-term support continues to strengthen. Institutional demand, led by ETFs and corporate treasuries, has quietly accumulated more than 1.3 million BTC, thereby “anchoring long-term trajectory.” Unlike speculative flows, these inflows are less sensitive to short-term market noise and reflect a growing recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The result is a layered market: speculative leverage dictates short-term turbulence, while institutional demand indicates the long-term trajectory.

The Solana-based memecoin launchpad, once hailed as Pump.fun’s fiercest challenger, only managed to graduate just five tokens in the last 24 hours, according to Dune Analytics data. Pump.fun, on the other hand, graduated more than 170 tokens over the same period. The numbers also tell a short story of how quickly LetsBonk’s momentum has evaporated since July, when it briefly overtook Pump.fun and controlled over 70% of the market. Pump.fun has reclaimed its dominance of the Solana memecoin launchpad space. Source: Dune Analytics From breakout star to fading rival Launched in April through a partnership between BONK and Raydium, LetsBonk rose on the back of its revenue-sharing model and deeper liquidity pools. By early July, the platform was graduating over 200 tokens per day at some point and attracting creators frustrated with Pump.fun’s fee-heavy structure. Recent data show that the rally was short-lived. Pump.fun has since found its way back to the top and reclaimed lost ground through a mix of product tweaks, liquidity programs, and community incentives. By early August, it had halved LetsBonk’s lead, and today’s Dune numbers suggest the challenger is sliding into irrelevance. In the past 24 hours, as of the time of writing this article, Pump.fun has 63.62% of the market share, followed by Heaven and Bags, which have 27.9% and 3%, respectively. LetsBonk comes in a distant fifth, with 1.7% of the market share. As of August 5, the last time it led the market, LetsBonk had 43.9% market share, followed by Pump.fun, which was already making a comeback at 36.6%. Why the collapse? The first factor will be the memecoin market itself, which is notoriously volatile, with users abandoning platforms once hype fades and narratives change. The meteoric rise of LetsBonk itself is partly owed to the fact that Pump.fun, which had the first-mover advantage, wasn’t doing much for its community, a gap which LetsBonk filled with its offerings. In early August, Pump.fun announced the launch of the “Glass Full Foundation,” an initiative aimed at pumping liquidity into select memecoin projects with the aim of steadying token markets. Some saw this move as a strategy to win back its community. While LetsBonk generated buzz with its brief market share gains, the platform may not have built the reputational foundation required to retain creators once competition intensified. With Pump.fun offering reliability and familiarity, many traders and developers simply returned to what they knew worked. For LetsBonk, fewer token launches also mean that liquidity is thinning out, making the platform less attractive for both creators and speculators. Can LetsBonk bounce back? Revamped incentive models, strategic partnerships, or a fresh narrative push may be required to claw back attention. But in the unforgiving memecoin market, patience is rare and loyalty even rarer. The platform recently launched a points incentive system , which has so far failed to deliver sustainable engagement. However, given that the program was just recently launched, now may not be the best time to judge its effectiveness in changing LetsBonk’s fortunes. For now, the data paints a stark picture, and that’s the fact that LetsBonk, the breakout platform that once threatened Pump.fun’s crown, is slipping dangerously close to irrelevancy. If this trend continues, creators may abandon the platform altogether, further concentrating Solana’s memecoin activity on Pump.fun and other platforms such as Bags or Heaven, the new kids on the block.

To achieve the target, the meme coin would need to rally over 40,000% from its current price of $0.00001255. SHIB YTD stock price chart. Source: Finbold SHIB’s path to $0.005 The AI model suggested SHIB could only hit the milestone between 2045 and 2050, pointing to structural hurdles that limit near-term upside. Notably, SHIB’s massive circulating supply remains its greatest challenge. With nearly 589 trillion tokens in existence, the coin’s current burn mechanisms are too small to make a meaningful impact. While billions of SHIB are burned monthly, analysts argue the pace must rise to trillions annually to impact price. Without deeper cuts, valuations would become unrealistic. The forecast also ties SHIB’s future to ecosystem growth, citing ShibaSwap, Shibarium, and ventures in gaming and the metaverse. These could drive long-term demand, though ChatGPT-5 cautions that global-scale adoption may take decades. The broader cryptocurrency market is also a decisive factor. Global market capitalization stands at $4 trillion in 2025, but some forecasts see the industry expanding to as much as $30 trillion by 2040. ChatGPT-5 suggested SHIB would need such growth to support the valuations required for $0.005. Capturing even 5% to 10% of that market could place the token’s value in the $1 to 3 trillion range, making the target price more realistic. Impact of SHIB community Additionally, community strength remains one of SHIB’s core advantages, but ChatGPT-5 warned that hype alone is not enough. While viral attention and celebrity endorsements have historically lifted meme coins, sustaining momentum at higher levels requires fundamentals such as supply burns and adoption. According to the projection, SHIB is expected to remain relatively subdued over the next decade, trading below $0.0001 through 2035. More meaningful gains could emerge in the mid-2040s, with prices potentially reaching $0.001. Only after significant supply reductions, ecosystem maturity, and broader market expansion does ChatGPT-5 see $0.005 as attainable. The projection suggests that while Shiba Inu has a chance at the long-awaited milestone, investors should prepare for a decades-long timeline rather than an imminent breakout.

On Wednesday, Trump jumped on Truth Social and wrote, “Cook must resign now!!!” This came right after Bill Pulte, his ally and the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, dropped a bombshell. Pulte publicly accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud by claiming two houses as her primary residence, at the same time. Pulte posted a letter on X saying Cook falsified bank records and property documents to lock in better mortgage deals. One of those homes was later listed for rent. He’s demanding the Department of Justice get involved. That’s not a small request. It adds more heat to the Trump administration’s long war against the Federal Reserve and its staff. Trump allies escalate mortgage fraud charges Pulte, who’s been echoing Trump’s frustration with the Fed, made the situation louder on CNBC. He claimed, “You cannot do that in America.” He was referring to Cook’s alleged tactic of calling two separate homes her main residence to get favorable loan terms. Pulte says one home went up for rent shortly after the deal closed. The accusation is simple: Cook claimed two primary residences, which is illegal under federal mortgage law. Pulte insisted there’s nothing political about it. “There’s no funny business here,” he said. “This is straightforward stuff, and if you commit mortgage fraud, especially in black and white, you will be prosecuted.” Trump isn’t new to beef with the Federal Reserve. He’s constantly bashed Fed Chair Jay Powell, calling him a “moron” and a “numbskull” for refusing to slash interest rates during his time in office. He’s also furious over the Fed’s decision to spend $2.5 billion renovating its Washington headquarters. White House pushes limits of Fed firing rules The fight over Cook’s position is not political; it is economical and it’s legal. Federal law says central bank governors can only be removed for “cause”, which usually means serious misconduct. That’s the only way a sitting board member like Cook can be kicked out before their term ends. Pulte argued on air that there’s “of course” cause to remove Cook, and then suggested Jay Powell could be the one to do it. “I’ll tell you this, Jay Powell, he has a chance to do the right thing by the law,” Pulte said. But that idea hits a wall. According to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, only the president can remove a Fed board member. That legal wall got taller earlier this year. The Supreme Court suggested that the president can’t just fire Federal Reserve governors because he doesn’t agree with their decisions. So even if Trump wants Cook out, even if Pulte is screaming fraud, the law might not be on their side. Not yet. Get seen where it counts.

With $4,150 acting as key support, ETH seems to be preparing for a bounce back toward the $4,788 resistance and all-time high zone. ETH Holds Steady Near $4,190 As $4,150 Support Faces Test Ash Crypto, in his recent Ethereum 4H chart analysis shared on X, pointed out that ETH is currently trading around $4,190, holding just above the key $4,150 support zone. This level has been acting as an important cushion for price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Above Key Level Against Bitcoin, Sparking Bullish Cycle Talk He further noted that Ethereum’s price movement is unfolding within a falling channel, a pattern that typically reflects short-term corrective pressure. This comes after the strong upward rally seen earlier this month, suggesting that the market is currently pausing and consolidating gains before deciding its next major direction. According to the analyst, if buyers can defend the $4,150 support, ETH may gain sufficient strength to attempt a breakout from the channel. Such a move could pave the way for a retest of the $4,788 resistance level or the all-time high zone. A successful push above this area would likely ignite renewed bullish momentum and possibly extend the larger uptrend. On the other hand, if the $4,150 level gives way under sustained selling pressure, Ethereum could face a deeper retracement. The next strong support lies around $3,900, a level that aligns with higher-timeframe support zones. This makes it a crucial area for bulls to defend, as a failure to hold there could shift market sentiment and signal the start of a more extended correction. Ethereum’s Next Move Hinges On Key Price Levels In his analysis of Ethereum, Ash Crypto emphasized the importance of momentum and key levels to watch closely. He pointed out that ETH is currently trading within a short-term bearish structure, characterized by a series of lower highs and lower lows on the chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears $5,000 After 45% Monthly Rally, Whale Buying and Regulatory Clarity Fuel Surge Despite this temporary weakness, Ash highlighted that a breakout above the falling channel would be a major shift in momentum. Such a move would flip the current bearish outlook into a bullish one, signaling the possibility of renewed upside pressure and a potential continuation of the broader uptrend. On the downside, the most critical support remains at $4,150. If this level fails to hold, the next strong support can be found at $3,900. As for the upside, the resistance to watch is $4,788. A successful retest and breakout above this level would likely confirm a strong bullish reversal, opening the door for ETH to push into uncharted territory.

This has again sparked a bearish sentiment, with the bears looking to be in control. How the Shiba Inu 699,000% Imbalance Happened Coinglass data showed that the Shiba 699,000% imbalance occurred due to the large disparity in the long and short positions that were liquidated in the space of one hour. This came as the SHIB price sharply dropped alongside the broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin, which declined to as low as $112,500 in the last 24 hours. The Shiba Inu price has dropped to as low as $0.00001206 during this period from an intraday high of $0.00001264, flushing a significant amount of long positions in the process. Further data from Coinglass shows that $425,230 in long positions have been wiped out in the 24-hour period, compared to just $11,230 in short positions. This development has sparked a bearish sentiment among Shiba Inu’s bulls , who appear to be waiting to see how things unfold before reentering the market. SHIB’s open interest is down over 4% in the last 24 hours, currently at $191.38 million. Meanwhile, the derivatives trading volume is also down 2%, currently at $177.46 million. However, a positive for Shiba Inu is that the long/short is at 1.0838, which indicates that more traders are currently long than short. This could spark a massive rebound when the market stabilizes. The crypto market is currently experiencing significant volatility ahead of Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium on August 22. Investors await to see whether the Fed Chair will take a hawkish or dovish stance, with rate cuts in focus. SHIB Burns Skyrocket 2,196% Shibburn data shows that Shiba Inu’s burns have skyrocketed 2196% in the last 24 hours, with 1.6 million SHIB burned during this period. However, the burns are down over 28% in the last seven days, with about 72 million tokens burned this period. Increase in burns is typically bullish for the meme coin, since it could spark a supply shock as demand increases. The 24-hour increase in Shiba Inu’s burns follows the SHIB Chainlink integration , which enables token burns to occur across multiple networks. Amid these developments, crypto analysts like Javon Marks remain bullish on SHIB’s trajectory. The analyst earlier this month predicted that the top meme coin could rally over 150% to reach $0.000032, which may just be the start of a larger reversal. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001226, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Shiba Inu|bitcoin|chainlink|Coinglass|Coinmarketcap|Fed|Jackson Hole Symposium|Javon Marks|Jerome Powell|meme coin|open interest|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibburn|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 20:00:24

A recent Bloomberg report indicates that these digital asset companies include Gemini Space Station Inc., helmed by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, alongside blockchain-focused lending firm Figure Technology Solutions Inc. Wall Street Banks Reveal $15B Crypto Companies IPO Pipeline Before September Earlier market uncertainties, including this year’s trade policy volatility, caused potential public companies to delay their debuts. However, these concerns have largely evaporated following successful listings like stablecoin provider Circle Internet Group Inc., which more than doubled in value upon market entry. “We are witnessing technology sector participants fast-track their schedules, with some who were previously targeting late this year or early next year now inquiring whether we can expedite the process,” explained Will Connolly, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s co-head of equity capital markets. Keith Canton, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s co-head of Americas equity capital markets, suggests that dozens of enterprises could complete public offerings before year-end, potentially generating over $15 billion collectively and pushing total IPO proceeds, excluding SPACs, toward $40 billion in 2024. JPMorgan is reportedly managing approximately 10 companies that have filed publicly or confidentially within its IPO pipeline, plus an additional 15 to 20 firms actively testing the market waters. According to Bloomberg, the U.S. IPO market is working to overcome several sluggish years following the record-breaking surge of 2021. This risk-positive environment is fueling optimism that 2025 will maintain this upward trajectory, with crypto companies positioned to benefit. The Circle IPO success story has particularly captured Wall Street’s attention to the digital asset market. Recently, crypto exchange Bullish also made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange with backing from Wall Street billionaire Peter Thiel, breaking new ground with its $1.15 billion initial public offering. The company became the first U.S.-listed entity to raise such a substantial sum entirely through blockchain-based stablecoins. The @Bullish IPO raises a record $1.15B, a first for a company on the @NYSE using majorly @solana stablecoins for funding. #Stablecoins #Solana https://t.co/SJkNm4kmSu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 19, 2025 Bloomberg’s ranking of major U.S. listings shows two crypto companies, Circle and CoreWeave, leading the top 10 best-performing IPOs of 2025, delivering returns of 336% and 132% to investors, respectively. Source: Bloomberg Also ranking prominently is Figma, which has recently venture d into cryptocurrency through Bitcoin acquisitions. The design company generated over 110% in returns following its public listing. Another crypto company is Bullish, which priced its IPO at $37 per share, achieving a $5.4 billion valuation and raising $1.1 billion while providing investors with a 66% return. Which Crypto Companies’ IPO Filings Are Coming Next? As the IPO season approaches, numerous crypto-focused enterprises are competing to go public. On Monday, blockchain-based lending platform Figure Technology Solutions, co-founded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, publicly submitted its IPO filing . Figure Technology Solutions previously raised $200 million in a 2021 funding round at a $3.2 billion valuation. Meanwhile, Ripple has eme rged as a supporter of Gemini’s forthcoming IPO, extending a $75 million credit facility to the exchange that could expand to $150 million. Gemini, planning to list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “GEMI,” disclo sed this arrangement while filing for its highly anticipated public offering. This development positions Gemini to become the third crypto exchange to go public in the United States, following Coinbase in 2021 and Bullish earlier this month. Additionally, the IPO acceleration occurs amid a shifting regulatory environment that increasingly favors digital assets.

After a Starship vehicle caught fire during a routine fueling run in June, the company reassigned roughly 20% of engineers from the Falcon 9 team to Starship for six months, according to people familiar with the plan. The goal is to speed repairs and push faster progress on the rocket Elon Musk says could take crews to the moon and later to Mars. The approach isn’t new. SpaceX and Musk often surge staff when a problem appears. Last year, Boring Co. workers were flown to Las Vegas to revive the Prufock machine after water damage, people said. According to a report by Bloomberg , in 2018, Tesla Inc. dispatched employees from around the U.S. to California to help ramp up Model 3 production. Inside SpaceX, the additional hands are aimed at reliability work, testing of parts, and building vehicles more quickly, one person said. In August, the company said a pressurized bottle holding gaseous nitrogen had been damaged, failed, and triggered an explosion during fueling. The test-stand mishap came after a difficult run for Starship. Of three flights this year from South Texas, two vehicles broke apart early , and a third didn’t release its test satellites and spun out during descent. Those setbacks have fueled doubts about timing. SpaceX’s track record fuels confidence despite setbacks Even with the setbacks, SpaceX’s past results shape expectations. The company built the Starlink internet network and advanced reusable rockets, influencing the space sector and U.S. policy while becoming one of the most valuable private firms. Testing plays out in public, with cinematic livestreams on X, Musk’s platform. The company emphasizes learning quickly from failure, but rapid changes to machines that cost hundreds of millions can create costly chain reactions. Musk has set high targets for Starship to be fully reusable, cheaper by orders of magnitude than rivals, and central to reaching Mars. Early timelines, which included carrying people by 2023 and landing on the moon this year, have not been met. “It’s really one of the hardest engineering challenges that exists,” Musk said at a Tesla owners event in July. “When we first started talking about Starship, people thought this was impossible. In fact, even within the company, we sort of thought it was impossible.” Starship’s tenth test set amid investor and NASA pressure SpaceX is targeting a tenth Starship test as early as Aug. 24. More test losses may be financially manageable , but proving momentum will be important for investors and for meeting NASA obligations. SpaceX started with Falcon, added Dragon for cargo and crew, and now relies on Starlink’s thousands of low-Earth-orbit satellites for most revenue. To speed Starship, it’s shifting engineers from Falcon, which could push some Falcon 9 Starlink missions from late this year to early 2026. With about 8,000 Starlink satellites already in orbit, a few slipped launches aren’t seen as critical. Getting Starship working is central to SpaceX’s roadmap. It is expected to carry larger, more capable Starlink satellites and, over time, take over from Falcon 9 as the main launcher, executives have said. NASA has awarded roughly $4 billion for Starship to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface. To meet that, SpaceX must show more than a dozen rapid, in-orbit refueling flights, a sequence never achieved at this scale, and Starship still hasn’t completed a full orbit. Speed has influenced design choices, according to a person familiar with the process. Recent flights have used a Version 2, or V2, prototype with some decisions made to save time and money. Such bets fit SpaceX’s style, but they can stack risks and shape public views.

Attorney Bill Morgan highlighted two critical decisions expected to be announced around the same time: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) final decision on spot XRP ETF applications and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) review of Ripple's national bank license application. These two developments could be turning points for XRP's future and Ripple's role in the global financial sector. The SEC has postponed its decision on spot XRP ETF applications filed by CoinShares, Grayscale, and 21Shares for the second time, moving the deadline to the end of October 2025. This deadline cannot be extended under US law, so the SEC will have to either approve or reject the applications next October. Related News: BREAKING: Chaos Ensues in Token Set to Be Completely Acquired by Another Altcoin - Now There's a Higher Bidder A potential approval would allow regulated investment products linked to XRP’s spot market to be listed on US exchanges, significantly expanding access for institutional and individual investors. Ripple's application to the OCC for a national bank license in the US could be finalized in October. The OCC is required by law to respond to the application, submitted on July 2nd, within 120 days. If approved, Ripple would join the ranks of nationally recognized US banks and expand beyond payment technologies into banking operations. Furthermore, the company's extensive XRP holdings on its balance sheet could provide significant leverage in this process. According to Bill Morgan, October could be a “decisive turning point” for Ripple and XRP, as decisions from both the SEC and OCC will play a critical role in the token’s adoption and Ripple’s long-term strategy. *This is not investment advice.

Solana’s RSI is 52.36, and the MACD is building positive momentum at 3.89 histogram despite its slight bearish positioning. Moderate 2.29 million SOL volume indicates steady institutional participation during the pullback phase. ChatGPT’s SOL analysis synthesizes 23 real-time technical indicators to assess Solana’s trajectory amid network milestone achievements and recovery from liquidation-driven market volatility toward a potential breakout acceleration. Technical Analysis: Healthy Pullback Within Strong Bull Trend Solana’s current price of $183.75 reflects a 4.27% decline from the opening price of $176.22 , establishing a volatile trading range between $185.06 (high) and $176.04 (low). This 4.9% intraday range demonstrates healthy volatility typical of strong trending assets during temporary corrections. Source: TradingView The RSI at 52.36 maintains neutral positioning after cooling from higher levels, providing balanced momentum without oversold conditions. Moving averages reveal exceptional bullish positioning with Solana trading above all major EMAs: 20-day at $181.76 ( +1.1% ), 50-day at $174.57 ( +5.0% ), 100-day at $168.11 ( +8.5% ), and 200-day at $165.62 ( +9.9% ). MACD shows a slight bearish structure at -0.53 below zero with the signal line at 3.36 , but a substantial negative histogram at 3.89 suggests building momentum toward a bullish crossover. Source: TradingView This momentum divergence during minor pullbacks often precedes continuation moves as technical indicators prepare for the next leg higher. Volume analysis shows moderate activity at 2.29 million SOL, indicating steady institutional participation during the correction phase. ATR maintains very high readings at 138.62 , suggesting strong volatility potential for continued major moves once a direction is established. Market Context: Network Milestones Drive Fundamental Strength Solana’s resilience follows the network achieving a historic 100,000 transactions per second during stress testing, demonstrating technical infrastructure superiority while crypto markets recover from liquidation events. Recent developments include the Wyoming stablecoin FRNT launching on Solana and 1inch adding cross-chain compatibility, expanding ecosystem utility. The @Bullish IPO raises a record $1.15B, a first for a company on the @NYSE using majorly @solana stablecoins for funding. #Stablecoins #Solana https://t.co/SJkNm4kmSu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 19, 2025 Similarly, Bullish exchange’s record $1.15 billion IPO settlement using Solana stablecoins demonstrates institutional infrastructure adoption despite market volatility. The 2025 trajectory shows considerable recovery from March’s $124.72 low to the current $183 levels, representing a 47% appreciation. Current positioning maintains elevation above the $150 – $175 recovery range established since April, validating institutional confidence in network development. Broader Market Liquidation Impact The crypto market turbulence provides crucial context for Solana’s relative performance. As CoinEx regional director Mal Zane observes, “The week opened with a sharp jolt across the markets as more than $400 million in leveraged long positions were liquidated, catching many traders off guard.” Zane notes that “Bitcoin fell below $115,000 , while Ethereum retraced from last week’s high of $4,700 to $4,300 ,” demonstrating the severity of the correction. However, Solana’s maintenance above all major EMAs during this period reveals exceptional relative strength compared to market leaders. Despite the volatility, Zane emphasizes structural resilience, explaining that “each pullback from new all-time highs this year has been progressively smaller.” The expert analysis suggests that “funding rates turned negative, and risk reversals are favoring puts” as traders hedge downside risks. Yet Solana’s continued network development and ecosystem expansion demonstrate fundamental strength beyond short-term positioning dynamics. Market Fundamentals: Strong Metrics Support Network Growth Solana maintains substantial positioning with a $99.21 billion market cap ( +2.9% ) despite broader market challenges. The market cap growth accompanies increased volume of $6.14 billion ( +10.82% ), indicating active institutional interest during network milestone achievements. The 6.2% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests healthy trading activity supporting price stability during correction phases. Source: CoinMarketCap The circulating supply of 540.19 million SOL represents controlled distribution supporting network economics, while the unlimited maximum supply reflects ongoing validator rewards and ecosystem development. Market dominance of 2.59% positions Solana as a major blockchain platform with proven technical capabilities. A fully diluted valuation of $111.31 billion reflects the total network value, including future token releases, and demonstrates institutional confidence in long-term ecosystem growth. Social Sentiment: Exceptional Performance Amid Network Achievements LunarCrush data reveals outstanding social performance with Solana’s AltRank at #1 during network milestone achievements. A Galaxy Score of 70 reflects strong sentiment as participants process 100K TPS validation and ecosystem expansion developments. Engagement metrics show substantial activity with 22.34 million total engagements ( -4.35M ) and 138.18K mentions ( +59.8K ), demonstrating continued attention during technical achievements. A social dominance of 9.65% maintains exceptional visibility while sentiment registers at a robust 81% positive despite a minor correction. The $SOL chart is pure poetry.

Major developments include Pump.fun revenue exploding 700% to $13.5 million weekly , while analysts identify accumulation patterns and falling wedge breakout potential, suggesting continued institutional positioning despite temporary market volatility. ChatGPT’s SOL Analysis: Network Strength Meets Technical Breakout ChatGPT’s SOL analysis reveals Solana maintaining exceptional technical structure above all major EMAs while processing major network achievements. The positioning above $183 represents institutional validation of network capacity demonstrations during broader market recovery phases. Immediate support emerges at the 20-day EMA around $181.76 , followed by key support at the 50-day EMA ( $174.57 ). Source: TradingView The layered EMA support structure provides substantial downside protection, while resistance begins at today’s high ( $185.06 ), followed by the psychological $190 – $200 levels. The technical setup suggests a healthy correction within a strong uptrend structure, with potential for continuation toward $200 psychological resistance. Three-Month Solana Price Forecast: Breakout Scenarios Network-Driven Breakout (50% Probability) A successful hold above the $174-$181 support, combined with continued network achievements, could drive a breakout toward $200 – $220 , representing a 9 – 20% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires market stabilization and continued ecosystem expansion. Healthy Consolidation (30% Probability) Continued market uncertainty could result in consolidation between $174 and $190 , allowing technical indicators to reset while network development accelerates through ecosystem milestones and institutional adoption. Source: TradingView Support Testing (20% Probability) Broader market weakness could trigger testing toward $168-$174 EMA support levels, representing an 8 – 10% downside. Source: TradingView Recovery would depend on network strength validation and major support defense. ChatGPT’s SOL Analysis: Technical Excellence Meets Network Innovation ChatGPT’s SOL analysis reveals Solana is positioned for a potential breakout following network milestone achievements and exceptional technical structure maintenance. The combination of 100K TPS validation with bullish positioning above all EMAs suggests institutional confidence in network infrastructure leadership. Next Price Target: $200-$220 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires holding above the $181 EMA support to validate continued bullish structure momentum. From there, network achievement validation could propel Solana toward $200 psychological resistance, with sustained ecosystem expansion driving toward $220 + breakout levels. However, failure to hold $181 would indicate consolidation toward the $168-$174 range, creating an accumulation opportunity before the next network wave drives Solana toward a $295 + all-time high retest as technical infrastructure advantages compound.

The market remains volatile, yet certain projects show momentum, adoption, and strength that may shape the year. Avalanche continues steady performance as a Layer-1. Polygon holds firm with growing network use. NEAR Protocol gains attention with institutional positioning and development strength. Together they create a diverse set of choices for the next cycle. Still, BlockDAG is pulling ahead as the most watched project. Its presale is accelerating, with analysts eyeing a possible 36x return from current levels. It is fast becoming the presale story drawing global attention. The key to progress with top crypto coins often lies in spotting trends early, and this breakdown highlights setups that may define the next major cycle. BlockDAG at $0.0276: Could It Deliver the 36x Story of 2025? BlockDAG’s presale is moving at pace, and delays may mean missing a major run. Batch 29 is live at $0.0276, while post-listing targets near $1 suggest a 36x potential for those positioned before the market reprices. With $377 million already raised toward a $600M target, each batch sellout moves the price up, lowering the margin for latecomers. What drives this rise is more than speculation. BlockDAG’s hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work design allows fast, secure, and scalable transactions without losing decentralization. Real adoption is clear: 19,300 ASIC miners sold, over 2.5 million users mining via the X1 mobile app, and developers preparing dApps for mainnet launch. When Batch 29 ends, prices adjust instantly. Past cycles show that the largest gains in top crypto coins often go to early participants. BlockDAG (BDAG) may be the story of 2025, and waiting could mean paying 5–10x more in only a few months. Avalanche (AVAX): Gains with Event Risk Avalanche trades close to $24.78, showing a ~5% weekly rise even with a ~2% daily slip. Liquidity stays strong with $1.42 billion in 24-hour volume, keeping it active in top crypto coins circles. Yet, a $42 million unlock ahead may create short-term pressure, with price risk toward $20. Still, Avalanche’s Layer-1 design, driven by subnets, continues to attract builders and capital flow. For traders, it is a case of weighing the possible impact of the unlock against the longer-term value of a network known for speed and scale. Polygon (POL): Consolidation Before a Shift Polygon, now under the POL brand on Ethereum’s mainnet, trades near $0.24. The past week’s range of $0.2311 to $0.2605 shows a phase of limited volatility. While not the strongest short-term top crypto coins play, such consolidation often sets up larger shifts once external triggers emerge. Core strength remains visible in the ecosystem, yet the market waits for a driver, whether through broader sentiment or major partnerships. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Accumulation and Uncertainty NEAR trades around $2.78, holding a ~5% weekly gain despite a ~4.6% daily drop. The range between $2.56 and $3.06 reflects a mix of growth and caution. Institutional flows shaped recent moves, with initial rises followed by profit-taking, a common pattern in top crypto coins during accumulation phases. As a developer-friendly Layer-1, NEAR stays competitive in rankings, though price shifts show that traders are waiting for clearer catalysts before committing further. Final Outlook: Where Momentum Meets Timing In the evolving field of top crypto coins , 2025 looks set to reward early and planned entries. Avalanche shows steady growth despite event risks, Polygon’s quiet phase may precede a bigger move, and NEAR holds firm with clear activity from large players. Yet one name stands out. BlockDAG’s presale momentum highlights advanced tech, wide adoption, and projections of 36x returns. History shows that the largest moves in top crypto coins often happen before the market reacts. Those tracking BlockDAG ahead of Batch 29’s close may be aligning with one of the most significant opportunities of the next cycle. The signals are here, but the timing rests with the trader.

Related Reading: Cardano Climbs To 8th, Pushing Dogecoin And TRON Down The Ranks Chair Paul Atkins confirmed that the agency will launch the President’s Digital Assets Group, a step he says will open a new chapter in US regulation. White House Roadmap According to Atkins, the first objective of the new group will be to carry out recommendations from the President’s Digital Asset Markets Working Group. His remarks came during the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, where he introduced what he called “Project Crypto” and promised to move away from regulation by enforcement. I had a great conversation with @TeresaGoody at @SALTConference’s Wyoming Blockchain Symposium today about my priorities as @SECgov chairman, including Project Crypto and making IPOs great again. It’s a new day at the SEC. Thread 🧵⬇️ pic.twitter.com/I7UIrjQFpT — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) August 19, 2025 Atkins stated the SEC will not rely on old methods. Instead, the commission intends to create rules that prevent abuse but remain flexible enough for technology’s rapid development. Atkins said the effort is part of US President Donald Trump’s extensive push for a more transparent policy on digital assets. Investor Protection And Innovation Atkins praised the administration for supporting a plan that he says balances investor protection with space for innovation. He added that cooperation with Congress, the White House, and other agencies will help keep US policy consistent and aligned with international standards. This is a clear contrast to the approach of his predecessor, Gary Gensler, who frequently said most tokens were securities under existing rules. Critics of Gensler’s stance argued it drove innovation overseas and created a climate of uncertainty. Atkins rejected that argument, saying very few tokens meet the definition of securities. The way tokens are packaged, marketed, and sold matters more, he explained. Flexible Rules For Developers The shift could make it easier for crypto projects to operate in the US without immediately being treated as securities. Reports show that the President’s DAWG released a roadmap in July urging regulators to introduce rules that encourage businesses while maintaining investor safeguards. Atkins said the SEC will stick closely to that roadmap. Related Reading: Analyst Says Shiba Inu’s $0.000010 Support Could Trigger Major Bounce Exemptions & Transparency He explained that the commission will provide exemptions, safe harbors, and new disclosure standards tailored for crypto companies. That would replace the “one-size-fits-all” system that has frustrated the industry for years. Activities such as ICOs, airdrops, network rewards, and building decentralized apps may be treated more flexibly under this plan. Atkins clarified that the new approach does not mean a free-for-all, but rather a structure designed to support responsible growth.

Cold Wallet ($CWT) is gaining traction with a $6.3 million presale and a projected 3,423% ROI at launch, placing it firmly in the spotlight. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is reinforcing its leadership in DeFi derivatives, supported by record trading volumes and deep institutional flows. Its growth has made it a central figure for traders seeking consistent exposure to this sector. At the same time, Cardano (ADA) is fueled by ETF speculation, while NEAR Protocol (NEAR) sits at a technical turning point that could spark significant moves. Together, these projects blend innovation, adoption, and technical setups, creating some of the strongest contenders for 2025’s best crypto projects. 1. Cold Wallet ($CWT): Presale Strengthens Its Case as a Market Game-Changer Cold Wallet (CWT) is making headlines with one of the best crypto projects of 2025, securing its place among the top crypto presale opportunities. Currently in Stage 17, CWT is priced at just $0.00998, while its confirmed launch price stands at $0.3517. This setup offers an impressive 3,423% ROI window for those positioning before the stage closes, highlighting why early participation is drawing strong attention. The presale has already crossed $6.3 million with more than 745 million tokens sold, signaling a level of demand that goes beyond speculation. Cold Wallet’s momentum is reinforced by its $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, which seamlessly integrated over 2 million active users into its ecosystem. This move ensures adoption at scale before the official debut, giving it a unique advantage over traditional wallet projects. What makes Cold Wallet stand apart is its utility-first design. Instead of draining user balances through fees, it rewards participation on every swap, transaction, and on or off-ramp. Each stage pushes the entry price higher, narrowing the ROI window and underscoring why this presale is emerging as one of the most compelling opportunities available right now. 2. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Record Volumes Signal DeFi Leadership Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to attract attention as one of the best crypto projects in the DeFi derivatives space. Its growth has been reinforced by institutional support, including a $583 million treasury initiative from Sonnet BioTherapeutics and Rorschach. This backing has pushed prices to new highs, with HYPE reaching $47 while analysts forecast a continued move toward $50. In July alone, the platform processed $319 billion in trading volume, contributing to a record $487 billion in DeFi perpetual activity. Open interest has doubled to $10.6 billion, supported by liquidity from Bybit and Grayscale. With unmatched speed and high-performance infrastructure, Hyperliquid is cementing its dominance in perpetual contracts and expanding its role as a market leader. 3. Cardano (ADA): Technical Strength Reinforces Market Confidence Cardano (ADA) has advanced into discussions of the best crypto projects after a confirmed breakout from a double-bottom reversal pattern. Trading firmly above its 50-day moving average, ADA has attracted fresh attention from both technical traders and institutions. Current price action at $0.99 reflects momentum that could evolve into a 100 to 150% rally of resistance zones at $1.19 and $1.32 are broken. Speculation around a potential spot ETF launch by Grayscale has further amplified confidence in ADA. The coin has gained 11.5% in the past week, driven by increasing volume and bullish sentiment. If macro conditions remain favorable, this alignment of technical strength and regulatory catalysts may fuel one of Cardano’s strongest rallies heading into 2025. 4. NEAR Protocol: Approaches a Breakout Decision NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is earning its place among the best crypto projects by showing resilience despite significant institutional sales of nearly 20 million tokens. Trading between $2.78 and $3.05, NEAR still managed a 6% gain over the past week. Analysts are closely watching a symmetrical triangle formation that could set the stage for either a bullish breakout or a bearish decline. A push toward $3.20 is possible if volume continues to rise, while downside risks remain should critical support levels give way. Even with near-term volatility, NEAR benefits from strong developer adoption and institutional liquidity that provide long-term stability. Its growing ecosystem and scalability potential ensure it remains a contender for traders seeking exposure to future blockchain growth. Key Points In 2025, the market rewards those who move with conviction rather than hesitation. Cold Wallet is shaping one of the best crypto projects of the year with a presale that blends adoption and a 3,423% ROI window. Alongside it, Hyperliquid maintains dominance in DeFi derivatives through record volumes, while Cardano’s ETF momentum points to major upside. NEAR Protocol adds a volatility-driven setup that appeals to technical traders. Each of these projects highlights a different growth path, whether through utility, scalability, or trading opportunities. As sentiment shifts and capital rotates, early positioning in these best crypto projects can define whether returns remain modest or expand into extraordinary territory. The opening for outsized gains is available now, but only for those ready to act before the market moves ahead.

On August 20, the popular crypto exchange announced that it is planning to bring its tokenized stocks, called xStocks, to the Tron blockchain. The move is being carried out in partnership with TRON DAO and Backed, the startup behind the creation of these assets. This is poised to strengthen Kraken’s goal of making traditional assets more open and accessible. Kraken Brings xStocks to Third Blockchain With Tron Launch xStocks are digital versions of well-known company shares such as Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla. Instead of being bought through a traditional broker, these assets are issued on the blockchain. This allows them to be traded at any time of day, to be bought in smaller fractions, and to connect with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. So far, Kraken has launched xStocks on the BNB Chain and Solana network. The addition of Tron will make it the third blockchain to support them in less than two months from now. In a recent statement, Kraken’s co-CEO Arjun Sethi said this shows what is possible when financial products are built to be open and flexible from the start. Backed to Issue xStocks as TRC-20 Tokens on Tron Backed, the company providing the infrastructure for xStocks, will issue the assets on Tron as TRC-20 tokens. Each token will be backed 1:1 with the underlying stock. In the coming weeks, users will also be able to deposit and withdraw their xStocks directly through the Tron network. This is poised to make it easier to move these assets across platforms. The main advantage of xStocks is access. They allow people from around the world to gain exposure to U.S. equities without the barriers of the traditional financial system. On the Solana blockchain, xStocks are already linked with platforms like Kamino , Raydium, and Jupiter. While on BNB Chain, they connect with PancakeSwap and Venus Protocol. According to Backed co-founder Adam Levi, xStocks have already seen more than $2.5 billion in trading volume across both centralized and decentralized exchanges since their launch in late June. Tokenized Stocks Gain Ground Despite Limits on Shareholder Rights While xStocks mirror the value of popular shares, they are not the same as owning the real stock. For regulatory reasons, they are structured as debt instruments and do not provide shareholder rights such as voting in company decisions. Tron founder Justin Sun recently explained that tokenized equities are still a step forward, offering more efficient and open access to global markets. Meanwhile, Kraken and Backed are not alone in this space. Other players are pushing into tokenized equities as well. Robinhood recently launched its own version of tokenized stocks on the Arbitrum blockchain. Its offering even includes shares of private companies such as OpenAI and SpaceX, which drew attention and some controversy across the industry .

50406487,561139,1755723648,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50406487.jpeg,TRON Secures Native Integration With MetaMask: Strategic Move For Global Adoption,https://bitcoinist.com/tron-secures-native-integration-with-metamask-move/,"TRON is stepping into the spotlight with a major integration that could expand its global reach. The official communication team announced today a strategic agreement with Consensys. This partnership will bring native TRON integration into MetaMask, the world’s leading self-custodial crypto wallet. For the first time, MetaMask users will be able to interact directly with the TRON ecosystem, unlocking access to based assets and dApps without needing third-party tools or custom configurations. This is expected to provide a seamless cross-chain experience while making blockchain more accessible and user-friendly across the globe. TRON already has a significant presence across Asia, South America, Africa, and Europe, and this integration with MetaMask positions the network for broader adoption by millions of users worldwide. For developers, this move could significantly boost exposure to TRON’s ecosystem, driving new dApp creation and cross-chain activity. Beyond technology, the agreement represents a strategic step in blockchain adoption , highlighting TRON’s ambition to solidify its role as a global leader in decentralization. For users, it means smoother access, more opportunities, and stronger integration into the crypto economy. Tron Expands Through MetaMask Integration and Corporate Adoption Community Spokesperson at TRON, Sam Elfarra, highlighted the importance of this development in a press release , stating: “MetaMask’s extensive user base and established reputation make it a vital gateway to decentralized applications.” From MetaMask’s perspective, this move is just as strategic. Angel Gonzalez-Capizzi, Director of Business Development at MetaMask, explained: “With TRON’s strong presence in Asia, this integration also helps us build bridges across regions and ecosystems, expanding access for MetaMask users around the world. Supporting networks like TRON is part of our broader mission to make MetaMask the most versatile and user-friendly gateway to Web3.” This collaboration comes at a time of growing corporate interest in TRON. In June, SRM Entertainment announced it would rebrand as Tron Inc. and adopt a treasury strategy centered on TRX, with founder Justin Sun serving as an adviser. Such moves demonstrate how the network is expanding beyond just blockchain enthusiasts, entering mainstream corporate and institutional adoption. With legal clarity in the US and increasing global adoption, the project is positioning itself as a serious player in Web3 infrastructure. The MetaMask integration, combined with corporate treasury strategies like SRM’s, reflects the growing confidence in its long-term role as a global financial and technological network. TRX Consolidates With Strength TRON (TRX) has shown a sustained uptrend, with the chart reflecting sustained bullish momentum over the past months. Currently, TRX is trading around $0.35, holding firmly above key moving averages that continue to trend upward. The 50-day SMA sits near $0.28, while the 100-day SMA is at $0.25, and the 200-day SMA at $0.19 — all significantly below current price levels, reinforcing a solid bullish structure. Consistent higher highs and higher lows have supported this multi-month rally, a clear sign of market strength. TRX recently tested the $0.36–$0.37 zone but faced resistance, prompting a slight pullback. However, the retracement remains shallow, indicating buyers are still active and defending support zones effectively. The volume profile shows steady inflows during rallies, signaling sustained investor interest. As long as TRX remains above $0.33–$0.34, the bullish structure is intact, with potential to retest the $0.40 level in the short term. A breakout above this resistance could open the path toward $0.45, aligning with the next liquidity cluster.

So is crypto. And guess what? They’re heading in the same direction — together. More players are betting with Bitcoin. More casinos are accepting it. And behind the scenes? Affiliate marketers are making it all happen. They’re the ones connecting crypto players with crypto-friendly casinos. If you're an affiliate and you’re not paying attention to this shift — you might already be late to the party. Why Crypto Is Showing Up in iGaming No one loves waiting days for payouts or dealing with tricky banking rules. Crypto skips all that. It’s quick, borderless, and you don’t need a credit card to play. That’s why more online casinos are now offering deposits and withdrawals in coins like BTC , ETH, and USDT. For players, it feels smoother. For casinos, it brings in a new crowd. And the smartest ones are already working with an iGaming affiliate partner that actually gets the crypto game. This approach opens up a fresh way to earn by promoting platforms that crypto users actually want to play on. What’s Changing for Affiliate Marketers Everything’s speeding up. Players are smarter, pickier, and way more global. They’re not just looking for flashy slots or big bonuses anymore. They want fast payments, better privacy, and casinos that feel modern — not stuck in 2013. That means affiliate marketers need to keep up. You need to know who you’re talking to, speak their style, and work with casino brands that actually bring something extra to the table – not just the usual stuff everyone’s offering. Crypto-friendly platforms give you that edge — and crypto-friendly players know the difference. Why Crypto Payments Make Affiliate Life Easier Traditional payouts can be a headache. You wait. You email support. You wait some more. But crypto? You get your commission, and a few moments later it’s in your wallet. Payments are fast. No bank delays. No hidden fees. And it doesn’t matter if you live in the UK, Brazil, or the middle of nowhere — crypto moves the same for everyone. That kind of speed and freedom helps affiliates run smoother, scale faster, and focus on what actually matters: getting more traffic and making more deals. How Crypto Is Changing the Game Things are moving fast in this space — here’s what’s standing out right now: Instant Payouts: No more waiting days or dealing with banking hours. You earn, you get paid, simple. Global Reach: Crypto works everywhere. That means you can promote offers to players from anywhere, not just the “easy” markets. Better Tracking (Coming Soon): Some platforms are starting to explore blockchain-based tracking, which could mean more accurate commissions and fewer disputes. Player Trust: Crypto players care about privacy and control. Promote brands that respect that, and you’ll build long-term loyalty. Lower Costs: No banking fees, no currency conversions — just cleaner profits. The Crypto Crowd Fits Right In Let’s be real — crypto users already think like gamblers. They’re used to taking risks. They follow fast markets. And they want freedom over their money. That’s why they’re such a great fit for iGaming. They don’t need long explanations on how to set up a wallet. They already know how to move coins and keep things anonymous. If you're promoting to this audience, you’ve got a big advantage — as long as you're pointing them to the right platforms. Don’t give them slow sites or limited payment options. They’ll bounce fast. Crypto users expect better. Pick the Right Affiliate Partner. Or Get Left Behind. Not every affiliate program understands crypto. Some are still stuck with only bank wires and slow dashboards. That’s fine if you enjoy waiting. But if you want to grow in 2025, you need a partner that’s built for this new wave of players. Look for fast payouts, crypto options, helpful support, and clear tracking. If a platform doesn’t offer those things — keep looking. There are better ones out there. And the difference shows up in your earnings, your conversions, and your stress levels.

They have a huge chance to grow — if they’re willing to move with the market. Now’s the time to jump in. Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been in the iGaming game for years, adding crypto to your plan gives you a big boost — more ways to grow, more people to reach, and way more doors to open.

Crypto Groups Unite to Back Quintenz Nomination Signed by the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI), Blockchain Association, Decentralization Research Center, DeFi Education Fund, The Digital Chamber, Satoshi Action Fund, and the Solana Policy Institute, the August 20 letter pushes for Quintenz’s “prompt confirmation” to help “ensure a golden age for digital assets in America.” It is my great honor to be nominated by President @realDonaldTrump as the next Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where I had served as a Commissioner in his last administration. The @CFTC plays a critical role in maintaining robust hedging and price discovery… — Brian Quintenz (@BrianQuintenz) February 12, 2025 “We are united in our conviction that Mr. Quintenz is uniquely prepared to serve as Chairman of the CFTC at this defining moment for America’s financial markets and digital asset future,” the organizations state. “The U.S. digital asset industry and the CFTC are at a pivotal crossroads in terms of advancing fit-for-purpose regulations that will promote responsible innovation, protect market integrity, and ensure U.S. economic dynamism and global competitiveness.” “Mr. Quintenz’s extensive experience and substantive and technical understanding of blockchains, digital assets, and financial markets make him exceptionally well-suited to lead the CFTC at this critical juncture,” the letter continues. Senate Delays Heighten Uncertainty Around CFTC Pick The news of the letter comes amid growing speculation in the crypto com munity over the delay in Quintenz’s CFTC confirmation, despite Trump having tapped the financial manager in February. Late last month , Politico reported that Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss urged Trump to reject Quintenz as CFTC chairman nominee despite the former praising the president’s decision earlier this year. “Congratulations Brian,” Tyler said in a February X post. “Well deserved. Great choice for crypto and for America.” A Senate Agriculture Committee vote on Quintenz’s nomination was canned twice in July, leading to increased concern over the policy adviser’s potential role in government .

The prediction is notable because Armstrong rarely offers public price targets. He isn’t alone in expecting such a surge. Jack Dorsey, who ran X (formerly Twitter) until 2021 and co-founded payments firm Block (formerly Square), has also said bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030 and likely move higher beyond that milestone. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest revised its long-term outlook last month, raising its decade-end projection to as high as $3.8 million , citing increased institutional adoption as the main driver. The optimism comes at a time when bitcoin has been setting records. The token is trading at $114,383, up 22% this year, after touching a new all-time high above $124,000 last week. The rally has strengthened arguments that bitcoin is consolidating its role as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Some investors see major moves happening sooner. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, said on CNBC on Aug. 19 that bitcoin could climb to between $180,000 and $200,000 within the next five months, adding that even that outlook may prove conservative.",Markets|Brian Armstrong|Cathie Wood|Bitcoin|Coinbase|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-20 21:28:00

According to Adler, the pullback experienced by the market is still limited and important support levels are maintained. Adler noted that Bitcoin has only retreated 8% from its local peak, noting that medium-term support lies at the 111-day moving average ($109.6,000) and the realized price for short-term investors ($106.8,000). He explained that these points constitute a high-demand zone between $107,000 and $110,000, arguing that this range is a critical area where price stability can occur and impulse buying can occur.

And as money begins to rotate from ETH into high-upside memecoins, Pepeto (PEPETO) is emerging as the best crypto to buy in this next leg. Ethereum price prediction: the 3-step setup pointing to $5K The idea is simple and it’s playing out on weekly candles. First you get the sharp drop and a clean base. Then a measured rally cools off and sets structure. Finally, the breakout leg stretches into new highs. That exact rhythm took ETH from sub-$200 to $4K+ last cycle. If the script repeats, $5,000 isn’t a stretch; from today’s levels, it’s roughly a mid-teens move that would still mark fresh highs and reignite risk across the board. SOURCES: Cryptodnes.bg / Cointelegraph.com / Binance.com Catalysts stacking in Ethereum’s favor Patterns need fuel, and Ethereum has it. The Pectra upgrade lines up meaningful improvements on both sides of the stack. EIP-7702 lets normal wallets act more like smart contracts (think sponsored gas and slicker UX), while EIP-7251 lifts validator limits from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH to streamline staking operations. Add the ETF angle, U.S. issuers pushing to include staking in spot ETH ETFs, and you’ve got a powerful demand pipe. And since EIP-4844 slashed L2 costs, activity on rollups keeps grinding higher. Put together, those drivers give real backbone to a $5K Ethereum price prediction. SOURCES: Ledger.com / Kraken.com / Sygnum.com Where smart money rotates next: high-potential Memecoins on Ethereum When ETH firms up, capital hunts torque. In every cycle, that rotation shows up first in the names with the tightest narratives and the cleanest access. This is where presales with real products, not just slogans, pull in whales. Which brings us to the presale that keeps landing on pro watchlists. Pepeto (PEPETO): an Ethereum memecoin with rails on day one In a market packed with hype-only memecoins, buying blind feels like a gamble, that not the case for PEPETO, here’s why: Pepeto (PEPETO) ships zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap, a native cross-chain bridge for smooth flow, and current staking rewards around 242% APY to keep holders engaged. Contracts are audited by SolidProof and Coinsult , the demo exchange is live, and the community has already topped 100,000 . The crypto presale sits at $0.000000148 , with $6.2M+ committed and Tier-1 listing chatter heating up, exactly the mix that turns attention into on-chain demand. JOIN PEPETO’S PRESALE NOW Why Pepeto stands out right now Plenty of tokens chase hype; Pepeto marries meme reach with real utility on Ethereum mainnet . That matters for liquidity, integrations, and listings. The tokenomics mirror proven playbooks (total supply 420T ; allocations for presale, liquidity, marketing, staking, and development) while the live tools: zero-fee DEX + native bridge , solve the fees and fragmentation that choke most meme trades. Whales are already positioning, and builder interest is strong, with hundreds of projects queued to list on PepetoSwap as it scales. The upside case in one line Close the gap to PEPE’s current zone (~$0.00001219) and Pepeto maps to about an 83× from this presale base, so a $10,000 entry here would sit near $800,000 at parity, with room to run as listings and usage compound. Disclaimer : To buy PEPETO, make sure to use the official website: https://pepeto.io/ As the listing draws closer, some are attempting to capitalize on the hype by using the name to mislead investors with fake platforms. Stay cautious and verify the source. Final takeaway: best crypto to buy now, ahead of the next leg Ethereum’s path to $5,000 is backed by upgrades, L2 growth, and the ETF narrative. The high-beta beneficiary with the cleanest setup is Pepeto (PEPETO) : zero-fee PepetoSwap, a native bridge, audited contracts, current 242% staking rewards , and a live demo, all at a $0.000000148 presale entry before the next stage lifts the floor. If you’re lining up the best memecoin to buy in an Ethereum-led run, this is the early window. Secure your allocation on Pepeto’s official site now, before the price steps up and the crowd follows.

U.S. District Judge Jennifer L. Rochon froze $57.6 million worth of USDC in June as part of a case in which the plaintiffs are seeking over $100 million in damages. Why did the judge lift the freeze requirement? The frozen assets were in two wallets controlled by defendants Hayden Davis, CEO of venture capital firm Kelsier Labs LLC, and Ben Chow, founder of decentralized exchange Meteora. Rochon claims both of them have been compliant with the court proceedings so far. That compliance is ultimately why she decided to lift the freeze requirement on the $57.6 million worth of USDC on Tuesday. However, as she did so, she also expressed skepticism about the likelihood of the plaintiffs, who are represented by Burwick Law , succeeding in their case even though it is still in an early phase. The plaintiffs claim that Davis and Chow misled investors by promoting the Libra Solana meme coin (LIBRA) with the social media post from President Milei in a bid to make the token look legit. Chow’s lawyer, Samson Enzer of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, has denied the plaintiffs’ claims, tagging them “untested and meritless.” Hayden Davis and Ben Chow are trying to clear their names The legal battle is unfolding months after the scandal of the LIBRA token, which surged to a $1.17 billion market capitalization before crashing down 97% to $33 million within 24 hours. Upon launch, LIBRA was touted by Argentine President Javier Milei as a funding tool for small businesses in the South American country, encouraging many traders to ape in. There was little reason to believe it was a scam, as around that time, the Central African Republic launched a national meme coin, and the President of the United States created his own official meme coin. Unfortunately, the story they sold was a lie as Libra wasn’t the official token of Argentina, and allegations of insider trading started to circulate, prompting Milei to delete his post, and it all went downhill from there. Davis attempted some damage control, even going on a media campaign to explain what had happened. It was a mistake as he soon became the face of the Libra scandal, with many investors pointing fingers at him for the collapse. Davis presented himself as President Milei’s advisor, claiming his role with Libra was to act as a custodian of the associated funds—a role that left him bag holding $100 million. Chow of Meteora was implicated because he referred a “handful” of projects to Davis’ Kelsier Labs, including First Lady Melania Trump’s official meme coin. Meteora’s infrastructure was also used to launch Libra. The scandal led to Chow’s exit from Meteora. Six months later, both are still trying to clear their names. While they do that, Milei continues to distance himself from the scandal. In May, Milei dissolved a task force investigating his role in the controversial Libra meme coin launch. According to documents published on the government’s website, the task force completed its investigation even though it did not reveal the details of its findings to the public.

Live Crypto Crime Detection It’s designed to prevent illicit assets from leaving the blockchain and was developed in collaboration with law enforcement, stablecoin issuers, exchanges, and various other firms . Some of the founding members include Ripple, Binance, Stripe, Anchorage Digital, Zodia Custody, PayPal, Robinhood, and many others, forming a groundbreaking alliance between traditional institutions and cryptocurrency companies. Leading federal law enforcement agencies worldwide are actively participating in the network, triggering alerts and flagging critical threat-linked addresses to prevent criminals from off-ramping their ill-gotten gains. Various security researchers and firms, including ZachXBT, zeroShadow, CryptoForensics Investigators, and Hypernative, among others, provide continuous threat monitoring. According to data from TRM Labs, at least $47 billion in cryptocurrency assets has been sent to addresses associated with fraudulent activities since 2023. However, that number is likely to be much higher, as most victims of this type of crime either do not report it, as they do not know how, or are simply ashamed that it has happened to them. Moreover, the year so far has seen over $2 billion of crypto funds stolen from their rightful owners. This constant wave of hacks, scams, and other illicit activities continues to drain billions from individuals, from everyday investors to well-established and secure organizations. In many cases, the stolen capital is quickly funneled and converted to fiat before the law can take action. A prime example is the disastrous $1.5 billion Bybit hack that occurred in February of this year, with the bad actors performing over 10.000 transactions in the month following the attack, provoking the urgent need for faster responses and detection across the crypto ecosystem. How Will It Operate? Until today, law enforcement and crypto platforms have been slow to react to crimes, which often occur after the funds have already been stolen. Given that transaction processing times on the blockchain are typically rapid in most scenarios, the response time should be measured in minutes, rather than days. The Beacon Network is primed and ready to tackle the rising wave of crypto criminals by providing several key functions: Flagging and propagation: Investigators flag addresses linked to crime, and the network automatically labels the wallets linked to them Real-time alerts: These are triggered when tagged funds arrive at a participating exchange or platform Rapid response: Crypto platforms will have the ability to hold flagged deposits before they are withdrawn, effectively stopping the criminals in their tracks Accessible by design: Affiliate membership is of no cost to law enforcement partners and verified exchanges. “As the crypto industry continues to evolve at a rapid pace, threats such as hacking and money laundering have become increasingly sophisticated, intelligent, complex, and fast-moving. It is no longer feasible for any single team to fight these crimes effectively — we must unite as an industry to build coordinated defenses and responses, and Beacon Network helps us do just that.” – Heisen Guo, Chief Security Officer at HTX The post Ripple, Binance Behind TRM Labs’ Real-Time Crypto Crime Response Network appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Crypto Crime,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-08-20 21:51:13

It has dropped nearly 9% over the past week, with traders bracing for a potential retest of the $4,100 level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Takes Major Step With Community Governance Model — Details Data from CoinGlass shows that more than $178 million in positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with ETH long traders suffering the biggest blow, over $127 million wiped out. A notable case saw one Hyperliquid trader lose nearly $6.2 million after re-entering ETH longs too aggressively, turning months of gains into heavy losses within just two days. This volatility comes as Ethereum’s exit queue for staking withdrawals has surged to 910,461 ETH, worth about $3.91 billion, signaling an upcoming wave of supply that could pressure prices further. ETH's price losing momentum on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Institutional Investors Step in Despite Market Jitters Despite retail pain, large institutional players appear to be buying the dip. Bitmine Immersion, the biggest publicly traded ETH holder, recently added 52,475 ETH, bringing its holdings to nearly $6.6 billion. SharpLink followed suit, purchasing 143,593 ETH at $4,648, though its position is now underwater. Blockchain trackers also flagged new inflows from FalconX-linked wallets worth over $38 million. This suggests that while short-term sentiment remains shaky, big-money investors continue to accumulate ETH, betting on its long-term value. Ethereum (ETH) Analysts Warn of Deeper Losses Before Recovery Market experts caution that Ethereum may remain under pressure as macroeconomic uncertainty looms ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole meeting. Pessimistic tone from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could trigger further risk-off sentiment across crypto and equities. On-chain activity has also weakened. Active Ethereum addresses have dropped nearly 28% in August, signaling waning retail participation. Network growth has slowed as well, raising questions about near-term demand. Still, analysts see long-term upside once the market absorbs the $4B staking unlock. Some forecasts remain bullish, with Ethereum projected to reach between $6,000–$8,000 by year-end if institutional flows persist.

The move lifted its total to 629,376 BTC, a holding worth about $46.15 billion at current prices. The company reports an average buy price of $73,320 per Bitcoin and says its crypto holdings are up 25% so far this year. Short and clear: the numbers are huge. Longer view: the scale of the bet helps explain why every tweak to policy now matters to both investors and critics. Equity Guidance And mNAV Rules According to reports, Strategy will use a measure called mNAV — market net asset value — to decide when to issue stock, buy Bitcoin or take other steps. If MSTR trades above four times mNAV, the firm will sell new shares aggressively to buy more Bitcoin. If the stock sits between two-and-a-half and four times mNAV , the company will still issue shares but only when it sees a good opportunity. Once the multiple falls below two-and-a-half, Strategy says it could sell shares to cover debt interest, pay preferred equity dividends and meet other needs. Reports add that if shares ever fall under 1x mNAV, the company could borrow money to buy back its stock. For scale: at 4x mNAV the implied price would be about $1,000, at 2.5x roughly $600 and at 1.0x roughly $210. Today the stock trades near $344, carrying an mNAV of about 1.58x. potential spiral of doom looming for @MicroStrategy : – sell $MSTR shares to service debt– dilute shareholders further each time– shares become worth less– interest payments mount– $MSTR sell its bitcoin to pay interest how do you think this ends? https://t.co/BfMPH4JHfo — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) August 19, 2025 Experts Warn Of A Downward Spiral According to Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, the plan risks trapping the company in a “spiral of doom.” He warns that repeated share issuance dilutes existing holders. That can push the share price down. Lower stock then forces more stock sales to raise cash. Over time, this cycle can accelerate. It is a simple math problem that becomes painful when markets wobble. Reports suggest this is the core fear among many independent analysts. How Share Dilution Could Escalate Strategy’s balance sheet moves are paired with a core bet: keep adding Bitcoin and hold it. The firm’s 629,376 BTC is the largest corporate reserve anywhere, and that scale gives the company credibility when prices rise. Yet buying more by issuing stock ties the treasury to the share market. According to the update, the company’s average buy price of $73,320 still leaves room for gains, but the link between stock issuance and Bitcoin buying raises a structural issue. If earnings, interest costs or investor sentiment shift, the math could flip fast.

Dogecoin is flashing bullish momentum, with a clear bull flag pattern suggesting a potential breakout toward $0.35. Participation is increasing, reinforcing the possibility of price action. Chainlink is also gaining traction, supported by its $60B DeFi footprint and expanding integrations. Analysts highlight a third-wave Elliott rally that could drive LINK toward the $30 level, positioning it as a major player in the next growth cycle. Even so, the spotlight is shifting to Cold Wallet ($CWT). Stage 17 of its presale is priced at $0.00998, with more than $6.3M raised and 745M tokens already sold. Backed by the $270M Plus Wallet acquisition, Cold Wallet enters with over 2M ready users and a cashback model that delivers utility from day one. Early Stage 1 buyers at $0.007 are already looking at a projected 3,400% ROI window. Dogecoin Eyes $0.35 as Bull Flag Breakout Gains Strength Dogecoin is displaying strong bullish signals after forming a clear bull flag pattern alongside a double bottom structure. These technical indicators suggest momentum could drive the price toward the $0.35 target, putting key resistance zones back within reach. The recent breakout above a long-standing downtrend, which has since been retested as support, adds further conviction to the setup. Institutional accumulation is also rising, providing a solid base for continued interest and sustained price movement. Analysts highlight support between $0.23 and $0.24 as a crucial level that could serve as a launchpad for another wave of upward momentum. Chainlink Builds Toward $30 With $60B DeFi Milestone Chainlink is gaining traction as its total value secured in DeFi climbs to an impressive $60 billion, reflecting its growing role in decentralized data services. Technical indicators align with the third phase of an Elliott Wave pattern, typically the most powerful rally stage, which could send LINK toward last year’s peak near $30. Momentum is further supported by a breakout from a double bottom reversal and a rising futures open interest above $1.4 billion. While a move below $17.90 would weaken this outlook, LINK’s expanding integrations and resilient chart structure keep it firmly positioned as a standout breakout candidate. Cold Wallet’s $6.3M Presale Surges as Sub-Cent Pricing Nears Its End Cold Wallet’s presale is moving with unusual speed, already surpassing $6.3M raised and 745M tokens sold at Stage 17 pricing of $0.00998. Most projects tend to slow once they cross the $5M milestone, yet Cold Wallet has accelerated, showing signs that large buyers are joining retail demand. At this level, the entry feels like a seed round, but unlike typical early-stage projects, it comes with an adoption base of more than 2M users secured through the $270M Plus Wallet acquisition. This surge points to a crypto presale that may not move neatly from stage to stage. Instead, demand could wipe out multiple brackets in quick succession, leaving new buyers forced to enter at higher valuations. The confirmed $0.3517 listing underscores the potential for early participants, with Stage 1 buyers at $0.007 already staring at returns that exceed 3,400% on paper. What sets Cold Wallet apart is its built-in cashback system that refunds gas, swap, and bridge fees directly in CWT. This creates ongoing value for holders and embeds utility into everyday transactions, ensuring adoption grows from the first day of launch. The model makes CWT more than a speculative play, positioning it as a lasting infrastructure asset. For those evaluating entry points, the urgency is clear. The sub-cent pricing at Stage 17 is on the verge of closing, and once it does, higher brackets will compress the ROI gap quickly. Momentum like this rarely lingers, and hesitation could translate into paying significantly more for the same exposure within just a few weeks. Looking Forward Dogecoin may offer short-term moves through pattern-based setups, and Chainlink continues to grow through its expanding ecosystem, yet Cold Wallet is advancing on a far stronger path. Stage 17 pricing remains under one cent but is closing quickly as more capital flows in, a signal that larger players are moving early. What makes Cold Wallet stand apart is its cashback model that monetizes everyday usage and its built-in base of over 2M users through the Plus Wallet acquisition. With a confirmed $0.3517 listing ahead, early Stage 1 entries at $0.007 already reflect a 3,400% ROI, making this one of 2025’s defining infrastructure plays.

From early-stage contenders to established names, the search for the best cryptos to buy is shaping the way traders and holders plan their next moves. The spotlight is now on four projects that stand out for both momentum and long-term potential. BlockDAG is capturing attention with its presale success. Solana is strengthening its market position with impressive technicals. Bittensor is building its name on the back of the AI trend, while Arbitrum is rising fast in the Layer-2 conversation. What makes this moment so compelling is not just price movement but also the real-world progress being delivered. These names represent very different strengths, but together they highlight how diverse the landscape is becoming. For anyone looking ahead, the best cryptos to buy are already taking shape across innovation, adoption, and utility. 1. BlockDAG: A Presale Powerhouse With Growing Strength BlockDAG has emerged as one of the clearest names to watch among the best cryptos to buy this year. Now in Batch 29 of its presale, priced at $0.0276, the project has already raised more than $376.5 million. Over 25.2 billion coins have been sold, and buyers from the very first batch are sitting on gains of 2,660 percent compared to the current batch price. Hardware adoption has been another big factor, with more than 19,300 miners sold, bringing in over $7.8 million on its own. The technology backing BlockDAG (BDAG) is a hybrid DAG plus Proof-of-Work model. This design allows fast, scalable transactions while staying secure and decentralized. It is not just the architecture driving growth; the developer ecosystem is already active, with more than 2.5 million users on the X1 mobile mining app. Every batch pushes the price higher, tightening the window for low-cost entry, and with a $600 million target halfway met, momentum is building quickly. Market watchers point to the possibility of BlockDAG reaching $1 after launch. At that level, current participants could see a 36x return. 2. Solana: Aiming Beyond Previous Highs Solana continues to hold its ground as one of the best cryptos to buy, thanks to its impressive run over the past week. It has posted gains of nearly 23 percent in seven days, with 14 percent added in just 24 hours. Trading between $192 and $199, and carrying a market capitalization of $106 billion, it is once again pressing through key resistance levels. Volume has surged to $12 billion daily, showing strong demand supported by DeFi and NFT activity on the chain. Technical indicators point toward the potential of breaking out beyond $185 and making a run at the $300 mark. Developer engagement remains consistent, which adds strength to the fundamentals and long-term growth story. For traders looking for large-cap options that combine speed with scalability, Solana is still one of the leading names to keep in view. 3. Bittensor: Riding the AI Wave Bittensor has secured its spot on the list of best cryptos to buy by linking blockchain with artificial intelligence. Its TAO coin trades close to $394 with a market capitalization of $3.78 billion. Gains of 15 percent in the last week and 5.5 percent in the past 24 hours highlight its growing traction. The unique part of Bittensor is its decentralized machine learning network, which rewards participants for training AI models. This creates a real use case that connects two of the fastest-growing industries. High trading volumes and strong developer interest are giving TAO the momentum to stand out as a Layer-1 competitor in an already crowded market. With AI integration still in its early stages, Bittensor’s model is positioned well for the next wave of growth. Its role in merging Web3 with AI has made it a strong candidate for long-term attention. 4. Arbitrum: Gaining Ground in Layer-2 Arbitrum has been proving its weight with one of the sharpest weekly rallies, up 41 percent in just seven days. Priced near $0.52, with daily volume doubling to $843 million, the project is gaining strong traction. A large part of this surge came from speculation around stablecoins tied to the PayPal ecosystem, but the fundamentals are also supportive. The total value locked remains close to $3 billion, showing that on-chain activity is strong. Analysts are targeting a range between $0.50 and $0.55 as near-term objectives, but higher gains remain possible if liquidity stays consistent. As Ethereum continues its push for scalability, Layer-2 networks are becoming a central piece of the puzzle. With low fees, speed, and a growing ecosystem, Arbitrum is building its case as one of the best cryptos to buy in the scaling sector. Closing Thoughts The digital asset market is in a period where technology and adoption matter as much as price action. The best cryptos to buy are no longer just speculative names; they are projects building real infrastructure. BlockDAG is showing what momentum looks like with its presale, Solana is pushing toward new highs, Bittensor is fusing AI with blockchain, and Arbitrum is capturing market share in the Layer-2 race. For anyone seeking opportunities in 2025, these projects highlight how the market is diversifying across use cases and narratives. Each one reflects a different path toward growth, and together they underline how quickly this cycle could shape up to be one of the most important yet.
