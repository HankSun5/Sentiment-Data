50357095,https://cryptonews.com/?p=411008,1755643320,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50357095.jpeg,$OKB Jumps Over 6% After 65M Token Burn and ‘X Layer’ Launch,https://cryptonews.com/news/okb-soars-177-after-65m-token-burn-and-x-layer-launch/,"$OKB has continued its bullish run, rising 6% this week to surpass $127 in a historic rally that’s left traders stunned. This isn’t just another pump—we’re witnessing one of crypto’s most dramatic supply shocks unfold in real time. This rally is a direct result of the protocol’s measures and major platform upgrades that have fundamentally transformed the token’s value proposition. The real question isn’t just what drove the explosion but whether $OKB can maintain this new altitude. How a Historic Token Burn and L2 Announcement Ignited $OKB Rally The OKB token, with a market capitalization of approximately $2.66 billion, was designed as the core utility token for the OKX ecosystem. Its value is derived from providing holders with benefits, including trading fee discounts, staking rewards, and governance rights. August has been a productive month for the token and its native platform. Earlier this month, $OKB saw its role evolve beyond exchange perks to now function as the native gas token for X Layer, OKX’s zkEVM-powered Ethereum Layer‑2 , delivering around 5,000 TPS, near-zero fees, and full Ethereum compatibility. Thereafter, the exchange executed a major token burn , permanently removing approximately 65.26 million OKB from its reserves, removing them from circulation. This event formally established a hard, immutable supply cap of 21 million tokens. OKX announced a strategic upgrade to X Layer and will permanently burn 65,256,712.097 OKB from historical buybacks and reserves. The OKB smart contract will be upgraded to remove minting and manual burns, fixing total supply at 21 million. OKTChain will be phased out, with OKT… pic.twitter.com/HM4dcXLcdU — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 13, 2025 A subsequent smart contract upgrade disabled any future minting or burning capabilities, cementing the token’s scarcity model. These changes spurred a surge of 160–170%, with OKB briefly reaching highs above $130. According to Etherscan, the on-chain ecosystem has roughly 17,900 holders , with the top 10 addresses controlling about 67% of the supply. Additionally, OKX began phasing out OKTChain, stopping OKT trading as of August 13, initiating automatic conversions of OKT to OKB based on the July 13–August 12 average price, and planning full decommissioning by January 1, 2026. OKB Faces Rejection at $130, Consolidates Above High-Volume Support Following the price rally, $OKB is now consolidating. This pause is important as it helps the market absorb its new price level and build a stronger base for its next potential move. After setting a historic high last week, the $OKB token encountered firm resistance near $130. Observing the order flow dynamics and volume activity, one could see the clear shift, particularly visible on the 1-hour chart. Buy-side interest was initially strong, as reflected in several large footprint clusters just above $126. One of the breakout candles showed over 100K in total volume, though it closed with a negative delta of -21.41K, indicating that profit-taking emerged to meet the buying pressure at this new high. Prior to that, volume bars leading up to the rejection were also filled with aggressive buying, but began showing signs of exhaustion as selling pressure absorbed the momentum. The delta footprint steadily tilted red, confirming that a period of consolidation had begun. While OKB briefly lost its upward momentum after pushing into the $128–$130 region, the broader market structure still leans bullish. The rejection from the top of the breakout range has so far led to a measured pullback, not a collapse. The asset’s price continues to trade above all major moving averages on the 1-hour chart, including the 20, 50, and 100-period SMAs, which continue to trend upward. The 20-SMA near $122 is particularly key, as it now aligns with the high-volume support area where recent consolidations have taken place. At press time, OKB is holding just above the $123 mark, hovering near the upper boundary of a high-volume liquidity band centered around $120–$122. This area has repeatedly absorbed selling pressure in recent sessions, suggesting that it remains a key battleground between buyers and sellers. Yet price action alone won’t be enough going forward. To regain directional control, bulls must show renewed initiative, ideally marked by a pick-up in aggressive buying and a shift in cumulative delta favoring demand. Given the powerful fundamental tailwinds from the token burn and X Layer launch, this key support zone is likely to be fiercely defended by long-term believers.

Among the hardest-hit names was Galaxy Digital, the crypto financial services firm that cratered by 10%. Coinbase, now part of the S&P 500, gave up over 5%, while eToro fell even further, sliding more than 6%. Other platforms like Robinhood and Bullish were also dragged down, both dropping above 6%. The risk-off mood didn’t spare the newer corners of the crypto industry either. Treasury-focused crypto firms get hammered Inside the growing niche of crypto treasury operations, red flashed across the board. Strategy, a firm that’s been rising fast in the background, tumbled 7%. SharpLink Gaming, which blends crypto tools with the online sports world, lost 8%. Bitmine Immersion, tied to mining infrastructure, sank 9%. But DeFi Development took the crown for biggest loser of the day, sliding a brutal 13%. Stablecoins, often considered the calmer end of the crypto space, didn’t escape the damage. Circle, the issuer of USDC and one of the most closely watched firms in the space following its IPO, dropped 4.5%. That decline hit just days after Circle had basked in regulatory support under the GENIUS Act, which established new rules for stablecoins in the United States. The pain wasn’t limited to equities. Bitcoin fell nearly 3%, retreating to just over $113,000, while Ether shed more than 5%, falling back to around $4,100, based on data from Coin Metrics. That was a big change from last week, when Bitcoin touched an all-time intraday high near $125,000, driven by speculative enthusiasm. Powell uncertainty triggers tech retreat Tech names were broadly under pressure across Wall Street. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.46%, ending the session at 21,314.95. The S&P 500 slid 0.59% to 6,411.37. Nvidia lost 3.5%, while other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom were down 5.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Palantir, one of the top performing software names in the last quarter, plunged more than 9%, ending as the S&P’s worst performer of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average avoided the full bloodbath, adding a weak 10.45 points to finish at 44,922.27, but that move came thanks to a lift from Home Depot, which pushed the 30-stock index to a new intraday record during the session. At the heart of the chaos was rising caution ahead of Powell’s appearance at the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole summit. Traders were nervous, pulling out of growth names, and crypto, with its speculative nature, was an easy first exit. “With Powell speaking at Jackson Hole, we typically see profit-taking ahead of his remarks,” said Satraj Bambra, CEO of Rails, a hybrid crypto exchange. “Any time there’s communication uncertainty from the Fed, you can generally expect some profit-taking as traders de-risk their positions.” In the last few months, crypto stocks had benefited from a string of bullish headlines. Coinbase’s entry into the S&P 500 gave it institutional exposure. Circle’s IPO added legitimacy to stablecoins. The GENIUS Act, which became law, created new clarity around digital tokens. But the mood has changed in August, as investors brace for more clarity or confusion out of the Fed.

Why BlockDAG Is the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/over-376m-raised-why-blockdag-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-in-2025/,"In 2025’s blockchain space, BlockDAG has become the clear frontrunner. The presale has already secured over $376 million, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, positioning it well ahead of rivals. Its ambitious $600 million target, paired with a rapidly expanding ecosystem, is why many consider it the best crypto to buy right now. Unlike projects that lose steam after early hype, BlockDAG’s momentum is still climbing. Large investors continue to accelerate batch sales, bringing it past the halfway mark toward its funding goal. Its hybrid consensus model, combining Proof-of-Work with Directed Acyclic Graph technology, enables speeds of 10 blocks per second while keeping mining open to both hardware and mobile users. With over 200,000 holders, 19,000 ASIC miners sold, and 2.5 million X1 mobile miners, BlockDAG is showing real adoption before exchange listings—a rare achievement in presale history. Why Buying in Presale Is a Strategic Move Developer traction remains one of the strongest signals of a blockchain’s future, and BlockDAG is excelling here. More than 4,500 developers are building 300+ dApps on the network, aided by EVM compatibility that allows seamless migration of Ethereum projects. This pre-launch activity highlights strong confidence in the protocol and adds weight to why it’s seen as the best crypto to buy. For buyers, entry at $0.0276 in Batch 29 locks in immediate upside. The confirmed listing price of $0.05 guarantees an 81% gain, while analyst projections pointing to $1 post-listing imply a possible 36x return. The batch pricing model ensures early allocations remain fixed, shielding participants from sudden spikes as later buyers enter at higher rates. With momentum and developer commitment accelerating, BlockDAG offers both near-term ROI and long-term ecosystem value, making it a strategic presale entry. Early Access Products Driving FOMO BlockDAG isn’t just raising capital it’s rolling out products ahead of launch. The Demo Trading Dashboard simulates a live exchange, complete with instant execution and visible order books, introducing thousands to BDAG trading before listing. Alongside this, the X1 mobile miner allows users to mine BDAG directly from their phones, building an engaged user base. These utilities strengthen its case as the best crypto to buy for those seeking early adoption and real-world integration. With over half of its $600 million target reached, each sold-out batch pushes prices higher. Late-stage presales typically attract a surge of buyers chasing remaining allocations, but early participants secure lower entry points. By locking in now, buyers gain exposure to one of the few projects delivering adoption, developer activity, and mining infrastructure well before launch. Final Word BlockDAG’s mix of rapid adoption, developer engagement, and technical scalability sets it apart in 2025. With $376 million already raised and Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, it’s not just another presale it’s the best crypto to buy this year. For early movers, the potential is striking. A listing at $0.05 already provides strong upside, but forecasts of $1 hint at far greater gains. In a market filled with promises, BlockDAG stands out as one of the only projects delivering before listing. That’s why it continues to be recognized as the best crypto to buy in 2025’s presale landscape.

Still, rising spot trading volumes offer a glimmer of hope that BTC may now be entering an accumulation phase. Is Bitcoin In The Accumulation Phase? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Binance’s BTC spot trading volume surpassed $6 billion on August 18 – one of the most significant spikes this month. Taha noted that such sudden spikes typically signal increased participation from institutional investors and large traders, along with some retail activity looking to capitalize on heightened volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Below $115,000 As Binance Buying Power Ratio Collapses It’s worth noting that the surge in Binance spot volume coincided with BTC’s drop below $115,000 – a movement that can serve as a leading indicator of a potential reversal in price momentum. Historical data suggests that strong spot buying during price dips often reflects traders stepping in to accumulate BTC at discounted prices. This dynamic can ease selling pressure and lay the foundation for a rebound if demand persists. Taha also highlighted that the increase in Binance spot volume occurred alongside a decline in the Binance Whale-to-Exchange Flow, which fell from $6.4 billion to $5 billion – a $1.4 billion drop in whale transfers to Binance over the past week. This reduction in whale deposits suggests fewer large holders are sending BTC to exchanges for potential selling, a trend generally considered bullish. Taha concluded: Bringing these elements together – a surge in Binance spot volume, rising demand during a price dip, and a decline in whale deposits – the market is showing early signs of stabilization. If accumulation continues at current levels, Bitcoin has a solid chance to recover and retest higher resistance levels in the near term. From a technical perspective, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that BTC is still following its weekly trendline. If the trend holds, BTC could target $130,000 in the coming weeks. Warning Signs For September While Taha suggests BTC may currently be in an accumulation phase with the possibility of a trend reversal in the coming months, other analysts remain cautious. Crypto analyst Josh Olszewics warned that BTC must survive a “brutal September” before any meaningful rebound can occur in Q4 2025. Related Reading: Bearish Case For Bitcoin: Analyst Warns Macro Top Is In Similarly, CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest cautioned that the next 1–2 weeks may bring heightened selling pressure for the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

50360001,560075,1755644452,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50360001.jpeg,Dogecoin Comes Under Attack From Same Group That Orchestrated Monero’s 51% Takeover,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-comes-under-attack/,"The Qubic community is now targeting Dogecoin (DOGE) following its recent and controversial attack on Monero (XMR) . After executing a 51% takeover and claiming majority control over Monero’s hashrate, the group is now shifting focus toward the world’s largest meme coin, signaling what could become one of the most ambitious challenges yet against a major Proof of Work (PoW) network . Qubic Targets Dogecoin After Monero Domination The Dogecoin network has become the latest declared target of Qubic, the project that recently claimed to have orchestrated a successful 51% attack on Monero. Sergey Ivancheglo, known on X social media as ‘Come-from-Beyond’ and the founder of Qubic, confirmed the move after a community vote on Discord placed Dogecoin as the overwhelming choice over competitors such as Kaspa and Zcash. The decision underscores a significant escalation in Qubic’s ambitions, shifting focus from privacy-focused networks to one of the largest and most recognizable meme coins in existence. Qubic’s founder highlighted that the previous Monero operation served as a demonstration of what coordinated control over hashrate can achieve. By pooling resources, the project reportedly captured over 77.54% of Monero’s power, effectively proving that 51% attacks are not merely theoretical vulnerabilities but real threats that could paralyze entire ecosystems. Ivancheglo also described the attack as a wake-up call, claiming that it helped Monero developers accelerate their work on defensive measures. Notably, crypto analysts have voiced concern that Qubic’s current focus on Dogecoin could represent a new frontier in network dominance. The Qubic pool previously boasted 4.29 GH/s of computational power that crushed Monero’s defenses , but Dogecoin’s scale presents a much more formidable challenge. Still, community insiders are not backing down, with many supporting the founder’s plan to dominate Dogecoin. The Challenge Of Taking On Dogecoin’s Network While Monero fell victim to Qubic’s calculated push, Dogecoin’s defense rests on an entirely different foundation. A Qubic Ambassador identified as the ‘QubicChurch’ on X explains that, unlike Monero’s CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant RandomX algorithm, Dogecoin relies on the Scrypt algorithm and is merge-mined with Litecoin. This means that the majority of Litecoin’s massive mining infrastructure also secures Dogecoin, creating a combined shield of unprecedented scale. As of August 18, 2025, Dogecoin’s hashrate stands at roughly 3.47 PH/s, while Litecoin adds 2.78 PH/s. Together, their combined network strength dwarfs Monero by over a million times. The Qubic Ambassador acknowledged this staggering gap, pointing out that preparation for such an attack on Dogecoin would require months of development. Notably, the scale difference between Monero and Dogecoin also redefines the potential outcome. The QubicChurch noted that if the project were to capture even 0.1% of the Dogecoin-Litecoin network , it would represent more computational power than the entire Monero network by a factor of over a thousand. At 1%, the leverage becomes astronomical, exceeding Monero’s power more than eleven thousand times over. For Qubic, such control would not only serve as proof of dominance but could also funnel massive cash flows into its ecosystem.",Dogecoin|asic|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin-Litecoin Network|dogeusd|dogeusdt|litecoin|monero|Qubic|QubicChurch|Sergey Ivancheglo,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|XMR|LTC|MINING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-19 23:00:52

Projects like Worldcoin and Pi Network are attracting attention through price setups and user growth, yet their value still depends heavily on what may come next. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) takes a different approach by proving its utility during the presale itself. Users can already access the app, carry out transactions, and receive USDT rewards, experiencing features that most projects only reveal after launch. This immediate usability, combined with early-stage availability, makes Cold Wallet stand out. It offers credibility and traction now, while others are still building anticipation. Worldcoin’s Triangle Setup Signals Imminent Breakout Worldcoin is tightening within a symmetrical triangle, with its price repeatedly testing support and resistance. This technical formation is known to precede sharp moves, and traders are now eyeing $2.70 as a key upside target. The recent bounce from lower support reflects strong buying pressure, adding weight to the bullish case. As the range compresses, volatility is likely to return with force. A confirmed push above the upper trendline on high volume could trigger rapid gains. The setup suggests Worldcoin may not remain at current levels for long once momentum builds. Pi Network Advances as Unlock Approaches Pi Network is preparing for a 276 million token unlock, equal to 3.5% of its circulating supply. Instead of sparking caution, this event is driving attention as more than 13 million users have migrated to the Open Mainnet. The Pi network price has already risen 10%, signaling that confidence is outpacing concerns. Behind the move is a surge in real network activity, with more nodes going live and user participation expanding daily. This growth is unfolding even before major exchange listings, pointing to a foundation being built in real time as momentum steadily accelerates. Cold Wallet Redefines Presale Standards With Live Utility Cold Wallet is challenging traditional crypto norms by delivering a fully functional product while its token is still in presale. Instead of waiting for a post-launch release, users can already download the wallet, execute transactions, and receive cashback rewards in USDT. This approach offers a level of utility that is rarely available at such an early stage. What makes this launch notable is the transparency and credibility it provides. Many projects raise funds with promises of future development, leaving users waiting months or even years to see results. Cold Wallet has reversed that trend by creating immediate value. The ability to interact with a working product before the token goes live adds a crucial layer of trust. This dual-track model of live functionality and presale participation positions Cold Wallet as a project with both vision and delivery. By letting users test and benefit from real features while the presale continues, it bridges the gap between early adoption and long-term engagement. This creates a stronger relationship between the platform and its community. Currently in Stage 17, Cold Wallet has raised more than $6.3 million, selling over 737 million tokens for $0.00998. With a listing price of $0.3517, the project presents a compelling case for those seeking the next top crypto to buy, combining proven utility with strong upside potential. Quick Rundown Early-access opportunities hold weight only when backed by real proof. While projects like Worldcoin and Pi Network are building anticipation through technical setups and growing communities, Cold Wallet delivers something more tangible. It is not just preparing for adoption; it is already active and rewarding users. With live transactions, cashback in USDT, and a functioning app available during presale, Cold Wallet blends usability with early pricing access. This ability to engage before listing creates a rare edge, making it a stronger choice for those who value trust and utility from the start.

Pepeto, Little Pepe or Bitcoin Hyper",https://timestabloid.com/which-one-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-and-the-next-shiba-pepeto/,"Looking for the best crypto to buy now as markets base and money rotates into presales? Memecoins are back on desks, and three live tickets keep popping up on scanners: Pepeto (PEPETO), Little Pepe, and Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER). Each is drawing fast community flow, pulling in fresh wallets, and grabbing headlines as traders try to lock early entries ahead of Tier-1 listings and deeper liquidity. This review stacks them on momentum, brand strength, tokenomics, and near-term catalysts so you can spot the best memecoin presale for outsized upside. If you want a clean read on which name screens best for risk-reward today, from presale pricing to adoption potential, does Pepeto, Little Pepe, or Bitcoin Hyper deserve your first allocation? Pepeto (PEPETO): Memecoin With Live Utility and Brand Muscle Pepeto (PEPETO), riffs on the PEPE meme by adding “T O” to the familiar P-E-P-E, turning viral recognition into a distinct identity of its own. Under the meme is value: zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap, a native cross-chain bridge, and current staking rewards around 242% APY. The presale is live at $0.000000147 with $6.2M+ raised, the code is audited by SolidProof and Coinsult, and the community has topped 100,000. A demo exchange is already up, supply is 420T like PEPE, and Tier-1 listing chatter is building as whales take early tranches. For anyone screening the best crypto to buy now and invest in, Pepeto pairs brand pull with working toolspositioning the token for real usage and stronger tokenomics into listings. JOIN PEPETO’S PRESALE NOW Little Pepe: Layer-2 Meme Play With Community Heat Little Pepe is gathering pace in the meme lane, leaning on the Pepe the Frog story and a busy social crowd. Its appeal is community energy, buzz that can drive liquidity and trigger sharp bursts. But it lacks the unique, durable utility Pepeto ships on Ethereum mainnet, so Little Pepe suits traders who want to bet on memecoin hype rather than build a long-term position. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): ZK Rollups on BTC, With Adoption Questions Hyper Bitcoin (HYPER) pitches a Bitcoin Layer-2 using ZK-rollups and the Solana Virtual Machine to bring fast transactions and smart contracts to BTC. A canonical bridge lets users wrap BTC onto the Hyper chain to stake, trade, and use low-fee dApps, though many analysts still doubt a Bitcoin L2 will gain broad, real-world adoption this cycle. Verdict: Today’s Best Buy in This Presale Trio Pepeto (PEPETO) checks the boxes as the cleaner, smarter pick right now, and the one best placed to chase the next 100x and SHIBA like memecoin. It sits on Ethereum with a sharp meme brand, real rails that move volume, zero-fee swaps on PepetoSwap, a native cross-chain bridge, current staking rewards near 242% APY, plus a live demo; more than $6.2M is in and the community already exceeds 100,000. Little Pepe leans on a Layer-2 angle many teams now copy; the edge is thin without a unique mainnet venue or live bridge, which makes it feel like a short-term swing rather than a long-term hold.

Bitcoin dropped 3.2% in the past 24 hours to slip below $114,000, while ether fell 5.3% to under $4,200. XRP tumbled 6.2%, Cardano's ADA slid 8% and the broader crypto market was down 3.2%. Shares of crypto-related companies, such as bitcoin miners, crypto exchanges and digital asset treasury firms, suffered even bigger losses, with MARA, COIN and MSTR closing today's regular session down 5.7%, 5.8% and 7.4%, respectively. By contrast, in general, U.S. equities suffered less: the Dow ended flat, the S&P 500 fell 0.59%, and the Nasdaq slid about 1.5%. The disparity underscores how digital assets, which rely heavily on cheap liquidity, are more exposed to shifts in rate expectations than traditional stocks. Investors now face a pivotal macro catalyst-heavy week. On Aug. 20 at 2 p.m. ET, the Fed will release minutes from the FOMC meeting held July 29–30, offering insight into policymakers’ tariff and inflation debates. From Aug. 21–23, central bankers gather for the Jackson Hole symposium, with Powell’s keynote set for Aug. 22 at 10 a.m. ET. Together, the minutes and Powell’s speech could define market expectations for the September policy meeting. Here are some top macro highlights traders will likely watch this week to gauge how the Fed will react during next month's meeting. Tariffs’ delayed bite Many companies have absorbed tariff costs to protect market share, but analysts warn they cannot do so indefinitely. Once passed on to consumers, these costs could drive prices higher and force the Fed to wait before cutting. Sticky inflation data Despite some cooling, inflation gauges remain elevated. The producer price index, a key wholesale measure, has been hotter than forecast, suggesting persistent pressures that complicate any case for aggressive easing. Corporate limits U.S. executives have signaled they will eventually be forced to shift tariff costs downstream. If that happens, consumer inflation could accelerate in the coming months, making a September cut seem premature. Mixed economic signals The U.S. economy shows both slowing job growth and resilient consumer demand. This uneven picture could encourage Powell to argue for patience until the Fed has clearer evidence that growth can withstand tariff-driven costs. Policy uncertainty Tariffs intersect with fiscal and trade policies in unpredictable ways. That complexity increases the risk of missteps, making a hawkish tone at Jackson Hole more likely. Lessons from history The tariff shocks of 2018–2019 produced delayed but meaningful inflation, prompting Fed caution. Powell may draw on that precedent to justify holding back this time. Forward-looking indicators The upcoming release of fresh economic data, including Thursday’s release of preliminary August data on manufacturing and services activity, could show tariff-related cost pressures building. Powell could point to these as another reason for prudence. Internal divisions Minutes from the July FOMC meeting may reveal a split inside the Fed. With hawks focused on inflation and doves emphasizing jobs, Powell may stress the need for consensus, which often favors waiting. For crypto, the stakes are clear. Higher-for-longer rates curb the liquidity that fuels speculative rallies, raising financing costs for miners and weighing on exchange activity. If Powell signals caution, the sell-off in tokens and crypto-linked equities could deepen. A dovish surprise, however, might offer the spark for a rebound.",Markets|Stocks|Crypto|The Fed|Jackson Hole|FOMC|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-19 23:13:13

But at what cost?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bank-of-japan-no-choice-but-to-hike-rates/,"Japan is staring down the barrel of an economic mess, and the Bank of Japan can’t stall any longer. The central bank has no real option left but to raise interest rates—again. The weak yen has wiped out purchasing power across the country, driven up living costs, and left millions struggling to keep up. That’s the brutal backdrop veteran ruling party lawmaker Taro Kono laid out on Tuesday, according to Reuters , as he demanded both tighter monetary policy and fiscal discipline to stop the damage. The BOJ had already pulled the plug on its decade-long stimulus experiment last year and bumped short-term interest rates up to 0.5% in January. But Kono, who’s gunning for the top job himself, says it hasn’t been enough. He warned that Japan can’t afford to let real borrowing costs—already negative thanks to high inflation—linger in the red. “I think it’s better to start early,” Kono said , pressing for more rate hikes. He added that the BOJ needs to “send out a message that Japan will pull out of a situation where real interest rates are negative.” When asked if a hike could come before year-end, he kept it vague but blunt: “I feel like [rate hikes] have already come too late.” Weak yen keeps crushing Japanese households Consumer prices in Japan have stayed above the 2% mark for over three years straight. But Governor Kazuo Ueda is still dragging his feet on raising rates further, citing pressure on the economy from U.S. tariffs—coming from Washington under President Donald Trump’s new administration. While the BOJ continues to hesitate, critics say the damage is already deep. Kono argued that the BOJ’s delay has weakened the yen and blown up import costs, creating a wave of inflation that’s hitting pensioners and businesses hard. What used to help exporters is now wrecking bottom lines. The cheap yen that once gave Japan’s export-heavy economy an edge has turned into a liability. Kono called it the “root cause of crippling inflation,” adding that it’s “eroding corporate margins and hurting pensioners.” With domestic production costs rising and imported goods draining company budgets, he said it’s time to move past the old economic playbook. That means ditching Abenomics—the blend of ultra-loose policy and big government spending introduced by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe back in 2013 to fight off deflation. “The BOJ should gradually raise interest rates, while the government should restore fiscal health under a new accord that replaces ‘Abenomics’,” Kono said. BOJ and government face pressure from business and inside the party Business leaders aren’t sitting quiet either. Takeshi Niinami, who chairs the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said the central bank is dangerously close to falling behind the curve. “I understand that the BOJ is in a very difficult position,” Niinami said last month, “but the bank should know that it will fall too much behind the curve if it doesn’t make a move.” His solution? Strengthen the yen. “The best step to combat rising living costs would be to reverse the weak yen and seek a somewhat stronger yen,” he said. Across Japan, the political pressure is rising too. While Kono failed in his 2024 bid to lead the Liberal Democratic Party, the party’s brutal loss in last month’s upper house election has reignited talk of a leadership shake-up. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who beat Kono last year, is now facing calls from within the party to step down. Senior LDP members are already pushing for a new leadership vote, adding more heat to an already volatile situation. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

But businesses could feel positive effects of digital ruble by 2029. The digital ruble will boost Russia’s economy to the tune of $3.2 billion per year, the country’s credit ratings agency says. The Russian media outlet RBC and the state-run news agency TASS reported that the claims come from the National Rating Agency (NRA). The credit rating agency is based in Moscow. It is authorized by the Central Bank and provides ratings for finance industry firms and government organs. Digital Ruble Will Bring Benefits by 2029, Says NRA The NRA has published a comprehensive report on the estimated impact of the Russian central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Central Bank’s St. Petersburg offices. (Source: Vityavo [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The digital RUB is set to roll out nationwide next year, with a phased adoption plan that will see the country’s biggest lenders start offering services with the CBDC in fall next year. Smaller firms will be given until 2027 or 2028 to start accepting the coin. But the government wants to use the CBDC to make welfare payments such as child benefits and pensions . The NRA conceded that the adoption plan would likely incur costs from both the private and public sector at first. But it said that the digital ruble project will quickly turn profitable. The agency said the CBDC would pump up to 260 billion rubles ($3.2 billion) per year into the Russian economy by 2031. The coin will also make the banking sector “up to 50 billion rubles ($619 million)” annually. Banking officials have previously expressed skepticism about the CBDC, claiming they cannot see why Moscow needs to issue the coin. ‘Big Businesses May Make up to $619M from Russian CBDC’ At the end of July, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that sets out a comprehensive roadmap for digital ruble adoption, starting from September 1, 2026. Donald Trump urged Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy to show some “flexibility” as the US president accelerates his efforts to end the war in Ukraine https://t.co/S7n9A3Iq3T — Bloomberg (@business) August 19, 2025 The agency said that companies and the government could begin to feel the benefits of the coin “between 2029 and 2031.” In the first years of adoptions, bigger businesses can expect to make 30-50 billion rubles ($371 million-$619 million) per year from the coin, the NRA said. Credit institutions, meanwhile, can expect to make up to 8 billion rubles ($99 million), NRA analysts added. War or peace?

The digital ruble launch could see banks lose clients to “new services” that cut them out of the picture, the agency said. This could see net profits drop by 8-10%, the experts calculated. But these initial losses will transform into later gains for banks, the agency said. After the project is fully rolled out, banks will be able to receive up to 61 billion rubles ($755 million) a year in “additional income” from smart contract -powered business, interbank transactions, and corporate liquidity management services. ‘No Advantages to CBDC Rollout’ In July this year, the Sberbank Chairman German Gref said that he does not “see any real advantages” for citizens, banks, or businesses . A branch of Sberbank. (Source: Artem Svetlov [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Gref said that experiments with digital fiats have not yet justified themselves. He added that all financial transactions are all already digitalized in Russia, meaning the CBDC would solves a problem that does not even exist. However, the Ministry of Finance wants to use the CBDC in government contract issuances. It thinks this will help eliminate corruption and boost transparency. Moscow is also thought to be keen on doing CBDC-powered business with its BRICS partners. Many BRICS members, particularly China, have made considerable progress with their own digital fiats. Cross-border CBDC solutions, BRICS members believe, will help render states immune to US-led sanctions packages. Moscow officials have long spoken about their desire to de-dollarize the Russian trade sector , and think that crypto or CBDC-powered solutions will let them do precisely that.

50358883,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79256,1755646205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Two Big Decisions to Change Everything for Ripple and XRP In October,https://timestabloid.com/two-big-decisions-to-change-everything-for-ripple-and-xrp-in-october/,"Legal and regulatory developments could place both Ripple and XRP in the spotlight this October. Attorney Bill Morgan, a well-known figure in the XRP community, recently outlined two significant decisions expected to take place around the same time, each with the potential to impact the token’s trajectory and Ripple’s long-term positioning in the financial sector. SEC’s Extended Review of Spot XRP ETFs The first development concerns the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ongoing evaluation of proposed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On August 18, the regulator announced that it would defer rulings on several pending applications, including those submitted by CoinShares, Grayscale, and 21Shares. These postponements moved the final decision deadlines into late October 2025. This marks the second delay by the SEC on spot XRP ETFs, but the upcoming deadline represents the final review period allowed under federal securities law. The agency must either approve or reject the proposals by that date. Approval would allow regulated investment products directly tied to XRP’s spot market to trade on U.S. exchanges, potentially opening the asset to a broader class of institutional and retail investors. Market analysts suggest that approval could strengthen XRP’s liquidity and credibility, while rejection would maintain the status quo but could dampen short-term sentiment. Ripple’s National Bank Charter Application The second major decision relates to Ripple’s application for a U.S. national banking charter. On July 2, Ripple formally submitted its request to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). According to federal regulations, the OCC is required to issue a decision within 120 days of receiving a complete application, unless an extension is formally granted. This timeline places a potential ruling around late October. If approved, the charter would permit Ripple to operate as a nationally recognized bank, providing it with the ability to expand its financial services beyond payments technology and into regulated banking activities. This development could also elevate Ripple into the ranks of significant U.S. financial institutions, particularly if the company maintains a large portion of its XRP holdings on its balance sheet. While the OCC could finalize its review before October, the agency also retains the discretion to extend the decision period if additional examination is deemed necessary. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Market Impact Commenting on the combined significance of these events, Bill Morgan noted that October could prove to be a decisive month for Ripple and XRP. The simultaneous timing of the SEC’s final ETF deadline and the OCC’s charter decision underscores how regulatory clarity could shape the future outlook for both the company and its token. Financial commentator Zach Rector has also weighed in on the potential effects of an ETF approval. Rector argued that anticipation for these investment products could drive short-term upward momentum in XRP’s price. However, he cautioned that some early investors might sell once approvals are confirmed, leading to a temporary pullback. In his view, long-term inflows into XRP ETFs would likely sustain demand and could support a rally toward double-digit price levels. With both the SEC and OCC expected to issue decisions in October, Ripple and XRP could soon face pivotal outcomes. ETF approval would broaden market access, while a successful bank charter application would significantly enhance Ripple’s institutional standing. Taken together, these developments could mark a turning point for XRP’s role in the global digital asset ecosystem.

50360004,560230,1755648002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50360004.jpeg,$92-Million Bitcoin Transfer: Bhutan Shuffles 800 BTC Amid Price Drop,https://bitcoinist.com/92-million-bitcoin-transfer-bhutan-shuffles-800-btc-amid-price-drop/,"The Royal Government of Bhutan has once again moved a large batch of Bitcoin, sparking talk across the crypto market. Nearly 800 BTC , valued at about $92 million, was shifted on August 18, 2025, into two new wallets. The move added to a series of transactions made earlier this month and has fueled speculation about whether the Himalayan kingdom is preparing to sell. Third Transaction This Month This is not the first time Bhutan has drawn attention in August. On August 5, the government transferred 517 BTC to an unknown address. Just two days later, on August 7, another batch was tracked to a Cobo Hot Wallet at an average price of $116,557. The Royal Government of Bhutan has transferred 799.69 $BTC , worth $92.06M, into 2 new wallets, likely for deposit into a CEX ( #Binance ). https://t.co/q4dW3qJBT5 pic.twitter.com/bRvm3o90UI — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) August 18, 2025 Reports confirmed that those coins were headed for sale, with Cobo acting as custodian of Bhutan’s Bitcoin holdings. In its latest update, blockchain analytics firm Arkham confirmed the 799.69 BTC move and highlighted that this was the third major transaction from Bhutan this month. Bitcoin’s Price Pressure The timing comes as Bitcoin struggles to hold onto recent highs. The token reached a record $124,500 on August 14, 2025, before sliding back to $115,300. Data shows it was down 2.30% in 24 hours and nearly 5% over the week. Platforms like Onchain Lens suggested that Bhutan’s most recent transfer may be linked to Binance, though no official word has come from Bhutanese authorities. Market watchers say such transfers often hint at a possible sale, but they can also be part of wallet restructuring or custody changes. Bhutan’s Place Among Top Holders Even with these movements, Bhutan remains one of the biggest nation-state holders of Bitcoin. Current estimates put its reserves at around 9,969 BTC, worth about $1.15 billion. That kind of figure makes Bhutan the sixth-largest holder worldwide, behind the US with 198,000 BTC, China with 190,000 BTC, the UK with 61,240 BTC, Ukraine with 46,350 BTC, and North Korea with 13,560 BTC. Unlike other countries that built their stacks mostly from seizures, Bhutan’s holdings trace back to mining . For now, the repeated transfers leave the market guessing. Some traders see it as a sign of profit-taking after Bitcoin’s latest peak. Others say it may just be about custody adjustments. Without confirmation from Bhutan, the reason behind the moves remains uncertain.

Although this feature was originally introduced to prevent network spam rather than to influence valuation, its long-term effect on supply has increasingly drawn attention. At present, XRP’s circulating supply is 99,985,821,508 tokens, slightly lower than the initial 100 billion created at launch . This small reduction is the result of ongoing token burns that permanently destroy a fraction of XRP. Annual Burn Rate on the XRP Ledger On average, the ledger removes approximately 2,700 XRP daily. However, this figure occasionally rises during periods of increased network use. This results in roughly 985,500 XRP permanently eliminated each year. If the current rate continues unchanged, the cumulative burn by the end of 2050 would total around 25 million tokens. That decline would lower the supply from 99.985 billion to about 99.960 billion, a reduction of only 0.025%. While the mathematical impact on supply appears minor, the perception of continuous scarcity has the potential to shape investor behaviour and, indirectly, market pricing. Modeling Potential Price Outcomes by 2050 To explore how both adoption and supply reduction could influence value, three possible scenarios for XRP’s price trajectory were outlined, starting from its trading level of $3.01 Scenario One: Gradual Institutional Adoption If banks, fintech firms, and remittance companies steadily incorporate XRP into their operations, a compound annual growth rate of 6–8% over the next 25 years could result in prices ranging between $18 and $25 by 2050 , even without factoring in supply burns. When the effect of ongoing token destruction is included, the projected range increases slightly to $20–$28. In this case, the burn contributes more as a psychological reinforcement of scarcity than as a mathematical driver. Scenario Two: Expanding Role in Global Liquidity A more aggressive growth trajectory envisions XRP becoming central to cross-border settlements, tokenized assets, and central bank digital currency infrastructure. Under this model, with adoption growing at 12–15% annually, XRP’s price could rise to $150–$250 by 2050 . Higher transaction volumes in this scenario would also accelerate the burn rate, potentially removing between 500 million and 1 billion XRP over 25 years, or about 1% of the total supply. This additional reduction could push valuations into the $180–$300 range . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Scenario Three: Global Reserve Settlement Asset In the most expansive evaluation, XRP functions as a neutral global reserve settlement tool supporting trillions in daily financial flows. Without considering the burn, this scenario points to valuations between $1,000 and $2,500. However, with large transaction volumes, the network could destroy 5–10 billion tokens over the same period, cutting the total supply by 5–10%. This meaningful reduction would support an even higher price range of $1,200 to $3,500. Although XRP’s burn mechanism was never intended to drive its price, its effect on long-term supply cannot be ignored. The impact of these burns, however, will depend largely on how extensively XRP is adopted across financial systems. By 2050, the combined influence of market demand, institutional integration, and sustained token burn could determine whether XRP remains moderately valued or rises into significantly higher ranges.

After weeks of strong momentum and multi-year highs, bulls are now struggling to defend support zones. The loss of this level raises concerns about a potential deeper correction, though fundamentals remain firmly bullish. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,350 Liquidity Pool: Can Demand Hold? Institutional adoption continues to provide strong tailwinds, with major firms increasing exposure to Ethereum through ETFs, treasury strategies, and on-chain accumulation. This steady demand reflects growing confidence in ETH’s long-term role within the digital asset ecosystem. At the same time, Open Interest has been rising sharply, highlighting a surge in speculation and leveraged positioning across derivatives markets. While this can amplify moves in both directions, it underscores the intense battle between bulls and bears at current levels. Market participants now see the coming days as critical for Ethereum’s short-term trajectory. Holding above nearby support could pave the way for a rebound and renewed attempts to challenge the $4,500–$4,800 resistance zone. Ethereum Faces Record Short Position Pressure Ethereum is entering one of its most decisive moments yet, with unprecedented short positioning building up in the market. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, we’re witnessing the biggest leveraged short position on ETH ever recorded. Net leveraged shorts have climbed to 18,438 contracts, marking the biggest bearish bet in Ethereum’s history. This surge in positioning reflects a market bracing for volatility, as traders place aggressive downside bets following Ethereum’s retrace from the $4,790 level. However, Pillows emphasizes that this dynamic could create the perfect storm for a short squeeze. If Ethereum manages to rally from current levels, these bearish positions could quickly unwind, forcing shorts to cover at higher prices and accelerating the rally. Historically, such imbalances have led to explosive upside moves in a short timeframe, catching bears off guard and rewarding bulls with rapid gains. While short-term volatility remains elevated, strong fundamentals — including declining exchange supply, institutional accumulation, and broader adoption trends — continue to support the long-term bullish thesis. For now, all eyes remain on whether the record-short positioning turns into the catalyst for Ethereum’s next breakout. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Grows As ETFs Break Records With $2.85B Weekly Inflow ETH Technical Details: Testing Demand Level Ethereum is currently trading at $4,284, showing signs of volatility after its recent decline from the $4,800 region. The 4-hour chart highlights how ETH has struggled to reclaim momentum, with price now testing a key support zone around the $4,200–$4,250 range. This level is crucial because it aligns with the 100-day moving average (green line), which has acted as dynamic support during previous pullbacks in this rally. The price structure shows that bulls remain active but are under pressure. After weeks of consistent gains, Ethereum is now experiencing heavier selling volume, as visible in the recent red bars on the chart. However, the broader trend remains bullish as long as ETH holds above the 200-day moving average (red line), currently sitting below $3,920.

Recent events indicate a continued slide, primarily influenced by anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. This downturn highlights the digital asset space’s sensitivity to macroeconomic factors, especially interest rate expectations. Why is the Crypto Market Feeling the Heat? Investors are closely watching for signals from the Federal Reserve, particularly the release of the July meeting minutes and upcoming remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole. These events often provide crucial insights into the Fed’s stance on interest rates, which directly impacts market liquidity and investor sentiment. July Meeting Minutes: These minutes reveal the detailed discussions and rationale behind the Fed’s latest policy decisions. Jackson Hole Symposium: Fed Chair Powell’s speeches here are highly anticipated for clues about future monetary policy direction. The prevailing sentiment is that the Fed might maintain a “higher-for-longer” stance on interest rates. This approach aims to curb inflation but can have a dampening effect on risk assets like cryptocurrencies, impacting the entire crypto market . How Are Key Digital Assets and Stocks Reacting in the Crypto Market? The impact of this economic uncertainty is evident across the board. Major cryptocurrencies have experienced notable declines, while crypto-linked stocks have seen even steeper losses, signaling broader market apprehension. Bitcoin (BTC): The flagship cryptocurrency recently dipped below the $113,000 mark, a significant move that often sets the tone for the broader crypto market . Ethereum (ETH) and XRP: These prominent altcoins also followed Bitcoin’s downward trend, reflecting a general risk-off sentiment. Crypto-Linked Stocks: Companies heavily invested in or operating within the crypto space, such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, posted more substantial losses. This suggests that traditional equity markets are also factoring in the potential for reduced crypto activity or profitability. This widespread decline underscores the interconnectedness of digital assets with broader financial markets, especially when economic policy shifts are on the horizon. The Critical Link: Cheap Liquidity and the Crypto Market Why does the Fed’s interest rate policy weigh so heavily on digital assets? The answer lies in crypto’s historical dependence on readily available, cheap liquidity. When interest rates are low, borrowing is inexpensive, encouraging investment in higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a “higher-for-longer” interest rate environment means: Higher Cost of Capital: It becomes more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow, reducing the flow of new money into speculative assets. Attractive Traditional Investments: Higher interest rates make safer investments, like bonds and savings accounts, more appealing, potentially drawing capital away from the volatile crypto market . Reduced Risk Appetite: Investors become more cautious, prioritizing capital preservation over aggressive growth strategies. This dynamic makes the crypto market particularly vulnerable to shifts in monetary policy compared to traditional equities, which often have established revenue streams and less reliance on speculative inflows. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Insights from Powell All eyes are now on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s upcoming remarks. While a “pause” in rate hikes is a likely outcome, the market will be dissecting every word for nuances. A subtle shift towards a more dovish stance — indicating a less aggressive approach to rate hikes or even potential cuts in the future — could provide the much-needed lift for the crypto market . However, if Powell reiterates a firm commitment to battling inflation with restrictive policies, the pressure on digital assets could persist. The market craves clarity, and any ambiguity often translates into volatility. Understanding these macro drivers is crucial for navigating the current landscape. While the short-term outlook remains sensitive to Fed announcements, the long-term potential of digital assets continues to be a subject of intense debate and innovation. In summary, the recent downturn in the crypto market is a direct reflection of heightened anxiety surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. As investors await key announcements from Fed officials, the sensitivity of digital assets to interest rate fluctuations is clear. A hawkish stance could prolong the current slump, while any hint of a dovish pivot might ignite a much-anticipated recovery. Staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts is paramount for anyone involved in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why are cryptocurrencies so sensitive to Federal Reserve decisions? A1: Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and altcoins, are often considered risk assets. Their value can be significantly influenced by the availability of cheap liquidity. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it makes borrowing more expensive and reduces the overall money supply, which tends to reduce investor appetite for riskier assets like those in the crypto market . Q2: What does “higher-for-longer” mean for interest rates? A2: “Higher-for-longer” refers to the Federal Reserve’s potential strategy of keeping interest rates elevated for an extended period to ensure inflation is fully under control, rather than cutting rates prematurely. This policy generally tightens financial conditions and can negatively impact growth-oriented and speculative assets. Q3: How do Fed announcements affect Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP specifically? A3: As leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP often serve as bellwethers for the broader crypto market . When the Fed signals hawkish policies, investors tend to reduce their exposure to these assets, leading to price drops. Conversely, dovish signals can spur buying interest. Q4: What is the Jackson Hole Symposium? A4: The Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium is an annual conference organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Central bankers, finance ministers, academics, and financial market participants from around the world attend. It’s often a venue where major policy signals are communicated, particularly by the Fed Chair. Q5: Are crypto-linked stocks impacted differently than cryptocurrencies themselves? A5: While both are affected, crypto-linked stocks (like Coinbase or MicroStrategy) can sometimes experience even steeper losses during downturns. This is because they face both the general market risk associated with equities and the specific volatility of the underlying crypto assets, potentially magnifying their losses during periods of uncertainty in the crypto market .

Recently, South Korea’s central bank issued a significant warning regarding U.S. dollar stablecoins , urging tighter regulations. This move highlights growing concerns among nations about the potential impact of these digital assets on traditional financial systems and monetary sovereignty. Why Are U.S. Dollar Stablecoins a Concern for South Korea? The Bank of Korea (BOK) has voiced serious reservations. According to a Yonhap News report, the central bank believes the increasing popularity of U.S. dollar stablecoins poses a direct threat to the nation’s monetary sovereignty. This concern stems from the potential for these digital assets to facilitate the evasion of existing foreign-exchange controls. In essence, if citizens extensively use stablecoins for transactions, it could bypass traditional banking channels and currency regulations. The BOK conveyed these sentiments in a written response to People Power Party (PPP) lawmaker Park Sung-hoon on August 20. They emphasized the urgency of addressing this issue, stating that growing use could enable illicit capital flows. How Do U.S. Dollar Stablecoins Impact Monetary Policy? Beyond foreign-exchange evasion, the BOK identified broader implications. They warned that widespread adoption of U.S. dollar stablecoins could significantly erode the effectiveness of the country’s monetary policy. Consider this: central banks manage inflation and economic stability primarily through controlling the money supply and interest rates. If a substantial portion of transactions occurs via stablecoins, the central bank’s tools become less potent. This situation could lead to: Undermined Monetary Sovereignty: The ability of the BOK to control its own currency and financial system diminishes. Increased Currency Market Volatility: Capital outflows could become more frequent and harder to track, leading to instability in the Korean Won’s value. Therefore, the central bank is advocating for prompt revisions to the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. This legislative update aims to equip regulators with the necessary powers to oversee these digital assets effectively and manage risks associated with U.S. dollar stablecoins . What’s Next for U.S. Dollar Stablecoins in South Korea? The BOK’s clear stance signals a growing global trend among financial regulators. They are increasingly scrutinizing the impact of cryptocurrencies, especially those pegged to fiat currencies like U.S. dollar stablecoins . For lawmakers in South Korea, the call to action is clear: swift legislative amendments are necessary. This will ensure the nation’s financial stability remains robust in the face of evolving digital financial instruments. The debate over digital asset regulation is far from over. However, South Korea’s proactive approach sets a precedent for how nations might tackle the challenges posed by stablecoins to their economic frameworks. The future of U.S. dollar stablecoins in the region will undoubtedly be shaped by these ongoing discussions. South Korea’s central bank has sounded a crucial alarm regarding U.S. dollar stablecoins . Their concerns about monetary sovereignty, foreign exchange control evasion, and policy effectiveness highlight the complex interplay between traditional finance and emerging digital assets. As the digital economy expands, robust regulatory frameworks become paramount for national economic stability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. dollar stablecoins? U.S. dollar stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged, typically 1:1, to the U.S. dollar. They aim to combine the stability of fiat currencies with the flexibility of digital assets. Why is South Korea’s central bank concerned about U.S. dollar stablecoins? The Bank of Korea (BOK) is concerned that the growing use of U.S. dollar stablecoins could threaten the country’s monetary sovereignty, enable evasion of foreign-exchange controls, and undermine the effectiveness of its monetary policy. How could stablecoins impact South Korea’s monetary policy? If stablecoins become widely adopted, the BOK fears it could reduce their ability to control the national money supply and interest rates, thereby weakening their influence over inflation and economic stability. What action is the Bank of Korea recommending? The BOK is calling for swift revisions to the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act to tighten oversight and establish clearer regulations for U.S. dollar stablecoins and other digital assets. Is South Korea the only country concerned about stablecoin regulation? No, many countries and central banks worldwide are actively discussing and developing regulations for stablecoins, recognizing their potential impact on financial stability and monetary systems.

Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely watched indicator, took a significant dip. As of August 20, this vital index now stands at 44, a notable 12-point drop from the previous day. This shift pushes the market squarely into the ‘Fear’ zone, marking its lowest point in approximately two months since June 22, when it registered 42. What does this mean for investors, and how should we interpret this signal? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drop The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a clear snapshot of market emotions. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. This tool helps gauge whether market participants are feeling overly anxious or excessively optimistic. A score of 44 clearly places us in the ‘Fear’ category, suggesting that investors are currently more cautious or even worried about the market’s immediate future. This recent drop reflects a weakening sentiment across the crypto landscape. Historically, periods of ‘Fear’ can precede either further declines or, conversely, present potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to enter when others are hesitant. The shift from ‘Greed’ to ‘Fear’ is a significant change, signaling a re-evaluation of risk by many market participants. What Influences the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not based on a single metric. Instead, it aggregates data from six different factors to provide a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Each factor carries a specific weighting to ensure a balanced assessment: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with average values. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values over 30 and 90 days. Social Media (15%): Looks at the volume and sentiment of crypto-related hashtags on social media platforms. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: Currently, this factor is paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s market share. A rising dominance often indicates fear, as investors move to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search query trends for crypto-related terms to gauge public interest and sentiment. These diverse inputs collectively paint a picture of the prevailing mood, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a robust indicator. Navigating Market Sentiment: What Does ‘Fear’ Mean? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters the ‘Fear’ zone, it often indicates that investors are panicking or selling off their assets due to negative news or market downturns. This widespread apprehension can lead to market undervaluation, as assets might be trading below their intrinsic value due to emotional selling. For contrarian investors, periods of extreme fear can be seen as opportune moments. However, it is crucial to remember that ‘Fear’ does not automatically guarantee a market rebound. It simply suggests that many participants are feeling pessimistic. Smart investors use this signal as one piece of their analytical puzzle, combining it with fundamental and technical analysis before making any decisions. It serves as a psychological barometer, highlighting when emotions might be overriding rational judgment in the market. Actionable Insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index How can you use the current reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to your advantage? While it is not a direct buy or sell signal, it offers valuable context: Extreme Fear (0-24): This often signals that the market is oversold. Historically, these periods have presented strong buying opportunities for long-term investors who are comfortable with risk. Fear (25-49): As we are currently experiencing, this suggests caution but can also be a time to consider dollar-cost averaging into positions if your long-term outlook remains positive. Greed (50-74): Indicates a bullish market. Investors might be getting overly enthusiastic, which could precede a correction. Extreme Greed (75-100): This is a warning sign. The market might be overbought, and a correction could be imminent. It’s often a time for profit-taking or increased caution. Always remember to conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) and align any investment decisions with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. The index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. Conclusion The recent fall of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 44, pushing it into the ‘Fear’ zone, is a significant development for the crypto market. It highlights a prevailing sense of caution among investors, reflecting recent market dynamics and a re-evaluation of risk. While fear can feel unsettling, understanding this index empowers you to make more informed decisions, rather than reacting purely to emotion. By combining this sentiment indicator with sound research, you can navigate the volatile world of cryptocurrency with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), helping investors understand if the market is overly fearful or overly optimistic. Q2: Why did the Crypto Fear & Greed Index drop to 44? The index dropped to 44 due to a weakening market sentiment, influenced by factors such as increased volatility, changes in market momentum and volume, social media trends, Bitcoin dominance shifts, and Google search trends, all indicating a move towards caution among investors. Q3: What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six main factors: market volatility, market momentum/volume, social media sentiment, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive sentiment score. Q4: How can investors use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Investors can use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a psychological barometer. Periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ might suggest buying opportunities, while ‘Extreme Greed’ could signal a need for caution or profit-taking. It should always be used in conjunction with other research methods. Q5: Is a ‘Fear’ zone always bad for investors? Not necessarily.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7925 Market cap $836.39M Trading volume (24-hour) $27.62M Circulating supply 1.055B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.8321 24-hour low $0.786 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.94% 50-day SMA $0.7638 14-Day RSI 51.42 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 56 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.6514 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is trading below all major moving averages with a clear downtrend structure intact. The breakdown below $0.8169 support creates overhead resistance for any bounce attempts. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart The daily Tezos chart for August 19 shows that the asset has formed a clear downtrend from its peak around $0.92, with price consistently making lower highs and lower lows while failing to reclaim the declining trendline resistance. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands show price trading below the middle band around $0.8169, a critical support level that now acts as overhead resistance and could cap any recovery attempts. The MACD remains in negative territory with bearish divergence, while the OBV suggests declining buying interest despite some accumulation phases earlier in the trend. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour timeframe reinforces the bearish outlook as Tezos trades at $0.7896, showing minimal recovery from session lows around $0.7846. The descending trendline from the $0.86 highs continues to cap rallies, creating a clear pattern of rejection at higher levels. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume remains subdued at 3.07M, indicating a lack of conviction in any bounce attempts, while the Money Flow Index has plunged to 22.21, signaling extreme oversold conditions that haven’t yet triggered meaningful buying interest. The 21-period SMA at $0.8309 acts as dynamic resistance, sitting well above current price action and confirming the downtrend remains intact across multiple timeframes. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7705 BUY SMA 5 $0.8182 SELL SMA 10 $0.8414 SELL SMA 21 $0.8229 SELL SMA 50 $0.7638 BUY SMA 100 $0.6836 BUY SMA 200 $0.6514 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8118 SELL EMA 5 $0.7701 BUY EMA 10 $0.7074 BUY EMA 21 $0.6719 BUY EMA 50 $0.7077 BUY EMA 100 $0.8036 SELL EMA 200 $0.8762 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos appears positioned for continued weakness with downside targets around $0.72-$0.74 representing the next major support cluster. Any recovery attempts will likely face strong resistance at $0.81-$0.83, making sustained upside moves difficult without significant volume expansion and momentum shift. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos unveiled Teslink, a modular interoperability layer connecting Tezos with EVM-compatible chains like Ethlink.

Understanding these shifts is vital for any crypto enthusiast. Currently, the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index sits at 45, indicating that the market is firmly in what’s known as Bitcoin Season. This reading, reported on August 20 at 00:29 UTC, shows a slight increase from the previous day, yet it still signals Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to most altcoins. But what exactly does this index mean for you and your crypto holdings? What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable metric that helps investors gauge the broader market sentiment and performance. It tracks how well the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have performed against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This index provides a clear snapshot of whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin or if Bitcoin is leading the charge. The score ranges from 1 to 100, offering a straightforward interpretation of market dynamics. Altcoin Season: This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. A high index score, typically above 75, suggests this environment. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. An index score below 25 often signifies a strong Bitcoin Season. With the index at 45, it indicates that while some altcoins might be performing, the overall trend leans towards Bitcoin’s dominance, making it a Bitcoin Season. Why Are We Experiencing Bitcoin Season? Bitcoin Season often emerges during periods of market consolidation or when major narratives begin to take shape. Bitcoin, as the pioneer cryptocurrency, often acts as a safe haven or the primary beneficiary of new capital entering the space. Investors frequently move into Bitcoin first, anticipating its price appreciation before capital eventually trickles down into altcoins. This trend highlights Bitcoin’s role as the market’s bellwether. Factors contributing to a Bitcoin Season can include: Macroeconomic uncertainties driving investors to less volatile (relatively) assets. Anticipation of significant Bitcoin-specific events, such as halving cycles or institutional adoption news. A period of profit-taking from previous altcoin rallies, with funds flowing back into Bitcoin. Understanding these underlying reasons provides a more comprehensive view of the current market state as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: Crucial Strategies When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season, it calls for a thoughtful approach to your portfolio. This period presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. Here are some actionable insights: Focus on Bitcoin: Consider accumulating Bitcoin if you believe in its long-term potential. Its dominance often suggests it will be the primary mover. Cautious Altcoin Accumulation: If you are interested in altcoins, research projects with strong fundamentals and innovative technology. Prices may be more attractive for long-term accumulation. Risk Management: Always employ robust risk management strategies. Volatility can be high, and not all altcoins will survive a prolonged Bitcoin Season. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin might be leading, a diversified portfolio can still include a select few altcoins that you believe have strong future prospects. Remember, market cycles are fluid. Staying informed and adapting your strategy is key to success in the dynamic crypto space. When Will Altcoin Season Return? The shift from Bitcoin Season back to Altcoin Season is a cyclical event, not a fixed date. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes a period where altcoins then catch up and even outperform Bitcoin significantly. Look for these indicators that might signal a return of Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Price Stability: After a major rally, if Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or consolidates, capital may start flowing into altcoins. Falling Bitcoin Dominance: A decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance chart often suggests that altcoins are gaining market share. Emergence of New Narratives: New technologies or trends (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions) can ignite specific altcoin sectors. Patience is a virtue in crypto investing. The market will undoubtedly shift again, and understanding the Altcoin Season Index helps you anticipate these changes. In conclusion, the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 45 clearly indicates that we are in a Bitcoin Season. This metric from CoinMarketCap provides crucial insights into the performance dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins. While Bitcoin leads the charge, understanding these cycles allows investors to make informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and position themselves for future opportunities. The crypto market is ever-evolving, and staying updated with such indicators is paramount for navigating its complexities successfully.

Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Bought Over 20,000 BTC In This Dip In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how some of Bitcoin’s key investors have been reacting to the latest volatility in the cryptocurrency’s price. Related Reading: Ethereum Plunges 10% After Smashing Into This Historical Barrier The holders in question are those carrying a wallet balance in the range of 10 to 10,000 BTC. At the current exchange rate of the asset, the former bound converts to $1.1 million and the latter one to $1.1 billion. Thus, the only addresses that would qualify for the range would be the ones owned by the large investors. Such entities can carry some influence in the market due to the size of their holdings, which can make their behavior worth keeping an eye on. These key holders are generally divided into two cohorts: sharks and whales. The whales are much larger than the other, so they hold the most power on the network. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the combined supply of these Bitcoin groups over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the sharks and whales saw a decline in July, suggesting some of the key investors sold at price levels near the all-time high (ATH). After bottoming a few days ago when BTC set its new ATH above $124,000, however, the metric has found a reversal, suggesting that the sharks and whales have been buying during the price drawdown that has followed. In total, investors falling inside this range have loaded up on 20,061 BTC (worth $2.3 billion) since August 13th. On a long-term scale, the two cohorts have bought a combined 225,320 BTC ($26.1 billion) since March 22nd. “There has been notable correlation between this group’s holdings and the direction of future price movement for the majority of the past five years,” explains the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen whether the same would hold true this time as well, with the shark and whale accumulation potentially leading to another price surge.

50362184,560042,1755651635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50362184.jpeg,Bitcoin Apparent Demand Weakens: Expansion Slows To 30K BTC,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-apparent-demand-weakens-expansion-slows-btc/,"Bitcoin is once again under pressure after failing to sustain momentum above the $120,000 mark and now struggling to hold support near $115,000. The recent rejection from the $125,000 level has triggered heightened volatility, with selling pressure weighing on short-term market sentiment. Despite printing new all-time highs last week, BTC has quickly retraced, moving into a consolidation phase between key support and resistance levels. Bulls remain cautious as momentum shows signs of fading, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to further downside if demand weakens. Data from CryptoQuant highlights this shift clearly: at current price levels, demand is softening while momentum indicators suggest exhaustion after months of strong gains. This cooling effect is particularly concerning given the backdrop of heavy resistance above $120,000, where many short-term holders may be tempted to take profits. A successful defense of the $115,000 zone could provide the foundation for a renewed push toward highs, but a breakdown risks triggering a deeper correction. With volatility returning and confidence being tested, all eyes are on BTC’s ability to maintain support and stabilize before making its next major move. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Shows Fading Momentum According to top analyst Axel Adler, one of the most telling on-chain signals right now is Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand . This metric tracks the net change of young investors holding coins less than one year old that have been actively moving. Positive values indicate expansion of circulation, suggesting new demand and activity from younger market participants. Negative values, in contrast, reflect coins aging into longer-term holding, signaling reduced demand from new entrants. Currently, the metric remains in positive territory, sitting around 30,000 BTC. This confirms that expanded demand still exists, but momentum has been clearly fading in recent weeks. The decline from higher levels shows that while Bitcoin continues to attract inflows, the intensity of new participation is weakening. If this value trends toward zero, it would signal cooling demand from new investors, a possible warning that fresh capital inflows are drying up. Adler notes that the market structure remains supportive of long-term strength, as older coins continue to migrate into strong hands. However, the slowdown in young investor activity at a time when Bitcoin struggles to hold support below all-time highs adds weight to the current consolidation. Traders are closely monitoring this indicator, as further decline could signal short-term vulnerability before the next major move. BTC Consolidates Below Key Level Bitcoin continues to face mounting volatility, with the 4-hour chart showing clear signs of weakness as the price hovers around $115,573. After multiple failed attempts to reclaim the $123,217 resistance level, BTC has entered a short-term downtrend, slipping below its key moving averages. The 50-day SMA has already crossed below the 100-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA looms overhead as a stronger resistance barrier, highlighting bearish momentum in the near term. The rejection from $123K has now turned into a consolidation phase, with sellers defending the $118K–$120K zone aggressively. Price action suggests that $115K has become the immediate level to watch, as a confirmed break below could open the door to deeper retracements toward $112K or even $110K. Trading volumes have also increased on down moves, signaling growing selling pressure. On the flip side, if Bitcoin manages to hold $115K and build a base, bulls may attempt another push toward $118K. However, momentum indicators suggest that buyers are losing steam, and the market could continue to consolidate before a decisive move. For now, BTC remains trapped between resistance at $123K and critical support at $115K, with the coming sessions likely to define its short-term direction.

The exchange demonstrated comprehensive upgrades across products, branding, security, and services, showcasing robust growth momentum and operational excellence. Trading Volume Growth Ranks No.1 Among Top Exchanges According to CoinGecko’s latest Q2 exchange report , HTX topped global rankings for trading volume growth, significantly outperforming industry averages. Additionally, CoinDesk’s July exchange market share report noted that HTX achieved the second-largest market share increase year-to-date, trailing only Binance—cementing its place among the top-tier global trading platforms. In July, HTX achieved remarkable performance metrics, including a 45% surge in new user registrations and 33% growth in trading volume month-over-month. HTX’s native growth engine keeps firing on all cylinders, propelled by surging organic traffic and industrial rankings that are fostering an increasingly vibrant ecosystem. HTX listed 12 new assets in July spanning AI, meme coin, and layer 1 sectors. Among them, token M debuted exclusively on the platform and soared as much as 25x, creating a significant wealth effect for early participants. The AI-focused ANI , buoyed by comments from Elon Musk, quickly became the hottest on-chain project in the humanoid AI category, posting a peak gain of 426% after listing. Other additions such as BLUM and COOKIE broadened HTX’s exposure to high-growth sectors. HTX New Listing Winners Campaigns Drive Liquidity and Brand Reach On the marketing operations front, HTX ran campaigns exclusive to stablecoins, centered on USD1, USDC, and USDD, generating over $400 million in spot trading volume. Additionally, the HTX 12th-Anniversary Carnival has begun and will run until September 12. Participants can light up “Task Planets” to earn rewards, including trading fee rebate vouchers, 0% margin interest vouchers, token airdrops, merchandise, and entries into lucky draws with grand prizes of 120 million $HTX and a $2,000 travel fund. During Istanbul Blockchain Week, HTX achieved 48+ million impressions in the Turkey market alone, and built deeper ties with partners including 0G Labs, 100xLabs, and Castrum Capital, which facilitated the listing of COOKIE. Online exposure rose by 60.8% versus prior events, with registrations and deposits hitting 14-day highs. Research and Product Upgrades Strengthen Platform This July, HTX Research published the first part of its in-depth report “ The New Stablecoin Order: Restructuring Global Payments, Regulatory Legitimization, and the Capital War ,” offering a macro view of stablecoin dynamics and forward trends. HTX also launched version 11.0 of its app , redesigning the homepage, assets page, and trading page with overhauled interfaces. Following the upgrade, homepage click-through rates jumped by 24%, streamlining the user experience. DAO Vision Refreshes with New Whitepaper HTX DAO released a newly updated Whitepaper, marking a pivotal declaration of strategic direction. The initiative signals HTX’s evolution—from a centralized exchange to a core force in on-chain financial governance—committed to building a user-led “Freeport of Finance.” Under this vision, all participants will not only share in the platform’s growth but also gain genuine decision-making power. Moving forward, the development of HTX DAO will be driven collectively by its community, opening a new chapter that blends decentralized governance with CeFi infrastructure. Strong Security and Transparent Reserves As a pioneer in implementing Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves, HTX has consistently demonstrated its dedication to transparency by publicly disclosing reserve data for 34 consecutive months. As of August 1, 2025, all reserve ratios stood at or above 100%, with full transparency via the Assets > PoR Reports section on its website. From accelerating user and trading growth to delivering standout crypto returns, product innovation, and global brand engagement, the July performance numbers underscore HTX’s ability to execute across multiple fronts. The exchange continues to deepen its user-centric approach and advance product and service innovations to help more traders seize the opportunities of the next market cycle.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, BTC is down 3% in the past 24 hours, changing hands at $113,000, while Ether is also in the red, down 5.6% to $4,100, extending a week of weakness across majors. The pullback comes despite a continued stream of bullish headlines, underscoring what market observers say is a widening gap between short-term price action and longer-term structural progress. In a recent report , Glassnode frames the decline as a function of fragility: spot momentum is fading, leverage is stretched, and profit-taking pressure is building. Even though U.S.-listed spot ETFs attracted nearly $900 million in inflows last week, Glassnode warns that without renewed conviction in spot markets, positioning remains vulnerable to deeper deleveraging. However, this view is not universal. Enflux, a Singapore-based market maker, by contrast, argued in a recent note shared with CoinDesk that the industry is maturing faster than prices suggest. Weak price action is a short-term disconnect, and traders aren't focusing on the more important headlines: Google becoming the largest shareholder in miner TeraWulf, Wyoming launching a state-backed stablecoin, and Tether hiring a former White House crypto policy official. These shifts, they argue, show capital and talent aligning around a regulatory-aligned, institutional future. The divergence in tone is telling. One camp sees fragile positioning and fading momentum; the other sees scaffolding being laid for an institutional, regulatory-aligned cycle. Prices may look unimpressed, but the industry’s trajectory suggests the market is maturing faster than charts imply. Market Movers BTC: Bitcoin fell 3.2% to below $114,000 as cryptocurrencies and related stocks extended losses ahead of the Fed’s FOMC minutes and Powell’s Jackson Hole speech later this week. ETH: Ether fell 3.5% to under $4,200 as investors reconsider the likelihood of a September Fed rate cut, with Bank of America economists warning Powell may argue for holding rates amid sticky inflation and tariff pressures. Gold: Gold edged up to $3,384.70 and silver to $38.115 in quiet trading as markets await Powell’s Jackson Hole speech Friday on the Fed’s policy outlook, while global stocks were mixed and China’s central bank injected $65 billion to steady bonds. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei slipped 1.14% to 43,050.89, retreating from record highs as investors weigh risks tied to a fragile U.S. trade deal. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday night, with the S&P 500 flat, Dow steady, and Nasdaq 100 down 0.2%, as investors awaited major retail earnings and Fed meeting minutes.

Union Square Ventures (USV), a prominent New York-based venture capital firm, has once again made headlines with a notable USV UNI sale . This move has caught the attention of on-chain analysts and the broader crypto community, raising questions about strategic portfolio adjustments by institutional investors. What’s Behind the Latest USV UNI Sale? According to on-chain data identified by Arkham, addresses linked to Union Square Ventures recently executed a substantial transaction. The firm reportedly sold 731,000 UNI tokens, valued at approximately $7.43 million. These tokens were transferred to Coinbase Prime roughly eight hours before the sale, indicating a deliberate and prepared move. This isn’t USV’s first foray into offloading UNI. On-chain analyst @EmberCN shared via an X post that this latest transaction marks the firm’s first UNI sale since December. In that earlier instance, USV offloaded an even larger sum: 3.51 million UNI tokens, fetching a remarkable $54.6 million at an average price of $15.53 per token. The consistent nature of these USV UNI sale events suggests a calculated approach to managing their digital asset portfolio. How Significant Are USV’s Remaining UNI Holdings After This Sale? Despite these considerable sales, Union Square Ventures still maintains a significant stake in the Uniswap ecosystem. USV-linked wallets currently hold approximately 9.68 million UNI tokens. At current valuations, this translates to an impressive $96.7 million. This substantial remaining holding indicates that while USV is taking profits or rebalancing its portfolio, it retains considerable exposure to UNI. For many, a venture capital firm’s continued investment, even after strategic sales, signals a long-term belief in the underlying asset and its potential. Understanding the full scope of the USV UNI sale requires looking at both what was sold and what remains. Key details of USV’s UNI activity: Recent Sale: 731,000 UNI ($7.43 million) via Coinbase Prime. Previous Sale (December): 3.51 million UNI ($54.6 million) at $15.53 average. Current Holdings: Approximately 9.68 million UNI ($96.7 million). What Does This USV UNI Sale Mean for the Market? When a major venture capital firm like USV makes significant moves in the crypto market, it often sparks discussions and speculation. Large-scale token offloads, such as this USV UNI sale , can be interpreted in several ways: Profit Taking: Given the substantial value of the tokens sold, it’s plausible that USV is realizing gains from their investment. Portfolio Rebalancing: VC firms frequently adjust their holdings to manage risk, diversify investments, or allocate capital to new opportunities. Market Sentiment: While not necessarily a bearish signal, large sales by early investors can sometimes influence market sentiment, prompting others to assess their positions. It’s important to remember that these are just a few possibilities. USV’s actions reflect their specific investment strategy and do not necessarily dictate the future trajectory of UNI or the broader DeFi market. However, monitoring such transactions provides valuable insights into institutional behavior within the evolving digital asset landscape. The ongoing interest in the USV UNI sale highlights the transparency of on-chain data and its role in understanding market dynamics. In conclusion, the recent USV UNI sale of $7.43 million in UNI tokens marks another strategic move by Union Square Ventures. While the firm has realized significant profits from its UNI holdings, its substantial remaining stake of nearly $97 million underscores its continued belief in the Uniswap ecosystem. These large-scale transactions by influential venture capital firms offer a fascinating glimpse into how institutional players navigate the volatile yet promising world of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Union Square Ventures (USV)? A1: Union Square Ventures (USV) is a well-known New York-based venture capital firm. They are recognized for their early investments in prominent technology and internet companies, including several significant projects within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Q2: What is UNI? A2: UNI is the native governance token of Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. UNI token holders can participate in the governance of the Uniswap protocol, voting on key proposals and changes. Q3: Why did USV execute this UNI token sale? A3: Venture capital firms like USV often sell portions of their holdings for various strategic reasons, including taking profits on successful investments, rebalancing their portfolio to manage risk, or freeing up capital for new investment opportunities. It’s a common practice in the investment world. Q4: How much UNI does USV still hold after this sale? A4: Despite the recent sales, USV-linked wallets still hold a substantial amount of UNI. Reports indicate they retain approximately 9.68 million UNI tokens, valued at around $96.7 million at current market prices. Q5: Does a large USV UNI sale impact the token’s price? A5: While a large sale by a prominent investor can sometimes influence market sentiment and potentially cause short-term price fluctuations, the overall impact depends on various factors, including market liquidity, broader crypto trends, and the fundamental strength of the Uniswap protocol. It’s not always a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Did you find this analysis of the USV UNI sale insightful?

The new app supports major digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), enabling users to manage mining activity directly from their mobile devices. What is cloud mining? Cloud mining involves mining cryptocurrency by renting computing power from remote data centers, eliminating the need to own or maintain mining hardware.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rapidly emerging $0.035 altcoin, is drawing attention for its innovative DeFi protocols and growing adoption, signaling potential influence in the next crypto bull cycle. Mutuum Finance token price in presale stage 6 is $0.035. It will go up by 14.29% to $0.04 in presale stage 7. Investors moving in now will receive minimum 400% returns when the token will go live. Mutuum Finance already has more than $14.6 million raised and over 15400 investors. While Ethereum maintains its dominant role, analysts are increasingly monitoring smaller players like Mutuum Finance, whose unique approach to decentralized finance could shape market dynamics in unexpected ways. Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $4,482.74, reflecting a modest 0.63% increase over the previous close. Despite recent profit-taking and a slight retreat from its intraday high of $4,489.75, ETH maintains a strong position above key support levels. Analysts remain optimistic, with projections suggesting potential gains toward $5,500–$6,000 by the end of August, contingent upon sustained institutional inflows and a favorable macroeconomic environment. However, market participants should remain vigilant, as any significant downturn could test support around $4,000. In this context, emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance are gaining attention for their innovative DeFi solutions, which could influence broader market dynamics. Mutuum Finance Presale Succeeds, Receives 95.00 Trust Score in Audit Mutuum Finance is performing very well in the DeFi sector. It has a 95.0/100 trust score, audited and assured by Certik.

President Donald Trump unveiled the new account , @whitehouse, on Tuesday evening. His debut post featured the lines: “I am your voice” and “America, we are BACK!” before greeting viewers with a casual, “What’s up, TikTok?” Trump has often credited TikTok with helping secure his youth vote in the 2024 election against Democrat Kamala Harris. His personal campaign account, @realdonaldtrump, has grown to more than 15 million followers. The Trump administration is doubling down on the platform’s reach by launching an official government account. Former White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described TikTok as vital for showcasing “the historic successes President Trump has delivered” to the widest audience possible. “During his campaign, President Trump’s message was dominant on TikTok,” Leavitt said. “We intend to build on that success and communicate in ways no other administration has before.” The White House account will share short videos highlighting Trump’s policies, events, and direct messages—part of a broader strategy to engage younger, increasingly TV-averse voters through digital platforms. Security worries and court battles escalate The launch is happening as TikTok has an uncertain future in the United States. The app was ordered to stop operating under a law passed in 2024 by Jan. 19, 2025, unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells its United States assets. And when Trump moved back into the White House in January, he shelved the ban. He first extended the deadline to April, then to June, and now to Sept. 17, 2025. Each extension has drawn criticism from Congress. Both Republicans and Democrats in Washington have warned that TikTok could surrender American user data to the Chinese authorities or distribute propaganda . Past intelligence reports have said ByteDance is “beholden” to Beijing. Critics complain that the Trump administration has largely ignored those risks. Besides, Minnesota has sued TikTok, accusing the platform of preying on young people with addictive algorithms that harm their mental health. Attorney General Keith Ellison said the case is about deception and manipulation, arguing the company knew the risks but failed to act. The lawsuit, filed under state laws on deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud, adds Minnesota to about 24 states now suing TikTok, following a nationwide investigation launched in 2022. Educators in Minnesota say they have seen a direct link between heavy TikTok use and rising depression, anxiety, and shorter attention spans among students. The case comes as President Donald Trump continues efforts to broker a deal for American investors to take over TikTok from its Chinese parent ByteDance amid data security concerns. TikTok has denied the allegations. Trump wields TikTok amid security risks Trump embraced social media early on to forge his political brand. From Twitter in his first presidency to Truth Social in his second, he has taken to online platforms to circumvent traditional media and communicate directly with supporters. On Truth Social, he posts most days and uses the platform to announce policies, attack opponents, and rally his base. He still posts to X (the platform once known as Twitter) and Instagram, but has largely pulled back to maintain a presence across all the major platforms. TikTok, however, offers something different. Its algorithm-based feed has a predilection for short, zippy videos that can go viral across broad swaths of people. This makes it a powerful megaphone for political messages. Trump’s campaign realized this in 2024 as brief clips of rallies and soundbites went viral, boosting his standing among younger voters. Campaign strategists say no other app provides instant reach to millions of people who don’t normally follow politics. But TikTok is more than a campaign cudgel — it is also a national security headache. National security officials have warned that the app’s Chinese ownership could make it a tool for the Chinese government to conduct espionage. The issue is user privacy and the ability to alter what Americans see, hear, and believe subtly. This is what makes the White House’s embrace of TikTok so paradoxical. On the one hand, the administration is pouring energy into using the app to connect with Americans. Meanwhile, Trump himself has postponed but not killed a law that would potentially ban TikTok on national security grounds. Get seen where it counts.

Writing on Truth Social, Trump said : “Could somebody please inform Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can’t get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut. ‘Too Late’ is a disaster!” The post landed as housing data continues to show cracks, and building sentiment slumps across the country. Despite a small jump in home construction last month, builder confidence has fallen again, mortgage rates remain high, and incentives are being thrown around like candy. Economists see no improvement in sight, and Trump, now in his second term in the White House, is placing the blame directly on Powell for delaying rate cuts that he believes are long overdue. Homebuilders slash prices as demand stays weak Last month, housing starts in the U.S. increased by 5.2%, reaching an annualized rate of 1.43 million homes. This is the highest figure in five months and was driven mostly by a rise in multifamily project construction. Still, the mood among homebuilders is in the gutter. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to 32 in August, the lowest level since December 2022, down from 33 in July. Economists had expected it to move up to 34. The drop reflects deep concerns about affordability and buyer hesitation. NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes, who builds homes in Lexington, North Carolina, said, “Affordability continues to be the top challenge for the housing market and buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to drop to move forward.” Hughes also pointed to long-standing issues developers face with land regulation and other construction-related red tape. Conditions have forced over a third of homebuilders to cut prices, with the average cut landing at 5%. On top of that, 66% of firms are offering sales incentives—the highest since the pandemic. Buyers are hard to find, and those who are interested are holding off until interest rates come down. Meanwhile, builder optimism about future sales hasn’t budged, and current sales conditions have worsened. Regionally, the Northeast saw confidence nosedive to the lowest point since January 2023. Sentiment in the South and Midwest stayed flat, while the West saw only a small improvement. Buyer foot traffic, though slightly higher than May, remains weak overall. Mortgage rates fall slightly but pressure builds on Powell The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.58% last week. That’s the lowest since October, and almost half a percentage point lower than where it stood at the start of this year. But this drop hasn’t been enough to shift the market. Buyers are still waiting, and builders are still bleeding. Robert Dietz, Chief Economist at NAHB, said, “Given a slowing housing market and other recent economic data, the Fed’s monetary policy committee should return to lowering the federal funds rate, which will reduce financing costs for housing construction and indirectly help mortgage interest rates.” But Powell hasn’t moved. All eyes are now on the Fed’s next policy meeting, where expectations for a cut are growing louder. This week, the Census Bureau is set to release July data on new home groundbreakings and permit filings. The outlook doesn’t look promising. In June, single-family housing starts dropped to an 11-month low, and permits fell to the lowest level in over two years. Economists told Reuters they don’t expect much better from July’s numbers.

This level is just 15% away from the coin’s all-time high. Chainlink is also making noise with a sharp breakout, showing signs of a potential 60% rise that could set up new highs. But the project turning heads is not trading on exchanges yet. Cold Wallet , now in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998, has already onboarded over 2 million users from its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition. With Stage 1 starting at $0.007 and a confirmed listing at $0.3517, it shows an ROI window sharper than ETH or LINK. Ethereum’s ETF Inflows Fuel $4,800 Outlook Ethereum is trading close to $4,293 after record ETF demand. A single day saw $1.02 billion flow into spot ETH ETFs. Leading the charge was BlackRock, which purchased 150,000 ETH worth $6.40 million. Fidelity and other funds followed, bringing total ETF inflows to $10.8 billion. This price marks Ethereum’s strongest level in more than two years and leaves it just 15% below the record highs from November 2021. On-chain data adds to the bullish case, showing ETH balances on exchanges at a nine-year low. With less supply available, selling pressure is falling. The technical picture also supports the case for growth. Resistance sits at $4,352, with price targets stretching to $4,800. If institutional demand continues, Ethereum could break higher, making it one of the most closely watched assets in this cycle. Chainlink Could Push Toward $50 Chainlink has shown strength after clearing long-term resistance. The breakout signals the chance for a 60% gain, with demand building and supply falling. Prices recently pushed through a trend that capped growth for months. The project’s progress is not limited to charts. A new partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) will deliver financial-grade data to blockchains. This expands its utility far beyond DeFi, strengthening its long-term role. Analysts point to several targets if the current trend holds. In the short run, LINK could push to around $26. Over the next few months, a rise to $31–$32 looks possible. Longer term, LINK may reach $35–$36. For those seeking the next strong mover, its technicals and expanding network utility suggest further gains are possible. Cold Wallet Presale Surpasses $6.3M Cold Wallet is changing the way launches unfold. Instead of raising funds first and searching for adoption later, it is entering the market with more than 2 million users in place. This reach comes from its $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet. Its model centers on utility, not speculation. Every swap, bridge, or transfer through Cold Wallet generates cashback rewards. That means the presale is not about testing interest but scaling an active user economy before the official listing. Stage 17 pricing sits at $0.00998, compared to $0.007 in Stage 1. Each new stage edges closer to the $0.3517 confirmed listing price. With $6.3 million already raised and more than 700 million coins sold, demand is climbing quickly. This momentum shows why the presale stages are closing faster than expected. As the window shrinks, so does the ROI gap. Those who wait until after launch may find the highest returns already gone. Why Cold Wallet Could Outpace ETH and LINK Ethereum’s strength comes from institutional demand, and Chainlink’s progress is tied to expanding partnerships. Both could generate sizable gains, but they remain tied to market swings and external factors. Cold Wallet offers a different angle. Priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, it carries a projected upside of 3,423% to its $0.3517 launch level. Unlike ETH or LINK, it begins its journey with millions of users and a functioning cashback system. This combination of adoption, utility, and growth potential sets it apart. Cold Wallet is not promising future development; it is already delivering value before listing. While Ethereum and Chainlink could continue to climb, Cold Wallet’s structure offers a quicker and potentially more certain path to exponential returns.

Solana is showing strength as it approaches $200, backed by technical breakouts and rising volume. PEPE is holding ground after a $40 million whale sell-off, with retail interest driving its recent price action. While both coins reflect short-term traction, BlockDAG is offering more than price movement. Its 200 ETH giveaway ties immediate incentives to deeper investment, rewarding buyers based on their presale volume. With $377 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG positions itself as a top coin project with a value-backed participation model. ETH Is the Prize, BDAG Is the Path: A Win-Win Formula for Investors BlockDAG’s 200 ETH giveaway is more than a headline. Instead, it’s a calculated incentive strategy designed to convert buyer interest into sustained commitment. The structure is simple: the more BDAG you purchase during the presale, the greater your odds of winning up to $1 million in Ethereum. There are no auctions. No complex rules. Just pure participation tied to investment. Consequently, this format flips the traditional model. Instead of separating speculation from utility, BlockDAG blends them. Investors are not only buying into a top coin project with strong long-term fundamentals, but also entering a high-reward competition with immediate upside. As a result, it’s a dual benefit that encourages faster decisions while reinforcing brand loyalty. Moreover, what sets this apart is BlockDAG’s credibility. After a successful 10 BTC auction that paid out over $1 million in gains, the project has shown it delivers on its promises. The numbers back it up: the presale has raised $377 million so far, with over 25 billion BDAG sold. Currently in batch 29, the token is priced at $0.0276, a 2,660% return since batch 1. Ultimately, this isn’t a short-term pump. Rather, it’s a long-game strategy that aligns buyer interest with project growth. As the mainnet approaches and momentum builds, this ETH giveaway functions as both an entry point and a confidence signal. For those tracking presale performance with an eye for real opportunity, BlockDAG continues to separate itself as a top coin project where short-term value and long-term vision are clearly aligned. Solana Price Momentum: Eyes on a Break Above $200 Currently, Solana is riding a notable wave of SOL price momentum, having broken out from a rising channel and closing in on the $200 level after bouncing from sub‑$160 earlier in August. This breakout reflects a series of higher highs and higher lows, suggesting buyers remain in control. Furthermore, futures volume has surged by over 66 percent to $44 billion, and open interest has jumped nearly 17 percent, both bolstering confidence in the strength behind the move. On the short‑term charts, however, technical indicators remain bullish yet cautionary: the RSI sits deep in overbought territory at 72.5, and prices are trading above the upper Bollinger Band, hinting at a possible short pause or pullback. Retail Strength Holds Ground as PEPE Coin Price Eyes Breakout Despite a $40 million sell-off from major holders, PEPE coin price posted a 9% gain, defying bearish pressure with growing retail momentum. Notably, the number of wallets holding PEPE increased from 207,000 to 211,000 in just a week, reflecting renewed interest from smaller investors. Meanwhile, technical signals remain mixed. While the On-Balance Volume shows consistent inflows, it hasn’t surpassed recent highs. In addition, bull-bear power has shifted toward buyers, though the intensity remains lower than previous peaks. At the same time, price action is now consolidating within a descending triangle, a pattern that often precedes a sharp move. If retail demand continues to hold firm, a breakout above this pattern could push PEPE up another 20%. Conversely, a breakdown would open room for deeper corrections. BlockDAG Outpaces Short-Term Hype with Long-Term Strategy While Solana tracks upward and PEPE leans on retail support, both rely heavily on short bursts of momentum. BlockDAG takes a different approach by connecting incentives to commitment through its 200 ETH giveaway. Instead of focusing solely on price, it builds value through participation, encouraging buyers to become part of its growth story. With $377 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI from batch one, BlockDAG’s presale structure offers more than a market reaction. It sets up a foundation where rewards and trust grow together, positioning it as a top coin project with a clear, steady purpose.

50364432,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=806865,1755655236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50364432.jpeg,Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Nearing Profit Zones That Marked Past Market Tops,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-warns-bitcoin-nearing-profit-zones-that-marked-past-market-tops/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has once again slipped under the $120,000 price mark, retracing after reaching a new all-time high above $124,000 last week. As of the latest market data, BTC is trading around $115,557, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 7% below its peak. This price movement suggests that the asset is currently consolidating after its recent rally, leaving market participants watching closely for the next directional move. Meanwhile, analysts are turning to on-chain data for signals on Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. One such perspective comes from PelinayPA, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, who examined long-term holder (LTH) behavior using a set of profit and loss metrics. The findings highlight that while profit-taking has begun, current selling levels remain below historical extremes seen in past bull market peaks. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP, ETH’s Pullback: Key Factors Behind The Recent Drop Tracking Long-Term Holder Signals According to PelinayPA, the LTH analysis uses several indicators to measure the relationship between Bitcoin’s price and the cost basis of long-term holders. Profit and loss bands, ranging from 150% to 1,000% above cost basis, help determine when Bitcoin enters zones historically associated with a higher risk of market tops. When BTC approaches the +500% band, it has often coincided with heightened selling activity and eventual cycle peaks. The analysis also incorporates a Spending Binary Indicator, which reflects the intensity of LTH selling, alongside “High Spending” signals that typically emerge near market tops and “Bottom Alerts” that occur during deep corrections. Reviewing past cycles, PelinayPA pointed to 2017 and 2021, where bear market downturns followed heavy long-term holder selling, while the 2022–2023 bottom was marked by multiple loss realization alerts around the $15,000–$20,000 range. Currently, Bitcoin sits within the 150%–350% profit band, leaving potential room for further growth, though the risk of a market top rises as the asset approaches the higher bands. The analyst noted that while green profit-taking bars are visible today, they remain well below the levels observed in earlier cycle peaks. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Short, Mid, and Long Term In outlining the potential scenarios, PelinayPA suggested that Bitcoin may remain range-bound in the short term, as controlled profit-taking by long-term holders limits upside momentum. However, if accumulation and broader demand continue, the price could advance into the $124,000–$178,000 range, corresponding to the higher profit thresholds on the LTH model. For the mid-term outlook, extending into late 2025, the analyst cautioned that if long-term holder selling intensifies like in 2021, Bitcoin could be nearing a cycle top. In such a scenario, the asset might peak above $150,000 before the next major correction. Looking ahead to 2026, the absence of new bottom alerts suggests that the market is still within the later stages of the ongoing bull cycle, rather than transitioning into a confirmed bear market.

50364441,560245,1755655243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50364441.jpeg,Crypto Giants Team Up: New Nonprofit Aims to Shape Washington’s View on Blockchain & AI,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-new-nonprofit-washingtons-view-blockchain-ai/,"A new nonprofit backed by some of the most prominent players in the crypto asset space has launched with the goal of improving how US lawmakers engage with emerging technologies. The American Innovation Project (AIP), supported by Coinbase, Uniswap Labs, Kraken, Paradigm, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG), officially began operations this week. The organization was formed to serve as a conduit between policymakers and the technology industry at a time when regulation of digital assets and artificial intelligence is moving to the forefront of US economic policy. According to its mission statement, AIP aims to create forums where lawmakers, industry leaders , and researchers can engage directly to better understand the implications of blockchain, AI, and related innovations. Mission and Structure of the American Innovation Project Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute, will lead AIP as president. In a statement, Smith explained that the nonprofit’s objective is to provide legislators with “the knowledge, context, and tools they need as they consider timely rules and regulations that meet the moment.” She emphasized that the group intends to promote bipartisan dialogue, bridging political divides to ensure regulatory decisions keep pace with rapid technological change. AIP plans to host a series of events, including workshops and roundtable discussions , designed to translate complex technological developments into accessible policy discussions. These gatherings will cover a broad range of topics, from the regulatory treatment of stablecoins to the implications of AI in financial services and national competitiveness. By engaging experts across sectors, AIP hopes to position itself as a central resource for government officials. The organization has secured seed funding from the Cedar Innovation Foundation, along with a $1 million contribution from Digital Currency Group. Mark Murphy, president of DCG, highlighted the initiative’s importance, stating that “the future of the U.S. economy will be shaped by the choices we make today in developing emerging technologies.” Policy Context and Industry Backing The launch of AIP comes at a moment of heightened activity in Washington regarding digital asset regulation. In recent months, lawmakers have advanced significant bills addressing cryptocurrency oversight . Last month, President Donald signed legislation establishing a federal framework for stablecoins, while the House of Representatives passed a comprehensive measure to regulate the crypto industry more broadly. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has begun “Project Crypto,” an initiative to update the agency’s rules governing custody , trading, and token distributions. Against this backdrop, AIP’s efforts to improve dialogue between the private sector and policymakers highlight the growing recognition that effective regulation requires technical fluency. Its founding supporters represent a cross-section of the digital asset ecosystem, from exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken to venture firms such as Paradigm, as well as associations like the National Cryptocurrency Association.

Onlookers and market analysts quickly took note when Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service, reported a substantial movement of Bitcoin. This particular transaction involved 2,000 BTC, which moved from the digital asset financial service provider Hashkey to a wallet whose owner remains unidentified. This single BTC transfer holds an estimated value of approximately $226 million, highlighting its immense scale and potential market impact. What Happened with This Significant BTC Transfer? The core of the news revolves around a large-scale Bitcoin movement. Specifically, 2,000 Bitcoin, worth a staggering $226 million at the time of the report, departed from Hashkey’s holdings. This type of transaction, often termed a ‘whale movement,’ immediately draws attention due to the sheer volume of assets involved. It signifies a major shift in digital wealth. Source of Funds: Hashkey, a well-known entity in the digital asset space. Destination: An ‘unknown wallet,’ meaning the recipient’s identity is not publicly linked to the address. Reported By: Whale Alert, a service dedicated to tracking large cryptocurrency transactions. Such a substantial BTC transfer can often precede significant market activity or indicate a strategic shift by a large holder. Why Do Large BTC Transfers Capture Attention? Large Bitcoin movements, especially those involving significant sums like this BTC transfer , always spark curiosity and discussion within the crypto community. These transactions are often seen as indicators of potential future market trends or shifts in investor sentiment. When a ‘whale’ moves a large amount of Bitcoin, it suggests a strategic decision is underway, which could impact supply, demand, or overall market stability. Consider these key reasons why such transfers matter: Market Sentiment: Large movements can influence whether the market feels bullish (optimistic) or bearish (pessimistic). Supply Dynamics: A large transfer to an exchange might suggest an intent to sell, while a transfer away could mean holding or cold storage. Transparency vs. Privacy: While transactions are on a public ledger, the identity behind an ‘unknown wallet’ remains private, adding a layer of mystery. Decoding the “Unknown Wallet”: Challenges and Speculations The term “unknown wallet” is crucial here. On the blockchain, every transaction is transparent, but the identities behind the wallet addresses are not always public. This anonymity is a core feature of many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Therefore, while we know the Bitcoin moved, identifying the exact entity that received this BTC transfer is challenging. Speculations often arise regarding the purpose of such a move: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals often use OTC desks for significant trades to avoid impacting exchange prices. Exchange Rebalancing: Exchanges sometimes move funds between their own cold and hot wallets for security or operational reasons. Institutional Accumulation: A large entity might be accumulating Bitcoin for long-term holding. Security Relocation: Funds might be moving to a more secure cold storage solution. Without further information, the true intent behind this particular BTC transfer remains a subject of speculation. Potential Market Implications of This BTC Transfer The immediate impact of a large BTC transfer is not always clear-cut. While some might interpret it as a precursor to selling pressure, others may see it as a sign of long-term holding or institutional adoption. The market’s reaction largely depends on broader economic conditions and prevailing crypto sentiment. Investors typically monitor such whale movements closely, as they can sometimes signal upcoming volatility or stability. For instance, if the BTC moved to an exchange, it could suggest an intention to sell, potentially increasing supply and putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, if it moved to a private cold storage wallet, it might indicate a long-term holding strategy, reducing immediate supply and potentially supporting prices. The recent BTC transfer from Hashkey to an unknown wallet is a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the specific intentions behind this $226 million move remain private, such large transactions underscore the significant capital flowing within the digital asset ecosystem. Monitoring these whale movements provides valuable, albeit sometimes ambiguous, insights into the market’s pulse and potential future directions. As the crypto space continues to mature, understanding these large-scale transfers becomes increasingly vital for investors and enthusiasts alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “whale movement” in crypto? A “whale movement” refers to a large transaction of cryptocurrency, typically involving a significant amount of a particular asset, executed by a single individual or entity (known as a “whale”) that holds a substantial portion of that asset. Why is the destination wallet often “unknown”? Blockchain transactions are pseudonymous. While the wallet address is public, the real-world identity of the person or entity controlling that address is not inherently linked or revealed, making it an “unknown” wallet to the public. Does a large BTC transfer always mean a price change is coming? Not necessarily. While large transfers can sometimes precede price volatility, they can also be for internal purposes (like exchange rebalancing or moving to cold storage) and may not directly lead to immediate price changes. It depends on the context and the ultimate destination of the funds. How can I track large crypto transactions like this BTC transfer? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking and reporting large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Many crypto news sites and analytics platforms also provide updates on significant movements. If you found this analysis insightful, share it with your network!

Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a significant movement of 2,068 Bitcoin (BTC) from an unidentified wallet to Hashkey, a well-known digital asset financial services group. This transaction, valued at approximately $233 million, immediately captured the attention of market observers and analysts alike. Such large-scale movements often signal potential shifts or strategies within the crypto ecosystem, prompting questions about their implications. What Does This Significant BTC Transfer Mean? This particular BTC transfer involves a substantial sum, making it noteworthy. When a large quantity of Bitcoin moves from an ‘unknown’ or ‘cold’ wallet to an exchange, it typically sparks curiosity. The ‘unknown wallet’ refers to an address not publicly associated with any known entity, adding an element of mystery to the transaction. Conversely, Hashkey is a regulated platform, suggesting a move towards a more formal or institutional environment. Key aspects of this transaction include: Scale: 2,068 BTC represents a significant portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, impacting potential market dynamics. Origin: The ‘unknown wallet’ status indicates a holder who has maintained anonymity, possibly a long-term holder or an early adopter. Destination: Hashkey’s role as a licensed digital asset platform implies a move towards liquidity, custody, or regulated trading. Why Do Large BTC Transfers Spark Investor Interest? Large BTC transfers , especially those involving ‘whale’ wallets, often generate considerable buzz. Investors and traders closely monitor these movements because they can sometimes precede significant market events. For instance, a large influx of BTC to an exchange might suggest an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and exerting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a large withdrawal from an exchange could indicate accumulation or a move to long-term storage, which might be seen as bullish. However, it is crucial to remember that a large BTC transfer does not automatically predict market direction. These transactions can serve various purposes: Consolidating holdings Moving funds for over-the-counter (OTC) deals Rebalancing portfolios Preparing for institutional investment Who is Hashkey and What Could This BTC Transfer Signal? Hashkey Group is a prominent end-to-end digital asset financial services group based in Asia. They operate regulated exchanges, provide asset management, and offer blockchain solutions. The transfer of 2,068 BTC to Hashkey could signal several possibilities: Institutional Activity: Hashkey serves institutional clients. This BTC transfer could be part of a larger institutional investment strategy, where a fund or corporation is either acquiring or rebalancing its Bitcoin holdings through a regulated channel. Custody Services: The Bitcoin might be moving into Hashkey’s secure custody solutions, indicating a desire for professional, regulated storage rather than self-custody in an unknown wallet. OTC Trading: The funds might be earmarked for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, which allows large transactions to occur without directly impacting exchange order books. Understanding the destination helps contextualize the transfer. Hashkey’s reputation as a compliant and secure platform adds a layer of professionalism to this significant move. The Enduring Mystery of the Unknown Wallet While the destination of this substantial BTC transfer is clear, the origin remains shrouded in anonymity. This highlights a fundamental characteristic of blockchain technology: transparency of transactions combined with the pseudonymity of participants. The identity behind the ‘unknown wallet’ could be a long-term holder, a private individual, or even an entity moving assets for strategic reasons. Without further information, the exact motive behind this particular transfer remains speculative, adding to the intrigue of such whale movements. In conclusion, the movement of 2,068 BTC to Hashkey is a significant event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate implications are subject to interpretation, such large-scale BTC transfers are always worth monitoring for insights into market sentiment, institutional adoption, and the evolving landscape of digital assets. It reminds us that behind the numbers, there are often strategic decisions shaping the future of Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale alert’ in cryptocurrency? A: A ‘whale alert’ refers to a notification system that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions, often involving significant amounts of Bitcoin or other digital assets. These alerts help observers identify major movements by large holders, or ‘whales’. Q2: What is Hashkey? A: Hashkey Group is a prominent digital asset financial services group based in Asia. They offer a range of services including regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, asset management, and blockchain solutions, primarily catering to institutional and professional investors. Q3: Why are large BTC transfers important to track? A: Large BTC transfers are important because they can signal potential market activity, such as selling pressure if funds move to exchanges, or accumulation if they move to cold storage. They offer insights into the strategies of major holders and institutional players, influencing market sentiment. Q4: Does this BTC transfer mean Bitcoin’s price will drop? A: Not necessarily. While a large transfer to an exchange can indicate an intent to sell, it could also be for other purposes like OTC deals, rebalancing, or moving to regulated custody. The price impact depends on the actual intent and subsequent actions of the recipient. Q5: How secure are such large BTC transfers? A: Bitcoin transactions are secured by the underlying blockchain technology, which uses cryptography to ensure immutability and prevent double-spending. However, the security of the funds ultimately depends on the security practices of the sender and recipient wallets/exchanges. Share This Insightful Article!

Whales are loading up, meme coins are exploding, and presale stages are closing faster than ever. Just last week, Neiro made waves with its lightning-fast community growth, while Memecoin shocked skeptics with back-to-back exchange listings. These shifts highlight one truth: momentum drives everything in crypto, and timing is everything. That’s why Arctic Pablo Coin is creating so much noise right now. Sitting at its 37th location, called “Ice Ice Baby,” Pablo is not just another meme coin. It’s a full-blown adventure. With a presale price of $0.00088, more than $3.5 million raised, and a built-in 66% APY staking program, Arctic Pablo is staging itself as one of the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025. Every location unlocks new scarcity thanks to its token burn system, giving investors both urgency and confidence that supply will stay tight. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) — The Adventure-Packed Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 In the heart of an icy expanse, where myths intertwine with reality, Arctic Pablo Coin embarks on a journey across frozen realms. Each presale phase isn’t just a number—it’s a new location with a backstory, a bonus stage that keeps fueling frenzy. Right now, the 37th location, “Ice Ice Baby,” is live at $0.00088, with Pablo having already secured more than $3.5 million in raised funds. For investors, this isn’t just a presale—it’s a narrative that blends gamification, scarcity, and wealth creation. Arctic Pablo is more than a meme coin—it’s a story. It invites investors to join Pablo on his myth-busting ride through icy lands, discovering shimmering APC tokens that promise ROI beyond imagination. At this current presale point, ROI for earliest joiners is already clocking over 5,766%. With projections running as high as 11,263% if it hits $0.1, the clock is ticking. And here’s the kicker: the presale is ending soon, and when the listing hits $0.008, today’s entry point will vanish for good. The tokenomics back this up. With a total supply of 221.2 billion APC, half of it (110.6 billion) goes directly into public presale. Weekly unsold tokens get burned, permanently reducing supply. At listing, $APC will open at $0.008, guaranteeing more than 809% ROI for anyone buying at the current location. Analysts project an eventual rise to $0.1, which would hand out more than 11,263% ROI. For earliest buyers, ROI already stands at 5,766%. That’s why Arctic Pablo stands out as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 —its entire journey creates urgency to jump in before the next location closes. But the attraction doesn’t stop at price. The 66% APY staking program transforms Pablo into a yield engine. Simply stake tokens and watch them multiply, vested for just two months post-launch. Add referral rewards, community competitions, and a two-fold burn system, and the mechanics keep buyers locked in. Even a $50,000 stake today equals 113,636,000 APCs, ballooning to more than $909,000 when the listing price goes live. Throw in the 200% bonus coin offer with the code BONUS100, and it’s clear: this is the bonus stage nobody wants to miss. Neiro — Viral Energy Meets Meme Power Neiro has quickly turned itself into one of the most talked-about projects in the meme ecosystem. Originally dismissed by critics as “just another Doge spin-off,” Neiro defied the odds with viral traction on X (Twitter) and TikTok. Its strength lies in community hype, which fuels short-term spikes. Just this month, Neiro recorded a trading surge after partnerships with prominent influencers pushed daily volume past the $200 million mark. However, unlike Pablo, Neiro lacks a staking program or token burn mechanism. This means sustainability relies heavily on community buzz. Still, its fast adoption curve proves that in crypto, virality can outpace mechanics. With a recent price breakout near $0.00013, investors see short-term ROI potential if the rally sustains. Memecoin — The OG of Meme Branding Memecoin, true to its name, has become the “brand coin” of the meme world. Built as both a token and a marketing engine, celebrity investors and entertainment giants have picked it up. Recent listings on top-tier exchanges added even more liquidity, pushing its market cap over $400 million. For a token built purely on brand identity, that’s a strong signal of staying power. Memecoin isn’t about elaborate mechanics like Arctic Pablo or hype-first models like Neiro. Instead, it markets itself as the cultural backbone of meme trading. By leveraging partnerships with gaming studios and NFT platforms, Memecoin is building an ecosystem that keeps it relevant beyond just speculation. Its steady growth model has allowed it to carve a niche as one of the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 for traders looking for cultural relevance combined with mainstream adoption. Final Thoughts Based on the research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025. With its unique location-based presale system, token burns, and 66% APY staking program, it’s offering investors structured pathways to extraordinary ROI. Neiro rides the viral meme train, while Memecoin plays the role of branding giant. But only Pablo blends myth, mechanics, and momentum. Arctic Pablo’s bonus code BONUS100 with 200% extra coins sweetens the pot even further. Join the Pablo meme coin presale now—before the gates to the next location lock shut.

Recently, two Nasdaq-listed companies, BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, have made headlines for their significant Ethereum holdings . Their accumulation strategies, particularly at average costs below the current market price, highlight a fascinating trend in corporate crypto adoption. What Are These Strategic Ethereum Holdings? On-chain analyst @EmberCN reported that BitMine Immersion Technologies, primarily known as a Bitcoin miner, began accumulating Ethereum (ETH) on July 9. By August 17, this company held a substantial 1,523,373 ETH. Their average acquisition cost stood at an impressive $3,730. This demonstrates a calculated approach to building their Ethereum holdings . BitMine Immersion Technologies: Acquired 1,523,373 ETH at an average cost of $3,730. SharpLink Gaming: Started buying on June 13, accumulating 740,760 ETH at an average cost of $3,478. To put this into perspective, CoinMarketCap data showed ETH trading at $4,072.50, despite a 5.44% drop in the past 24 hours. Both companies acquired their Ethereum holdings at prices significantly below this figure, indicating a shrewd entry point. Why Are Companies Building Such Significant Ethereum Holdings? The decision by publicly traded companies to accumulate substantial amounts of a volatile asset like Ethereum is not taken lightly. Several factors likely influence these strategic Ethereum holdings : Long-Term Belief: These firms may hold a strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential, viewing it as a foundational asset for the decentralized web. Diversification: For BitMine, primarily a Bitcoin miner, adding ETH to its balance sheet provides diversification within the crypto sector. DeFi and NFT Growth: Ethereum remains the leading blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Exposure to ETH offers a stake in these booming ecosystems. Staking Opportunities: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, companies can potentially generate passive income by staking their Ethereum holdings . This trend suggests a growing institutional comfort level with digital assets beyond just Bitcoin. What Do These Ethereum Holdings Signify for the Market? The accumulation of significant Ethereum holdings by Nasdaq-listed entities sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It underscores increasing institutional interest and validation of Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. When established companies like BitMine and SharpLink commit capital, it can bolster investor confidence. Moreover, these substantial holdings could influence market dynamics. If these companies continue to accumulate, it could reduce the circulating supply, potentially creating upward price pressure. Conversely, any large-scale selling could lead to downward pressure. For now, their average acquisition costs suggest they are in a favorable position, holding their ETH below current market values. Key Takeaways from BitMine and SharpLink’s Ethereum Holdings The actions of BitMine and SharpLink offer valuable lessons for anyone interested in the crypto market: Strategic Accumulation: Both companies acquired their ETH at attractive price points, demonstrating careful market timing. Institutional Validation: Their involvement highlights a growing acceptance of Ethereum among publicly traded firms. Diversification Benefits: For miners or gaming companies, adding crypto assets like ETH can broaden their investment portfolios. Long-Term Vision: These significant Ethereum holdings likely reflect a long-term bullish outlook on the asset’s future utility and value. Understanding these corporate strategies provides a glimpse into the evolving landscape of digital asset investment. The strategic accumulation of Ethereum holdings by companies like BitMine and SharpLink is more than just a financial transaction; it represents a significant vote of confidence in the future of decentralized technologies. Their ability to acquire large quantities of ETH at favorable average costs positions them well for potential future gains, and their actions certainly warrant attention from the wider crypto community. As the digital asset space matures, such institutional movements will likely become increasingly common, shaping market trends and validating the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.823 Market cap $824.91M Trading volume $239.21M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.8713 24-hour low $0.8174 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.82% 50-day SMA $0.9753 14-Day RSI 43.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 56 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $1.2625 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF shows signs of stabilization above the $0.799 support with modest upside momentum Breaking above resistance at $0.847-$0.916 will determine if recovery can gain traction. The observed volume decline suggests a consolidation phase before the next major directional move. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart The daily WIF chart for August 20 displays a modest recovery with the price at $0.830, up 0.36%, attempting to stabilize after the brutal selloff from highs near $1.030. The coin has found temporary support around the $0.799 level, marked by the lower Bollinger Band, while the middle band sits at $0.916, representing the first major resistance hurdle. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The descending trendline from the peak continues to cap upside moves around $0.920-$0.930, creating a formidable barrier for any sustained rally attempt. Volume has contracted significantly to 30.92M. The RSI at 47.17 indicates neutral momentum territory, while price remains trapped between the critical $0.799 support and $0.916 resistance zone. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour timeframe shows WIF attempting to build a base above the $0.813-$0.810 support cluster. The Alligator indicator shows all three lines converging around current price levels, suggesting a potential breakout scenario in either direction. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview Most notably, price has broken above the short-term descending trendline and is testing the $0.841 resistance level, with the next major obstacle at $0.847. The OBV at 3.45M shows declining volume participation, indicating that while selling pressure has eased, strong buying conviction remains absent. The consolidation pattern between $0.813-$0.847 suggests WIF is preparing for its next directional move. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7138 BUY SMA 5 $0.7987 BUY SMA 10 $0.9072 SELL SMA 21 $0.9181 SELL SMA 50 $0.9753 SELL SMA 100 $0.9796 SELL SMA 200 $1.2625 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9558 SELL EMA 5 $0.9503 SELL EMA 10 $0.8890 SELL EMA 21 $0.7649 BUY EMA 50 $0.7028 BUY EMA 100 $0.9222 SELL EMA 200 $1.3250 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF appears to be at a critical juncture where a break above $0.847-$0.850 could target the $0.916 resistance, while failure to hold $0.813 support opens the door to retest $0.799 lows. The immediate bias remains neutral with slight bullish undertones. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Recent data reveals that Bitcoin’s (BTC) 30-day options delta skew on Deribit has surged to 12%, marking its highest point in over four months. This crucial indicator often reflects market sentiment, and its current reading suggests a notable shift in how traders perceive future price movements. While a high skew typically points to apprehension, understanding its full implications requires a deeper look into its mechanics and historical context. What is the Bitcoin Options Market Skew Telling Us? Understanding the 30-day options delta skew is vital for grasping the current sentiment in the Bitcoin options market . This gauge measures the relative pricing of call and put options. It essentially tells us which side of the market – bullish or bearish – traders are willing to pay a premium for. Under neutral market conditions, this skew typically hovers between -6% and +6%. This range indicates a relatively balanced view between upside potential and downside risk. A reading above 10%, like the current 12%, indicates elevated fear among participants. It suggests a significantly higher demand for put options compared to call options. Put options provide the right to sell an asset at a specific price, serving as insurance against price drops. Therefore, a surge in their demand signals that a significant portion of the market is bracing for potential downside volatility in BTC, indicating a collective defensive posture. This metric is a powerful tool for gauging short-term market expectations, offering a glimpse into the collective anxiety or confidence of professional traders. Decoding the Fear: Why is the Bitcoin Options Market Reacting This Way? Why would the Bitcoin options market suddenly exhibit such a strong signal of fear? Several factors could contribute to this shift in sentiment. Traders might be reacting to a combination of macroeconomic uncertainties, such as inflation concerns or interest rate hikes, which can dampen appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Additionally, anticipation of upcoming regulatory announcements or a general cooling-off period after recent price rallies could prompt investors to secure their gains or hedge against potential pullbacks. This heightened demand for downside protection often reflects a collective anxiety about the immediate future of Bitcoin’s price. It’s a snapshot of prevailing short-term expectations, where market participants are actively seeking to mitigate potential losses rather than aggressively betting on further rallies. This proactive hedging highlights a cautious approach among those active in the options space. Historical Insights: Does Fear Always Lead to a Dip in Bitcoin? Interestingly, a high fear signal in the Bitcoin options market does not always guarantee a price downturn. History offers a compelling counter-example that challenges this assumption, suggesting that extreme fear can sometimes precede a strong recovery or even a new rally. The last time this specific skew reached a similar level (13%) was on April 7. At that time, many feared a significant correction. Following that peak, BTC did experience a brief dip, falling below $74,500. This initial reaction aligned with the fear signal. However, what happened next was remarkable: Bitcoin quickly reversed course, surging significantly to reach $104,150 by May 8. This demonstrates that the market can surprise, turning perceived weakness into strength. This historical precedent suggests that while the current skew indicates caution, it doesn’t necessarily signal the definitive end of Bitcoin’s impressive rally. Instead, it might represent a moment of market re-evaluation and consolidation before its next major move. Such periods of extreme sentiment often precede notable shifts, both positive and negative. Navigating the Bitcoin Options Market: Actionable Insights For investors and traders, understanding these signals from the Bitcoin options market is crucial. While the current fear might seem concerning, it’s important to approach it with a balanced perspective. Consider these actionable insights: Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: If you’re concerned about short-term volatility, reassess your portfolio’s exposure to BTC. Adjusting position sizes or setting stop-loss orders can help manage risk effectively. Look Beyond the Immediate: Short-term fear can sometimes create valuable buying opportunities for long-term holders. Periods of high put demand might indicate a capitulation point, potentially signaling a floor for prices. Diversify Your Strategy: Do not rely solely on one indicator. Combine options market data with fundamental analysis, technical charts, and broader macroeconomic trends for a more comprehensive view. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on other market indicators, on-chain data, and relevant news that could influence Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Understanding the full picture helps in making informed decisions. The current skew highlights that many are hedging against downside, but it also presents a scenario where a potential bounce could surprise those overly focused on bearish outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of a well-rounded strategy. In conclusion, the surge in Bitcoin’s 30-day options delta skew to a four-month high undeniably signals elevated fear within the Bitcoin options market . While this indicates that many traders are bracing for potential downside, historical data reminds us that such fear signals do not always predict a crash. Sometimes, they precede significant recoveries, offering a nuanced perspective. Investors should remain vigilant, understand the intricacies of these signals, and make informed decisions based on a comprehensive view of the market, rather than succumbing to panic. The market’s current apprehension could be a precursor to its next decisive move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a high Bitcoin options delta skew mean? A high Bitcoin options delta skew, typically above 10%, indicates that traders are paying a premium for put options compared to call options. This suggests a collective sentiment of fear or anticipation of downside price movement for Bitcoin. Is a high skew always bearish for Bitcoin? Not necessarily. While it signals fear, historical data shows instances where a high skew preceded a brief dip followed by a significant rally, as seen in April 2024. It suggests caution but not always a definitive crash. How can I use the options skew in my trading strategy? You can use the options skew as an indicator of market sentiment. A high skew might suggest a potential short-term pullback, but also a possible contrarian buying opportunity if combined with other bullish indicators, especially for long-term investors. What is the Bitcoin options market? The Bitcoin options market is a financial market where traders buy and sell options contracts, which give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) Bitcoin at a specified price on or before a certain date. Where does the 30-day options delta skew data come from? The data for the 30-day options delta skew often comes from major cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges like Deribit, which is a primary platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum options trading.

On August 19, U.S. spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs experienced a staggering $422.29 million in net outflows. This marks the second-largest daily withdrawal since these investment products first launched, prompting many to ask about the underlying reasons for such a substantial movement. What Caused This Significant Shift in U.S. Spot ETH ETFs? While the immediate cause for such a large outflow from U.S. spot ETH ETFs isn’t explicitly stated in the initial report, several factors can influence investor behavior in the volatile crypto market. For instance, broader market sentiment plays a crucial role, often reacting to macroeconomic news or regulatory developments. Additionally, changes in Ethereum’s price performance itself or strategic portfolio rebalancing by large institutional investors could trigger such movements. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for grasping the full picture of why capital flows in and out of these digital asset vehicles. Such significant withdrawals highlight the dynamic nature of the crypto investment landscape, where sentiment can shift rapidly. Breaking Down the Outflows: Who Led the Charge Among U.S. Spot ETH ETFs? The data clearly shows which funds bore the brunt of these significant withdrawals, offering insights into where investor sentiment might be shifting. Fidelity’s FETH, for example, accounted for a substantial portion of the redemptions, indicating a notable divestment specifically tied to that fund. Fidelity’s FETH: Saw the largest redemption, totaling $156.32 million. This substantial figure highlights a major divestment from this particular fund among U.S. spot ETH ETFs . Grayscale’s ETHE: Followed with significant outflows of $122.05 million. Grayscale’s products often experience large movements due to their considerable market share and unique redemption mechanisms. Grayscale’s Mini: Recorded $88.53 million in withdrawals, further contributing to Grayscale’s overall net outflow from its Ethereum-linked products. Bitwise’s ETHW: Experienced $39.8 million in outflows, indicating broader participation in the withdrawals across various providers of U.S. spot ETH ETFs . Smaller Withdrawals: Franklin’s EZET ($6.29 million), BlackRock’s ETHA ($6.27 million), and VanEck’s ETHV ($3.03 million) also saw net redemptions, albeit on a smaller scale, reflecting a widespread trend. No Flows/Data Unavailable: Notably, 21Shares’ CETH reported no flows for the day, while data for Invesco’s QETH was not available, providing an incomplete picture for some funds. What Do These U.S. Spot ETH ETFs Outflows Mean for Investors? Such large outflows from U.S. spot ETH ETFs can signal a few things for both current and prospective investors. Firstly, it might suggest a period of profit-taking, especially if investors bought in during earlier, lower price points. Alternatively, it could reflect a cautious outlook on Ethereum’s immediate price trajectory or broader cryptocurrency market conditions. Investors often reallocate capital based on perceived risk and reward. Consider these implications: Market Volatility: The crypto market remains highly volatile. Large outflows can sometimes precede or follow price corrections, emphasizing the need for a robust risk management strategy. Institutional Sentiment: Significant movements in U.S. spot ETH ETFs often reflect the sentiment of institutional players. Their actions can have a magnified impact due to the size of their holdings, influencing broader market trends. Diversification: For those invested in ETH ETFs, this event serves as a reminder of the importance of diversification within a portfolio and staying informed about market trends. Long-Term Outlook: Despite daily fluctuations, many analysts maintain a positive long-term outlook for Ethereum and the broader digital asset space. Daily outflows, while notable, do not necessarily define the entire market trajectory. The recent $422.29 million outflow from U.S. spot ETH ETFs is a significant event, marking a notable day in the history of these relatively new investment vehicles. While it’s important to acknowledge such large movements, understanding the context—whether it’s market rebalancing, profit-taking, or a reaction to specific news—is key. The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, and data from products like U.S. spot ETH ETFs offers valuable insights into investor sentiment and capital flows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are U.S. spot ETH ETFs? A U.S. spot ETH ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment product that allows investors to gain exposure to the price of Ethereum (ETH) without directly owning the cryptocurrency. These funds hold actual ETH, and their shares trade on traditional stock exchanges. Q2: Why did U.S. spot ETH ETFs see such large outflows on August 19? While the exact reasons are not always immediately clear, large outflows can be influenced by various factors including broader market sentiment, significant price movements in Ethereum, profit-taking by investors, or a shift in institutional investment strategies. Q3: Which funds were most affected by these outflows? Fidelity’s FETH experienced the largest redemption, followed by Grayscale’s ETHE and Grayscale’s Mini. Bitwise’s ETHW also saw significant withdrawals, alongside smaller outflows from Franklin’s EZET, BlackRock’s ETHA, and VanEck’s ETHV. Q4: Does this mean Ethereum’s price will fall? Large outflows from ETFs can sometimes put downward pressure on the underlying asset’s price, but they are just one factor among many. The overall market sentiment, trading volume, and other fundamental and technical indicators also play a significant role in Ethereum’s price action. Q5: How can investors stay informed about U.S. spot ETH ETFs performance? Investors can stay informed by following financial news, checking daily flow reports from reliable data providers, and monitoring market analysis from reputable crypto and financial experts. Understanding the broader market context is always beneficial. Did you find this analysis helpful?

50367205,https://invezz.com/?p=2843976,1755657713,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Cardano hits $0.9241 on governance moves; which coin hits $3 first?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/20/cardano-hits-0-9241-on-governance-moves-which-coin-hits-3-first/,"Cardano (ADA)’s recent governance update has impressed the market, with its price touching $0.9241 and sparking renewed energy within its community. Governance progress often signals maturity, but experienced traders understand that governance changes alone rarely fuel exponential rallies. What investors are now watching more closely are new DeFi protocols that combine real-world functionality with token economics designed for growth. One name increasingly surfacing in crypto predictions is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized liquidity protocol gearing up for launch with multiple features that analysts expect to set it apart. Cardano (ADA) hits $0.9241 Cardano (ADA) surged 12.9% to ~$0.9241, driven by a historic governance vote approving a $71 million treasury fund for core development, including Hydra and Ouroboros Leios, on August 3, 2025, with 74.01% support from 4.657 billion delegated ADA. The rally, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.28 billion, reflects strong investor confidence following the Plomin hard fork’s decentralized governance milestone. Technical indicators show ADA breaking $0.89 resistance, with RSI at 71.45 and support at $0.8241. Whale accumulation of 390 million ADA and ETF speculation, with 75% approval odds, further fuel optimism. Analysts project a $1.20 target if $1.02 clears, but macro pressures like US tariffs pose risks. A drop below $0.8241 could test $0.70. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has entered the spotlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as more than a typical DeFi experiment. Built as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol, it introduces both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending. This dual model allows users to either access pooled liquidity directly or negotiate rates individually, creating flexibility for both retail and institutional users. By integrating on layer-2 infrastructure, the project will offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to older platforms relying purely on layer-1 systems. For anyone involved in crypto investing, this type of efficiency is not just an upgrade but a requirement for scalability. Another major highlight is the decentralized stablecoin planned for launch. This $1 stable asset will be minted only when borrowers post collateral such as ETH, and it will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will actively adjust interest rates to maintain its peg close to $1, while arbitrage ensures market stability. The stablecoin will bring predictable liquidity to the ecosystem and encourage users to adopt lending and borrowing without the volatility that makes traditional crypto investment strategies more challenging. Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale at a price of $0.035 per token. It has already raised over $14.65 million, with 22% of tokens sold across a community of more than 15,400 holders. The credibility of the project is strengthened by its CertiK audit, which earned a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. Phase 6 is already 22% sold out, and with the next phase raising the price by another 15%, urgency is building among investors who do not want to miss out on discounted entry. The road to $3 and beyond What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) especially attractive is not just the presale excitement but the mechanics that will sustain demand once trading goes live. A portion of protocol revenue generated from its lending services will be used to buy back MUTM directly from the market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers, creating a continuous reward system and incentivizing users to hold long term. Unlike many projects that rely solely on hype, this buy-and-distribute mechanism directly ties token rewards to platform usage, producing a demand loop that will strengthen as adoption grows. This structure will gain traction once the beta platform is launched, as real users will be able to test its features in a live environment. Combining the lending protocol with the upcoming stablecoin and staking rewards provides a multi-layer utility that expands beyond speculation. For long-term crypto investment strategies, these factors establish a foundation for sustainable growth rather than short-lived spikes. Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not standing still after presale. Its roadmap outlines four stages: launching with a focus on presale and compliance, building its smart contracts and interface, finalizing with beta testing and exchange preparations, and then delivering on exchange listings with further feature rollouts. With exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, and Kraken targeted for listings, global accessibility will further increase trading volume and visibility. Such momentum has already led analysts to suggest that MUTM could surge toward the $3 mark, outpacing older tokens that rely primarily on governance headlines to stay relevant. Conclusion Investors entering at the $0.035 presale level will already see significant paper gains once the token lists at $0.06. As user adoption of lending, staking, and stablecoin features grows, those gains will expand further. This aligns with broader investor behavior: when asking why crypto is down in certain weeks, the reality is that capital rotates toward projects offering real utility and strong fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides both, making it a standout for crypto investing strategies seeking higher growth potential. While Cardano (ADA) has captured attention with its governance updates, the real buzz is shifting toward protocols preparing to deliver functional ecosystems with sustainable economics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just following the trend but setting a new benchmark for DeFi by combining speed, liquidity, and recurring rewards. For investors looking for the next major leap, this presale offers one of the last chances to secure tokens at entry prices before global listings and beta adoption fuel demand.

This marks a concerning third consecutive day of withdrawals, signaling a notable period of investor re-evaluation in the market. Such sustained movements in these investment vehicles often capture the attention of market participants. They can offer insights into broader sentiment and the flow of capital within the digital asset space. What’s Driving the Recent U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflows? According to data shared by Trader T on X, this latest wave of withdrawals brings the total to three straight days of net negative flows for these popular investment vehicles. The sheer volume of $523.31 million indicates a strong selling pressure from investors. Let’s break down which funds saw the most significant redemptions: Fidelity’s FBTC bore the brunt, reporting the steepest redemptions at a hefty $246.89 million. Following closely was Grayscale’s GBTC , which saw $115.53 million in outflows. Other significant contributors to the decline included Bitwise’s BITB with $86.76 million and ARK Invest’s ARKB at $63.35 million. Even smaller funds like Grayscale’s Mini ($7.51 million) and Franklin’s EZBC ($3.27 million) recorded withdrawals. While data for Invesco’s BTCO was not yet available, other remaining funds showed no change, suggesting the outflows were concentrated among a few key players. Understanding the Impact: Why Do These Withdrawals Matter? These consistent outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just numbers; they reflect evolving market sentiment. When investors pull funds from these instruments, it often suggests a cautious outlook or a move to reallocate capital. While direct causation is complex, sustained outflows can contribute to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. This occurs as ETF providers may need to sell underlying BTC to meet redemption requests, creating a ripple effect across the broader crypto ecosystem. Moreover, such trends highlight shifts in investor behavior. Are institutional investors taking profits, or are retail investors reacting to broader economic uncertainties? Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. Navigating Volatility: What Should U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Investors Consider? For those invested in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , it’s important to distinguish between short-term market fluctuations and long-term investment strategies. Bitcoin has historically demonstrated resilience, but periods of significant outflows can test investor resolve. Considering diversification beyond a single asset class or investment vehicle remains a prudent strategy. Monitoring the overall economic landscape, regulatory developments, and broader crypto market trends can provide valuable context. Staying informed about daily flow data, alongside fundamental analysis of Bitcoin’s adoption and technological advancements, empowers investors to make more informed decisions. The crypto market is dynamic, and vigilance is key. The recent three-day streak of substantial outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , totaling over half a billion dollars, serves as a significant market signal. While specific reasons can be multifaceted, these withdrawals underscore the fluctuating nature of digital asset investments. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these flow dynamics becomes paramount for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. 2. Why are outflows from Bitcoin ETFs significant? Outflows indicate that more investors are selling their shares than buying new ones, leading to a net reduction in the amount of Bitcoin held by the ETF. This can reflect a shift in investor sentiment or a response to market conditions. 3. Which ETFs saw the largest outflows on August 19th? Fidelity’s FBTC saw the steepest redemptions at $246.89 million, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC ($115.53 million), Bitwise’s BITB ($86.76 million), and ARK Invest’s ARKB ($63.35 million). 4. Does this mean Bitcoin’s price will fall? While significant outflows can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin’s price, many factors influence the price. These outflows are one data point among many that investors consider. 5. How often do U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experience outflows? ETF flows are dynamic and can fluctuate daily, experiencing both inflows and outflows based on market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and investor behavior. Three consecutive days of outflows is a notable trend. Did this article help you understand the recent movements in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs ?

50366711,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787931,1755658250,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50366711.jpeg,Paul Atkins says the SEC will launch the President’s Digital Assets Group soon,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/atkins-announces-digital-assets-group-launch/,"SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the Commission will soon launch the President’s Digital Assets Group as part of a new chapter in US crypto rules. Atkins announced this during his speech at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium , where he shared his plan for “Project Crypto” and promised to stop using regulation by enforcement. SEC chair launches group to set crypto rules Atkins explained that the group’s first task would be to implement the recommendations from the President’s Digital Asset Markets Working Group. He made it clear that the project was a major part of the White House’s bigger plan for digital assets and praised President Trump for supporting the effort. The SEC chair further explained that the group will create rules and find the right balance between protecting investors and allowing new ideas to grow. He said the SEC must create rules that are strong enough to prevent abuse but flexible enough to adapt as technology develops. He added that the SEC will partner with Congress, the White House, and other agencies to ensure the US rules remain fair, consistent, and in line with international standards. This approach could unite the different parts of the government around digital assets. Atkins’ predecessor, Gary Gensler, often said that most crypto assets should be securities under existing SEC rules . Critics said this approach pushed innovation overseas because it forced many projects to either register with the SEC or face enforcement actions. Atkins rejected this view and said, “There are very few tokens that are securities.” He explained that the important factor is not the token itself but how it is packaged, marketed, and sold to the public. The change of direction suggests that the SEC will make it easier for crypto projects to launch in the US without being treated as securities. President’s plan drives SEC’s new crypto push The President’s Digital Assets Working Group released a policy roadmap in July, requesting regulators adopt rules that make life easier for crypto businesses while keeping investor protections in place. Paul Atkins said the SEC will stick to the roadmap to move in the same direction as the White House and reduce conflicting voices. According to Atkins, the SEC will provide tailored exemptions, safe harbors, and new types of disclosure rules for crypto companies to replace the one-size-fits-all regulations of the past. Activities like initial coin offerings (ICOs), airdrops, network rewards, and even the development of decentralized apps could be treated more flexibly to allow entrepreneurs to innovate without fear. Atkins said that it didn’t mean a free-for-all, but rather a better structure that will protect investors and encourage responsible growth at the same time. Venture capital firms and advocacy groups like Andreessen Horowitz and the DeFi Education Fund have already started pushing the SEC to create exemptions to protect developers from enforcement risks. These groups say that safe harbors will make developers more confident in innovating in the United States instead of overseas. Atkins responded and said the SEC is open to industry feedback, but was clear that it can only change its approach for now because lasting certainty depends on legislation. He further emphasized that enforcement should focus on fraud, scams, or abuse cases, and let legitimate projects get room to grow. If those promises are kept, the SEC’s partnership with the administration’s working group could be the most significant change in US financial regulation in many years.

It is important to understand that this is a temporary measure, not a delisting, and it is a common practice in the crypto world. While deposits and withdrawals will pause, trading of BERA tokens on Bithumb might continue as usual. However, users should always verify the latest information directly from Bithumb’s official channels. Planning any BERA transfers well in advance of the September 3 deadline is a smart move to avoid any inconvenience. Why is Bithumb Implementing This BERA Suspension ?

Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For 10x Surge? Analyst Points To Gold’s Playbook At the time of writing, LINK trades around $24.2, marking its highest level in seven months. The move came with strong trading volume, confirming a bullish breakout above the 200-day moving average. Whale accumulation has played a pivotal role in fueling the rally. On-chain data reveals that large holders scooped up 1.1 million LINK, valued at approximately $27 million, mover the past seven days.

LINK Wallet Growth Hits 2025 Highs Beyond whale activity, organic network growth has also surged. Analytics firm Santiment reported that nearly 9,600 new LINK wallets were created in mid-August, while daily transfers from active addresses exceeded 9,800, both setting records for 2025. Wallet creation and transaction spikes are widely viewed as indicators of healthy adoption. For Chainlink, these metrics suggest that both retail and institutional demand are rising in tandem, potentially supporting more sustainable price growth.

50366726,560090,1755658839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50366726.jpeg,Bitmine Becomes 2nd Largest Crypto Treasury Company: Now Holding $6.6B In Ethereum,https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-becomes-2nd-largest-crypto-treasury-company/,"BitMine, a publicly traded company renowned for its bold treasury strategy, has officially become the second-largest crypto treasury company in the world. The firm now holds more than $6.6 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH), totaling 1.52 million tokens — a staggering 1.26% of the total ETH supply. This milestone underscores BitMine’s aggressive accumulation strategy, which has set it apart from other institutions and corporate treasuries in the crypto space. What makes this move even more significant is BitMine’s long-term vision: the company has set a target of holding 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, meaning they are already 25% of the way toward their ambitious goal. The announcement sends a strong signal to markets and institutional investors. Ethereum’s growing role as both a financial and technological backbone of Web3 is attracting corporations to treat ETH not just as an asset, but as a strategic reserve. BitMine’s approach mirrors the conviction once seen in Bitcoin-focused treasury strategies , but it places Ethereum front and center in the evolving digital asset economy. BitMine Becomes The Leading Ethereum Treasury BitMine has cemented its position as the largest Ethereum treasury in the world, now holding over $6.6 billion worth of ETH, up from $4.9 billion just last week. This rapid increase highlights the company’s aggressive accumulation strategy and its conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value. The treasury currently accounts for 1.52 million ETH, making BitMine the undisputed leader in Ethereum corporate holdings. Globally, BitMine now ranks as the second crypto treasury company overall, second only to Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which dominates Bitcoin holdings. This milestone underscores the shifting landscape of institutional crypto adoption, where Ethereum is increasingly being recognized as more than just the leading smart contract platform — it is becoming a core reserve asset. Notably, BitMine now holds more ETH than Sharplink Gaming, The Ether Machine, and The Ethereum Foundation combined. This marks a turning point in the treasury race, where corporations are no longer competing on Bitcoin alone but are diversifying into Ethereum at unprecedented levels. This growing trend is likely to continue as ETH gains momentum, supported by strong institutional demand, ETF inflows, and broader adoption across decentralized finance and real-world asset tokenization. Analysts believe that if BitMine maintains its current pace, its treasury strategy could reshape how companies manage long-term reserves in the digital economy. ETH Facing Critical Test Ethereum is currently trading near $4,310 after a sharp retrace from its recent peak above $4,790. The chart highlights that ETH has entered a consolidation phase after weeks of strong bullish momentum, with price now testing key support levels. The 50-day moving average is trending upward and currently sits near $3,560, well below current price levels, signaling that the broader bullish structure remains intact. Meanwhile, the 100-day and 200-day moving averages at $3,048 and $2,575, respectively, also confirm strong long-term support. This alignment suggests that despite the pullback, Ethereum’s broader trend is still positioned for growth. If ETH manages to hold this level, a rebound back toward resistance at $4,600–$4,800 is likely in the short term. However, a breakdown below support could open the door for a deeper retrace toward $3,800. The coming sessions will be key to determining direction.

50366743,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79312,1755658844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Spots XRP Historical Data That Shows Looming 777% Price Pump,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-spots-xrp-historical-data-that-shows-looming-777-price-pump/,"A recent market study suggests that XRP may be preparing for a significant upward move, potentially reaching $28 by September 2025. The projection, made by analyst EGRAG, is based on recurring price structures observed on XRP’s long-term charts. The forecast comes amid XRP’s attempt to hold above $3 after a period of volatility. Following a high of $3.35 on August 14, the asset declined under persistent selling pressure and slipped below the $3 threshold on August 18. Despite this setback, EGRAG’s research indicates that XRP is currently repeating a historical cycle that has previously preceded major rallies. Historical Chart Patterns According to EGRAG’s analysis, XRP has historically displayed a recurring sequence whenever it reenters a multi-year ascending channel. In this setup, the asset typically experiences two major rallies. The first produces an initial top, followed by a consolidation phase, and then a second, often higher, peak. #XRP – The Chart Doesn’t Lie! The chart is speaking volumes, and a 777% surge is all we need to ignite this journey! What we’re witnessing now is just the beginning of something much bigger. A Call to Action : Hey, @bgarlinghouse , what’s holding you back from sharing… pic.twitter.com/gEm5HG9uJz — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 10, 2025 This cycle was first recorded in 2017 . XRP rose from a trading range of $0.0490–$0.0690 within the ascending channel and advanced to a high of $0.3988 in May 2017. After six months of consolidation, it surged again to a new peak of $3.30 in early 2018. The period between the two tops lasted 245 days, or eight monthly candles. The same pattern reappeared in 2020. After returning to the ascending channel in November 2020, XRP climbed to $0.79 before consolidating. It then rallied to $1.96 in April 2021. In this case, the interval between the first and second highs was 151 days, equal to five monthly candles. Current Cycle and Outlook EGRAG argues that the same structure is now unfolding. XRP revisited the ascending channel during April to November 2024, when prices declined to around $0.50. A strong recovery followed the U.S. elections , pushing the asset to $3.40 in January 2025, which represented the first top of the cycle. Since then, XRP has corrected to the $2 range and spent six months consolidating before recently regaining levels above $3. If the current path continues to mirror the 2017 sequence, the second top is expected to occur in September 2025, 243 days, or eight monthly candles, from the first peak at $3.40. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Based on this projection, EGRAG estimates that XRP could increase by as much as 777% from its consolidation levels, setting a potential target of $28.16. This outlook aligns with a separate forecast from analyst CrediBULL, who argued that XRP is advancing in a formation similar to Bitcoin’s Elliott Wave cycles, which could also support a move toward $28. Community Developments EGRAG’s analysis comes shortly after Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission jointly agreed to end their prolonged legal dispute by withdrawing their appeals. However, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has not publicly addressed the settlement, raising speculation among community members about the implications of his silence. While no outcome is guaranteed, the chart-based analysis highlights that XRP may be repeating a well-documented cycle that has historically led to substantial gains. If this trend holds, September 2025 could mark the next significant price peak for the asset, with projections ranging toward $28.

BlockDAG’s 30,000x Path Could Be the Best Buy in 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-and-ethereum-blockdags-30000x-path-could-be-the-best-buy-in-2025/,"Not every opportunity is judged by today’s value. The biggest rewards often come from where a project could be in just a few years. Crypto history proves that those who acted early on Bitcoin or Ethereum didn’t just make profits. They multiplied their wealth thousands of times over. For those seeking the next big chance in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) is shaping up as one of the strongest options. The presale has already brought in more than $377 million and continues to expand at a rapid pace. The excitement is clear. With these numbers, BlockDAG may be walking the same road that early-stage Bitcoin and Ethereum once took. The stage is set for what could be one of the boldest stories in the market. Numbers That Speak for Themselves BlockDAG’s presale success is hard to ignore. Starting at just $0.001 in Batch 1, the price has climbed steadily to $0.0276 in Batch 29. That marks an early return of 2,660% for those who joined at the very start. More than 25.2 billion coins have already been sold. The presale has collected over $377 million, making it one of the largest events of its kind in recent years. On top of this, miner sales have crossed $7.8 million, with more than 19,300 miners purchased by the community. For anyone searching for the smartest choice in 2025, these figures are not just encouraging. They show that BlockDAG’s demand is real, fueled by both capital and participation. The ROI Projection That Could Redefine the Game BlockDAG is not just about today’s presale. It is about where this growth can lead. Analysts and community voices suggest that by 2030, the potential ROI could stretch as high as 30,000x from the current presale levels. This kind of projection is backed by past examples. Ethereum’s earliest supporters watched their holdings grow massively within five years. Solana’s rise also turned early backers into overnight success stories. BlockDAG stands out because entry at presale is still open. The price is yet to move into exchange listings. The full use of its network has not been unlocked. This timing creates a rare opening, making BlockDAG one of the best-aligned projects for those planning their moves in 2025. Why Getting in Early Matters Most In crypto, timing can mean the difference between a good return and a life-changing outcome. The gap between presale and launch is often where the biggest rewards are made. Right now, BlockDAG’s price sits at $0.0276. Those entering today are ahead of all the major exchange listings and before retail hype takes over. When liquidity from large markets arrives, those who secured positions early will benefit from both immediate growth and longer-term appreciation. The last bull runs proved this clearly. Those who stepped in early on breakout projects walked away with far more than latecomers. For anyone weighing options on the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG is timed perfectly to deliver both strong entry and future growth potential. Last Thought Chances like this don’t appear often, and when they do, they rarely stay open for long. BlockDAG’s presale has already handed its earliest supporters gains of 2,660%. Yet its path forward suggests the real journey is only beginning. The project has raised more than $377 million, sold over 25.2 billion coins, and achieved miner sales of $7.8 million from selling 19,300 devices. Its projections point to a possible 30,000x ROI by 2030, giving it one of the boldest outlooks in the market. For anyone looking closely at the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG has the right mix of strong funding, steady demand, and a clear roadmap. The window is open now, but it will not stay open forever.

Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction has turned bullish as a clear bull flag points to a possible breakout at $0.35, supported by rising institutional activity. Chainlink (LINK) price growth is also gaining speed, with its $60 billion DeFi footprint fueling a third Elliott Wave rally that could push it toward $30. But Cold Wallet (CWT) is building momentum of its own. With a Stage 17 price of $0.00998, $6.2 million already raised, and over 736 million tokens sold, Cold Wallet (CWT) is racing ahead. Its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition delivered a built-in community of 2 million+ active users. Early Stage 1 entries at $0.007 now point toward a confirmed listing at $0.3517, projecting an ROI of over 3,400%. Dogecoin Bull Flag Signals Breakout Toward $0.35 Dogecoin has formed a clear bull flag and double-bottom pattern, pointing to further strength. Analysts say the setup could push prices toward $0.35 as resistance zones open up. The meme coin also broke a long downtrend and flipped it into support, adding weight to the bullish case. Institutional interest is climbing, adding deeper support for price action. Support levels at $0.23–$0.24 remain strong, offering a launchpad for more gains. For traders watching chart setups, Dogecoin’s mix of bullish structures and growing confidence makes it one of the breakouts to watch. Chainlink Builds Toward $30 With $60B DeFi Growth Chainlink (LINK) is moving higher as its total value secured (TVS) in DeFi hits $60 billion. This dominance in data feeds has sparked the third phase of an Elliott Wave, often the most powerful part of a rally, setting targets around $30. A breakout from a double-bottom reversal and open futures interest above $1.4 billion further strengthens the outlook. While a drop under $17.90 could challenge the setup, momentum still favours more upside. LINK’s integrations and technical strength make it a strong candidate for those seeking the next breakout play. Cold Wallet’s Presale Hits $6.2 Million in Weeks Cold Wallet is defying normal presale trends. Instead of slowing down after crossing $5 million, it has only accelerated. Stage 17 is priced at $0.00998, with $6.2 million raised and more than 736 million tokens sold already. This surge suggests that large-scale buyers are watching closely. Unlike early-stage projects that rely on hope, Cold Wallet is backed by a $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition, instantly adding over 2 million real users. This gives Cold Wallet a rare edge: adoption before launch. The presale is moving quickly, and if momentum continues, several stages could sell out in clusters. Stage 1 participants who entered at $0.007 are already looking at a potential ROI of 3,400% at the confirmed $0.3517 listing price. Cold Wallet’s model also makes it different. Cashback on swaps, bridge rebates, and gas-fee refunds are already part of its system, ensuring users benefit from the start. This structure encourages daily use and turns the wallet into more than storage; it becomes a revenue tool for users. As more capital flows in, the sub-cent entry point will vanish, leaving higher costs for late buyers. With strong inflows, live features, and adoption already secured, Cold Wallet is shaping up to be one of the most important infrastructure plays of 2025. Final Thoughts Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction and Chainlink (LINK) price growth both highlight strong near-term opportunities, but Cold Wallet stands apart. With rapid fundraising, live cashback systems, and millions of built-in users, it doesn’t wait for adoption, it begins with it. At $0.00998, with a confirmed $0.3517 listing ahead, the ROI potential still sits above 3,400%. In a year where speed will define success, Cold Wallet is one of the few projects positioned to deliver both utility and scale immediately. Missing its current entry may mean missing one of 2025’s strongest returns.

This is precisely what the Radiant Capital hacker has achieved, turning an initial heist into a significantly larger fortune through clever cryptocurrency trading. How the Radiant Capital Hacker Amplified Their Gains It’s an alarming development reported by on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X: the individual responsible for the Radiant Capital (RDNT) exploit has managed to nearly double their ill-gotten gains. This isn’t just about holding onto stolen assets; it involves active, strategic trading. Here’s a breakdown of their audacious moves: Initial Sale: About a week ago, the Radiant Capital hacker sold a substantial 9,631 Ethereum (ETH) at an average price of $4,562. This transaction converted their ETH holdings into a massive 43.93 million DAI, a stablecoin. Strategic Repurchase: As ETH prices experienced a pullback, the hacker seized the opportunity. They repurchased 2,109.5 ETH at a lower average price of $4,096, spending 8.64 million DAI. This move allowed them to acquire more ETH for less capital. This calculated maneuver demonstrates a keen understanding of market dynamics, enabling the Radiant Capital hacker to capitalize on price fluctuations. Understanding the Hacker’s Ethereum Trading Strategy The hacker’s strategy was straightforward yet effective: sell high, buy low. This classic trading principle, when applied to a large sum of stolen funds, allowed for significant profit amplification. By converting ETH to DAI when ETH was at a higher valuation and then buying back when the price dipped, they effectively increased their ETH holdings and overall portfolio value. Currently, the Radiant Capital hacker holds a staggering 14,436 ETH and 35.29 million DAI. The combined value of these assets stands at an astounding $94.63 million. This represents a substantial $41.63 million increase from the original $53 million stolen during the exploit last year. Such a profit margin is a stark reminder of the challenges in recovering funds once they fall into the wrong hands, especially when those hands are adept at market manipulation. The Unsettling Reality of the Radiant Capital Hacker’s Success The success of the Radiant Capital hacker in growing their illicit fortune sends a troubling message across the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. It highlights not only the vulnerabilities within protocols but also the difficulty in tracing and freezing funds once they are actively traded across different assets. While on-chain analysis can track these movements, actual recovery remains a formidable challenge. This incident underscores the critical need for enhanced security measures within DeFi projects and more robust collaboration among exchanges and law enforcement agencies to prevent such financial gains from criminal activities. The ability of the Radiant Capital hacker to operate with such impunity, even turning a profit, emphasizes the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between cybercriminals and the crypto community. In conclusion, the journey of the funds stolen from Radiant Capital, from an initial hack to a nearly doubled fortune through strategic ETH trading, is a sobering tale. It serves as a potent reminder of the sophistication of some cybercriminals and the persistent challenges faced by the blockchain ecosystem in safeguarding assets and ensuring justice. As the crypto space evolves, so too must its defenses against such illicit activities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What happened in the Radiant Capital hack? The Radiant Capital protocol experienced an exploit last year, resulting in approximately $53 million worth of cryptocurrency being stolen by a hacker. The details of the exploit typically involve vulnerabilities in the protocol’s smart contracts. How did the Radiant Capital hacker increase their stolen funds? The hacker strategically traded Ethereum (ETH). They initially sold a large amount of ETH for DAI (a stablecoin) when ETH prices were high. Later, when ETH prices pulled back, they used some of the DAI to repurchase more ETH at a lower price, effectively increasing their total crypto holdings and overall portfolio value. What is the current value of the funds held by the Radiant Capital hacker? According to on-chain analysis, the hacker now holds assets valued at approximately $94.63 million, which includes 14,436 ETH and 35.29 million DAI. This marks a $41.63 million increase from the original stolen amount. Does this incident pose a risk to other DeFi projects? While this specific incident targets Radiant Capital, the hacker’s ability to profit from stolen funds highlights broader security challenges in the DeFi space. It emphasizes the need for continuous security audits, robust smart contract design, and proactive monitoring to prevent similar exploits and subsequent illicit gains.

Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act was officially ratified last month at a White House signing ceremony, where U.S. President Donald Trump praised the landmark stablecoin bill . “Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,” the president said. “You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago—but this signing is a massive validation.” Key players in the Democratic Party, however, have pushed back against certain pieces of crypto legislation. In July, Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) launched “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week,” where she called both the CLARITY and GENIUS Act “especially dangerous.” “The CLARITY and GENIUS bills wrap themselves in the flag of innovation, but all they really do is replicate the same mess that led to past financial crises: They call for few regulations, minimal enforcement, weak consumer protections, and more industry consolidation,” Waters said.

One significant event that frequently impacts traders is crypto perpetual futures liquidation . Over the past 24 hours, we observed a substantial wave of these liquidations across major digital assets, highlighting the inherent volatility and risks in leveraged trading. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? For those new to the derivatives market, perpetual futures are a type of futures contract without an expiry date. They allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset, often using leverage. Leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses, making it a double-edged sword. Crypto perpetual futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s position is automatically closed by the exchange. This happens because their margin collateral falls below a certain maintenance level, usually due to adverse price movements. Essentially, it’s a forced closure designed to prevent further losses and ensure the solvency of the exchange and the broader market. How Did Major Cryptos Fare in the Last 24 Hours of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? The recent 24-hour period saw significant liquidations, particularly for long positions. This indicates a sharp downward price movement caught many traders off guard. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the crypto perpetual futures liquidation figures: ETH: $200.61 million liquidated, with a staggering 79.80% being long positions. This suggests a strong bearish move against bullish bets on Ethereum. BTC: $116.68 million liquidated, and an even higher 95.77% were long positions. Bitcoin traders holding leveraged long positions faced immense pressure. SOL: $21.26 million liquidated, with 81.90% stemming from long positions. Solana also saw its share of optimistic traders caught on the wrong side of the market. These figures underscore the rapid and often unforgiving nature of the crypto market, especially when leverage is involved. A “long” position means a trader bets on the price going up, while a “short” position bets on the price going down. The high percentage of long liquidations clearly indicates a sudden price drop that caught bullish traders off guard. Why Do Such Massive Liquidations Occur in Crypto Futures? Several factors contribute to large-scale crypto perpetual futures liquidation events. Market volatility is a primary driver. Cryptocurrencies are known for their rapid price swings, which can quickly erode margin collateral for leveraged positions. Unexpected news, macroeconomic shifts, or even large whale movements can trigger cascading liquidations. Moreover, the use of high leverage amplifies the risk. While leverage can boost profits, it also means a smaller price movement against a position can lead to swift liquidation. Traders often underestimate the speed at which the market can turn, leading to these forced closures. What Actionable Insights Can Traders Gain from Recent Liquidations? Understanding these liquidation events is vital for responsible trading. These occurrences serve as powerful reminders of the risks inherent in highly leveraged trading. They emphasize the need for robust risk management strategies to navigate the unpredictable crypto landscape. Here are some key takeaways: Risk Management is Paramount: Never over-leverage. Use stop-loss orders diligently to limit potential losses and protect your capital. Understand Market Sentiment: While data like this shows past events, it highlights the importance of analyzing market trends and sentiment before entering leveraged positions. Start Small: If you’re new to perpetual futures, begin with small positions and low leverage to gain experience without risking significant capital. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data to make more informed trading decisions. In conclusion, the recent 24-hour breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation serves as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of leveraged crypto trading. While perpetual futures offer opportunities for amplified gains, they come with significant risks, as evidenced by the millions liquidated from long positions in ETH, BTC, and SOL. Prudent risk management, understanding market dynamics, and avoiding excessive leverage are essential for anyone engaging in this complex segment of the crypto market. Always prioritize capital preservation over aggressive speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date. How does liquidation work in perpetual futures? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses and ensure the trader can meet their obligations. Why were so many long positions liquidated recently? A high percentage of long liquidations typically indicates a significant and rapid downward price movement in the underlying asset. Traders who bet on prices increasing were caught off guard by the sudden drop. How can traders avoid crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Traders can reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and carefully managing their overall risk exposure. What is the role of leverage in liquidations? Leverage amplifies both profits and losses. While it can increase potential gains, it also means smaller adverse price movements can lead to liquidation much faster compared to unleveraged trading. Did you find this breakdown insightful?

The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange has announced a significant Binance delisting affecting three specific spot trading pairs. This strategic move, set for August 22, 2024, at 03:00 UTC, directly impacts MOVE/FDUSD, NIL/FDUSD, and SXT/BNB. Understanding such announcements is paramount for every trader navigating the dynamic and often unpredictable crypto landscape. Binance, renowned for its extensive range of digital assets and robust trading platform, regularly reviews its listings. This proactive approach ensures a healthy, secure, and compliant trading environment for its global user base. The official announcement, readily available on their website, clearly detailed the affected pairs and the precise time of their removal. Consequently, after the specified date and time, users will no longer be able to execute spot trades for these pairs. Why Does Binance Delisting Occur? You might wonder why a leading exchange like Binance opts for a Binance delisting . It’s a standard practice within the industry, driven by a comprehensive evaluation process. Binance conducts periodic and thorough reviews of all listed digital assets, adhering to strict internal criteria. Several key factors influence these decisions: Trading Volume and Liquidity: Pairs with consistently low trading volume or insufficient liquidity may be delisted. This ensures market efficiency and prevents potential manipulation. Project Commitment and Development: Binance assesses the project team’s commitment to their asset, including development activity, roadmap progress, and community engagement. A lack of ongoing effort can trigger a review. Network Stability and Security: The stability and security of the underlying blockchain network are critical. Any vulnerabilities or persistent technical issues can lead to a Binance delisting . Regulatory Compliance: The evolving global regulatory landscape plays a significant role. Assets that no longer meet regulatory standards in various jurisdictions may be removed to maintain compliance. User Feedback: While not the sole factor, user feedback and reports of issues can also contribute to the review process. What is the Impact of This Binance Delisting on Traders? For traders holding positions in MOVE/FDUSD, NIL/FDUSD, or SXT/BNB, this Binance delisting necessitates immediate action. Ignoring such an announcement can lead to potential financial losses or complications in managing your assets. Here’s what you need to consider: Potential Price Volatility: Often, assets facing delisting can experience increased price volatility leading up to the effective date. Some traders might rush to sell, while others might look for arbitrage opportunities. Limited Trading Options: Once delisted from spot trading, your options to trade these specific pairs on Binance become severely restricted. Asset Management: Binance typically advises users to convert their affected assets into other available cryptocurrencies or withdraw them to external wallets before the delisting deadline. It’s crucial to act promptly to avoid any inconvenience. Navigating Crypto Delistings: Actionable Insights Proactive management is your best defense against unexpected market shifts, including a Binance delisting . Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate such situations effectively: Stay Informed: Regularly check official announcements from exchanges where you trade. Binance’s official website and social media channels are primary sources for such critical updates. Review Your Portfolio: Periodically audit your cryptocurrency holdings. Identify any assets that might be at risk due to low liquidity or project inactivity. Understand Your Options: If an asset you hold is slated for delisting, understand the available options. This might include converting it to a stablecoin or another major cryptocurrency, or transferring it to a different exchange that still supports the asset. Set Reminders: For critical dates like the August 22 Binance delisting , set multiple reminders to ensure you take action well before the deadline. Diversify Your Holdings: A diversified portfolio can mitigate risks associated with individual asset performance or delistings. The upcoming Binance delisting of MOVE/FDUSD, NIL/FDUSD, and SXT/BNB serves as a potent reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic and ever-evolving nature. While delistings can seem disruptive, they are often a necessary part of maintaining a healthy and efficient trading ecosystem. Staying informed, being proactive, and having a clear strategy for managing your digital assets are paramount to navigating these changes successfully. Embrace the opportunity to refine your trading habits and remain resilient in the face of market adjustments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What happens if I hold assets in a delisted pair after August 22? Binance typically converts delisted assets into stablecoins or allows withdrawals for a certain period. However, it is strongly advised to manage your assets before the delisting date to avoid potential complications or losses due to market volatility. 2. Can I still withdraw my assets after the delisting deadline? Yes, usually Binance allows users to withdraw delisted assets for a specific period after the spot trading ceases. However, the exact duration varies, and it’s always best to withdraw or convert your funds promptly. 3. Why did Binance choose these specific pairs for delisting? Binance delists pairs based on a rigorous review process considering factors like trading volume, liquidity, project commitment, network stability, and regulatory compliance.

Now, there’s a significant update bringing a sigh of relief to many: Celsius is beginning its third distribution of funds. This latest Celsius payout , totaling an impressive $220.6 million, represents a crucial step towards recovery for thousands of affected creditors. What Does This Celsius Payout Mean for Creditors?

For those who had their assets locked up with Celsius, this news is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a tangible sign of progress and a step closer to regaining lost funds.

This new Celsius payout provides a partial recovery, offering a measure of relief and a pathway to closure. Navigating the Road to Recovery: The Celsius Payout Process Understanding how these distributions work can be complex.

Binance Alpha and Futures are set to add SAPIEN, a significant development that has captured widespread attention. This Binance SAPIEN listing was initially announced via the New Listings Feed on X, marking a major milestone for the SAPIEN project. For many, securing a listing on a top-tier exchange like Binance represents substantial validation and opens up critical new trading avenues. What Does the Binance SAPIEN Listing Uncover for Traders? Binance Alpha functions as an early-stage discovery program. It meticulously identifies promising tokens based on specific, stringent criteria. These criteria primarily include robust community engagement and alignment with emerging market trends. The core objective is to highlight potential crypto gems before they gain mainstream recognition. However, it is important to note that selection for Alpha does not automatically guarantee a subsequent listing on Binance Spot or Futures markets. This distinction makes the direct futures listing for SAPIEN particularly noteworthy and impactful. The fact that SAPIEN secured a futures listing directly is a powerful indicator of its perceived potential. It strongly suggests that Binance sees considerable promise in the token and its underlying project. Futures trading enables users to speculate on the future price of an asset without needing to own the underlying asset itself. This mechanism can offer enhanced liquidity and diverse opportunities for both long and short positions. Ultimately, the Binance SAPIEN listing on futures has the potential to dramatically increase its overall market exposure and appeal. Why Did SAPIEN Achieve This Remarkable Binance Listing? Binance’s selection process for Alpha tokens is notoriously rigorous. It places significant emphasis on projects that demonstrate active communities and those that resonate with current market narratives. SAPIEN’s ability to meet these demanding standards speaks volumes about its inherent strength and growing appeal. A vibrant and engaged community often translates directly into sustained interest and ongoing development, both of which are absolutely crucial for a project’s long-term viability and success. Moreover, emerging market trends play a truly vital role in Binance’s listing decisions. Binance continuously monitors the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape to identify truly innovative and impactful projects.

A comprehensive understanding of these inherent risks is paramount for any trader considering participation. Traders must always conduct thorough and independent research before engaging in any form of futures trading. The volatility inherent in the crypto market can be extreme and unpredictable. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial to employ robust and well-thought-out risk management strategies.

50368289,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=409153,1755661271,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/50368289.jpeg,Tron Short-Term Gains Exceed 30%: Rising Profits Could Spark a Market Rally,https://cryptopotato.com/tron-short-term-gains-exceed-30-rising-profits-could-spark-a-market-rally/,"Tron (TRX) short-term holders (STHs) are witnessing good returns, with some groups now sitting on profits exceeding 30% in just three months. Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Burak Kesmeci shows that one-week holders of the token are currently up 3.8%, while one-month holders have gained 10.3%. However, three-month TRX holders are enjoying the biggest profit margin, with their investment up by 31.2%. Earlier Profit-Taking Wave Paved the Way According to Kesmeci, this increase in profitability has lifted sentiment among traders and fueled talk of a potential rally if momentum continues. He posited that Tron’s profitability will boost confidence among existing holders, which would in turn help bring in new capital to the ecosystem. “When short-term investors are in profit, sentiment improves,” the analyst stated. “These traders tend to share their success stories, which often attracts new participants into the market.” In his opinion, as long as STHs stay in the green, it builds a strong foundation for a likely TRX rally in the foreseeable future. The upbeat mood comes after a heavy round of profit-taking by long-term TRX investors earlier this month. On August 6, CryptoPotato reported that wallets holding Tron’s native token for three to five years drove a $1.4 billion realized profit spree, the second-largest single-day profit event for TRX this year. While that wave of selling reflected veteran holders cashing out into strength, it did little to dampen Tron’s wider momentum. The network continues to stand out in the stablecoin sector, hosting more than $82 billion worth of Tether (USDT), per DefiLlama, and processing roughly 60% of all global USDT transfers. This activity has cemented Tron’s position as a preferred network for institutions and emerging markets. The blockchain also enjoyed a burst of online attention last week, ranking among the most-discussed cryptocurrencies on social media. Adding to the story, corporate adoption has begun to surface. Leisure goods firm SRM Entertainment not only integrated TRX into its treasury holdings but also rebranded itself as “Tron Inc.,” highlighting the token’s growing presence outside pure crypto circles. TRX Price Performance TRX is currently trading at $0.3494, slightly edging up by 0.8% over the past seven days. This contrasts sharply with the broader crypto market, which has slipped 4.2% in the last week, and with rival smart contract platform tokens, which, according to CoinGecko, are down about 2% in the same period. The cryptocurrency’s price has fluctuated between $0.345 and $0.3525 in the last 24 hours, showing a measure of resilience in a broadly weaker market. Additionally, over the past 30 days, it has gained 9.3%, while its year-on-year performance has seen it go up by just under 158%. Even so, TRX remains 19.1% below its December 2024 peak of $0.4313, leaving headroom for further gains if fresh buying pressure emerges.

The company sold over 11.1 million shares of rival miner Bitfarms for a substantial $15.1 million. This strategic move, initially reported by TheMinerMag, immediately caught the attention of market observers and industry participants alike. It represents a notable shift in the relationship between these two prominent entities. This share divestment reduces Riot Platforms ‘ ownership stake in Bitfarms to below the crucial 5% disclosure threshold. This development follows a period of intense corporate maneuvering. Previously, Riot Platforms had attempted a full takeover of Bitfarms, a move that ignited a public management dispute. However, both firms eventually reached a settlement in September 2024, aiming to resolve their differences amicably. This latest sale appears to be a direct consequence of that agreement, signaling a new chapter for both companies in the dynamic and competitive crypto mining landscape. What’s Behind Riot Platforms ‘ Strategic Share Sale? The decision by Riot Platforms to offload such a significant block of Bitfarms shares is certainly strategic. While the exact motivations are proprietary, several factors likely influenced this move. Firstly, the sale could represent a reallocation of capital. By liquidating this investment, Riot Platforms gains a considerable sum of $15.1 million, which it can then deploy into its own core operations, expansion projects, or other strategic investments. Moreover, the sale allows Riot Platforms to streamline its focus. After a contentious takeover attempt and subsequent settlement, maintaining a substantial minority stake in a rival could lead to ongoing complexities. Divesting these shares offers a cleaner break, enabling Riot Platforms to concentrate solely on its independent growth trajectory without potential conflicts of interest or distractions arising from a significant holding in a competitor. This aligns with a broader trend of companies optimizing their portfolios for maximum efficiency. How Does This Impact Bitfarms and the Broader Bitcoin Mining Sector? For Bitfarms, the implications of Riot Platforms reducing its stake are largely positive. With a major, formerly adversarial shareholder significantly reducing its influence, Bitfarms can now operate with greater autonomy. This potentially reduces external pressure and allows its management to pursue its strategic vision without the constant shadow of a potential takeover or activist investor. The broader Bitcoin mining sector also watches these developments closely. This move by Riot Platforms could set a precedent or at least offer insights into how large mining companies manage their portfolios and competitive dynamics. The industry is constantly evolving, marked by fluctuating Bitcoin prices, increasing network difficulty, and the race for operational efficiency. Strategic divestments like this highlight the ongoing adaptation within the sector as companies seek to optimize their positions and capital allocation. This event underscores the maturing nature of the cryptocurrency mining industry. Companies are making calculated moves, not just based on mining profitability, but also on corporate strategy and portfolio management. It reflects a sophisticated approach to navigating a highly competitive and capital-intensive environment. Investors and market watchers will continue to monitor how both Riot Platforms and Bitfarms evolve following this significant transaction. In conclusion, Riot Platforms ‘ sale of Bitfarms shares is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic realignment. It signifies a clear pivot for Riot away from a direct investment in its competitor, likely freeing up capital and focus for its own ambitious plans. For Bitfarms, it brings a renewed sense of independence. Ultimately, this move contributes to the ever-changing narrative of the Bitcoin mining industry, emphasizing strategic decision-making in a dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Riot Platforms? Riot Platforms is a prominent Bitcoin mining company, operating large-scale data centers for cryptocurrency mining. Why did Riot Platforms sell Bitfarms shares? The sale of Bitfarms shares by Riot Platforms likely represents a strategic decision to reallocate capital, streamline focus on core operations, and potentially move past the complexities of a previous takeover attempt. What was the previous relationship between Riot Platforms and Bitfarms? Riot Platforms previously attempted a takeover of Bitfarms, which led to a public management dispute. The two companies reached a settlement in September 2024 to resolve their differences. How does this sale affect the Bitcoin mining industry? This sale highlights the strategic shifts within the competitive Bitcoin mining industry, indicating companies are optimizing their portfolios and focusing on independent growth and operational efficiency. What is the 5% disclosure threshold? In many jurisdictions, a 5% disclosure threshold means that if an entity’s ownership stake in a publicly traded company crosses this percentage, they are typically required to publicly disclose their holding, often signaling significant influence or intent.

The Nasdaq-listed firm announced Tuesday that Dogehash shareholders will swap all of their holdings for 30.7m shares of Thumzup. Once the deal closes, the combined company will be renamed Dogehash Technologies Holdings and trade under the new ticker XDOG. The transaction is expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter, pending shareholder approval and regulatory clearance. Dogehash Runs 2,500 Scrypt Miners Across North America Dogehash operates roughly 2,500 Scrypt ASIC miners across North America, focused on producing Dogecoin and Litecoin. The company plans to expand its fleet later this year, targeting significant growth in output through 2026. Its operations are centered at a renewable-energy data center, with satellite sites being added to scale production. $TZUP and Dogehash aim to become the world's leading #Dogecoin mining platform and will leverage Dogecoin Layer-2 infrastructure via staking in DeFi products within the DogeOS ecosystem to enhance miner economics and amplify yield beyond base block rewards. … — Thumzup Media Corporation (@thumz_up) August 19, 2025 By joining forces, Thumzup and Dogehash expect to leverage Dogecoin’s Layer-2 infrastructure through DeFi staking products built into the DogeOS ecosystem. Executives say this will improve mining economics and deliver higher yields than standard block rewards. Performance metrics will be disclosed after the merger closes. Dogecoin, one of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies, is valued for its fast block times and low transaction fees. It has an inflationary but predictable supply that mirrors fiat currency issuance, making it a staple for high-throughput payments and trading. The asset consistently records millions in daily volume and remains one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Thumzup Acquisition Follows $50M Fundraising Round Thumzup chief executive Robert Steele said the deal would accelerate the company’s transformation from a marketing platform into a diversified digital asset infrastructure player. Meanwhile, Dogehash head Parker Scott said the company had invested in infrastructure rather than speculative trading. “Unlike many companies that simply used their cash to buy cryptocurrency, we have invested in mining infrastructure. By owning and operating our own fleet of ASICs, we generate revenue directly from production, creating an ongoing, sustainable source of Dogecoin,” he said. Further, the acquisition comes after Thumzup raised $50m in July. The funds were set aside to expand its crypto strategies and buy more mining rigs. Additionally, the board approved up to $250m in digital asset holdings . These include Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Ether and USDC. Thumzup began its crypto journey in January by purchasing Bitcoin and now holds 19.1 BTC. Its shift into mining marks a new chapter for the Los Angeles-based firm, which until recently was best known for its digital marketing platform that rewarded users for promoting brands on social media. The company gained further visibility in July when Donald Trump Jr., son of the US president, bought 350,000 shares worth nearly $3.3m at the time, according to regulatory filings. The purchase positioned the Trump family as notable backers of Thumzup’s growing ambitions in digital assets.

WazirX Restructuring Heads Back To Court After Overwhelming Support Indian crypto exchange WazirX became prey to a notorious hack in July of last year, in which it lost user funds amounting to about $235 million, nearly half of what its reserve had at the time. WazirX shut down its withdrawals in response, and to this day, the remaining user funds have sat in the custody of the exchange. This may finally be about to change, however, as the platform has cleared a crucial step in restarting operations. As announced by the exchange in a blog post , users have voted in favor of the latest restructuring plan. The vote occurred between July 30th and August 6th, and asked creditors whether they approve of the platform’s restructuring scheme. This was actually the second vote done by the exchange. The first vote occurred back in March, and 93.1% of creditors were in favor of it. So, why did a revote have to take place? The answer is that even though creditors approved of the crypto distribution plan, Zettai PTE LTD, a Singaporean entity responsible for handling WazirX’s crypto funds, couldn’t get it sanctioned through the Singapore High Court due to compliance issues. Last month, the company again went to court with an amended proposal, and this time, it obtained the thumbs-up. The change from the previous restructuring plan was that WazirX’s Indian parent entity, Zanmai Labs, would instead handle user withdrawals, not Zettai. The revote was to get creditors’ approval on this new restructuring scheme. The results are now in, with 95.7% of users saying yes, slightly more than the previous vote. By value of approved claims, these creditors make up 94.6% of the total. “A second round of voting having such strong numbers is a testament to our approach towards the restructuring, which has been fair, transparent, and the quickest option for users to recover funds,” said Nischal Shetty, WazirX founder. The next step for the exchange is to return to the Singapore High Court to get the creditor-approved amended scheme sanctioned. According to an email sent out to creditors, the platform has already made a filing with the court, ahead of the earlier planned date of August 21st. “Should the Singapore Court sanction the Scheme, we are committed to restarting operations within 10 business days of the scheme taking effect,” noted Shetty. Last month, another Indian crypto exchange, CoinDCX, also fell prey to a $44 million hack . The timing of the attack was eerie, coming one year after the WazirX incident almost exactly to the date (July 18th vs July 19th). Bitcoin Price Bitcoin recovered toward $117,000 on Monday, but it appears the asset’s momentum has already faded as its price is now back at $115,600.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto exchange|Crypto Exchange WazirX|WazirX,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|ASIA|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 04:00:04

A groundbreaking development is reshaping how large players engage with digital assets: the rise of institutional staking . This innovative approach offers a secure pathway for major entities to participate in the crypto economy. What is Institutional Staking and Why Does It Matter? Recently, Core Foundation, a Bitcoin-based EVM-compatible blockchain, announced a pivotal integration. They have woven their unique dual staking feature into Hex Trust’s institutional custody platform. This collaboration, reported by BlockchainReporter, marks a significant step forward for the industry. So, what exactly is staking? In simple terms, it involves locking up cryptocurrency holdings to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return, participants earn rewards. However, for institutions, security, compliance, and liquidity are paramount. This is where institutional staking solutions become crucial. Security: Institutions require enterprise-grade security to protect substantial asset holdings. Compliance: Navigating complex regulatory environments is essential for institutional participation. Liquidity Management: The ability to earn rewards without liquidating core assets is a key benefit. Unlocking Value: The Core Foundation and Hex Trust Collaboration The integration between Core Foundation and Hex Trust directly addresses these institutional needs. Hex Trust, a leading digital asset custodian, provides a robust and secure environment for institutional clients. By integrating Core Foundation’s dual staking, they enable a new era of secure yield generation. This partnership empowers institutional clients to stake both Bitcoin (BTC) and Core (CORE) directly from their custodial accounts. This means they can earn on-chain rewards without the need to sell off their valuable holdings. It’s a game-changer for institutions looking to maximize their digital asset portfolios while maintaining stringent security protocols. This form of institutional staking offers a pathway to passive income for large-scale investors. How Does This Partnership Enhance Institutional Staking Security? Security is often the biggest hurdle for institutions entering the crypto space. Hex Trust’s role as a regulated digital asset custodian is central to this integration. Their platform is built with institutional-grade security measures, including advanced encryption, multi-party computation (MPC), and robust internal controls. By leveraging Hex Trust’s secure infrastructure, Core Foundation ensures that institutions engaging in BTC and CORE staking can do so with peace of mind. This reduces operational risks and helps institutions meet their compliance obligations. The emphasis on a secure custodial solution significantly de-risks the process of institutional staking . The Future of Institutional Staking: Broader Adoption Ahead? This development has far-reaching implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. As more secure and compliant pathways for earning yield emerge, we can expect a surge in institutional interest. The ability to generate returns on dormant assets without compromising security or liquidity is a powerful incentive. This collaboration sets a precedent, demonstrating how blockchain innovation can meet the stringent demands of traditional finance. It paves the way for greater institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives in a regulated and secure manner. The growth of institutional staking solutions is a clear indicator of the maturing crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, the partnership between Core Foundation and Hex Trust represents a significant leap forward for institutional participation in the crypto economy. By enabling secure and compliant dual staking for BTC and CORE, they are opening new avenues for yield generation and accelerating the integration of digital assets into traditional financial portfolios. This innovative step underscores the increasing sophistication and accessibility of the blockchain space for large-scale investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Core Foundation? A1: Core Foundation operates a Bitcoin-based, EVM-compatible blockchain, designed to bring Bitcoin’s power and security to a broader decentralized ecosystem. Q2: What is Hex Trust’s role in this partnership? A2: Hex Trust is a leading digital asset custodian that provides institutional-grade custody solutions, ensuring the secure storage and management of digital assets for their clients. Q3: Which cryptocurrencies can institutions stake through this integration? A3: Through this integration, institutional clients can stake both Bitcoin (BTC) and Core (CORE) assets. Q4: What are the main benefits of institutional staking through this partnership? A4: The primary benefits include earning on-chain rewards without liquidating holdings, enhanced security through Hex Trust’s custodial platform, and compliance with institutional requirements. Q5: Does this integration require institutions to liquidate their holdings? A5: No, a key benefit of this integration is that it allows institutional clients to stake their BTC and CORE without liquidating their holdings, maintaining their asset positions while earning rewards.

Although ETH has since corrected to around $4,306, the asset remains positive in terms of weekly performance, showing a 0.7% increase. This price action shows ongoing investor interest at a time when Ethereum’s relative performance against Bitcoin is attracting attention. Analysts have pointed to Ethereum’s growing strength in both spot and derivatives markets, where ETH is showing resilience against BTC. On CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, contributor EgyHash noted that the ETH/BTC trading pair has reached levels not seen since the beginning of the year, with spot trading volumes climbing to record highs. This shift in participation highlights Ethereum’s expanding role within the broader crypto market, particularly as institutional activity continues to increase. Related Reading: Ethereum Store-of-Value Evolution: From Utility Token To Digital Reserve Asset ETH/BTC Ratio and Market Participation According to EgyHash, Ethereum has recovered significantly after reaching a six-year low against Bitcoin earlier this year. The ETH/BTC pair now trades at 0.0368, its highest level in 2025, though still well below past cycle peaks. Notably, weekly spot trading volumes for ETH relative to BTC reached an all-time high, with Ethereum trading nearly three times the volume of Bitcoin last week. This signals an adjustment in market preference, as traders and investors increasingly allocate toward ETH. The derivatives market has also reflected this trend. Data shows that ETH/BTC perpetual futures open interest has risen to 0.71, its highest point in 14 months. This rise suggests stronger speculative positioning around Ethereum. EgyHash emphasized that such increases often signal short-term strength but also warned that Ethereum’s long-term standing against Bitcoin will depend on sustained adoption and continued investor conviction. Ethereum Institutional Demand and Policy Context Beyond spot and derivatives activity, institutional demand for Ethereum has been growing steadily. Another CryptoQuant analyst, writing under the pseudonym OnChain, highlighted that investment funds now hold approximately 6.1 million ETH. This represents a 68% increase compared to December 2024 levels and a 75% rise from April 2025. Alongside these holdings, the fund market premium for ETH has expanded significantly, climbing to a two-week average of 6.44%, far higher than during previous cycle peaks. Related Reading: Ethereum Plunges 10% After Smashing Into This Historical Barrier OnChain noted that such institutional accumulation reflects both financial and psychological market effects, with entities like BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF expanding exposure. The analyst also suggested that once staking becomes available within ETH-based ETFs, institutional flows could increase further. This development could coincide with broader US regulatory clarity, as legislation such as the proposed CLARITY Act seeks to formally classify both Bitcoin and Ethereum as digital commodities under federal law.

The move towards self-management could set a new standard for other mining operations. The Strategic Importance of the Texas Bitcoin Mining Facility Texas has emerged as a key hub for cryptocurrency mining, thanks to its deregulated energy market and abundant renewable energy potential. The decision to launch this 10 MW Bitcoin mining facility here is a strategic one, leveraging the state’s favorable conditions.

This initiative not only boosts Compass Mining’s capabilities but also strengthens the overall Bitcoin network by adding significant hash power from a stable and strategically managed source. The future of Bitcoin mining looks increasingly professional and energy-conscious. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of a 10 MW Bitcoin mining facility? A 10 MW facility is considered a large-scale operation, capable of hosting thousands of mining machines. It significantly contributes to the overall network hash rate and demonstrates substantial investment in the sector. Q2: Why is Texas a popular location for Bitcoin mining facilities? Texas attracts Bitcoin mining facilities due to its deregulated energy market, which allows for competitive power prices, and its abundant access to renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Q3: What does it mean for Compass Mining to ‘oversee daily operations’ itself? This means Compass Mining is directly managing the facility, including maintenance, power management, and operational efficiency, rather than relying on third-party operators. This allows for greater control and potentially higher profitability. Q4: What is ‘enterprise hosting’ in the context of Bitcoin mining? Enterprise hosting refers to providing large-scale, professional hosting services for institutional clients or large mining operations. These clients typically require dedicated infrastructure, high uptime, and specialized support. Q5: How does this new facility impact the Bitcoin network? By adding 10 MW of operational capacity, this new Bitcoin mining facility increases the overall hash rate of the Bitcoin network. This enhances network security and resilience by making it more difficult for any single entity to control a majority of the mining power.
