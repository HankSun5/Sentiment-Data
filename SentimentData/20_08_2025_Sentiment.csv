50357095,https://cryptonews.com/?p=411008,1755643320,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50357095.jpeg,$OKB Jumps Over 6% After 65M Token Burn and ‘X Layer’ Launch,https://cryptonews.com/news/okb-soars-177-after-65m-token-burn-and-x-layer-launch/,"$OKB has continued its bullish run, rising 6% this week to surpass $127 in a historic rally that’s left traders stunned. This isn’t just another pump—we’re witnessing one of crypto’s most dramatic supply shocks unfold in real time. This rally is a direct result of the protocol’s measures and major platform upgrades that have fundamentally transformed the token’s value proposition. The real question isn’t just what drove the explosion but whether $OKB can maintain this new altitude. How a Historic Token Burn and L2 Announcement Ignited $OKB Rally The OKB token, with a market capitalization of approximately $2.66 billion, was designed as the core utility token for the OKX ecosystem. Its value is derived from providing holders with benefits, including trading fee discounts, staking rewards, and governance rights. August has been a productive month for the token and its native platform. Earlier this month, $OKB saw its role evolve beyond exchange perks to now function as the native gas token for X Layer, OKX’s zkEVM-powered Ethereum Layer‑2 , delivering around 5,000 TPS, near-zero fees, and full Ethereum compatibility. Thereafter, the exchange executed a major token burn , permanently removing approximately 65.26 million OKB from its reserves, removing them from circulation. This event formally established a hard, immutable supply cap of 21 million tokens. OKX announced a strategic upgrade to X Layer and will permanently burn 65,256,712.097 OKB from historical buybacks and reserves. The OKB smart contract will be upgraded to remove minting and manual burns, fixing total supply at 21 million. OKTChain will be phased out, with OKT… pic.twitter.com/HM4dcXLcdU — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 13, 2025 A subsequent smart contract upgrade disabled any future minting or burning capabilities, cementing the token’s scarcity model. These changes spurred a surge of 160–170%, with OKB briefly reaching highs above $130. According to Etherscan, the on-chain ecosystem has roughly 17,900 holders , with the top 10 addresses controlling about 67% of the supply. Additionally, OKX began phasing out OKTChain, stopping OKT trading as of August 13, initiating automatic conversions of OKT to OKB based on the July 13–August 12 average price, and planning full decommissioning by January 1, 2026. OKB Faces Rejection at $130, Consolidates Above High-Volume Support Following the price rally, $OKB is now consolidating. This pause is important as it helps the market absorb its new price level and build a stronger base for its next potential move. After setting a historic high last week, the $OKB token encountered firm resistance near $130. Observing the order flow dynamics and volume activity, one could see the clear shift, particularly visible on the 1-hour chart. Buy-side interest was initially strong, as reflected in several large footprint clusters just above $126. One of the breakout candles showed over 100K in total volume, though it closed with a negative delta of -21.41K, indicating that profit-taking emerged to meet the buying pressure at this new high. Prior to that, volume bars leading up to the rejection were also filled with aggressive buying, but began showing signs of exhaustion as selling pressure absorbed the momentum. The delta footprint steadily tilted red, confirming that a period of consolidation had begun. While OKB briefly lost its upward momentum after pushing into the $128–$130 region, the broader market structure still leans bullish. The rejection from the top of the breakout range has so far led to a measured pullback, not a collapse. The asset’s price continues to trade above all major moving averages on the 1-hour chart, including the 20, 50, and 100-period SMAs, which continue to trend upward. The 20-SMA near $122 is particularly key, as it now aligns with the high-volume support area where recent consolidations have taken place. At press time, OKB is holding just above the $123 mark, hovering near the upper boundary of a high-volume liquidity band centered around $120–$122. This area has repeatedly absorbed selling pressure in recent sessions, suggesting that it remains a key battleground between buyers and sellers. Yet price action alone won’t be enough going forward. To regain directional control, bulls must show renewed initiative, ideally marked by a pick-up in aggressive buying and a shift in cumulative delta favoring demand. Given the powerful fundamental tailwinds from the token burn and X Layer launch, this key support zone is likely to be fiercely defended by long-term believers.

Among the hardest-hit names was Galaxy Digital, the crypto financial services firm that cratered by 10%. Coinbase, now part of the S&P 500, gave up over 5%, while eToro fell even further, sliding more than 6%. Other platforms like Robinhood and Bullish were also dragged down, both dropping above 6%. The risk-off mood didn’t spare the newer corners of the crypto industry either. Treasury-focused crypto firms get hammered Inside the growing niche of crypto treasury operations, red flashed across the board. Strategy, a firm that’s been rising fast in the background, tumbled 7%. SharpLink Gaming, which blends crypto tools with the online sports world, lost 8%. Bitmine Immersion, tied to mining infrastructure, sank 9%. But DeFi Development took the crown for biggest loser of the day, sliding a brutal 13%. Stablecoins, often considered the calmer end of the crypto space, didn’t escape the damage. Circle, the issuer of USDC and one of the most closely watched firms in the space following its IPO, dropped 4.5%. That decline hit just days after Circle had basked in regulatory support under the GENIUS Act, which established new rules for stablecoins in the United States. The pain wasn’t limited to equities. Bitcoin fell nearly 3%, retreating to just over $113,000, while Ether shed more than 5%, falling back to around $4,100, based on data from Coin Metrics. That was a big change from last week, when Bitcoin touched an all-time intraday high near $125,000, driven by speculative enthusiasm. Powell uncertainty triggers tech retreat Tech names were broadly under pressure across Wall Street. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.46%, ending the session at 21,314.95. The S&P 500 slid 0.59% to 6,411.37. Nvidia lost 3.5%, while other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom were down 5.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Palantir, one of the top performing software names in the last quarter, plunged more than 9%, ending as the S&P’s worst performer of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average avoided the full bloodbath, adding a weak 10.45 points to finish at 44,922.27, but that move came thanks to a lift from Home Depot, which pushed the 30-stock index to a new intraday record during the session. At the heart of the chaos was rising caution ahead of Powell’s appearance at the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole summit. Traders were nervous, pulling out of growth names, and crypto, with its speculative nature, was an easy first exit. “With Powell speaking at Jackson Hole, we typically see profit-taking ahead of his remarks,” said Satraj Bambra, CEO of Rails, a hybrid crypto exchange. “Any time there’s communication uncertainty from the Fed, you can generally expect some profit-taking as traders de-risk their positions.” In the last few months, crypto stocks had benefited from a string of bullish headlines. Coinbase’s entry into the S&P 500 gave it institutional exposure. Circle’s IPO added legitimacy to stablecoins. The GENIUS Act, which became law, created new clarity around digital tokens. But the mood has changed in August, as investors brace for more clarity or confusion out of the Fed.

Why BlockDAG Is the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/over-376m-raised-why-blockdag-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-in-2025/,"In 2025’s blockchain space, BlockDAG has become the clear frontrunner. The presale has already secured over $376 million, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, positioning it well ahead of rivals. Its ambitious $600 million target, paired with a rapidly expanding ecosystem, is why many consider it the best crypto to buy right now. Unlike projects that lose steam after early hype, BlockDAG’s momentum is still climbing. Large investors continue to accelerate batch sales, bringing it past the halfway mark toward its funding goal. Its hybrid consensus model, combining Proof-of-Work with Directed Acyclic Graph technology, enables speeds of 10 blocks per second while keeping mining open to both hardware and mobile users. With over 200,000 holders, 19,000 ASIC miners sold, and 2.5 million X1 mobile miners, BlockDAG is showing real adoption before exchange listings—a rare achievement in presale history. Why Buying in Presale Is a Strategic Move Developer traction remains one of the strongest signals of a blockchain’s future, and BlockDAG is excelling here. More than 4,500 developers are building 300+ dApps on the network, aided by EVM compatibility that allows seamless migration of Ethereum projects. This pre-launch activity highlights strong confidence in the protocol and adds weight to why it’s seen as the best crypto to buy. For buyers, entry at $0.0276 in Batch 29 locks in immediate upside. The confirmed listing price of $0.05 guarantees an 81% gain, while analyst projections pointing to $1 post-listing imply a possible 36x return. The batch pricing model ensures early allocations remain fixed, shielding participants from sudden spikes as later buyers enter at higher rates. With momentum and developer commitment accelerating, BlockDAG offers both near-term ROI and long-term ecosystem value, making it a strategic presale entry. Early Access Products Driving FOMO BlockDAG isn’t just raising capital it’s rolling out products ahead of launch. The Demo Trading Dashboard simulates a live exchange, complete with instant execution and visible order books, introducing thousands to BDAG trading before listing. Alongside this, the X1 mobile miner allows users to mine BDAG directly from their phones, building an engaged user base. These utilities strengthen its case as the best crypto to buy for those seeking early adoption and real-world integration. With over half of its $600 million target reached, each sold-out batch pushes prices higher. Late-stage presales typically attract a surge of buyers chasing remaining allocations, but early participants secure lower entry points. By locking in now, buyers gain exposure to one of the few projects delivering adoption, developer activity, and mining infrastructure well before launch. Final Word BlockDAG’s mix of rapid adoption, developer engagement, and technical scalability sets it apart in 2025. With $376 million already raised and Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, it’s not just another presale it’s the best crypto to buy this year. For early movers, the potential is striking. A listing at $0.05 already provides strong upside, but forecasts of $1 hint at far greater gains. In a market filled with promises, BlockDAG stands out as one of the only projects delivering before listing. That’s why it continues to be recognized as the best crypto to buy in 2025’s presale landscape.

Still, rising spot trading volumes offer a glimmer of hope that BTC may now be entering an accumulation phase. Is Bitcoin In The Accumulation Phase? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Binance’s BTC spot trading volume surpassed $6 billion on August 18 – one of the most significant spikes this month. Taha noted that such sudden spikes typically signal increased participation from institutional investors and large traders, along with some retail activity looking to capitalize on heightened volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Below $115,000 As Binance Buying Power Ratio Collapses It’s worth noting that the surge in Binance spot volume coincided with BTC’s drop below $115,000 – a movement that can serve as a leading indicator of a potential reversal in price momentum. Historical data suggests that strong spot buying during price dips often reflects traders stepping in to accumulate BTC at discounted prices. This dynamic can ease selling pressure and lay the foundation for a rebound if demand persists. Taha also highlighted that the increase in Binance spot volume occurred alongside a decline in the Binance Whale-to-Exchange Flow, which fell from $6.4 billion to $5 billion – a $1.4 billion drop in whale transfers to Binance over the past week. This reduction in whale deposits suggests fewer large holders are sending BTC to exchanges for potential selling, a trend generally considered bullish. Taha concluded: Bringing these elements together – a surge in Binance spot volume, rising demand during a price dip, and a decline in whale deposits – the market is showing early signs of stabilization. If accumulation continues at current levels, Bitcoin has a solid chance to recover and retest higher resistance levels in the near term. From a technical perspective, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that BTC is still following its weekly trendline. If the trend holds, BTC could target $130,000 in the coming weeks. Warning Signs For September While Taha suggests BTC may currently be in an accumulation phase with the possibility of a trend reversal in the coming months, other analysts remain cautious. Crypto analyst Josh Olszewics warned that BTC must survive a “brutal September” before any meaningful rebound can occur in Q4 2025. Related Reading: Bearish Case For Bitcoin: Analyst Warns Macro Top Is In Similarly, CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest cautioned that the next 1–2 weeks may bring heightened selling pressure for the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

50360001,560075,1755644452,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50360001.jpeg,Dogecoin Comes Under Attack From Same Group That Orchestrated Monero’s 51% Takeover,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-comes-under-attack/,"The Qubic community is now targeting Dogecoin (DOGE) following its recent and controversial attack on Monero (XMR) . After executing a 51% takeover and claiming majority control over Monero’s hashrate, the group is now shifting focus toward the world’s largest meme coin, signaling what could become one of the most ambitious challenges yet against a major Proof of Work (PoW) network . Qubic Targets Dogecoin After Monero Domination The Dogecoin network has become the latest declared target of Qubic, the project that recently claimed to have orchestrated a successful 51% attack on Monero. Sergey Ivancheglo, known on X social media as ‘Come-from-Beyond’ and the founder of Qubic, confirmed the move after a community vote on Discord placed Dogecoin as the overwhelming choice over competitors such as Kaspa and Zcash. The decision underscores a significant escalation in Qubic’s ambitions, shifting focus from privacy-focused networks to one of the largest and most recognizable meme coins in existence. Qubic’s founder highlighted that the previous Monero operation served as a demonstration of what coordinated control over hashrate can achieve. By pooling resources, the project reportedly captured over 77.54% of Monero’s power, effectively proving that 51% attacks are not merely theoretical vulnerabilities but real threats that could paralyze entire ecosystems. Ivancheglo also described the attack as a wake-up call, claiming that it helped Monero developers accelerate their work on defensive measures. Notably, crypto analysts have voiced concern that Qubic’s current focus on Dogecoin could represent a new frontier in network dominance. The Qubic pool previously boasted 4.29 GH/s of computational power that crushed Monero’s defenses , but Dogecoin’s scale presents a much more formidable challenge. Still, community insiders are not backing down, with many supporting the founder’s plan to dominate Dogecoin. The Challenge Of Taking On Dogecoin’s Network While Monero fell victim to Qubic’s calculated push, Dogecoin’s defense rests on an entirely different foundation. A Qubic Ambassador identified as the ‘QubicChurch’ on X explains that, unlike Monero’s CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant RandomX algorithm, Dogecoin relies on the Scrypt algorithm and is merge-mined with Litecoin. This means that the majority of Litecoin’s massive mining infrastructure also secures Dogecoin, creating a combined shield of unprecedented scale. As of August 18, 2025, Dogecoin’s hashrate stands at roughly 3.47 PH/s, while Litecoin adds 2.78 PH/s. Together, their combined network strength dwarfs Monero by over a million times. The Qubic Ambassador acknowledged this staggering gap, pointing out that preparation for such an attack on Dogecoin would require months of development. Notably, the scale difference between Monero and Dogecoin also redefines the potential outcome. The QubicChurch noted that if the project were to capture even 0.1% of the Dogecoin-Litecoin network , it would represent more computational power than the entire Monero network by a factor of over a thousand. At 1%, the leverage becomes astronomical, exceeding Monero’s power more than eleven thousand times over. For Qubic, such control would not only serve as proof of dominance but could also funnel massive cash flows into its ecosystem.",Dogecoin|asic|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin-Litecoin Network|dogeusd|dogeusdt|litecoin|monero|Qubic|QubicChurch|Sergey Ivancheglo,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|XMR|LTC|MINING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-19 23:00:52

Projects like Worldcoin and Pi Network are attracting attention through price setups and user growth, yet their value still depends heavily on what may come next. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) takes a different approach by proving its utility during the presale itself. Users can already access the app, carry out transactions, and receive USDT rewards, experiencing features that most projects only reveal after launch. This immediate usability, combined with early-stage availability, makes Cold Wallet stand out. It offers credibility and traction now, while others are still building anticipation. Worldcoin’s Triangle Setup Signals Imminent Breakout Worldcoin is tightening within a symmetrical triangle, with its price repeatedly testing support and resistance. This technical formation is known to precede sharp moves, and traders are now eyeing $2.70 as a key upside target. The recent bounce from lower support reflects strong buying pressure, adding weight to the bullish case. As the range compresses, volatility is likely to return with force. A confirmed push above the upper trendline on high volume could trigger rapid gains. The setup suggests Worldcoin may not remain at current levels for long once momentum builds. Pi Network Advances as Unlock Approaches Pi Network is preparing for a 276 million token unlock, equal to 3.5% of its circulating supply. Instead of sparking caution, this event is driving attention as more than 13 million users have migrated to the Open Mainnet. The Pi network price has already risen 10%, signaling that confidence is outpacing concerns. Behind the move is a surge in real network activity, with more nodes going live and user participation expanding daily. This growth is unfolding even before major exchange listings, pointing to a foundation being built in real time as momentum steadily accelerates. Cold Wallet Redefines Presale Standards With Live Utility Cold Wallet is challenging traditional crypto norms by delivering a fully functional product while its token is still in presale. Instead of waiting for a post-launch release, users can already download the wallet, execute transactions, and receive cashback rewards in USDT. This approach offers a level of utility that is rarely available at such an early stage. What makes this launch notable is the transparency and credibility it provides. Many projects raise funds with promises of future development, leaving users waiting months or even years to see results. Cold Wallet has reversed that trend by creating immediate value. The ability to interact with a working product before the token goes live adds a crucial layer of trust. This dual-track model of live functionality and presale participation positions Cold Wallet as a project with both vision and delivery. By letting users test and benefit from real features while the presale continues, it bridges the gap between early adoption and long-term engagement. This creates a stronger relationship between the platform and its community. Currently in Stage 17, Cold Wallet has raised more than $6.3 million, selling over 737 million tokens for $0.00998. With a listing price of $0.3517, the project presents a compelling case for those seeking the next top crypto to buy, combining proven utility with strong upside potential. Quick Rundown Early-access opportunities hold weight only when backed by real proof. While projects like Worldcoin and Pi Network are building anticipation through technical setups and growing communities, Cold Wallet delivers something more tangible. It is not just preparing for adoption; it is already active and rewarding users. With live transactions, cashback in USDT, and a functioning app available during presale, Cold Wallet blends usability with early pricing access. This ability to engage before listing creates a rare edge, making it a stronger choice for those who value trust and utility from the start.

Pepeto, Little Pepe or Bitcoin Hyper",https://timestabloid.com/which-one-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-and-the-next-shiba-pepeto/,"Looking for the best crypto to buy now as markets base and money rotates into presales? Memecoins are back on desks, and three live tickets keep popping up on scanners: Pepeto (PEPETO), Little Pepe, and Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER). Each is drawing fast community flow, pulling in fresh wallets, and grabbing headlines as traders try to lock early entries ahead of Tier-1 listings and deeper liquidity. This review stacks them on momentum, brand strength, tokenomics, and near-term catalysts so you can spot the best memecoin presale for outsized upside. If you want a clean read on which name screens best for risk-reward today, from presale pricing to adoption potential, does Pepeto, Little Pepe, or Bitcoin Hyper deserve your first allocation? Pepeto (PEPETO): Memecoin With Live Utility and Brand Muscle Pepeto (PEPETO), riffs on the PEPE meme by adding “T O” to the familiar P-E-P-E, turning viral recognition into a distinct identity of its own. Under the meme is value: zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap, a native cross-chain bridge, and current staking rewards around 242% APY. The presale is live at $0.000000147 with $6.2M+ raised, the code is audited by SolidProof and Coinsult, and the community has topped 100,000. A demo exchange is already up, supply is 420T like PEPE, and Tier-1 listing chatter is building as whales take early tranches. For anyone screening the best crypto to buy now and invest in, Pepeto pairs brand pull with working toolspositioning the token for real usage and stronger tokenomics into listings. JOIN PEPETO’S PRESALE NOW Little Pepe: Layer-2 Meme Play With Community Heat Little Pepe is gathering pace in the meme lane, leaning on the Pepe the Frog story and a busy social crowd. Its appeal is community energy, buzz that can drive liquidity and trigger sharp bursts. But it lacks the unique, durable utility Pepeto ships on Ethereum mainnet, so Little Pepe suits traders who want to bet on memecoin hype rather than build a long-term position. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): ZK Rollups on BTC, With Adoption Questions Hyper Bitcoin (HYPER) pitches a Bitcoin Layer-2 using ZK-rollups and the Solana Virtual Machine to bring fast transactions and smart contracts to BTC. A canonical bridge lets users wrap BTC onto the Hyper chain to stake, trade, and use low-fee dApps, though many analysts still doubt a Bitcoin L2 will gain broad, real-world adoption this cycle. Verdict: Today’s Best Buy in This Presale Trio Pepeto (PEPETO) checks the boxes as the cleaner, smarter pick right now, and the one best placed to chase the next 100x and SHIBA like memecoin. It sits on Ethereum with a sharp meme brand, real rails that move volume, zero-fee swaps on PepetoSwap, a native cross-chain bridge, current staking rewards near 242% APY, plus a live demo; more than $6.2M is in and the community already exceeds 100,000. Little Pepe leans on a Layer-2 angle many teams now copy; the edge is thin without a unique mainnet venue or live bridge, which makes it feel like a short-term swing rather than a long-term hold.

Bitcoin dropped 3.2% in the past 24 hours to slip below $114,000, while ether fell 5.3% to under $4,200. XRP tumbled 6.2%, Cardano's ADA slid 8% and the broader crypto market was down 3.2%. Shares of crypto-related companies, such as bitcoin miners, crypto exchanges and digital asset treasury firms, suffered even bigger losses, with MARA, COIN and MSTR closing today's regular session down 5.7%, 5.8% and 7.4%, respectively. By contrast, in general, U.S. equities suffered less: the Dow ended flat, the S&P 500 fell 0.59%, and the Nasdaq slid about 1.5%. The disparity underscores how digital assets, which rely heavily on cheap liquidity, are more exposed to shifts in rate expectations than traditional stocks. Investors now face a pivotal macro catalyst-heavy week. On Aug. 20 at 2 p.m. ET, the Fed will release minutes from the FOMC meeting held July 29–30, offering insight into policymakers’ tariff and inflation debates. From Aug. 21–23, central bankers gather for the Jackson Hole symposium, with Powell’s keynote set for Aug. 22 at 10 a.m. ET. Together, the minutes and Powell’s speech could define market expectations for the September policy meeting. Here are some top macro highlights traders will likely watch this week to gauge how the Fed will react during next month's meeting. Tariffs’ delayed bite Many companies have absorbed tariff costs to protect market share, but analysts warn they cannot do so indefinitely. Once passed on to consumers, these costs could drive prices higher and force the Fed to wait before cutting. Sticky inflation data Despite some cooling, inflation gauges remain elevated. The producer price index, a key wholesale measure, has been hotter than forecast, suggesting persistent pressures that complicate any case for aggressive easing. Corporate limits U.S. executives have signaled they will eventually be forced to shift tariff costs downstream. If that happens, consumer inflation could accelerate in the coming months, making a September cut seem premature. Mixed economic signals The U.S. economy shows both slowing job growth and resilient consumer demand. This uneven picture could encourage Powell to argue for patience until the Fed has clearer evidence that growth can withstand tariff-driven costs. Policy uncertainty Tariffs intersect with fiscal and trade policies in unpredictable ways. That complexity increases the risk of missteps, making a hawkish tone at Jackson Hole more likely. Lessons from history The tariff shocks of 2018–2019 produced delayed but meaningful inflation, prompting Fed caution. Powell may draw on that precedent to justify holding back this time. Forward-looking indicators The upcoming release of fresh economic data, including Thursday’s release of preliminary August data on manufacturing and services activity, could show tariff-related cost pressures building. Powell could point to these as another reason for prudence. Internal divisions Minutes from the July FOMC meeting may reveal a split inside the Fed. With hawks focused on inflation and doves emphasizing jobs, Powell may stress the need for consensus, which often favors waiting. For crypto, the stakes are clear. Higher-for-longer rates curb the liquidity that fuels speculative rallies, raising financing costs for miners and weighing on exchange activity. If Powell signals caution, the sell-off in tokens and crypto-linked equities could deepen. A dovish surprise, however, might offer the spark for a rebound.",Markets|Stocks|Crypto|The Fed|Jackson Hole|FOMC|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-19 23:13:13

But at what cost?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bank-of-japan-no-choice-but-to-hike-rates/,"Japan is staring down the barrel of an economic mess, and the Bank of Japan can’t stall any longer. The central bank has no real option left but to raise interest rates—again. The weak yen has wiped out purchasing power across the country, driven up living costs, and left millions struggling to keep up. That’s the brutal backdrop veteran ruling party lawmaker Taro Kono laid out on Tuesday, according to Reuters , as he demanded both tighter monetary policy and fiscal discipline to stop the damage. The BOJ had already pulled the plug on its decade-long stimulus experiment last year and bumped short-term interest rates up to 0.5% in January. But Kono, who’s gunning for the top job himself, says it hasn’t been enough. He warned that Japan can’t afford to let real borrowing costs—already negative thanks to high inflation—linger in the red. “I think it’s better to start early,” Kono said , pressing for more rate hikes. He added that the BOJ needs to “send out a message that Japan will pull out of a situation where real interest rates are negative.” When asked if a hike could come before year-end, he kept it vague but blunt: “I feel like [rate hikes] have already come too late.” Weak yen keeps crushing Japanese households Consumer prices in Japan have stayed above the 2% mark for over three years straight. But Governor Kazuo Ueda is still dragging his feet on raising rates further, citing pressure on the economy from U.S. tariffs—coming from Washington under President Donald Trump’s new administration. While the BOJ continues to hesitate, critics say the damage is already deep. Kono argued that the BOJ’s delay has weakened the yen and blown up import costs, creating a wave of inflation that’s hitting pensioners and businesses hard. What used to help exporters is now wrecking bottom lines. The cheap yen that once gave Japan’s export-heavy economy an edge has turned into a liability. Kono called it the “root cause of crippling inflation,” adding that it’s “eroding corporate margins and hurting pensioners.” With domestic production costs rising and imported goods draining company budgets, he said it’s time to move past the old economic playbook. That means ditching Abenomics—the blend of ultra-loose policy and big government spending introduced by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe back in 2013 to fight off deflation. “The BOJ should gradually raise interest rates, while the government should restore fiscal health under a new accord that replaces ‘Abenomics’,” Kono said. BOJ and government face pressure from business and inside the party Business leaders aren’t sitting quiet either. Takeshi Niinami, who chairs the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said the central bank is dangerously close to falling behind the curve. “I understand that the BOJ is in a very difficult position,” Niinami said last month, “but the bank should know that it will fall too much behind the curve if it doesn’t make a move.” His solution? Strengthen the yen. “The best step to combat rising living costs would be to reverse the weak yen and seek a somewhat stronger yen,” he said. Across Japan, the political pressure is rising too. While Kono failed in his 2024 bid to lead the Liberal Democratic Party, the party’s brutal loss in last month’s upper house election has reignited talk of a leadership shake-up. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who beat Kono last year, is now facing calls from within the party to step down. Senior LDP members are already pushing for a new leadership vote, adding more heat to an already volatile situation. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

But businesses could feel positive effects of digital ruble by 2029. The digital ruble will boost Russia’s economy to the tune of $3.2 billion per year, the country’s credit ratings agency says. The Russian media outlet RBC and the state-run news agency TASS reported that the claims come from the National Rating Agency (NRA). The credit rating agency is based in Moscow. It is authorized by the Central Bank and provides ratings for finance industry firms and government organs. Digital Ruble Will Bring Benefits by 2029, Says NRA The NRA has published a comprehensive report on the estimated impact of the Russian central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Central Bank’s St. Petersburg offices. (Source: Vityavo [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The digital RUB is set to roll out nationwide next year, with a phased adoption plan that will see the country’s biggest lenders start offering services with the CBDC in fall next year. Smaller firms will be given until 2027 or 2028 to start accepting the coin. But the government wants to use the CBDC to make welfare payments such as child benefits and pensions . The NRA conceded that the adoption plan would likely incur costs from both the private and public sector at first. But it said that the digital ruble project will quickly turn profitable. The agency said the CBDC would pump up to 260 billion rubles ($3.2 billion) per year into the Russian economy by 2031. The coin will also make the banking sector “up to 50 billion rubles ($619 million)” annually. Banking officials have previously expressed skepticism about the CBDC, claiming they cannot see why Moscow needs to issue the coin. ‘Big Businesses May Make up to $619M from Russian CBDC’ At the end of July, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that sets out a comprehensive roadmap for digital ruble adoption, starting from September 1, 2026. Donald Trump urged Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy to show some “flexibility” as the US president accelerates his efforts to end the war in Ukraine https://t.co/S7n9A3Iq3T — Bloomberg (@business) August 19, 2025 The agency said that companies and the government could begin to feel the benefits of the coin “between 2029 and 2031.” In the first years of adoptions, bigger businesses can expect to make 30-50 billion rubles ($371 million-$619 million) per year from the coin, the NRA said. Credit institutions, meanwhile, can expect to make up to 8 billion rubles ($99 million), NRA analysts added. War or peace?

The digital ruble launch could see banks lose clients to “new services” that cut them out of the picture, the agency said. This could see net profits drop by 8-10%, the experts calculated. But these initial losses will transform into later gains for banks, the agency said. After the project is fully rolled out, banks will be able to receive up to 61 billion rubles ($755 million) a year in “additional income” from smart contract -powered business, interbank transactions, and corporate liquidity management services. ‘No Advantages to CBDC Rollout’ In July this year, the Sberbank Chairman German Gref said that he does not “see any real advantages” for citizens, banks, or businesses . A branch of Sberbank. (Source: Artem Svetlov [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Gref said that experiments with digital fiats have not yet justified themselves. He added that all financial transactions are all already digitalized in Russia, meaning the CBDC would solves a problem that does not even exist. However, the Ministry of Finance wants to use the CBDC in government contract issuances. It thinks this will help eliminate corruption and boost transparency. Moscow is also thought to be keen on doing CBDC-powered business with its BRICS partners. Many BRICS members, particularly China, have made considerable progress with their own digital fiats. Cross-border CBDC solutions, BRICS members believe, will help render states immune to US-led sanctions packages. Moscow officials have long spoken about their desire to de-dollarize the Russian trade sector , and think that crypto or CBDC-powered solutions will let them do precisely that.

50358883,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79256,1755646205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Two Big Decisions to Change Everything for Ripple and XRP In October,https://timestabloid.com/two-big-decisions-to-change-everything-for-ripple-and-xrp-in-october/,"Legal and regulatory developments could place both Ripple and XRP in the spotlight this October. Attorney Bill Morgan, a well-known figure in the XRP community, recently outlined two significant decisions expected to take place around the same time, each with the potential to impact the token’s trajectory and Ripple’s long-term positioning in the financial sector. SEC’s Extended Review of Spot XRP ETFs The first development concerns the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ongoing evaluation of proposed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On August 18, the regulator announced that it would defer rulings on several pending applications, including those submitted by CoinShares, Grayscale, and 21Shares. These postponements moved the final decision deadlines into late October 2025. This marks the second delay by the SEC on spot XRP ETFs, but the upcoming deadline represents the final review period allowed under federal securities law. The agency must either approve or reject the proposals by that date. Approval would allow regulated investment products directly tied to XRP’s spot market to trade on U.S. exchanges, potentially opening the asset to a broader class of institutional and retail investors. Market analysts suggest that approval could strengthen XRP’s liquidity and credibility, while rejection would maintain the status quo but could dampen short-term sentiment. Ripple’s National Bank Charter Application The second major decision relates to Ripple’s application for a U.S. national banking charter. On July 2, Ripple formally submitted its request to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). According to federal regulations, the OCC is required to issue a decision within 120 days of receiving a complete application, unless an extension is formally granted. This timeline places a potential ruling around late October. If approved, the charter would permit Ripple to operate as a nationally recognized bank, providing it with the ability to expand its financial services beyond payments technology and into regulated banking activities. This development could also elevate Ripple into the ranks of significant U.S. financial institutions, particularly if the company maintains a large portion of its XRP holdings on its balance sheet. While the OCC could finalize its review before October, the agency also retains the discretion to extend the decision period if additional examination is deemed necessary. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Market Impact Commenting on the combined significance of these events, Bill Morgan noted that October could prove to be a decisive month for Ripple and XRP. The simultaneous timing of the SEC’s final ETF deadline and the OCC’s charter decision underscores how regulatory clarity could shape the future outlook for both the company and its token. Financial commentator Zach Rector has also weighed in on the potential effects of an ETF approval. Rector argued that anticipation for these investment products could drive short-term upward momentum in XRP’s price. However, he cautioned that some early investors might sell once approvals are confirmed, leading to a temporary pullback. In his view, long-term inflows into XRP ETFs would likely sustain demand and could support a rally toward double-digit price levels. With both the SEC and OCC expected to issue decisions in October, Ripple and XRP could soon face pivotal outcomes. ETF approval would broaden market access, while a successful bank charter application would significantly enhance Ripple’s institutional standing. Taken together, these developments could mark a turning point for XRP’s role in the global digital asset ecosystem.

50360004,560230,1755648002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50360004.jpeg,$92-Million Bitcoin Transfer: Bhutan Shuffles 800 BTC Amid Price Drop,https://bitcoinist.com/92-million-bitcoin-transfer-bhutan-shuffles-800-btc-amid-price-drop/,"The Royal Government of Bhutan has once again moved a large batch of Bitcoin, sparking talk across the crypto market. Nearly 800 BTC , valued at about $92 million, was shifted on August 18, 2025, into two new wallets. The move added to a series of transactions made earlier this month and has fueled speculation about whether the Himalayan kingdom is preparing to sell. Third Transaction This Month This is not the first time Bhutan has drawn attention in August. On August 5, the government transferred 517 BTC to an unknown address. Just two days later, on August 7, another batch was tracked to a Cobo Hot Wallet at an average price of $116,557. The Royal Government of Bhutan has transferred 799.69 $BTC , worth $92.06M, into 2 new wallets, likely for deposit into a CEX ( #Binance ). https://t.co/q4dW3qJBT5 pic.twitter.com/bRvm3o90UI — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) August 18, 2025 Reports confirmed that those coins were headed for sale, with Cobo acting as custodian of Bhutan’s Bitcoin holdings. In its latest update, blockchain analytics firm Arkham confirmed the 799.69 BTC move and highlighted that this was the third major transaction from Bhutan this month. Bitcoin’s Price Pressure The timing comes as Bitcoin struggles to hold onto recent highs. The token reached a record $124,500 on August 14, 2025, before sliding back to $115,300. Data shows it was down 2.30% in 24 hours and nearly 5% over the week. Platforms like Onchain Lens suggested that Bhutan’s most recent transfer may be linked to Binance, though no official word has come from Bhutanese authorities. Market watchers say such transfers often hint at a possible sale, but they can also be part of wallet restructuring or custody changes. Bhutan’s Place Among Top Holders Even with these movements, Bhutan remains one of the biggest nation-state holders of Bitcoin. Current estimates put its reserves at around 9,969 BTC, worth about $1.15 billion. That kind of figure makes Bhutan the sixth-largest holder worldwide, behind the US with 198,000 BTC, China with 190,000 BTC, the UK with 61,240 BTC, Ukraine with 46,350 BTC, and North Korea with 13,560 BTC. Unlike other countries that built their stacks mostly from seizures, Bhutan’s holdings trace back to mining . For now, the repeated transfers leave the market guessing. Some traders see it as a sign of profit-taking after Bitcoin’s latest peak. Others say it may just be about custody adjustments. Without confirmation from Bhutan, the reason behind the moves remains uncertain.

Although this feature was originally introduced to prevent network spam rather than to influence valuation, its long-term effect on supply has increasingly drawn attention. At present, XRP’s circulating supply is 99,985,821,508 tokens, slightly lower than the initial 100 billion created at launch . This small reduction is the result of ongoing token burns that permanently destroy a fraction of XRP. Annual Burn Rate on the XRP Ledger On average, the ledger removes approximately 2,700 XRP daily. However, this figure occasionally rises during periods of increased network use. This results in roughly 985,500 XRP permanently eliminated each year. If the current rate continues unchanged, the cumulative burn by the end of 2050 would total around 25 million tokens. That decline would lower the supply from 99.985 billion to about 99.960 billion, a reduction of only 0.025%. While the mathematical impact on supply appears minor, the perception of continuous scarcity has the potential to shape investor behaviour and, indirectly, market pricing. Modeling Potential Price Outcomes by 2050 To explore how both adoption and supply reduction could influence value, three possible scenarios for XRP’s price trajectory were outlined, starting from its trading level of $3.01 Scenario One: Gradual Institutional Adoption If banks, fintech firms, and remittance companies steadily incorporate XRP into their operations, a compound annual growth rate of 6–8% over the next 25 years could result in prices ranging between $18 and $25 by 2050 , even without factoring in supply burns. When the effect of ongoing token destruction is included, the projected range increases slightly to $20–$28. In this case, the burn contributes more as a psychological reinforcement of scarcity than as a mathematical driver. Scenario Two: Expanding Role in Global Liquidity A more aggressive growth trajectory envisions XRP becoming central to cross-border settlements, tokenized assets, and central bank digital currency infrastructure. Under this model, with adoption growing at 12–15% annually, XRP’s price could rise to $150–$250 by 2050 . Higher transaction volumes in this scenario would also accelerate the burn rate, potentially removing between 500 million and 1 billion XRP over 25 years, or about 1% of the total supply. This additional reduction could push valuations into the $180–$300 range . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Scenario Three: Global Reserve Settlement Asset In the most expansive evaluation, XRP functions as a neutral global reserve settlement tool supporting trillions in daily financial flows. Without considering the burn, this scenario points to valuations between $1,000 and $2,500. However, with large transaction volumes, the network could destroy 5–10 billion tokens over the same period, cutting the total supply by 5–10%. This meaningful reduction would support an even higher price range of $1,200 to $3,500. Although XRP’s burn mechanism was never intended to drive its price, its effect on long-term supply cannot be ignored. The impact of these burns, however, will depend largely on how extensively XRP is adopted across financial systems. By 2050, the combined influence of market demand, institutional integration, and sustained token burn could determine whether XRP remains moderately valued or rises into significantly higher ranges.

After weeks of strong momentum and multi-year highs, bulls are now struggling to defend support zones. The loss of this level raises concerns about a potential deeper correction, though fundamentals remain firmly bullish. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,350 Liquidity Pool: Can Demand Hold? Institutional adoption continues to provide strong tailwinds, with major firms increasing exposure to Ethereum through ETFs, treasury strategies, and on-chain accumulation. This steady demand reflects growing confidence in ETH’s long-term role within the digital asset ecosystem. At the same time, Open Interest has been rising sharply, highlighting a surge in speculation and leveraged positioning across derivatives markets. While this can amplify moves in both directions, it underscores the intense battle between bulls and bears at current levels. Market participants now see the coming days as critical for Ethereum’s short-term trajectory. Holding above nearby support could pave the way for a rebound and renewed attempts to challenge the $4,500–$4,800 resistance zone. Ethereum Faces Record Short Position Pressure Ethereum is entering one of its most decisive moments yet, with unprecedented short positioning building up in the market. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, we’re witnessing the biggest leveraged short position on ETH ever recorded. Net leveraged shorts have climbed to 18,438 contracts, marking the biggest bearish bet in Ethereum’s history. This surge in positioning reflects a market bracing for volatility, as traders place aggressive downside bets following Ethereum’s retrace from the $4,790 level. However, Pillows emphasizes that this dynamic could create the perfect storm for a short squeeze. If Ethereum manages to rally from current levels, these bearish positions could quickly unwind, forcing shorts to cover at higher prices and accelerating the rally. Historically, such imbalances have led to explosive upside moves in a short timeframe, catching bears off guard and rewarding bulls with rapid gains. While short-term volatility remains elevated, strong fundamentals — including declining exchange supply, institutional accumulation, and broader adoption trends — continue to support the long-term bullish thesis. For now, all eyes remain on whether the record-short positioning turns into the catalyst for Ethereum’s next breakout. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Grows As ETFs Break Records With $2.85B Weekly Inflow ETH Technical Details: Testing Demand Level Ethereum is currently trading at $4,284, showing signs of volatility after its recent decline from the $4,800 region. The 4-hour chart highlights how ETH has struggled to reclaim momentum, with price now testing a key support zone around the $4,200–$4,250 range. This level is crucial because it aligns with the 100-day moving average (green line), which has acted as dynamic support during previous pullbacks in this rally. The price structure shows that bulls remain active but are under pressure. After weeks of consistent gains, Ethereum is now experiencing heavier selling volume, as visible in the recent red bars on the chart. However, the broader trend remains bullish as long as ETH holds above the 200-day moving average (red line), currently sitting below $3,920.

Recent events indicate a continued slide, primarily influenced by anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. This downturn highlights the digital asset space’s sensitivity to macroeconomic factors, especially interest rate expectations. Why is the Crypto Market Feeling the Heat? Investors are closely watching for signals from the Federal Reserve, particularly the release of the July meeting minutes and upcoming remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole. These events often provide crucial insights into the Fed’s stance on interest rates, which directly impacts market liquidity and investor sentiment. July Meeting Minutes: These minutes reveal the detailed discussions and rationale behind the Fed’s latest policy decisions. Jackson Hole Symposium: Fed Chair Powell’s speeches here are highly anticipated for clues about future monetary policy direction. The prevailing sentiment is that the Fed might maintain a “higher-for-longer” stance on interest rates. This approach aims to curb inflation but can have a dampening effect on risk assets like cryptocurrencies, impacting the entire crypto market . How Are Key Digital Assets and Stocks Reacting in the Crypto Market? The impact of this economic uncertainty is evident across the board. Major cryptocurrencies have experienced notable declines, while crypto-linked stocks have seen even steeper losses, signaling broader market apprehension. Bitcoin (BTC): The flagship cryptocurrency recently dipped below the $113,000 mark, a significant move that often sets the tone for the broader crypto market . Ethereum (ETH) and XRP: These prominent altcoins also followed Bitcoin’s downward trend, reflecting a general risk-off sentiment. Crypto-Linked Stocks: Companies heavily invested in or operating within the crypto space, such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, posted more substantial losses. This suggests that traditional equity markets are also factoring in the potential for reduced crypto activity or profitability. This widespread decline underscores the interconnectedness of digital assets with broader financial markets, especially when economic policy shifts are on the horizon. The Critical Link: Cheap Liquidity and the Crypto Market Why does the Fed’s interest rate policy weigh so heavily on digital assets? The answer lies in crypto’s historical dependence on readily available, cheap liquidity. When interest rates are low, borrowing is inexpensive, encouraging investment in higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a “higher-for-longer” interest rate environment means: Higher Cost of Capital: It becomes more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow, reducing the flow of new money into speculative assets. Attractive Traditional Investments: Higher interest rates make safer investments, like bonds and savings accounts, more appealing, potentially drawing capital away from the volatile crypto market . Reduced Risk Appetite: Investors become more cautious, prioritizing capital preservation over aggressive growth strategies. This dynamic makes the crypto market particularly vulnerable to shifts in monetary policy compared to traditional equities, which often have established revenue streams and less reliance on speculative inflows. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Insights from Powell All eyes are now on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s upcoming remarks. While a “pause” in rate hikes is a likely outcome, the market will be dissecting every word for nuances. A subtle shift towards a more dovish stance — indicating a less aggressive approach to rate hikes or even potential cuts in the future — could provide the much-needed lift for the crypto market . However, if Powell reiterates a firm commitment to battling inflation with restrictive policies, the pressure on digital assets could persist. The market craves clarity, and any ambiguity often translates into volatility. Understanding these macro drivers is crucial for navigating the current landscape. While the short-term outlook remains sensitive to Fed announcements, the long-term potential of digital assets continues to be a subject of intense debate and innovation. In summary, the recent downturn in the crypto market is a direct reflection of heightened anxiety surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. As investors await key announcements from Fed officials, the sensitivity of digital assets to interest rate fluctuations is clear. A hawkish stance could prolong the current slump, while any hint of a dovish pivot might ignite a much-anticipated recovery. Staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts is paramount for anyone involved in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why are cryptocurrencies so sensitive to Federal Reserve decisions? A1: Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and altcoins, are often considered risk assets. Their value can be significantly influenced by the availability of cheap liquidity. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it makes borrowing more expensive and reduces the overall money supply, which tends to reduce investor appetite for riskier assets like those in the crypto market . Q2: What does “higher-for-longer” mean for interest rates? A2: “Higher-for-longer” refers to the Federal Reserve’s potential strategy of keeping interest rates elevated for an extended period to ensure inflation is fully under control, rather than cutting rates prematurely. This policy generally tightens financial conditions and can negatively impact growth-oriented and speculative assets. Q3: How do Fed announcements affect Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP specifically? A3: As leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP often serve as bellwethers for the broader crypto market . When the Fed signals hawkish policies, investors tend to reduce their exposure to these assets, leading to price drops. Conversely, dovish signals can spur buying interest. Q4: What is the Jackson Hole Symposium? A4: The Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium is an annual conference organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Central bankers, finance ministers, academics, and financial market participants from around the world attend. It’s often a venue where major policy signals are communicated, particularly by the Fed Chair. Q5: Are crypto-linked stocks impacted differently than cryptocurrencies themselves? A5: While both are affected, crypto-linked stocks (like Coinbase or MicroStrategy) can sometimes experience even steeper losses during downturns. This is because they face both the general market risk associated with equities and the specific volatility of the underlying crypto assets, potentially magnifying their losses during periods of uncertainty in the crypto market .

Recently, South Korea’s central bank issued a significant warning regarding U.S. dollar stablecoins , urging tighter regulations. This move highlights growing concerns among nations about the potential impact of these digital assets on traditional financial systems and monetary sovereignty. Why Are U.S. Dollar Stablecoins a Concern for South Korea? The Bank of Korea (BOK) has voiced serious reservations. According to a Yonhap News report, the central bank believes the increasing popularity of U.S. dollar stablecoins poses a direct threat to the nation’s monetary sovereignty. This concern stems from the potential for these digital assets to facilitate the evasion of existing foreign-exchange controls. In essence, if citizens extensively use stablecoins for transactions, it could bypass traditional banking channels and currency regulations. The BOK conveyed these sentiments in a written response to People Power Party (PPP) lawmaker Park Sung-hoon on August 20. They emphasized the urgency of addressing this issue, stating that growing use could enable illicit capital flows. How Do U.S. Dollar Stablecoins Impact Monetary Policy? Beyond foreign-exchange evasion, the BOK identified broader implications. They warned that widespread adoption of U.S. dollar stablecoins could significantly erode the effectiveness of the country’s monetary policy. Consider this: central banks manage inflation and economic stability primarily through controlling the money supply and interest rates. If a substantial portion of transactions occurs via stablecoins, the central bank’s tools become less potent. This situation could lead to: Undermined Monetary Sovereignty: The ability of the BOK to control its own currency and financial system diminishes. Increased Currency Market Volatility: Capital outflows could become more frequent and harder to track, leading to instability in the Korean Won’s value. Therefore, the central bank is advocating for prompt revisions to the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. This legislative update aims to equip regulators with the necessary powers to oversee these digital assets effectively and manage risks associated with U.S. dollar stablecoins . What’s Next for U.S. Dollar Stablecoins in South Korea? The BOK’s clear stance signals a growing global trend among financial regulators. They are increasingly scrutinizing the impact of cryptocurrencies, especially those pegged to fiat currencies like U.S. dollar stablecoins . For lawmakers in South Korea, the call to action is clear: swift legislative amendments are necessary. This will ensure the nation’s financial stability remains robust in the face of evolving digital financial instruments. The debate over digital asset regulation is far from over. However, South Korea’s proactive approach sets a precedent for how nations might tackle the challenges posed by stablecoins to their economic frameworks. The future of U.S. dollar stablecoins in the region will undoubtedly be shaped by these ongoing discussions. South Korea’s central bank has sounded a crucial alarm regarding U.S. dollar stablecoins . Their concerns about monetary sovereignty, foreign exchange control evasion, and policy effectiveness highlight the complex interplay between traditional finance and emerging digital assets. As the digital economy expands, robust regulatory frameworks become paramount for national economic stability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. dollar stablecoins? U.S. dollar stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged, typically 1:1, to the U.S. dollar. They aim to combine the stability of fiat currencies with the flexibility of digital assets. Why is South Korea’s central bank concerned about U.S. dollar stablecoins? The Bank of Korea (BOK) is concerned that the growing use of U.S. dollar stablecoins could threaten the country’s monetary sovereignty, enable evasion of foreign-exchange controls, and undermine the effectiveness of its monetary policy. How could stablecoins impact South Korea’s monetary policy? If stablecoins become widely adopted, the BOK fears it could reduce their ability to control the national money supply and interest rates, thereby weakening their influence over inflation and economic stability. What action is the Bank of Korea recommending? The BOK is calling for swift revisions to the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act to tighten oversight and establish clearer regulations for U.S. dollar stablecoins and other digital assets. Is South Korea the only country concerned about stablecoin regulation? No, many countries and central banks worldwide are actively discussing and developing regulations for stablecoins, recognizing their potential impact on financial stability and monetary systems.

Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely watched indicator, took a significant dip. As of August 20, this vital index now stands at 44, a notable 12-point drop from the previous day. This shift pushes the market squarely into the ‘Fear’ zone, marking its lowest point in approximately two months since June 22, when it registered 42. What does this mean for investors, and how should we interpret this signal? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drop The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a clear snapshot of market emotions. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. This tool helps gauge whether market participants are feeling overly anxious or excessively optimistic. A score of 44 clearly places us in the ‘Fear’ category, suggesting that investors are currently more cautious or even worried about the market’s immediate future. This recent drop reflects a weakening sentiment across the crypto landscape. Historically, periods of ‘Fear’ can precede either further declines or, conversely, present potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to enter when others are hesitant. The shift from ‘Greed’ to ‘Fear’ is a significant change, signaling a re-evaluation of risk by many market participants. What Influences the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not based on a single metric. Instead, it aggregates data from six different factors to provide a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Each factor carries a specific weighting to ensure a balanced assessment: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with average values. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values over 30 and 90 days. Social Media (15%): Looks at the volume and sentiment of crypto-related hashtags on social media platforms. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: Currently, this factor is paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s market share. A rising dominance often indicates fear, as investors move to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search query trends for crypto-related terms to gauge public interest and sentiment. These diverse inputs collectively paint a picture of the prevailing mood, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a robust indicator. Navigating Market Sentiment: What Does ‘Fear’ Mean? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters the ‘Fear’ zone, it often indicates that investors are panicking or selling off their assets due to negative news or market downturns. This widespread apprehension can lead to market undervaluation, as assets might be trading below their intrinsic value due to emotional selling. For contrarian investors, periods of extreme fear can be seen as opportune moments. However, it is crucial to remember that ‘Fear’ does not automatically guarantee a market rebound. It simply suggests that many participants are feeling pessimistic. Smart investors use this signal as one piece of their analytical puzzle, combining it with fundamental and technical analysis before making any decisions. It serves as a psychological barometer, highlighting when emotions might be overriding rational judgment in the market. Actionable Insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index How can you use the current reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to your advantage? While it is not a direct buy or sell signal, it offers valuable context: Extreme Fear (0-24): This often signals that the market is oversold. Historically, these periods have presented strong buying opportunities for long-term investors who are comfortable with risk. Fear (25-49): As we are currently experiencing, this suggests caution but can also be a time to consider dollar-cost averaging into positions if your long-term outlook remains positive. Greed (50-74): Indicates a bullish market. Investors might be getting overly enthusiastic, which could precede a correction. Extreme Greed (75-100): This is a warning sign. The market might be overbought, and a correction could be imminent. It’s often a time for profit-taking or increased caution. Always remember to conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) and align any investment decisions with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. The index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. Conclusion The recent fall of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 44, pushing it into the ‘Fear’ zone, is a significant development for the crypto market. It highlights a prevailing sense of caution among investors, reflecting recent market dynamics and a re-evaluation of risk. While fear can feel unsettling, understanding this index empowers you to make more informed decisions, rather than reacting purely to emotion. By combining this sentiment indicator with sound research, you can navigate the volatile world of cryptocurrency with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), helping investors understand if the market is overly fearful or overly optimistic. Q2: Why did the Crypto Fear & Greed Index drop to 44? The index dropped to 44 due to a weakening market sentiment, influenced by factors such as increased volatility, changes in market momentum and volume, social media trends, Bitcoin dominance shifts, and Google search trends, all indicating a move towards caution among investors. Q3: What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six main factors: market volatility, market momentum/volume, social media sentiment, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive sentiment score. Q4: How can investors use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Investors can use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a psychological barometer. Periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ might suggest buying opportunities, while ‘Extreme Greed’ could signal a need for caution or profit-taking. It should always be used in conjunction with other research methods. Q5: Is a ‘Fear’ zone always bad for investors? Not necessarily.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7925 Market cap $836.39M Trading volume (24-hour) $27.62M Circulating supply 1.055B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.8321 24-hour low $0.786 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.94% 50-day SMA $0.7638 14-Day RSI 51.42 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 56 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.6514 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is trading below all major moving averages with a clear downtrend structure intact. The breakdown below $0.8169 support creates overhead resistance for any bounce attempts. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart The daily Tezos chart for August 19 shows that the asset has formed a clear downtrend from its peak around $0.92, with price consistently making lower highs and lower lows while failing to reclaim the declining trendline resistance. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands show price trading below the middle band around $0.8169, a critical support level that now acts as overhead resistance and could cap any recovery attempts. The MACD remains in negative territory with bearish divergence, while the OBV suggests declining buying interest despite some accumulation phases earlier in the trend. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour timeframe reinforces the bearish outlook as Tezos trades at $0.7896, showing minimal recovery from session lows around $0.7846. The descending trendline from the $0.86 highs continues to cap rallies, creating a clear pattern of rejection at higher levels. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume remains subdued at 3.07M, indicating a lack of conviction in any bounce attempts, while the Money Flow Index has plunged to 22.21, signaling extreme oversold conditions that haven’t yet triggered meaningful buying interest. The 21-period SMA at $0.8309 acts as dynamic resistance, sitting well above current price action and confirming the downtrend remains intact across multiple timeframes. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7705 BUY SMA 5 $0.8182 SELL SMA 10 $0.8414 SELL SMA 21 $0.8229 SELL SMA 50 $0.7638 BUY SMA 100 $0.6836 BUY SMA 200 $0.6514 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8118 SELL EMA 5 $0.7701 BUY EMA 10 $0.7074 BUY EMA 21 $0.6719 BUY EMA 50 $0.7077 BUY EMA 100 $0.8036 SELL EMA 200 $0.8762 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos appears positioned for continued weakness with downside targets around $0.72-$0.74 representing the next major support cluster. Any recovery attempts will likely face strong resistance at $0.81-$0.83, making sustained upside moves difficult without significant volume expansion and momentum shift. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos unveiled Teslink, a modular interoperability layer connecting Tezos with EVM-compatible chains like Ethlink.

Understanding these shifts is vital for any crypto enthusiast. Currently, the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index sits at 45, indicating that the market is firmly in what’s known as Bitcoin Season. This reading, reported on August 20 at 00:29 UTC, shows a slight increase from the previous day, yet it still signals Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to most altcoins. But what exactly does this index mean for you and your crypto holdings? What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable metric that helps investors gauge the broader market sentiment and performance. It tracks how well the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have performed against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This index provides a clear snapshot of whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin or if Bitcoin is leading the charge. The score ranges from 1 to 100, offering a straightforward interpretation of market dynamics. Altcoin Season: This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. A high index score, typically above 75, suggests this environment. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. An index score below 25 often signifies a strong Bitcoin Season. With the index at 45, it indicates that while some altcoins might be performing, the overall trend leans towards Bitcoin’s dominance, making it a Bitcoin Season. Why Are We Experiencing Bitcoin Season? Bitcoin Season often emerges during periods of market consolidation or when major narratives begin to take shape. Bitcoin, as the pioneer cryptocurrency, often acts as a safe haven or the primary beneficiary of new capital entering the space. Investors frequently move into Bitcoin first, anticipating its price appreciation before capital eventually trickles down into altcoins. This trend highlights Bitcoin’s role as the market’s bellwether. Factors contributing to a Bitcoin Season can include: Macroeconomic uncertainties driving investors to less volatile (relatively) assets. Anticipation of significant Bitcoin-specific events, such as halving cycles or institutional adoption news. A period of profit-taking from previous altcoin rallies, with funds flowing back into Bitcoin. Understanding these underlying reasons provides a more comprehensive view of the current market state as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: Crucial Strategies When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season, it calls for a thoughtful approach to your portfolio. This period presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. Here are some actionable insights: Focus on Bitcoin: Consider accumulating Bitcoin if you believe in its long-term potential. Its dominance often suggests it will be the primary mover. Cautious Altcoin Accumulation: If you are interested in altcoins, research projects with strong fundamentals and innovative technology. Prices may be more attractive for long-term accumulation. Risk Management: Always employ robust risk management strategies. Volatility can be high, and not all altcoins will survive a prolonged Bitcoin Season. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin might be leading, a diversified portfolio can still include a select few altcoins that you believe have strong future prospects. Remember, market cycles are fluid. Staying informed and adapting your strategy is key to success in the dynamic crypto space. When Will Altcoin Season Return? The shift from Bitcoin Season back to Altcoin Season is a cyclical event, not a fixed date. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes a period where altcoins then catch up and even outperform Bitcoin significantly. Look for these indicators that might signal a return of Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Price Stability: After a major rally, if Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or consolidates, capital may start flowing into altcoins. Falling Bitcoin Dominance: A decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance chart often suggests that altcoins are gaining market share. Emergence of New Narratives: New technologies or trends (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions) can ignite specific altcoin sectors. Patience is a virtue in crypto investing. The market will undoubtedly shift again, and understanding the Altcoin Season Index helps you anticipate these changes. In conclusion, the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 45 clearly indicates that we are in a Bitcoin Season. This metric from CoinMarketCap provides crucial insights into the performance dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins. While Bitcoin leads the charge, understanding these cycles allows investors to make informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and position themselves for future opportunities. The crypto market is ever-evolving, and staying updated with such indicators is paramount for navigating its complexities successfully.

Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Bought Over 20,000 BTC In This Dip In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how some of Bitcoin’s key investors have been reacting to the latest volatility in the cryptocurrency’s price.

At the current exchange rate of the asset, the former bound converts to $1.1 million and the latter one to $1.1 billion. Thus, the only addresses that would qualify for the range would be the ones owned by the large investors. Such entities can carry some influence in the market due to the size of their holdings, which can make their behavior worth keeping an eye on. These key holders are generally divided into two cohorts: sharks and whales. The whales are much larger than the other, so they hold the most power on the network. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the combined supply of these Bitcoin groups over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the sharks and whales saw a decline in July, suggesting some of the key investors sold at price levels near the all-time high (ATH). After bottoming a few days ago when BTC set its new ATH above $124,000, however, the metric has found a reversal, suggesting that the sharks and whales have been buying during the price drawdown that has followed. In total, investors falling inside this range have loaded up on 20,061 BTC (worth $2.3 billion) since August 13th. On a long-term scale, the two cohorts have bought a combined 225,320 BTC ($26.1 billion) since March 22nd. “There has been notable correlation between this group’s holdings and the direction of future price movement for the majority of the past five years,” explains the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen whether the same would hold true this time as well, with the shark and whale accumulation potentially leading to another price surge.

50362184,560042,1755651635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50362184.jpeg,Bitcoin Apparent Demand Weakens: Expansion Slows To 30K BTC,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-apparent-demand-weakens-expansion-slows-btc/,"Bitcoin is once again under pressure after failing to sustain momentum above the $120,000 mark and now struggling to hold support near $115,000. The recent rejection from the $125,000 level has triggered heightened volatility, with selling pressure weighing on short-term market sentiment. Despite printing new all-time highs last week, BTC has quickly retraced, moving into a consolidation phase between key support and resistance levels. Bulls remain cautious as momentum shows signs of fading, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to further downside if demand weakens. Data from CryptoQuant highlights this shift clearly: at current price levels, demand is softening while momentum indicators suggest exhaustion after months of strong gains. This cooling effect is particularly concerning given the backdrop of heavy resistance above $120,000, where many short-term holders may be tempted to take profits. A successful defense of the $115,000 zone could provide the foundation for a renewed push toward highs, but a breakdown risks triggering a deeper correction. With volatility returning and confidence being tested, all eyes are on BTC’s ability to maintain support and stabilize before making its next major move. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Shows Fading Momentum According to top analyst Axel Adler, one of the most telling on-chain signals right now is Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand . This metric tracks the net change of young investors holding coins less than one year old that have been actively moving. Positive values indicate expansion of circulation, suggesting new demand and activity from younger market participants. Negative values, in contrast, reflect coins aging into longer-term holding, signaling reduced demand from new entrants. Currently, the metric remains in positive territory, sitting around 30,000 BTC. This confirms that expanded demand still exists, but momentum has been clearly fading in recent weeks. The decline from higher levels shows that while Bitcoin continues to attract inflows, the intensity of new participation is weakening. If this value trends toward zero, it would signal cooling demand from new investors, a possible warning that fresh capital inflows are drying up. Adler notes that the market structure remains supportive of long-term strength, as older coins continue to migrate into strong hands. However, the slowdown in young investor activity at a time when Bitcoin struggles to hold support below all-time highs adds weight to the current consolidation. Traders are closely monitoring this indicator, as further decline could signal short-term vulnerability before the next major move. BTC Consolidates Below Key Level Bitcoin continues to face mounting volatility, with the 4-hour chart showing clear signs of weakness as the price hovers around $115,573. After multiple failed attempts to reclaim the $123,217 resistance level, BTC has entered a short-term downtrend, slipping below its key moving averages. The 50-day SMA has already crossed below the 100-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA looms overhead as a stronger resistance barrier, highlighting bearish momentum in the near term. The rejection from $123K has now turned into a consolidation phase, with sellers defending the $118K–$120K zone aggressively. Price action suggests that $115K has become the immediate level to watch, as a confirmed break below could open the door to deeper retracements toward $112K or even $110K. Trading volumes have also increased on down moves, signaling growing selling pressure. On the flip side, if Bitcoin manages to hold $115K and build a base, bulls may attempt another push toward $118K. However, momentum indicators suggest that buyers are losing steam, and the market could continue to consolidate before a decisive move. For now, BTC remains trapped between resistance at $123K and critical support at $115K, with the coming sessions likely to define its short-term direction.
