It’s the smallest Bitcoin purchase in Strategy history, both in terms of BTC total and US dollar value. Strategy Snaps Up Additional 130 BTC According to a March 17 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy purchased 130 Bitcoin for approximately $10.7 million at an average price of $82,981 per coin between March 10 and March 16. Strategy has acquired 130 BTC for ~$10.7M at ~$82,981 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 6.9% YTD 2025. As of 3/16/2025, we hodl 499,226 $BTC acquired for ~$33.1 billion at ~$66,360 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK https://t.co/8xRmR8vlIt — Michael Saylor (@saylor) March 17, 2025 The recent purchase represented Strategy’s smallest Bitcoin acquisition since the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm started accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020 under the leadership of Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. Since that time, the business intelligence firm has remodeled itself into a Bitcoin development company and pioneered the crypto treasury reserve asset model that other publicly traded companies have emulated. Strategy’s Massive $41 Billion Bitcoin Gamble While the latest buy is Strategy’s smallest, the company had its largest acquisition of 2025 on Feb. 24, scooping up 20,365 BTC for $1.9 billion, as ZyCrypto reported . Strategy announced earlier this month that it may soon sell $21 billion of its STRK preferred stock to acquire more Bitcoin. The announcement dovetailed the company’s plans in October to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed income sales in the next three years for additional buying power. Strategy now holds a whopping 499,226 BTC, valued at over $41 billion — making it the largest corporate treasury reserve holder of the apex crypto. For perspective, the company owns nearly 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total supply. However, that mark is considerably below Saylor’s recent suggestion that the United States should acquire 25% of the supply, adding that the massive Bitcoin reserve could generate between $16 trillion and $18 trillion in wealth for the U.S., thus helping eliminate the entire national debt. Regardless of whether or not the US purchases Bitcoin, Saylor stressed that he has no plans of halting BTC purchases, previously suggesting he would be “ buying the top forever ”.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION|STRK,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-17 22:14:37

Sadly, mostly older adults in the country are falling for the tricks. Authorities have alerted the public to be very careful, as these scammers use advanced technology to steal millions from unsuspecting individuals. Older Malaysian Investors Are the Biggest Targets Older investors, also known as older citizens in Malaysia, are now prime targets in crypto scams. Scammers deceive these older citizens, as many do not understand crypto investments well. They promise quick and easy profits, convincing victims to buy expensive coins that do not exist. Once the money is sent, it disappears. In a recent case, a 74-year-old man lost tens of millions of ringgit after buying fake cryptocurrency. Authorities warned that many of these crypto assets are fake and advised traders to research before investing in any digital assets. Scammers also create fake websites and investment platforms that look real, making it hard for victims to notice any fraudulent act until it is too late. Officials urged investors to verify the legitimacy of any project before making financial decisions. Crypto Scams Featuring AI Tools and Fake Calls Crypto scams is not the only financial crime rising in Malaysia. Phone scams are also a big problem. Scammers pretend to be bank workers, police officers, or government officials. They trick people into sending them money. Many scams start with a fake courier call. The scammer connects the victim to a fake police officer, bank official, or audit expert in the same call. Officials warned that real government agencies do not operate this way. Fraudsters also use advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep-fake tools, to make their schemes more believable . Experts worry these tricks will only become more sophisticated over time. Nevertheless, Malaysian authorities are taking steps ahead in fighting cybercrime and protecting digital services. Last year, they arrested thousands of suspected individuals linked to scam syndicates, marking a major effort in the fight against financial fraud. They also use AI and blockchain to detect and flag suspicious activity on digital platforms before traders and investors lose money. The Rise of Illegal Bitcoin Mining in Malaysia Malaysia is facing more cases of illegal Bitcoin mining. Reportedly, some miners steal electricity to power their mining machines, causing big losses for the country’s power grid. Officials have found many mining farms using stolen electricity. These illegal operations strain the country’s energy supply and create concerns about cybersecurity risks.

The world of AI just took a surprising turn, and it’s got some serious implications for digital content and, by extension, the world of NFTs and digital ownership we’re so passionate about. Google’s brand-new AI model , Gemini 2.0 Flash, just unlocked a skill that’s turning heads and raising eyebrows in equal measure: effortless watermark removal from images. Is this a game-changer for content creation, or a Pandora’s Box for copyright infringement ? Let’s dive into this fascinating, and potentially disruptive, development. The Gemini AI Watermark Removal Revolution: What’s Happening? Social media is buzzing with reports of users leveraging Google’s latest AI model to perform what was once a tedious and often imperfect task: removing watermarks from images. Imagine taking a stock photo, riddled with a Getty Images watermark, and with a few simple prompts, poof! Watermark gone, seemingly like magic. This isn’t just about tidying up photos; it’s a potential seismic shift in how we perceive digital ownership and copyright in the age of AI. Here’s the lowdown: Gemini 2.0 Flash Unleashed: Google recently broadened access to its Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model , boasting native image generation and editing capabilities. This is powerful tech in anyone’s book. The Watermark Wizard: Users quickly discovered Gemini’s uncanny ability to not just remove watermarks, but also intelligently fill in the gaps left behind, making the edits nearly seamless. Social Media Buzz: Platforms like X and Reddit are flooded with examples showcasing Gemini’s watermark-banishing prowess. The ease and effectiveness are genuinely impressive. New skill unlocked: Gemini 2 Flash model is really awesome at removing watermarks in images! pic.twitter.com/6QIk0FlfCv — Deedy (@deedydas) March 15, 2025 Gemini 2.0 Flash, available in Google’s AI studio, is amazing at editing images with simple text prompts. It also can remove watermarks from images (and puts its own subtle watermark in instead ) pic.twitter.com/ZnHTQJsT1Z — Tanay Jaipuria (@tanayj) March 16, 2025 Is This the End of Watermarks? Exploring the Implications of AI-Powered Image Editing While the tech is undeniably cool, the implications of AI’s newfound ability for image editing , specifically watermark removal , are far-reaching and complex. Let’s consider some key points: Copyright Concerns Soar: The most immediate concern is, of course, copyright infringement . Removing watermarks is essentially stripping away the visual declaration of ownership. Imagine the impact on stock photo agencies and artists who rely on watermarks to protect their work and revenue. Ethical Gray Areas: While some AI models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o actively refuse to remove watermarks citing ethical and legal reasons, Gemini 2.0 Flash seemingly has no such qualms. This raises questions about the ethical guidelines and responsibilities of AI developers. Not Foolproof, Yet: It’s crucial to note that Gemini isn’t perfect. It struggles with semi-transparent watermarks or those covering large image areas. However, the technology is still in its early stages and rapidly evolving. Google’s Stance: Google has acknowledged the issue, stating that using Gemini for copyright infringement violates their terms of service. They label the feature as “experimental” and “not for production use,” and claim to be monitoring feedback. However, the ease of access and lack of built-in restrictions are still worrying. The Legal Landscape: Watermark Removal and Copyright Infringement Legally speaking, removing a watermark without the copyright holder’s permission is generally considered illegal under US copyright law, except in very specific circumstances. Think about it – watermarks are a form of digital signature, and tampering with them can have serious legal ramifications. For the crypto and NFT space, where digital provenance and ownership are paramount, this development adds another layer of complexity. Consider this table to understand the contrasting approaches: AI Model Watermark Removal Capability Ethical/Legal Stance Gemini 2.0 Flash Yes, highly effective Potentially problematic, terms of service violation for copyright infringement Claude 3.7 Sonnet No Explicitly refuses, deems it unethical and potentially illegal GPT-4o No Explicitly refuses, aligns with ethical and legal considerations Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Era of AI Image Editing So, what does this mean for you? Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Be Aware, Not Alarmed: While the watermark removal capability is powerful, it’s still experimental. Don’t panic, but stay informed. Respect Copyright: Just because the technology exists doesn’t make copyright infringement okay. Always respect creators’ rights and seek proper permissions for image use. For Creators: Consider robust watermarking strategies, but also explore blockchain-based solutions for digital ownership verification, which are increasingly relevant in the NFT and crypto space. For Developers: The responsibility is on AI developers to implement ethical guardrails and usage restrictions to prevent misuse of powerful image editing tools like Gemini. Conclusion: A Powerful Tool with a Shadow of Doubt Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model ‘s ability to perform seamless watermark removal is undeniably impressive. It showcases the rapid advancements in AI and image editing . However, this “amazing” capability comes with a significant shadow of doubt regarding copyright infringement and ethical usage. As the technology evolves, it’s crucial for developers, users, and legal frameworks to adapt to ensure responsible innovation and protect the rights of content creators in this brave new world of AI-powered tools.

Canary is a frequent crypto ETF applicant. This would reportedly be the first SUI ETF in the United States. The Canary SUI ETF would be structured as a trust. Canary stated that it intended to stake some of its SUI through providers that will enable the trust to establish validator nodes. Staking leads to possible taxation in connection with staking rewards. Investors can get SUI in different ways SUI is the native token of the Sui network, a layer-1 blockchain that was developed by Mysten Labs. According to the S-1, its transaction speed and scalability make it suitable for gaming and high-frequency trading. Canary telegraphed its intentions to create the ETF when it registered a Canary SUI ETF statutory trust in Delaware on March 6. Before an ETF can be launched, the exchange that will host it has to file form 19b-4 with the SEC. That form requests changes in the rules for the exchange that would allow the new ETF to be listed. Canary did not specify an exchange in its S-1. Although this is the first suggestion of a SUI ETF in the United States, exchange-traded product issuer Valour has a SUI product on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market denominated in Swedish kronor. In addition, Switzerland-based 21Shares offers a SUI staking ETP. VanEck offers a SUI exchange-traded note (ETN). An ETN also tracks an asset but, unlike an ETF, the issuer does not own any of the assets. Sui and Franklin Templeton announced a “strategic partnership” in November, although it was not clear what the goals of that partnership were. Grayscale has a SUI exchange-traded note (ETN) The ETN tracks the price of SUI but is a closed fund, whereas an ETF is open-ended. On March 6, World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance protocol linked to the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, announced that it would include SUI in its strategic reserves and it explore product development opportunities with Sui. Canary Capital has big altcoin ambitions The SUI ETF is not the only first Nashville-based Canary has stocked up. In December, it was the first to apply for an LTC (Litecoin) ETF. Canary Capital has filed with the SEC for several crypto ETFs, including Hedera , Solana , and XRP . Canary also runs a digital asset fund that invests in digital assets and crypto equity funds whose prices have fallen below their net asset value. Altcoin ETFs may become more common. For example, Grayscale has applied for Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs, while 21Shares is also looking into Solana, XRP, and Polkadot ETFs. Hashdex applied to the SEC to expand its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF to include Solana, XRP, Cardano, Chainlink, Avalanche, Litecoin and Uniswap in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The new program, ""Onchain Labs,"" is designed to provide go-to-market support to ""experimental and volatile"" projects, according to a blog post from Offchain Labs, Arbitrum's main developer. “Through Onchain Labs, we’re dedicating resources to support developers looking to rapidly expand the application layer by ideating with them from the ground floor to bring the best user experiences to Arbitrum,” the blog post said. “As we do with many Arbitrum teams, we’ll provide product and [go-to-market] support to these early-stage projects, collaborating closely to help their applications thrive on Arbitrum.” Arbitrum Foundation is a non-profit that stewards Arbitrum ecosystem governance. Offchain Labs, which created the blockchain in 2021, focuses on developer tooling and core network infrastructure. Offchain Labs is pitching its new initiative as a way to spur greater activity and interest in the wider Arbitrum ecosystem. According to the blog post from the company, the first Onchain Labs projects will soon emerge from stealth. Offchain Labs said the only projects supported by its new program will be those that explicitly ""commit to fair and equitable launches"" — presumably meaning they avoid token launches and other mechanics that preference insiders. Offchain Labs stated in its blog post that the selection criteria are meant to avoid ""extractive ecosystems"" and ""zero-sum games."" Tandem, Offchain Labs' venture capital arm, ""may or may not purchase associated tokens in public markets,"" the company added. Arbitrum is a layer-2 optimistic rollup network on Ethereum. Like other rollups, the chain is designed to process transactions faster and more cheaply than the main Ethereum blockchain. Several new blockchains are built on Arbitrum's technical framework, forming a network of interconnected blockchains called Arbitrum 'Orbit.' Arbitrum is currently the largest layer-2 network on Ethereum, with roughly $12.2 billion on its primary 'Arbitrum One' chain, according to L2beat .

According to the application , the firm applied for the trademark on February 25. The accompanying statement explaining the term suggests that it will apply to downloaded software, financial services, peer-to-peer network computer services, and cloud software that can be used for the custody, storage, and transmission of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. One of the statement reads: “Financial services, namely, custodial services in the nature of maintaining storage and possession of cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency for financial management purposes.” These statements, which describe the potential application of the term, have led to speculation about what Ripple might be planning in the coming months. Most times, a trademark application such as this suggests that a company is finalizing its plans to unveil a product. In 2024, Ripple for trademarks for Ripple Payments, RLUSD, and Ripple USD, a few months before launching the RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, the news of the application has attracted different reactions from the XRP community. Noah Christopher on X believes that Ripple is expanding into custody and payments to boost its adoption, while Faril speculates that the US might rely on Ripple to custody its crypto reserves. However, some users have noted that a Ripple Custody app already exists in the App Store. It is simply an authenticator app for institutional customers signing transactions using Metaco to custody their assets. Ripple bought the digital asset custody firm Metaco in 2023. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has already received and acknowledged the trademark application but has not assigned it to an examiner. The approval process for a trademark in the US only takes a few months unless it is contested. XRP remains in the green despite a turbulent year While there is no clarity yet on whether Ripple is planning a custody product or has already launched one, its XRP token remains in the only top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap with some gains year-to-date. Per CoinMarketCap data, the token is up more than 1% YTD after losing more than 10% of its value in the past 90 days. Although this might seem inconsequential, it represents a much better performance than Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Cardano ADA, DOGE, and Tron TRX, all of which have been down between 14% and 46% since January 2025. XRP’s positive performance is due to various factors, including the expectation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon drop the lawsuit against Ripple over the token’s status. With the regulator dropping crypto-related actions against Coinbase, Uniswap, and Robinhood, many believe that Ripple is next. XPR ETF for 2025 is at 75% Yes (Source: Polymarket) The market expectations are clearly evident in the Polymarket contract on whether the SEC will approve an XRP exchange-traded fund in 2025.

Here’s what this reset could mean for BTC, based on past trends. Bitcoin Open Interest Has Gone Through A Crash Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC Open Interest has seen a retest recently. The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of futures positions related to Bitcoin that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Peak In? This Data Suggests Otherwise, Analytics Firm Says When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up more positions on the market. Generally, the total leverage present in the sector goes up when this happens, so this kind of trend can lead to more volatility for the asset. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the futures users are closing up positions or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. As leverage decreases following such a trend, the market can act in a more stable manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest, as well as its 90-day percentage change, over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest shot up to a new all-time high (ATH) of $33.6 billion back in January. Interestingly, this peak in the indicator coincided with the ATH in the price itself. As mentioned before, a rise in the Open Interest can lead to volatility for the cryptocurrency. The reason behind this lies in the fact that a mass liquidation event, popularly known as a squeeze, can become more probable to occur when the market is overleveraged. In such an event, a sharp swing in the price triggers a large amount of simultaneous liquidations, which end up acting as fuel for the move itself, thus elongating its length. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations. The volatility emerging out of an increase in the Open Interest can, in theory, take Bitcoin in either direction. During the earlier bull rally, the Open Interest increase was accompanied by bullish momentum. From the chart, it’s visible, however, that the indicator reached a turning point around the time of the aforementioned peak. As bearish momentum took over Bitcoin following the ATH, it was now the turn of the bulls to get liquidated. The massive long squeezes that the price legs down induced helped to further the price decline, explaining its sharpness. Related Reading: Dogecoin Can Still Go Parabolic If This Support Holds, Analyst Says Today, the Open Interest is down to just $23.1 billion, with the indicator’s 90-day change sitting at a notable low of -14%. In the chart, the quant has highlighted the previous deleveraging events where the metric plummeted in a similar manner. “Looking at historical trends, each past deleveraging like this has provided good opportunities for the short to medium term,” notes the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether this cooldown in the futures market will be enough for Bitcoin to see a rebound or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $83,500, up 1% in the last 24 hours.

Is a Fall or a Rebound More Likely?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-in-bitcoin-in-the-coming-days-is-a-fall-or-a-rebound-more-likely/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price action suggests that institutional investors have yet to make a strong comeback, leaving the market in a consolidation phase. According to a report from Bitfinex, Bitcoin fell significantly from its all-time high of $109,590 on Jan. 20 to a low of $77,041 last week. This 29.7% drop marks the second deepest correction in the current bull market. Historically, bull markets tend to experience corrections of around 30% before resuming their rise, according to Bitfinex. However, this cycle has been characterized by shallower pullbacks, largely due to institutional adoption and demand from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite this, short-term holders are currently facing net unrealized losses, adding to the sell-side pressure. Investors who bought Bitcoin in the past 7 to 30 days are particularly vulnerable to capitulation, which further exacerbates market weakness, analysts say. Related News: Outlook Changes in Altcoin Dominance Analysis Firm Draws Particular Attention to These 10 Altcoins A major concern highlighted in the report is the slowdown in fresh capital inflows. When new money enters the market lessens and cost basis trends shift, this is typically a sign of weakening demand. This is becoming more apparent as Bitcoin struggles to maintain key support levels. Without significant new buying activity, BTC could remain in a prolonged period of consolidation or face further declines as weaker holders exit their positions. Market analysts suggest that the return of long-term holders and institutional demand will be critical in determining Bitcoin’s next move. If deep-pocketed investors begin to absorb supply at these low levels, it could signal the start of an accumulation phase, potentially stabilizing prices and shifting market sentiment back into bullish territory. *This is not investment advice.

In terms of Bitcoin holdings, North Korea is the fifth largest country in the world. / Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The Scale of North Korean Cybercrime North Korea’s vast wealth in cryptocurrencies stems from years of cyberattacks and crypto heists, including the 2024 DMM Bitcoin exploit in Japan and the 2022 Ronin Network breach , where Lazarus stole $308 million and over $600 million, respectively. The Lazarus Group refers to a large subset of state-sponsored cyber activities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), operating as an integral wing of North Korea’s central foreign intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). Chainalysis’ Crypto Crime 2025 Report shows North Korean hackers stole $660.5 million in 2023 and $1.34 billion in 2024, marking a 102.88% year-over-year increase. One of the most recent examples of North Korea’s expanding cyber operations is the Bybit hack. Bybit Attack: North Korea’s Massive Crypto Theft The dramatic increase in North Korea’s Bitcoin holdings is directly linked to the February 2025 attack on the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. The Lazarus Group organized the theft of over 400,000 Ether from Bybit’s secure multi-signature cold wallet. Following the theft, Lazarus employed sophisticated techniques to launder the stolen Ether and convert it into Bitcoin. The group exploited decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like THORChain, which faced criticism for lacking strong anti-crime protections. This allowed Lazarus to obscure the origins of the stolen funds and facilitate their conversion into Bitcoin. This attack has consequences beyond Bybit’s financial losses. According to the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) , proceeds from cyberattacks, along with other illicit wealth generated by North Korean-funded syndicates, fund North Korea’s nuclear missile program and pose a major threat to international security.

Hashdex’s move could open the door for major investors to explore altcoins, reshaping crypto investment priorities. Litecoin’s inclusion challenges the Bitcoin-Ethereum dominance, pushing investors to reconsider diversification strategies Crypto asset management firm Hashdex submitted an amendment proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last Friday to add Litecoin (LTC) to its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. If approved, Litecoin will join the ETF’s other proposed digital assets, broadening its exposure to the traditional financial market and institutional investors within a regulated environment. Litecoin Gains ETF Exposure as Hashdex Seeks Broader Crypto Holdings The March 14 filing , filed under file number 333-280990, outlined Hashdex’s plans to expand its Crypto Index ETF portfolio beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The revised index is expected to include additional cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI), with each operating on its respective blockchain network. Particularly, the addition of Litecoin would further diversify the fund’s holdings and attract investors interested in a wider array of cryptocurrencies. BTW, @hashdex 's CEO @SamirKerbage is going to be at the Litecoin Summit in Vegas the end of May. Just sayin'. https://t.co/SkVxJC7X2a https://t.co/dEUqIkRanV — Litecoin (@litecoin) March 17, 2025 An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of assets—such as stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies—traded on stock exchanges. It allows investors to buy and sell shares throughout the day, offering diversification by spreading risk across multiple assets. Hashdex’s proposal to add Litecoin isn’t random. Litecoin has been around for over a decade, often seen as Bitcoin’s lighter, faster counterpart. Its features, such as its popularity, strong liquidity, and lower transaction fees, make it an interesting addition to an ETF. If this gets the green light, it would be another step towards integrating crypto with traditional finance, which would give both big institutions and everyday investors more options to diversify their portfolios. Brazil ETF Approval Highlights Hashdex Expansion Strategy Recently, Hashdex secured approval from Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the world’s first XRP spot ETF on the B3 stock exchange. This approval allows Brazilian investors to gain exposure to XRP through a regulated investment vehicle. Hashdex continues to provide more crypto investment options while signaling increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets. The Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund was officially established on February 18, 2025, and Genial Investimentos was appointed its administrator.

Since Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs received approval in 2024, fund issuers have accelerated efforts to broaden their offerings. SEC Decision on Litecoin Could Boost Hashdex Crypto Index ETF Expansion Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimate a 90% likelihood of Litecoin ETF approval before the end of 2025. Their prediction places Litecoin ahead of Solana (70%), Dogecoin (75%), and XRP (65%). Our official alt coin ETF approval odds are out. Litecoin leads w 90% chance, then Doge, followed by Solana and XRP. We are only doing for 33 Act $IBIT -esque filings.

Demand for crypto ETFs has surged, with spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs attracting $40.7 billion and $3.18 billion in net inflows since their launches. While a Litecoin ETF may not see the same demand, Seyffart notes that even modest inflows could make it viable for fund issuers. The SEC’s final decision on Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs is expected between October 2 and 18, a timeline closely watched by investors and fund issuers looking to expand the reach of crypto index ETFs. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does Litecoin’s classification as a commodity impact its chances of ETF approval? Since Litecoin is considered a commodity rather than a security, it avoids the tougher regulations and doubts that securities may face in the same situation. This makes it easier to get approval since it sidesteps the SEC’s stricter oversight on securities branded cryptocurrencies. What are the risks of a Litecoin ETF? Among the risks known primarily to ETFs is their reliance on third parties to store assets safely. These parties are often centralized and leave space for potential price manipulation due to crypto’s volatility and liquidity issues. Could a Litecoin ETF lead to more altcoin ETFs? Yes, if Litecoin’s ETF gets approved, it could pave the way for others like Solana and XRP. A green light from regulators would show they’re open to approving beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, which would mean they are now open to altcoins, too.

CZ was responding to a post on X (formerly Twitter) by crypto influencer EmperorBTC, who analyzes the psychological landscape of market participants. “The bar for success in crypto is very low,” EmperorBTC said, arguing that most investors are ill-equipped to deal with the volatile nature of the crypto market. According to EmperorBTC, 80% of crypto investors are simply “tourists,” entering the market excitedly and leaving when sentiment changes. Another 10% are making buying and selling decisions based on misleading influencers, while another 5% believe they are falsely projecting wealth. That leaves only the 5% who truly understand crypto, he claimed. Related News: Binance Finally Brought The Expected Feature: Added to the Home Page, Here are the Impacted Altcoins CZ weighed in on these statistics, suggesting that even among the 5% of so-called “insiders,” most have failed to outperform Bitcoin. “Even if there were a 5% who were true experts in crypto, most of them still wouldn’t be able to outperform Bitcoin,” he said. He also noted that within this group, only 4% actively trade or allocate capital to blockchain projects, but they still lag behind Bitcoin’s long-term performance. CZ said that simply holding Bitcoin outperforms 99% of crypto market participants and even outperforms most traditional asset classes with minimal effort. Despite Bitcoin’s dominance, CZ admitted that rising into the top 1% of crypto investors requires extraordinary effort, deep market knowledge, and constant work. *This is not investment advice.

Per the news agency EFE (via Infobae ), police officers said they had “dismantled” a “criminal organization” that promoted “fake cryptocurrency investments.” Spanish Police Make Arrests in Malaga, Madrid, Murcia Officers said they have arrested eight people, but fear that “more than 3,600 people” have lost money to the crypto scam . National Police Corp vehicles in Spain. (Source: Supertoni123 [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The National Police Corps (CNP)’s Economic and Financial Crime Unit said the network’s mastermind was a “computer programmer” whom they arrested in Malaga. The CNP also made arrests in the cities of Murcia, and Madrid, detaining people of “various nationalities and backgrounds.” The detainees include “marketing and web design experts,” officers said. Police say the group developed a “seemingly legitimate platform that offered clients a choice of Bitcoin investment plans.” They then allegedly promoted these products on various websites and social media platforms. Victims, police said, “did not need to know anything about crypto,” as the alleged scam operators “made it easy for people to convert hundreds, even thousands of euros into Bitcoin.” The alleged scammers were also able to dupe some “victims” into surrendering control of their electronic devices to “carry out crypto transfers themselves, in addition to stealing their personal and banking data.” Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Operation Began in 2022 – Police The CNP first learned of the operation in 2022, when a “victim” filed a report in Murcia. As police investigated, they unearthed a complicated network of investments whereby older investors were paid using newer investors’ funds. When people tried to withdraw their funds from the platform, the operators would reportedly concoct “obstacles” to delay or obfuscate the process. One officer told EFE that some “victims” signed “contracts” with the operators, who “promised to pay dividends of 40% after one month,” and “up to 300% after a year.” The police force eventually found a “trail” of fraud that “included thousands of victims in as many as 36 countries.” Spain’s economy is getting a boost thanks to the country’s attractiveness for remote workers, according to central bank chief Jose Luis Escriva https://t.co/ke3IYbcEbh — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 17, 2025 ‘Worthless Coin’ The CNP thinks that “at least 3,646 victims” lost their money to the scammers, 2,718 of whom are Spanish residents. The fraudsters appear to have amassed vast Bitcoin holdings, with crypto wallets containing some BTC 400. Officers say the masterminds also “created a new, worthless token” to investors. The victims were mainly individuals who “had never invested in cryptocurrencies” before, the CNP said. Some corporations also fell victim to the scam, officers added. Officers also froze 73 bank accounts and impounded cars, motorcycles, computer equipment, and hundreds of euros in cash.

Analysts suggest this pattern has been confirmed, as the altcoin has broken above its neckline resistance. This development indicates strong buying pressure, which could push the Ripple token price toward the $30 mark. Bullish Double Bottom Pattern Suggests XRP Price Could Reach $30 According to analyst Steph Is Crypto, XRP price has completed a double-bottom formation by breaking above the neckline resistance. This breakout is considered a strong bullish signal, indicating a potential rally. Historically, once this type of pattern is confirmed, prices tend to rise, with projections based on the pattern’s height extended from the breakout point. The long-term chart of XRP price shows an extended accumulation phase, similar to previous bull cycles. The breakout above the neckline suggests strong buying momentum, potentially triggering an altcoin rally. Top analysts anticipate that if momentum sustains, XRP price could move towards its projected $30 target. Source: X More so, XRP price breakout aligns with increasing trading volume, reinforcing the bullish outlook. A sustained increase in volume after a breakout often indicates institutional participation and growing investor confidence. Additionally, analysts highlight the absence of strong resistance between current levels and the projected target, making a sharp upward movement feasible. Ripple Price Must Hold $2 Support Level Additionally, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out that XRP price is also forming a head-and-shoulders pattern on its weekly chart. This pattern typically signals a trend reversal, with the $2 support level being crucial for maintaining an upward trajectory. Martinez highlighted that if XRP price fails to hold above $2, it could face a decline to $1.25. Traders are closely monitoring this level, as a breakdown below it could lead to further downside pressure. However, if the support holds, XRP could continue its bullish trend and push towards the projected $30 target. Source: X Altcoin Rally and Broader Market Trends The broader cryptocurrency market trend is another factor influencing XRP price. Bitcoin’s performance and macroeconomic factors, such as the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions, could impact investor sentiment. A positive market environment could support an altcoin rally, benefiting XRP’s upward momentum. According to CryptoQuant’s recent analysis, the rising demand for stablecoins is fueling an altcoin season . Experts believe this shift signals a strong rally for altcoins in the coming weeks. The recent market correction has seen XRP price trading between $1.79 and $3.36. A rebound began in early March, with XRP closing the past week in green. At press time, Ripple token price was $2.34, reflecting a 1.95% increase in the last 24 hours. Historical price trends suggest that XRP has undergone extended periods of accumulation before major bull cycles. This pattern appears to be repeating, with XRP price breaking above key resistance zones. Adding to the bullish sentiments, Ripple filed a trademark for downloadable software to custody crypto assets. This move could push the altcoin toward the $5 mark in the coming months and probably cross the $30 price target.

In a new interview on Senator Ted Cruz’s Verdict podcast, Musk says the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has now discovered about 14 “magic money” computers. Musk tells Cruz that these computers are responsible for sending trillions of dollars in payments. “I call a magic money computer any computer that can make money out of thin air. It just issues payments… They just send money out of nothing.” Musk says about 5-10% of the payments executed by these computers are not reported. “You may think that the government computers all talk to each other. They synchronize. They add up what funds are going somewhere and it’s coherent, and that the numbers that you’re presented as a Senator are actually the real numbers. One would think. They’re not.” Musk says DOGE has discovered these computers at the Treasury Department, State Department, Health and Human Services Department and the Defense Department. According to Musk, the government’s systems make it tough to reconcile payments and tackle waste and fraud. “If you want to know what what the situation is with the accounting and you’re trying to reconcile accounting and get rid of waste and fraud, you must be able to analyze the computer databases. Otherwise you can’t figure it out. Because what you’re doing is asking a human – who will then ask another human – and finally usually ask some contractor – who will ask another contractor – to do a query on the computer. So it’s many layers deep. The only way to reconcile the databases and get rid of waste and fraud is to to actually look at the computers and see what’s going on. When I sort of cryptically refer to reprogramming The Matrix, you have to understand what’s going at the computers. You have to reconcile the computer databases in order to identify the waste and fraud.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a new thread, the pseudonymous crypto analyst Pentoshi tells his 861,300 followers on the social media platform X that we are close to seeing the end of quantitative tightening (QT), which are policies that reduce the Fed’s balance sheet and lowers the supply of money in circulation. The trader cites data from the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, which shows that 100% of users believe that the Fed will end QT by May of this year. The cessation of QT is typically seen as bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins as the move signals the end of tight monetary conditions. However, Pentoshi warns investors to be “cautiously optimistic” as both the S&P 500 and top crypto assets have seen growth over the last few years that appears unsustainable. “I think we are getting close to [the] end of QT with Polymarket now pricing in odds as a sure thing whereas before they were much lower odds. As previously stated, it does seem Trump would end up forcing it. I don’t think QT automatically means it’s easy mode. I think that mode is clearly gone overall in the way people think about it (2017/2021). While prices are much lower, I think it’s best to be cautiously optimistic. Many things are down significantly and there hopefully will be some decent mean reversion. Markets in general have rallied hard. And assets were likely a bit overvalued before. SPX going 25% back to back years was going to have low growth or negative this year as it wasn’t a sustainable pace. BTC went from $16,000 to $108,000, SOL [from] $8 to $300. Cautiously optimistic. [Be] patient for any time capitulation, as often, following big trends, we eventually get longer sideways periods and less volatility as the market finds balance.” While Pentoshi is flipping tactically bullish on stocks and crypto, he warns investors that any rally will likely be short-lived. “I think any up currently will be a lower high. People underestimate the time aspect.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $83,248.

The general market sentiment is one of a cautious nature, and hopes of a quick return above $90,000 are starting to fade. However, a new technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a significant rally, as price action shows the cryptocurrency is currently conforming to the cup-and-handle pattern. Cup And Handle Support Could Cause A Major Bitcoin Rally Recent Bitcoin price movements have drawn attention back to a key technical structure of the handle support of a cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting that a bullish setup may be quietly taking shape. This interesting Bitcoin price activity was relayed in a technical analysis by a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suppression Below $100,000 Worries Investors, JPMorgan Analysts Reveal Real Problem The cup-and-handle pattern in question has been forming over multiple years, with the rounded bottom phase stretching from 2021 to mid-2024. This prolonged accumulation period saw Bitcoin gradually recover from the bearish market cycle before breaking above its neckline resistance. The breakout started the handle formation in the latter half of 2024, a consolidation phase that set the stage for BTC’s next leg up. By November 2024, Bitcoin completed this handle phase and went on an impressive rally that ultimately resulted in a new all-time high of $108,786 in January 2025. However, the recent 24% correction from this all-time high has seen the Bitcoin price returning to the neckine resistance of the cup-and-handle formation. The logical next step is for this neckline resistance to serve as support for the price correction and we could see Bitcoin rebound from here. In terms of a price prediction, Elliott wave analysis and projections put the price target above $130,000, particularly at $139,000. Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests A Surge Toward $130,000 According to the Elliot Waves technical framework, Bitcoin is currently in a larger fifth impulse wave formation. However, this fifth wave, which is generally bullish, has been punctuated by corrective ABC sub-waves, leading Bitcoin to retest the support of the cup-and-handle formation. Now that the support has been met, Bitcoin is in a position to bounce and continue the formation of its fifth impulse wave. This is expected to bring it to the price target above $130,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Crashed To 6-Month Low, Here’s What Followed The Last Time The alignment of the cup-and-handle formation with Elliott wave projections strengthens the case for a major breakout in the coming months. However, Bitcoin’s fundamentals reflect uncertainty in the short term. There is currently a lack of bullish momentum needed to rechallenge the $90,000 mark, which would be the first step needed to reach $130,000.

President Donald Trump nominated Atkins to lead the SEC on Dec. 4, but his marriage into a billionaire family has reportedly caused headaches with financial disclosures — delaying his potential start date. While it isn’t clear whether the White House has produced those papers to the Senate, Senate Banking, House and Urban Affairs Chair Tim Scott is reportedly eyeing a March 27 hearing to review Atkins’ standing, Semafor’s Eleanor Mueller said in a March 17 X post. “No clarity yet on whether the committee has Atkins’ paperwork in hand, but either way, this is the most momentum we’ve seen so far.” Atkins would, however, need to be voted in by the Senate at a later date. Mueller also said the Senate banking committee is also planning to hold a bipartisan meeting on Atkins’ nomination on March 21. Source: Eleanor Mueller It follows an earlier March 3 Semafor report , where Mueller said financial disclosures had held Atkins back from scheduling a Senate hearing to review his standing. His wife’s family is tied to TAMKO Building Products LLC — a manufacturer of residential roofing shingles that reportedly turned over $1.2 billion in revenue in 2023, Forbes said on Dec. 14, 2024. “It’s a lot to go through,” one former Senate Banking Committee staffer reportedly told Mueller on March 3. “But he got named so early on, so I think that’s why people are starting to be like, ‘What the hell’s taking so long?’” Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008 and worked as a corporate lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP in New York before that. He is expected to regulate the crypto arena with a more collaborative approach than former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. It’s been almost four months since Atkins was chosen by Trump to lead the SEC on Dec. 4, and over two months since Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. A late start for an SEC chair wouldn’t be too unusual, however. The two most recent SEC chairs, Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton, started on April 17, 2021, and May 4, 2017 — months after presidential transitions occurred in those years. Related: SEC’s enforcement case against Ripple may be wrapping up Meanwhile, Mark Uyeda has been serving as the SEC’s acting chair since Gensler left on Jan. 20. Since then, the Uyeda-led SEC has established a Crypto Task Force led by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and canceled a controversial rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets. The SEC has dropped several investigations and lawsuits that the Gensler-led commission filed against the likes of Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap and OpenSea over the last month. The SEC is also looking to abandon a rule requiring crypto firms to register as exchanges and may even axe the Biden administration’s proposed crypto custody rules, Uyeda said on March 17.

Standard Chartered’s decision to ditch its Ethereum to $10K prediction is the latest in a series of negatives for the asset. Ethereum Price Continues In Descending Channel Recent price movements for Ethereum (ETH) are unpromising with analysts predicting a steeper drop for the asset. At the moment, Ethereum’s price hovers around $1,930 continuing its unenthusiastic ranging pattern. The MACD indicator confirms widespread buying weakness for the second-largest cryptocurrency with bears reigning supreme. Moving averages are pointing to a neutral trend for Ethereum price, sparking theories over a possible consolidation for the asset. “The price continues to move in a descending channel, indicating a possible continuation of consolidation,” said the pseudonymous LVelarde. At the moment, the Ethereum price is consolidating below the 5-day and 200-day moving averages (MA) with traders scanning the horizon for a potential breakout or rejection. Since ETH fell below $2,000 , a slew of dour sentiment has trailed the asset, casting doubt over its long-term future. “In the short term, technical indicators point to a possible retest of support around $1,800-$1,850, and a break below could reinforce the bearish movement,” said LVelarde. Standard Chartered Slashes Its ETH Prediction Ethereum’s community was roiled by Standard Chartered’s reduction of its ETH prediction for 2025 from $10,000 to $4,000. According to a note, Standard Chartered analysts are predicting ETH will continue underperforming ahead of its 10th anniversary. Analysts termed Ethereum’s decline as a “mid-life crisis” with layer 2 Base taking off $50 billion from ETH’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, the incoming Converge blockchain will snag a portion of Ethereum’s market cap as experts call for a radical change. “Only a proactive change of commercial direction from the Ethereum Foundation – such as taxing layer 2 – could achieve that now, in our view,” read the note. Ethereum ETFs have faltered with the inbound 21Shares liquidations of Bitcoin and Ethereum Futures ETFs. Experts say that Pectra activation on the mainnet can trigger a fresh rally for Ethereum price to a $5,000 valuation.

According to the latest analysis by crypto research firm MakroVision, ETH has not seen a strong buying reaction so far. The key question now is whether Ethereum has formed a bottom or if the decline will continue. Analysis shows that Ethereum has dropped below multiple support zones and is revisiting deeper liquidity areas. Despite the brief stabilization, no sustained buying momentum has been seen, leaving the risk of further declines high. Analysts list the key critical price zones for ETH as follows: $2,132: First major hurdle. Ethereum must reclaim this level to start a potential recovery. $2,400: A critical area with descending trend lines. Breaking above this level could signal a trend reversal. $1,730: This level has held so far, but another test could weaken the support. $1,544: The lowest liquidity zone, likely the next target if Ethereum breaks below $1,730.

33767162,[object Object],1742257805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio Reaches Highest Since September: What It Means,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-stress-ratio-highest-september/,"On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin “Supply Stress Ratio” has climbed to 0.23 recently, a sign that may not be positive for the BTC market. Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio Indicates Market Currently Under Stress In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the the latest trend in the Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio. The “Supply Stress Ratio” here refers to an indicator that measures, in the analytics firm’s words, “the relative magnitude of supply in loss.” The BTC Blockchain data is public, meaning anyone can look at the transaction history that the users have participated in. This allows for a way to track things like investor cost basis and profit-loss status. The cost basis of the holders, also known as the Realized Price , can be obtained by assuming that the previous transaction of any token of the cryptocurrency represents the last time that it changed hands. That is, the price at its time was its acquisition value. Comparison of this cost basis against the current spot price can tell us whether the coin is currently being held at a profit or loss. The Supply Stress Ratio makes use precisely of this data to calculate its value. When the indicator’s value is zero, it means no part of the BTC supply is being held at a loss. In other words, the market isn’t under any ‘stress’. This condition occurs only when the asset’s price is exploring new all-time highs (ATHs). The rest of the time, the metric stays above this mark, indicating some portion of the investors are underwater. The higher the indicator’s value, the more the supply is in loss, and so, the higher the market stress. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode, that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio has witnessed a jump recently as the asset’s bearish price action has occurred. The indicator is now sitting at a value of 0.23, which is the highest since September. “Historically, values above 0.2 have marked periods of heightened market stress,” notes the analytics firm. In the chart, the data of two other metrics is also displayed. Colored in red is the Realized Price of the Supply in Loss , meaning that it’s the average value at which the loss holders purchased their coins. Similarly, the blue line represents the Realized Price of the Supply in Profit . The stress that the loss investors are under right now is also visible from these metrics, as the spot price of the asset is currently trading notably under the red curve. So far, Bitcoin has shown stabilization around its lows, but it only remains to be seen whether the decline is over or if there is more to come. Naturally, a further drawdown would mean an increase in the Supply Stress Ratio. “If the value continues to rise, it could signal increasing market pressure, potentially reinforcing a broader shift in sentiment,” explains Glassnode. BTC Price Bitcoin has taken to sideways movement recently as its price is still floating around the $83,000 mark, printing flat returns for the week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin profitability|Bitcoin Supply In Loss|Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-18 00:30:05

From Dogecoin’s legendary rise to Pepe’s unexpected pump, these tokens thrive on community, culture, and virality. But in a crowded market, finding the best new meme coins for massive return potential isn’t easy. Some offer staking rewards, others ride pop culture waves, and a few even integrate AI. So, which ones have what it takes to explode in the following years? BTFD Coin’s presale is nearing its final stages, having already raised over $6.32 million with more than 71 billion coins sold. As Stage 14 wraps up, the chance to grab BTFD at $0.00016 is fading fast. With projections pointing to a potential moonshot of $0.006, early buyers could be looking at a staggering 3,650% ROI. And with its 10% referral rewards program , it’s not just about buying—it’s about earning, too. 1. BTFD Coin – The Meme Coin That Rewards Its Holders Built around the philosophy of “Buying The Dip,” this Ethereum-based project has captivated the crypto community with its bullish spirit, high APY staking, and referral rewards program. The BTFD Coin Rewards Program is a game-changer. Investors who refer others earn 10% of their referral’s raise amount in BTFD tokens if they make it to the top 20 leaderboard at the end of the month. Meanwhile, those using a referral code get a 10% bonus on their purchase if they invest at least $50. For investors eyeing long-term gains, the numbers are enticing. A $1,000 investment at the presale price of $0.00016 could net over 6.25 million BTFD coins. If BTFD hits $0.0006 upon launch, that investment balloons to $3,750. And if it surges to $0.006 as some predict? That same $1,000 could transform into a staggering $37,500. Why this meme coin made it to this list: BTFD rewards its holders with a referral system that incentivizes growth while offering a pathway to massive returns. Plus, its thriving community (11,400+ strong) and staking potential make it a solid bet. 2. Gigachad – The Alpha of the Meme Coin Space Gigachad is a meme coin that celebrates internet masculinity and the ultimate “Sigma” mindset. With a strong NFT integration, Gigachad offers holders access to exclusive content, community perks, and governance votes within its ecosystem. This coin thrives on meme culture, backed by a die-hard following that’s spreading its dominance across social media. Why this meme coin made it to this list: Its viral appeal, NFT utility, and ultra-engaged community make Gigachad one to watch. 3. Floki Inu – The Viking-Inspired Meme Coin with Impressive Utility Floki Inu has evolved beyond meme status, building an ecosystem with a metaverse game, DeFi tools, and even an education platform. The project is named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, giving it an initial boost, but its roadmap shows long-term ambitions that set it apart. Why this meme coin made it to this list: With real-world utility and an expanding ecosystem, Floki Inu has staying power beyond the hype among the best new meme coins for massive return potential. 4. Bone ShibaSwap – The Governance Powerhouse Bone ShibaSwap serves as the governance token of the ShibaSwap DEX, allowing users to vote on proposals that shape the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It’s a vital part of Shiba’s DeFi ambitions and is a must-watch for investors bullish on the Shiba Inu brand. Why this meme coin made it to this list: As a governance token with real decision-making power, Bone plays a crucial role in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 5. Just a Chill Guy – 2024’s Most Viral Meme This meme coin embodies a stress-free approach to crypto investing, with a community focused on positivity and rewards. Just a Chill Guy offers passive income through staking and fun engagement in its meme-driven ecosystem. Why this meme coin made it to this list: It turns crypto into a relaxing experience, blending humor with solid tokenomics. 6. Peanut the Squirrel – The Acorn Collector of Crypto After Peanut’s emotional story went viral, the community rallied by creating this meme coin as tribute, and it’s still relevant to this day. Dedicating part of the profits to wildlife preservation initiatives, this meme coin is far more than its viral appeal. Why this meme coin made it to this list: It’s a meme coin with heart and soul, giving it a unique, charitable edge over other best meme coins for massive return potential. 7. SLERF – The Dark Horse with Explosive Potential Backed by an anonymous team, SLERF has cultivated a passionate following eager to see where the project leads. However, it depends on its virality and the market hype, positioning itself as a high-risk bet with potentially insane rewards if it gains traction once again.

The rally coincided with another positive day for U.S. stocks, providing a favorable backdrop for cryptocurrencies. Despite the bullish price action, some analysts remain cautious. Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Group, warned that the monthly chart of the S&P 500 is pointing to a potential correction in U.S. equities, which could negatively impact cryptocurrencies. “Given the state of global trade tensions and concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy, there is concern that stocks could fall further at a time when it is increasingly unclear how much more accommodation the Fed can provide,” Kruger said. Related News: Binance Finally Brought The Expected Feature: Added to the Home Page, Here are the Impacted Altcoins Kruger also noted that if there is a broader correction in the market, Bitcoin could return to its March 2024 highs of around $73,000-$74,000. Investors are closely watching this week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates at current levels. However, analysts are watching for potential changes to the central bank's quantitative tightening (QT) program that could impact market liquidity. David Duong, director of research at Coinbase Institutional, suggested that the Fed could pause or end the QT program as bank reserve levels approach the 10-11% of GDP threshold deemed necessary for financial stability. Duong attributed the recent crypto sell-off to macroeconomic concerns and worsening liquidity conditions. However, he believes that these conditions could improve in the coming quarters and provide some support for asset prices. “Cryptocurrency prices could find bottoms in the next few weeks before hitting new highs later this year,” Duong said. *This is not investment advice.
