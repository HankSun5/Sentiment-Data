It’s the smallest Bitcoin purchase in Strategy history, both in terms of BTC total and US dollar value. Strategy Snaps Up Additional 130 BTC According to a March 17 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy purchased 130 Bitcoin for approximately $10.7 million at an average price of $82,981 per coin between March 10 and March 16. Strategy has acquired 130 BTC for ~$10.7M at ~$82,981 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 6.9% YTD 2025. As of 3/16/2025, we hodl 499,226 $BTC acquired for ~$33.1 billion at ~$66,360 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK https://t.co/8xRmR8vlIt — Michael Saylor (@saylor) March 17, 2025 The recent purchase represented Strategy’s smallest Bitcoin acquisition since the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm started accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020 under the leadership of Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. Since that time, the business intelligence firm has remodeled itself into a Bitcoin development company and pioneered the crypto treasury reserve asset model that other publicly traded companies have emulated. Strategy’s Massive $41 Billion Bitcoin Gamble While the latest buy is Strategy’s smallest, the company had its largest acquisition of 2025 on Feb. 24, scooping up 20,365 BTC for $1.9 billion, as ZyCrypto reported . Strategy announced earlier this month that it may soon sell $21 billion of its STRK preferred stock to acquire more Bitcoin. The announcement dovetailed the company’s plans in October to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed income sales in the next three years for additional buying power. Strategy now holds a whopping 499,226 BTC, valued at over $41 billion — making it the largest corporate treasury reserve holder of the apex crypto. For perspective, the company owns nearly 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total supply. However, that mark is considerably below Saylor’s recent suggestion that the United States should acquire 25% of the supply, adding that the massive Bitcoin reserve could generate between $16 trillion and $18 trillion in wealth for the U.S., thus helping eliminate the entire national debt. Regardless of whether or not the US purchases Bitcoin, Saylor stressed that he has no plans of halting BTC purchases, previously suggesting he would be “ buying the top forever ”.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION|STRK,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-17 22:14:37

Sadly, mostly older adults in the country are falling for the tricks. Authorities have alerted the public to be very careful, as these scammers use advanced technology to steal millions from unsuspecting individuals. Older Malaysian Investors Are the Biggest Targets Older investors, also known as older citizens in Malaysia, are now prime targets in crypto scams. Scammers deceive these older citizens, as many do not understand crypto investments well. They promise quick and easy profits, convincing victims to buy expensive coins that do not exist. Once the money is sent, it disappears. In a recent case, a 74-year-old man lost tens of millions of ringgit after buying fake cryptocurrency. Authorities warned that many of these crypto assets are fake and advised traders to research before investing in any digital assets. Scammers also create fake websites and investment platforms that look real, making it hard for victims to notice any fraudulent act until it is too late. Officials urged investors to verify the legitimacy of any project before making financial decisions. Crypto Scams Featuring AI Tools and Fake Calls Crypto scams is not the only financial crime rising in Malaysia. Phone scams are also a big problem. Scammers pretend to be bank workers, police officers, or government officials. They trick people into sending them money. Many scams start with a fake courier call. The scammer connects the victim to a fake police officer, bank official, or audit expert in the same call. Officials warned that real government agencies do not operate this way. Fraudsters also use advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep-fake tools, to make their schemes more believable . Experts worry these tricks will only become more sophisticated over time. Nevertheless, Malaysian authorities are taking steps ahead in fighting cybercrime and protecting digital services. Last year, they arrested thousands of suspected individuals linked to scam syndicates, marking a major effort in the fight against financial fraud. They also use AI and blockchain to detect and flag suspicious activity on digital platforms before traders and investors lose money. The Rise of Illegal Bitcoin Mining in Malaysia Malaysia is facing more cases of illegal Bitcoin mining. Reportedly, some miners steal electricity to power their mining machines, causing big losses for the country’s power grid. Officials have found many mining farms using stolen electricity. These illegal operations strain the country’s energy supply and create concerns about cybersecurity risks.

The world of AI just took a surprising turn, and it’s got some serious implications for digital content and, by extension, the world of NFTs and digital ownership we’re so passionate about. Google’s brand-new AI model , Gemini 2.0 Flash, just unlocked a skill that’s turning heads and raising eyebrows in equal measure: effortless watermark removal from images. Is this a game-changer for content creation, or a Pandora’s Box for copyright infringement ? Let’s dive into this fascinating, and potentially disruptive, development. The Gemini AI Watermark Removal Revolution: What’s Happening? Social media is buzzing with reports of users leveraging Google’s latest AI model to perform what was once a tedious and often imperfect task: removing watermarks from images. Imagine taking a stock photo, riddled with a Getty Images watermark, and with a few simple prompts, poof! Watermark gone, seemingly like magic. This isn’t just about tidying up photos; it’s a potential seismic shift in how we perceive digital ownership and copyright in the age of AI. Here’s the lowdown: Gemini 2.0 Flash Unleashed: Google recently broadened access to its Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model , boasting native image generation and editing capabilities. This is powerful tech in anyone’s book. The Watermark Wizard: Users quickly discovered Gemini’s uncanny ability to not just remove watermarks, but also intelligently fill in the gaps left behind, making the edits nearly seamless. Social Media Buzz: Platforms like X and Reddit are flooded with examples showcasing Gemini’s watermark-banishing prowess. The ease and effectiveness are genuinely impressive. New skill unlocked: Gemini 2 Flash model is really awesome at removing watermarks in images! pic.twitter.com/6QIk0FlfCv — Deedy (@deedydas) March 15, 2025 Gemini 2.0 Flash, available in Google’s AI studio, is amazing at editing images with simple text prompts. It also can remove watermarks from images (and puts its own subtle watermark in instead ) pic.twitter.com/ZnHTQJsT1Z — Tanay Jaipuria (@tanayj) March 16, 2025 Is This the End of Watermarks? Exploring the Implications of AI-Powered Image Editing While the tech is undeniably cool, the implications of AI’s newfound ability for image editing , specifically watermark removal , are far-reaching and complex. Let’s consider some key points: Copyright Concerns Soar: The most immediate concern is, of course, copyright infringement . Removing watermarks is essentially stripping away the visual declaration of ownership. Imagine the impact on stock photo agencies and artists who rely on watermarks to protect their work and revenue. Ethical Gray Areas: While some AI models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o actively refuse to remove watermarks citing ethical and legal reasons, Gemini 2.0 Flash seemingly has no such qualms. This raises questions about the ethical guidelines and responsibilities of AI developers. Not Foolproof, Yet: It’s crucial to note that Gemini isn’t perfect. It struggles with semi-transparent watermarks or those covering large image areas. However, the technology is still in its early stages and rapidly evolving. Google’s Stance: Google has acknowledged the issue, stating that using Gemini for copyright infringement violates their terms of service. They label the feature as “experimental” and “not for production use,” and claim to be monitoring feedback. However, the ease of access and lack of built-in restrictions are still worrying. The Legal Landscape: Watermark Removal and Copyright Infringement Legally speaking, removing a watermark without the copyright holder’s permission is generally considered illegal under US copyright law, except in very specific circumstances. Think about it – watermarks are a form of digital signature, and tampering with them can have serious legal ramifications. For the crypto and NFT space, where digital provenance and ownership are paramount, this development adds another layer of complexity. Consider this table to understand the contrasting approaches: AI Model Watermark Removal Capability Ethical/Legal Stance Gemini 2.0 Flash Yes, highly effective Potentially problematic, terms of service violation for copyright infringement Claude 3.7 Sonnet No Explicitly refuses, deems it unethical and potentially illegal GPT-4o No Explicitly refuses, aligns with ethical and legal considerations Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Era of AI Image Editing So, what does this mean for you? Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Be Aware, Not Alarmed: While the watermark removal capability is powerful, it’s still experimental. Don’t panic, but stay informed. Respect Copyright: Just because the technology exists doesn’t make copyright infringement okay. Always respect creators’ rights and seek proper permissions for image use. For Creators: Consider robust watermarking strategies, but also explore blockchain-based solutions for digital ownership verification, which are increasingly relevant in the NFT and crypto space. For Developers: The responsibility is on AI developers to implement ethical guardrails and usage restrictions to prevent misuse of powerful image editing tools like Gemini. Conclusion: A Powerful Tool with a Shadow of Doubt Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model ‘s ability to perform seamless watermark removal is undeniably impressive. It showcases the rapid advancements in AI and image editing . However, this “amazing” capability comes with a significant shadow of doubt regarding copyright infringement and ethical usage. As the technology evolves, it’s crucial for developers, users, and legal frameworks to adapt to ensure responsible innovation and protect the rights of content creators in this brave new world of AI-powered tools.

Canary is a frequent crypto ETF applicant. This would reportedly be the first SUI ETF in the United States. The Canary SUI ETF would be structured as a trust. Canary stated that it intended to stake some of its SUI through providers that will enable the trust to establish validator nodes. Staking leads to possible taxation in connection with staking rewards. Investors can get SUI in different ways SUI is the native token of the Sui network, a layer-1 blockchain that was developed by Mysten Labs. According to the S-1, its transaction speed and scalability make it suitable for gaming and high-frequency trading. Canary telegraphed its intentions to create the ETF when it registered a Canary SUI ETF statutory trust in Delaware on March 6. Before an ETF can be launched, the exchange that will host it has to file form 19b-4 with the SEC. That form requests changes in the rules for the exchange that would allow the new ETF to be listed. Canary did not specify an exchange in its S-1. Although this is the first suggestion of a SUI ETF in the United States, exchange-traded product issuer Valour has a SUI product on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market denominated in Swedish kronor. In addition, Switzerland-based 21Shares offers a SUI staking ETP. VanEck offers a SUI exchange-traded note (ETN). An ETN also tracks an asset but, unlike an ETF, the issuer does not own any of the assets. Sui and Franklin Templeton announced a “strategic partnership” in November, although it was not clear what the goals of that partnership were. Grayscale has a SUI exchange-traded note (ETN) The ETN tracks the price of SUI but is a closed fund, whereas an ETF is open-ended. On March 6, World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance protocol linked to the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, announced that it would include SUI in its strategic reserves and it explore product development opportunities with Sui. Canary Capital has big altcoin ambitions The SUI ETF is not the only first Nashville-based Canary has stocked up. In December, it was the first to apply for an LTC (Litecoin) ETF. Canary Capital has filed with the SEC for several crypto ETFs, including Hedera , Solana , and XRP . Canary also runs a digital asset fund that invests in digital assets and crypto equity funds whose prices have fallen below their net asset value. Altcoin ETFs may become more common. For example, Grayscale has applied for Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs, while 21Shares is also looking into Solana, XRP, and Polkadot ETFs. Hashdex applied to the SEC to expand its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF to include Solana, XRP, Cardano, Chainlink, Avalanche, Litecoin and Uniswap in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The new program, ""Onchain Labs,"" is designed to provide go-to-market support to ""experimental and volatile"" projects, according to a blog post from Offchain Labs, Arbitrum's main developer. “Through Onchain Labs, we’re dedicating resources to support developers looking to rapidly expand the application layer by ideating with them from the ground floor to bring the best user experiences to Arbitrum,” the blog post said. “As we do with many Arbitrum teams, we’ll provide product and [go-to-market] support to these early-stage projects, collaborating closely to help their applications thrive on Arbitrum.” Arbitrum Foundation is a non-profit that stewards Arbitrum ecosystem governance. Offchain Labs, which created the blockchain in 2021, focuses on developer tooling and core network infrastructure. Offchain Labs is pitching its new initiative as a way to spur greater activity and interest in the wider Arbitrum ecosystem. According to the blog post from the company, the first Onchain Labs projects will soon emerge from stealth. Offchain Labs said the only projects supported by its new program will be those that explicitly ""commit to fair and equitable launches"" — presumably meaning they avoid token launches and other mechanics that preference insiders. Offchain Labs stated in its blog post that the selection criteria are meant to avoid ""extractive ecosystems"" and ""zero-sum games."" Tandem, Offchain Labs' venture capital arm, ""may or may not purchase associated tokens in public markets,"" the company added. Arbitrum is a layer-2 optimistic rollup network on Ethereum. Like other rollups, the chain is designed to process transactions faster and more cheaply than the main Ethereum blockchain. Several new blockchains are built on Arbitrum's technical framework, forming a network of interconnected blockchains called Arbitrum 'Orbit.' Arbitrum is currently the largest layer-2 network on Ethereum, with roughly $12.2 billion on its primary 'Arbitrum One' chain, according to L2beat .

According to the application , the firm applied for the trademark on February 25. The accompanying statement explaining the term suggests that it will apply to downloaded software, financial services, peer-to-peer network computer services, and cloud software that can be used for the custody, storage, and transmission of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. One of the statement reads: “Financial services, namely, custodial services in the nature of maintaining storage and possession of cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency for financial management purposes.” These statements, which describe the potential application of the term, have led to speculation about what Ripple might be planning in the coming months. Most times, a trademark application such as this suggests that a company is finalizing its plans to unveil a product. In 2024, Ripple for trademarks for Ripple Payments, RLUSD, and Ripple USD, a few months before launching the RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, the news of the application has attracted different reactions from the XRP community. Noah Christopher on X believes that Ripple is expanding into custody and payments to boost its adoption, while Faril speculates that the US might rely on Ripple to custody its crypto reserves. However, some users have noted that a Ripple Custody app already exists in the App Store. It is simply an authenticator app for institutional customers signing transactions using Metaco to custody their assets. Ripple bought the digital asset custody firm Metaco in 2023. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has already received and acknowledged the trademark application but has not assigned it to an examiner. The approval process for a trademark in the US only takes a few months unless it is contested. XRP remains in the green despite a turbulent year While there is no clarity yet on whether Ripple is planning a custody product or has already launched one, its XRP token remains in the only top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap with some gains year-to-date. Per CoinMarketCap data, the token is up more than 1% YTD after losing more than 10% of its value in the past 90 days. Although this might seem inconsequential, it represents a much better performance than Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Cardano ADA, DOGE, and Tron TRX, all of which have been down between 14% and 46% since January 2025. XRP’s positive performance is due to various factors, including the expectation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon drop the lawsuit against Ripple over the token’s status. With the regulator dropping crypto-related actions against Coinbase, Uniswap, and Robinhood, many believe that Ripple is next. XPR ETF for 2025 is at 75% Yes (Source: Polymarket) The market expectations are clearly evident in the Polymarket contract on whether the SEC will approve an XRP exchange-traded fund in 2025.

Here’s what this reset could mean for BTC, based on past trends. Bitcoin Open Interest Has Gone Through A Crash Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC Open Interest has seen a retest recently. The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of futures positions related to Bitcoin that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Peak In? This Data Suggests Otherwise, Analytics Firm Says When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up more positions on the market. Generally, the total leverage present in the sector goes up when this happens, so this kind of trend can lead to more volatility for the asset. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the futures users are closing up positions or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. As leverage decreases following such a trend, the market can act in a more stable manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest, as well as its 90-day percentage change, over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest shot up to a new all-time high (ATH) of $33.6 billion back in January. Interestingly, this peak in the indicator coincided with the ATH in the price itself. As mentioned before, a rise in the Open Interest can lead to volatility for the cryptocurrency. The reason behind this lies in the fact that a mass liquidation event, popularly known as a squeeze, can become more probable to occur when the market is overleveraged. In such an event, a sharp swing in the price triggers a large amount of simultaneous liquidations, which end up acting as fuel for the move itself, thus elongating its length. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations. The volatility emerging out of an increase in the Open Interest can, in theory, take Bitcoin in either direction. During the earlier bull rally, the Open Interest increase was accompanied by bullish momentum. From the chart, it’s visible, however, that the indicator reached a turning point around the time of the aforementioned peak. As bearish momentum took over Bitcoin following the ATH, it was now the turn of the bulls to get liquidated. The massive long squeezes that the price legs down induced helped to further the price decline, explaining its sharpness. Related Reading: Dogecoin Can Still Go Parabolic If This Support Holds, Analyst Says Today, the Open Interest is down to just $23.1 billion, with the indicator’s 90-day change sitting at a notable low of -14%. In the chart, the quant has highlighted the previous deleveraging events where the metric plummeted in a similar manner. “Looking at historical trends, each past deleveraging like this has provided good opportunities for the short to medium term,” notes the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether this cooldown in the futures market will be enough for Bitcoin to see a rebound or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $83,500, up 1% in the last 24 hours.

Is a Fall or a Rebound More Likely?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-in-bitcoin-in-the-coming-days-is-a-fall-or-a-rebound-more-likely/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price action suggests that institutional investors have yet to make a strong comeback, leaving the market in a consolidation phase. According to a report from Bitfinex, Bitcoin fell significantly from its all-time high of $109,590 on Jan. 20 to a low of $77,041 last week. This 29.7% drop marks the second deepest correction in the current bull market. Historically, bull markets tend to experience corrections of around 30% before resuming their rise, according to Bitfinex. However, this cycle has been characterized by shallower pullbacks, largely due to institutional adoption and demand from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite this, short-term holders are currently facing net unrealized losses, adding to the sell-side pressure. Investors who bought Bitcoin in the past 7 to 30 days are particularly vulnerable to capitulation, which further exacerbates market weakness, analysts say. Related News: Outlook Changes in Altcoin Dominance Analysis Firm Draws Particular Attention to These 10 Altcoins A major concern highlighted in the report is the slowdown in fresh capital inflows. When new money enters the market lessens and cost basis trends shift, this is typically a sign of weakening demand. This is becoming more apparent as Bitcoin struggles to maintain key support levels. Without significant new buying activity, BTC could remain in a prolonged period of consolidation or face further declines as weaker holders exit their positions. Market analysts suggest that the return of long-term holders and institutional demand will be critical in determining Bitcoin’s next move. If deep-pocketed investors begin to absorb supply at these low levels, it could signal the start of an accumulation phase, potentially stabilizing prices and shifting market sentiment back into bullish territory. *This is not investment advice.

In terms of Bitcoin holdings, North Korea is the fifth largest country in the world. / Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The Scale of North Korean Cybercrime North Korea’s vast wealth in cryptocurrencies stems from years of cyberattacks and crypto heists, including the 2024 DMM Bitcoin exploit in Japan and the 2022 Ronin Network breach , where Lazarus stole $308 million and over $600 million, respectively. The Lazarus Group refers to a large subset of state-sponsored cyber activities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), operating as an integral wing of North Korea’s central foreign intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). Chainalysis’ Crypto Crime 2025 Report shows North Korean hackers stole $660.5 million in 2023 and $1.34 billion in 2024, marking a 102.88% year-over-year increase. One of the most recent examples of North Korea’s expanding cyber operations is the Bybit hack. Bybit Attack: North Korea’s Massive Crypto Theft The dramatic increase in North Korea’s Bitcoin holdings is directly linked to the February 2025 attack on the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. The Lazarus Group organized the theft of over 400,000 Ether from Bybit’s secure multi-signature cold wallet. Following the theft, Lazarus employed sophisticated techniques to launder the stolen Ether and convert it into Bitcoin. The group exploited decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like THORChain, which faced criticism for lacking strong anti-crime protections. This allowed Lazarus to obscure the origins of the stolen funds and facilitate their conversion into Bitcoin. This attack has consequences beyond Bybit’s financial losses. According to the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) , proceeds from cyberattacks, along with other illicit wealth generated by North Korean-funded syndicates, fund North Korea’s nuclear missile program and pose a major threat to international security.

Hashdex’s move could open the door for major investors to explore altcoins, reshaping crypto investment priorities. Litecoin’s inclusion challenges the Bitcoin-Ethereum dominance, pushing investors to reconsider diversification strategies Crypto asset management firm Hashdex submitted an amendment proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last Friday to add Litecoin (LTC) to its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. If approved, Litecoin will join the ETF’s other proposed digital assets, broadening its exposure to the traditional financial market and institutional investors within a regulated environment. Litecoin Gains ETF Exposure as Hashdex Seeks Broader Crypto Holdings The March 14 filing , filed under file number 333-280990, outlined Hashdex’s plans to expand its Crypto Index ETF portfolio beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The revised index is expected to include additional cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI), with each operating on its respective blockchain network. Particularly, the addition of Litecoin would further diversify the fund’s holdings and attract investors interested in a wider array of cryptocurrencies. BTW, @hashdex 's CEO @SamirKerbage is going to be at the Litecoin Summit in Vegas the end of May. Just sayin'. https://t.co/SkVxJC7X2a https://t.co/dEUqIkRanV — Litecoin (@litecoin) March 17, 2025 An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of assets—such as stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies—traded on stock exchanges. It allows investors to buy and sell shares throughout the day, offering diversification by spreading risk across multiple assets. Hashdex’s proposal to add Litecoin isn’t random. Litecoin has been around for over a decade, often seen as Bitcoin’s lighter, faster counterpart. Its features, such as its popularity, strong liquidity, and lower transaction fees, make it an interesting addition to an ETF. If this gets the green light, it would be another step towards integrating crypto with traditional finance, which would give both big institutions and everyday investors more options to diversify their portfolios. Brazil ETF Approval Highlights Hashdex Expansion Strategy Recently, Hashdex secured approval from Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the world’s first XRP spot ETF on the B3 stock exchange. This approval allows Brazilian investors to gain exposure to XRP through a regulated investment vehicle. Hashdex continues to provide more crypto investment options while signaling increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets. The Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund was officially established on February 18, 2025, and Genial Investimentos was appointed its administrator.

Since Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs received approval in 2024, fund issuers have accelerated efforts to broaden their offerings. SEC Decision on Litecoin Could Boost Hashdex Crypto Index ETF Expansion Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimate a 90% likelihood of Litecoin ETF approval before the end of 2025. Their prediction places Litecoin ahead of Solana (70%), Dogecoin (75%), and XRP (65%). Our official alt coin ETF approval odds are out. Litecoin leads w 90% chance, then Doge, followed by Solana and XRP. We are only doing for 33 Act $IBIT -esque filings.

Demand for crypto ETFs has surged, with spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs attracting $40.7 billion and $3.18 billion in net inflows since their launches. While a Litecoin ETF may not see the same demand, Seyffart notes that even modest inflows could make it viable for fund issuers. The SEC’s final decision on Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs is expected between October 2 and 18, a timeline closely watched by investors and fund issuers looking to expand the reach of crypto index ETFs. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does Litecoin’s classification as a commodity impact its chances of ETF approval? Since Litecoin is considered a commodity rather than a security, it avoids the tougher regulations and doubts that securities may face in the same situation. This makes it easier to get approval since it sidesteps the SEC’s stricter oversight on securities branded cryptocurrencies. What are the risks of a Litecoin ETF? Among the risks known primarily to ETFs is their reliance on third parties to store assets safely. These parties are often centralized and leave space for potential price manipulation due to crypto’s volatility and liquidity issues. Could a Litecoin ETF lead to more altcoin ETFs? Yes, if Litecoin’s ETF gets approved, it could pave the way for others like Solana and XRP. A green light from regulators would show they’re open to approving beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, which would mean they are now open to altcoins, too.

CZ was responding to a post on X (formerly Twitter) by crypto influencer EmperorBTC, who analyzes the psychological landscape of market participants. “The bar for success in crypto is very low,” EmperorBTC said, arguing that most investors are ill-equipped to deal with the volatile nature of the crypto market. According to EmperorBTC, 80% of crypto investors are simply “tourists,” entering the market excitedly and leaving when sentiment changes. Another 10% are making buying and selling decisions based on misleading influencers, while another 5% believe they are falsely projecting wealth. That leaves only the 5% who truly understand crypto, he claimed. Related News: Binance Finally Brought The Expected Feature: Added to the Home Page, Here are the Impacted Altcoins CZ weighed in on these statistics, suggesting that even among the 5% of so-called “insiders,” most have failed to outperform Bitcoin. “Even if there were a 5% who were true experts in crypto, most of them still wouldn’t be able to outperform Bitcoin,” he said. He also noted that within this group, only 4% actively trade or allocate capital to blockchain projects, but they still lag behind Bitcoin’s long-term performance. CZ said that simply holding Bitcoin outperforms 99% of crypto market participants and even outperforms most traditional asset classes with minimal effort. Despite Bitcoin’s dominance, CZ admitted that rising into the top 1% of crypto investors requires extraordinary effort, deep market knowledge, and constant work. *This is not investment advice.

Per the news agency EFE (via Infobae ), police officers said they had “dismantled” a “criminal organization” that promoted “fake cryptocurrency investments.” Spanish Police Make Arrests in Malaga, Madrid, Murcia Officers said they have arrested eight people, but fear that “more than 3,600 people” have lost money to the crypto scam . National Police Corp vehicles in Spain. (Source: Supertoni123 [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The National Police Corps (CNP)’s Economic and Financial Crime Unit said the network’s mastermind was a “computer programmer” whom they arrested in Malaga. The CNP also made arrests in the cities of Murcia, and Madrid, detaining people of “various nationalities and backgrounds.” The detainees include “marketing and web design experts,” officers said. Police say the group developed a “seemingly legitimate platform that offered clients a choice of Bitcoin investment plans.” They then allegedly promoted these products on various websites and social media platforms. Victims, police said, “did not need to know anything about crypto,” as the alleged scam operators “made it easy for people to convert hundreds, even thousands of euros into Bitcoin.” The alleged scammers were also able to dupe some “victims” into surrendering control of their electronic devices to “carry out crypto transfers themselves, in addition to stealing their personal and banking data.” Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Operation Began in 2022 – Police The CNP first learned of the operation in 2022, when a “victim” filed a report in Murcia. As police investigated, they unearthed a complicated network of investments whereby older investors were paid using newer investors’ funds. When people tried to withdraw their funds from the platform, the operators would reportedly concoct “obstacles” to delay or obfuscate the process. One officer told EFE that some “victims” signed “contracts” with the operators, who “promised to pay dividends of 40% after one month,” and “up to 300% after a year.” The police force eventually found a “trail” of fraud that “included thousands of victims in as many as 36 countries.” Spain’s economy is getting a boost thanks to the country’s attractiveness for remote workers, according to central bank chief Jose Luis Escriva https://t.co/ke3IYbcEbh — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 17, 2025 ‘Worthless Coin’ The CNP thinks that “at least 3,646 victims” lost their money to the scammers, 2,718 of whom are Spanish residents. The fraudsters appear to have amassed vast Bitcoin holdings, with crypto wallets containing some BTC 400. Officers say the masterminds also “created a new, worthless token” to investors. The victims were mainly individuals who “had never invested in cryptocurrencies” before, the CNP said. Some corporations also fell victim to the scam, officers added. Officers also froze 73 bank accounts and impounded cars, motorcycles, computer equipment, and hundreds of euros in cash.

Analysts suggest this pattern has been confirmed, as the altcoin has broken above its neckline resistance. This development indicates strong buying pressure, which could push the Ripple token price toward the $30 mark. Bullish Double Bottom Pattern Suggests XRP Price Could Reach $30 According to analyst Steph Is Crypto, XRP price has completed a double-bottom formation by breaking above the neckline resistance. This breakout is considered a strong bullish signal, indicating a potential rally. Historically, once this type of pattern is confirmed, prices tend to rise, with projections based on the pattern’s height extended from the breakout point. The long-term chart of XRP price shows an extended accumulation phase, similar to previous bull cycles. The breakout above the neckline suggests strong buying momentum, potentially triggering an altcoin rally. Top analysts anticipate that if momentum sustains, XRP price could move towards its projected $30 target. Source: X More so, XRP price breakout aligns with increasing trading volume, reinforcing the bullish outlook. A sustained increase in volume after a breakout often indicates institutional participation and growing investor confidence. Additionally, analysts highlight the absence of strong resistance between current levels and the projected target, making a sharp upward movement feasible. Ripple Price Must Hold $2 Support Level Additionally, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out that XRP price is also forming a head-and-shoulders pattern on its weekly chart. This pattern typically signals a trend reversal, with the $2 support level being crucial for maintaining an upward trajectory. Martinez highlighted that if XRP price fails to hold above $2, it could face a decline to $1.25. Traders are closely monitoring this level, as a breakdown below it could lead to further downside pressure. However, if the support holds, XRP could continue its bullish trend and push towards the projected $30 target. Source: X Altcoin Rally and Broader Market Trends The broader cryptocurrency market trend is another factor influencing XRP price. Bitcoin’s performance and macroeconomic factors, such as the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions, could impact investor sentiment. A positive market environment could support an altcoin rally, benefiting XRP’s upward momentum. According to CryptoQuant’s recent analysis, the rising demand for stablecoins is fueling an altcoin season . Experts believe this shift signals a strong rally for altcoins in the coming weeks. The recent market correction has seen XRP price trading between $1.79 and $3.36. A rebound began in early March, with XRP closing the past week in green. At press time, Ripple token price was $2.34, reflecting a 1.95% increase in the last 24 hours. Historical price trends suggest that XRP has undergone extended periods of accumulation before major bull cycles. This pattern appears to be repeating, with XRP price breaking above key resistance zones. Adding to the bullish sentiments, Ripple filed a trademark for downloadable software to custody crypto assets. This move could push the altcoin toward the $5 mark in the coming months and probably cross the $30 price target.

In a new interview on Senator Ted Cruz’s Verdict podcast, Musk says the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has now discovered about 14 “magic money” computers. Musk tells Cruz that these computers are responsible for sending trillions of dollars in payments. “I call a magic money computer any computer that can make money out of thin air. It just issues payments… They just send money out of nothing.” Musk says about 5-10% of the payments executed by these computers are not reported. “You may think that the government computers all talk to each other. They synchronize. They add up what funds are going somewhere and it’s coherent, and that the numbers that you’re presented as a Senator are actually the real numbers. One would think. They’re not.” Musk says DOGE has discovered these computers at the Treasury Department, State Department, Health and Human Services Department and the Defense Department. According to Musk, the government’s systems make it tough to reconcile payments and tackle waste and fraud. “If you want to know what what the situation is with the accounting and you’re trying to reconcile accounting and get rid of waste and fraud, you must be able to analyze the computer databases. Otherwise you can’t figure it out. Because what you’re doing is asking a human – who will then ask another human – and finally usually ask some contractor – who will ask another contractor – to do a query on the computer. So it’s many layers deep. The only way to reconcile the databases and get rid of waste and fraud is to to actually look at the computers and see what’s going on. When I sort of cryptically refer to reprogramming The Matrix, you have to understand what’s going at the computers. You have to reconcile the computer databases in order to identify the waste and fraud.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a new thread, the pseudonymous crypto analyst Pentoshi tells his 861,300 followers on the social media platform X that we are close to seeing the end of quantitative tightening (QT), which are policies that reduce the Fed’s balance sheet and lowers the supply of money in circulation. The trader cites data from the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, which shows that 100% of users believe that the Fed will end QT by May of this year. The cessation of QT is typically seen as bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins as the move signals the end of tight monetary conditions. However, Pentoshi warns investors to be “cautiously optimistic” as both the S&P 500 and top crypto assets have seen growth over the last few years that appears unsustainable. “I think we are getting close to [the] end of QT with Polymarket now pricing in odds as a sure thing whereas before they were much lower odds. As previously stated, it does seem Trump would end up forcing it. I don’t think QT automatically means it’s easy mode. I think that mode is clearly gone overall in the way people think about it (2017/2021). While prices are much lower, I think it’s best to be cautiously optimistic. Many things are down significantly and there hopefully will be some decent mean reversion. Markets in general have rallied hard. And assets were likely a bit overvalued before. SPX going 25% back to back years was going to have low growth or negative this year as it wasn’t a sustainable pace. BTC went from $16,000 to $108,000, SOL [from] $8 to $300. Cautiously optimistic. [Be] patient for any time capitulation, as often, following big trends, we eventually get longer sideways periods and less volatility as the market finds balance.” While Pentoshi is flipping tactically bullish on stocks and crypto, he warns investors that any rally will likely be short-lived. “I think any up currently will be a lower high. People underestimate the time aspect.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $83,248.

The general market sentiment is one of a cautious nature, and hopes of a quick return above $90,000 are starting to fade. However, a new technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a significant rally, as price action shows the cryptocurrency is currently conforming to the cup-and-handle pattern. Cup And Handle Support Could Cause A Major Bitcoin Rally Recent Bitcoin price movements have drawn attention back to a key technical structure of the handle support of a cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting that a bullish setup may be quietly taking shape. This interesting Bitcoin price activity was relayed in a technical analysis by a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suppression Below $100,000 Worries Investors, JPMorgan Analysts Reveal Real Problem The cup-and-handle pattern in question has been forming over multiple years, with the rounded bottom phase stretching from 2021 to mid-2024. This prolonged accumulation period saw Bitcoin gradually recover from the bearish market cycle before breaking above its neckline resistance. The breakout started the handle formation in the latter half of 2024, a consolidation phase that set the stage for BTC’s next leg up. By November 2024, Bitcoin completed this handle phase and went on an impressive rally that ultimately resulted in a new all-time high of $108,786 in January 2025. However, the recent 24% correction from this all-time high has seen the Bitcoin price returning to the neckine resistance of the cup-and-handle formation. The logical next step is for this neckline resistance to serve as support for the price correction and we could see Bitcoin rebound from here. In terms of a price prediction, Elliott wave analysis and projections put the price target above $130,000, particularly at $139,000. Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests A Surge Toward $130,000 According to the Elliot Waves technical framework, Bitcoin is currently in a larger fifth impulse wave formation. However, this fifth wave, which is generally bullish, has been punctuated by corrective ABC sub-waves, leading Bitcoin to retest the support of the cup-and-handle formation. Now that the support has been met, Bitcoin is in a position to bounce and continue the formation of its fifth impulse wave. This is expected to bring it to the price target above $130,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Crashed To 6-Month Low, Here’s What Followed The Last Time The alignment of the cup-and-handle formation with Elliott wave projections strengthens the case for a major breakout in the coming months. However, Bitcoin’s fundamentals reflect uncertainty in the short term. There is currently a lack of bullish momentum needed to rechallenge the $90,000 mark, which would be the first step needed to reach $130,000.

41833303,https://cointelegraph.com/news/trumps-sec-chair-paul-atkins-senate-committee-hearing,1742256039,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Paul Atkins closes in on SEC chair role amid setbacks: Report,https://cointelegraph.com/news/trumps-sec-chair-paul-atkins-senate-committee-hearing?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Paul Atkins could move one step closer to becoming the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s new crypto-friendly chair, with a Senate committee hearing reportedly in the works for March 27. President Donald Trump nominated Atkins to lead the SEC on Dec. 4, but his marriage into a billionaire family has reportedly caused headaches with financial disclosures — delaying his potential start date. While it isn’t clear whether the White House has produced those papers to the Senate, Senate Banking, House and Urban Affairs Chair Tim Scott is reportedly eyeing a March 27 hearing to review Atkins’ standing, Semafor’s Eleanor Mueller said in a March 17 X post. “No clarity yet on whether the committee has Atkins’ paperwork in hand, but either way, this is the most momentum we’ve seen so far.” Atkins would, however, need to be voted in by the Senate at a later date. Mueller also said the Senate banking committee is also planning to hold a bipartisan meeting on Atkins’ nomination on March 21. Source: Eleanor Mueller It follows an earlier March 3 Semafor report , where Mueller said financial disclosures had held Atkins back from scheduling a Senate hearing to review his standing. His wife’s family is tied to TAMKO Building Products LLC — a manufacturer of residential roofing shingles that reportedly turned over $1.2 billion in revenue in 2023, Forbes said on Dec. 14, 2024. “It’s a lot to go through,” one former Senate Banking Committee staffer reportedly told Mueller on March 3. “But he got named so early on, so I think that’s why people are starting to be like, ‘What the hell’s taking so long?’” Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008 and worked as a corporate lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP in New York before that. He is expected to regulate the crypto arena with a more collaborative approach than former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. It’s been almost four months since Atkins was chosen by Trump to lead the SEC on Dec. 4, and over two months since Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. A late start for an SEC chair wouldn’t be too unusual, however. The two most recent SEC chairs, Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton, started on April 17, 2021, and May 4, 2017 — months after presidential transitions occurred in those years. Related: SEC’s enforcement case against Ripple may be wrapping up Meanwhile, Mark Uyeda has been serving as the SEC’s acting chair since Gensler left on Jan. 20. Since then, the Uyeda-led SEC has established a Crypto Task Force led by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and canceled a controversial rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets. The SEC has dropped several investigations and lawsuits that the Gensler-led commission filed against the likes of Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap and OpenSea over the last month. The SEC is also looking to abandon a rule requiring crypto firms to register as exchanges and may even axe the Biden administration’s proposed crypto custody rules, Uyeda said on March 17.

Standard Chartered’s decision to ditch its Ethereum to $10K prediction is the latest in a series of negatives for the asset. Ethereum Price Continues In Descending Channel Recent price movements for Ethereum (ETH) are unpromising with analysts predicting a steeper drop for the asset. At the moment, Ethereum’s price hovers around $1,930 continuing its unenthusiastic ranging pattern. The MACD indicator confirms widespread buying weakness for the second-largest cryptocurrency with bears reigning supreme. Moving averages are pointing to a neutral trend for Ethereum price, sparking theories over a possible consolidation for the asset. “The price continues to move in a descending channel, indicating a possible continuation of consolidation,” said the pseudonymous LVelarde. At the moment, the Ethereum price is consolidating below the 5-day and 200-day moving averages (MA) with traders scanning the horizon for a potential breakout or rejection. Since ETH fell below $2,000 , a slew of dour sentiment has trailed the asset, casting doubt over its long-term future. “In the short term, technical indicators point to a possible retest of support around $1,800-$1,850, and a break below could reinforce the bearish movement,” said LVelarde. Standard Chartered Slashes Its ETH Prediction Ethereum’s community was roiled by Standard Chartered’s reduction of its ETH prediction for 2025 from $10,000 to $4,000. According to a note, Standard Chartered analysts are predicting ETH will continue underperforming ahead of its 10th anniversary. Analysts termed Ethereum’s decline as a “mid-life crisis” with layer 2 Base taking off $50 billion from ETH’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, the incoming Converge blockchain will snag a portion of Ethereum’s market cap as experts call for a radical change. “Only a proactive change of commercial direction from the Ethereum Foundation – such as taxing layer 2 – could achieve that now, in our view,” read the note. Ethereum ETFs have faltered with the inbound 21Shares liquidations of Bitcoin and Ethereum Futures ETFs. Experts say that Pectra activation on the mainnet can trigger a fresh rally for Ethereum price to a $5,000 valuation.

According to the latest analysis by crypto research firm MakroVision, ETH has not seen a strong buying reaction so far. The key question now is whether Ethereum has formed a bottom or if the decline will continue. Analysis shows that Ethereum has dropped below multiple support zones and is revisiting deeper liquidity areas. Despite the brief stabilization, no sustained buying momentum has been seen, leaving the risk of further declines high. Analysts list the key critical price zones for ETH as follows: $2,132: First major hurdle. Ethereum must reclaim this level to start a potential recovery. $2,400: A critical area with descending trend lines. Breaking above this level could signal a trend reversal. $1,730: This level has held so far, but another test could weaken the support. $1,544: The lowest liquidity zone, likely the next target if Ethereum breaks below $1,730.

From Dogecoin’s legendary rise to Pepe’s unexpected pump, these tokens thrive on community, culture, and virality. But in a crowded market, finding the best new meme coins for massive return potential isn’t easy. Some offer staking rewards, others ride pop culture waves, and a few even integrate AI. So, which ones have what it takes to explode in the following years? BTFD Coin’s presale is nearing its final stages, having already raised over $6.32 million with more than 71 billion coins sold. As Stage 14 wraps up, the chance to grab BTFD at $0.00016 is fading fast. With projections pointing to a potential moonshot of $0.006, early buyers could be looking at a staggering 3,650% ROI. And with its 10% referral rewards program , it’s not just about buying—it’s about earning, too. 1. BTFD Coin – The Meme Coin That Rewards Its Holders Built around the philosophy of “Buying The Dip,” this Ethereum-based project has captivated the crypto community with its bullish spirit, high APY staking, and referral rewards program. The BTFD Coin Rewards Program is a game-changer. Investors who refer others earn 10% of their referral’s raise amount in BTFD tokens if they make it to the top 20 leaderboard at the end of the month. Meanwhile, those using a referral code get a 10% bonus on their purchase if they invest at least $50. For investors eyeing long-term gains, the numbers are enticing. A $1,000 investment at the presale price of $0.00016 could net over 6.25 million BTFD coins. If BTFD hits $0.0006 upon launch, that investment balloons to $3,750. And if it surges to $0.006 as some predict? That same $1,000 could transform into a staggering $37,500. Why this meme coin made it to this list: BTFD rewards its holders with a referral system that incentivizes growth while offering a pathway to massive returns. Plus, its thriving community (11,400+ strong) and staking potential make it a solid bet. 2. Gigachad – The Alpha of the Meme Coin Space Gigachad is a meme coin that celebrates internet masculinity and the ultimate “Sigma” mindset. With a strong NFT integration, Gigachad offers holders access to exclusive content, community perks, and governance votes within its ecosystem. This coin thrives on meme culture, backed by a die-hard following that’s spreading its dominance across social media. Why this meme coin made it to this list: Its viral appeal, NFT utility, and ultra-engaged community make Gigachad one to watch. 3. Floki Inu – The Viking-Inspired Meme Coin with Impressive Utility Floki Inu has evolved beyond meme status, building an ecosystem with a metaverse game, DeFi tools, and even an education platform. The project is named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, giving it an initial boost, but its roadmap shows long-term ambitions that set it apart. Why this meme coin made it to this list: With real-world utility and an expanding ecosystem, Floki Inu has staying power beyond the hype among the best new meme coins for massive return potential. 4. Bone ShibaSwap – The Governance Powerhouse Bone ShibaSwap serves as the governance token of the ShibaSwap DEX, allowing users to vote on proposals that shape the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It’s a vital part of Shiba’s DeFi ambitions and is a must-watch for investors bullish on the Shiba Inu brand. Why this meme coin made it to this list: As a governance token with real decision-making power, Bone plays a crucial role in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 5. Just a Chill Guy – 2024’s Most Viral Meme This meme coin embodies a stress-free approach to crypto investing, with a community focused on positivity and rewards. Just a Chill Guy offers passive income through staking and fun engagement in its meme-driven ecosystem. Why this meme coin made it to this list: It turns crypto into a relaxing experience, blending humor with solid tokenomics. 6. Peanut the Squirrel – The Acorn Collector of Crypto After Peanut’s emotional story went viral, the community rallied by creating this meme coin as tribute, and it’s still relevant to this day. Dedicating part of the profits to wildlife preservation initiatives, this meme coin is far more than its viral appeal. Why this meme coin made it to this list: It’s a meme coin with heart and soul, giving it a unique, charitable edge over other best meme coins for massive return potential. 7. SLERF – The Dark Horse with Explosive Potential Backed by an anonymous team, SLERF has cultivated a passionate following eager to see where the project leads. However, it depends on its virality and the market hype, positioning itself as a high-risk bet with potentially insane rewards if it gains traction once again. Why this meme coin made it to this list: Its viral marketing and engaged community suggest strong potential for a future breakout. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on the Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential Meme coins are unpredictable, but the right picks can deliver massive returns. BTFD Coin stands out with its lucrative referral program and presale momentum, while others like Gigachad, Floki Inu, and Bone ShibaSwap offer unique selling points of their own.

The rally coincided with another positive day for U.S. stocks, providing a favorable backdrop for cryptocurrencies. Despite the bullish price action, some analysts remain cautious. Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Group, warned that the monthly chart of the S&P 500 is pointing to a potential correction in U.S. equities, which could negatively impact cryptocurrencies. “Given the state of global trade tensions and concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy, there is concern that stocks could fall further at a time when it is increasingly unclear how much more accommodation the Fed can provide,” Kruger said. Related News: Binance Finally Brought The Expected Feature: Added to the Home Page, Here are the Impacted Altcoins Kruger also noted that if there is a broader correction in the market, Bitcoin could return to its March 2024 highs of around $73,000-$74,000. Investors are closely watching this week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates at current levels. However, analysts are watching for potential changes to the central bank's quantitative tightening (QT) program that could impact market liquidity. David Duong, director of research at Coinbase Institutional, suggested that the Fed could pause or end the QT program as bank reserve levels approach the 10-11% of GDP threshold deemed necessary for financial stability. Duong attributed the recent crypto sell-off to macroeconomic concerns and worsening liquidity conditions. However, he believes that these conditions could improve in the coming quarters and provide some support for asset prices. “Cryptocurrency prices could find bottoms in the next few weeks before hitting new highs later this year,” Duong said. *This is not investment advice.

Valued at $0.02, the token looks forward to making a 25% jump up to $0.025 when phase four arrives, with analysts speculating a 200% investment win at its $0.06 exchange debut. On a larger timeframe, estimates suggest it could reach $3.20—a 15,900% increase—on the back of its decentralized lending customer usage and buy-pressure mechanics. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Hedera (HBAR) tease bullish patterns, neither holds a semblance of substance, relying on speculative trends that pale in comparison to MUTM’s sound DeFi fundamentals. Here’s how these assets compare for wealth creation in 2025. Hedera (HBAR): A Volatile Dance With Resistance Hedera (HBAR) Shows Cautious Optimism As Its Price Rises To $0.219 Resistance A 5% bounce from last week’s 20% collapse suggests buyer interest, but momentum is still tenuous. The Average Directional Index (ADX) sits at 27.4, indicating a flagging bearish trend, and increasing buying pressure pushes the +DI indicator higher. Traders eye a potential 40% run to $0.287 on the break of resistance, though failure to make a move could see a dive below $0.17. The Ichimoku Cloud tells a mixed story: HBAR is grimly moving around and above the over the Tenkan-Sen line, though remains stuck below the Kijun-Sen baseline. Short term EMAs suggests potential reversal, but doubt remains over the market. For HBAR, success in 2025 depends on the destruction of immediate technical obstructions — an uphill battle not guaranteed to succeed. Shiba Inu Takes its Gambles on Memes Shiba Inu (SHIB) hangs around with ambitious price targets on hand but is dependent on social hype and technical patterns. Downtrend channel bull trap, resistance $0.000013 While analysts trumpet a 12x jump if SHIB takes out this zone, the 200-day EMA remains a defiant barrier. Exchange reserves tumbling to 94.2 trillion tokens—a four-year low—signal less sell pressure, and social mentions have exploded up by 4,110. Pumpers include Luis Delgado, who wants a $0.01 target price (up 76,923%). Doing so, however, requires the slashing of SHIB’s market-dominating supply and the fostering of mainstream adoption — a dual task even optimists deem Herculean. SHIB could be made to $0.000081 (450% gains) by 2025 — but its road ahead is littered with “ifs” that dent wealth-generation certainty. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outshines speculative competitors with a lending protocol that offers genuine yield. Phase three at $0.02 gives early access to a token designed to absorb demand spikes. A price rise to $0.025 in phase four yields immediate 25% returns, and the listing price of $0.06 offers 200% profit. After launch, algorithmic buybacks—paid for by platform revenue—will create eternal buy-side pressure, pushing MUTM to conservative $3.20 predictions. This is similar to a 15,900% ROI, a small return compared to HBAR and SHIB. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the process of a CertiK audit for its smart contracts. Once completed, the results will be shared on official social platforms. More reinforcing the project’s commitment to security and transparency. Also boosting investor trust as the presale gains traction. mtTokens help make the project’s proposition more appealing: assets deposited such as ETH or DAI earn interest as chyme mtETH or mtDAI, combining liquidity with passive income. Overcollateralized loans and P2P lending also help mitigate risk in the system to lure more conservative capital. Phase three is already 5,800 holders strong, with the speed of fill-rate further emphasizing a need to act. Wait too long and you could miss the lowest price tier before exchange listings trigger parabolic runs. Final Status: Utility Beats Speculation Where Hedera and Shiba Inu offer volatile opportunities, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is an easily accessible path to structured, demand-led growth. As HBAR licks wounds from relentless resistance and SHIB wanders meme-fueled pathways, MUTM’s $3.6 million presale take and 5800-holder base reflect its grounded, real-world utility. Phase three progress means the 25% prelaunch gain window closes with every passing day — a prompt to investor action ahead of 2025 wealth creation. Avoid phase four capital schemes.

Chris Chung, founder of Solana swap platform Titan, said that this is a major milestone for Solana and paves the way for the eventual approval of SOL ETFs. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital assets research, also acknowledged the development on X on Monday , calling it a major step toward the approval of a Solana ETF. Solana futures make their U.S. debut on CME with strong trading activity In February, CME announced plans to list two types of SOL futures contracts: standard contracts representing 500 SOL and smaller “micro” contracts covering 25 SOL each. These are the first regulated Solana futures available in the U.S. market, following Coinbase’s launch of SOL futures in February. The contracts are cash-settled rather than physically delivered. According to preliminary data from CME’s website , SOL futures saw a notional volume of nearly 40,000 SOL on the first day of trading—equivalent to approximately $5 million at current prices. Early trading data suggests a potentially bearish outlook among traders. CME’s April SOL futures were priced at $127 per token, $2 lower than the contracts expiring in March. The exchange does not publish finalized daily trading volumes until the next business day. The first-ever SOL futures trade on CME was executed on March 16 by trading firms FalconX and StoneX. “Solana has come a long way in the last five years,” said Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based swap platform Titan. CME Group’s Giovanni Vicioso stated last month that the introduction of Solana futures aligns with growing client demand for a wider range of regulated products to manage cryptocurrency price risk. He emphasized that as Solana gains traction among developers and investors, these futures contracts will serve as an efficient tool for investment and hedging strategies. Solana ETF approval gains momentum amid market shifts According to Chris Chung, the establishment of a regulated market for SOL futures signals Solana’s maturation as an asset. He noted that this development could allow regulators to approve additional financial products with similar risk profiles. Chung also highlighted the shifting regulatory stance toward cryptocurrency in the U.S. this year. He pointed out that while many dismissed the idea of a Solana ETF last year, it is now seen as an inevitability. He expects a wave of altcoin ETFs to gain approval in both North America and Canada, further cementing Solana’s position in mainstream finance. On March 13, Chris Chung said that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve VanEck and Canary Capital’s proposed spot Solana ETFs as early as May. Futures contracts, which are standardized agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date, are widely used for both hedging and speculation by retail and institutional investors. They also play a critical role in supporting spot cryptocurrency ETFs by offering a regulated benchmark for tracking asset performance. The CME already offers futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), both of which received SEC approval for spot ETFs last year. Bitcoin’s ETF success paves the way for Solana’s approval The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and spot Ethereum ETFs in July. A crypto task force led by Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce was launched last month and has been working on distinguishing which crypto assets are securities, among other priorities. At least 13 Solana ETF proposals are pending SEC approval. Former President Donald Trump appointed crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, but since Atkins has yet to undergo confirmation hearings, these proposals remain in regulatory limbo. ETF Store President Nate Geraci recently predicted that BlackRock will eventually file for both Solana and XRP ETFs, suggesting that a Solana filing could happen soon. Last month, Bloomberg ETF analysts estimated a 70% chance of Solana ETF approval by the end of the year. As of now, Solana’s native token is trading at approximately $126.56, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The discussion touched on federal government spending, magic money computers, nonprofit funding, and Musk’s perspectives on artificial intelligence. Cruz started off by stating that Musk had made big waves since the beginning of the new administration. The senator described Musk as someone who has had “an impact” that few others could match in so short a time. Musk, whose actions have gained significant public attention, acknowledged that recent weeks have been high-profile. He said, “Holy crap… never a dull moment.” Cruz asked Musk to compare his initial challenges when he took over D.O.G.E. He said, “Which was worse—the mess you found at Twitter or the mess you found in the federal government?” Musk said that competing with the federal government was much tougher. He added, “It is worse than I expected. But on the plus side, that means there’s more opportunity for improvement.” Shortly afterward, Musk described the government’s waste-to-fraud ratio as “80% waste, 20% fraud,” then mentioned a need to look on the bright side: “If it was a well-run ship, it would be very difficult to improve.” In the latter part of the interview, the conversation focused on identifying such improvements in federal expenditures. Magic-money computers in government agencies Musk clarified that the waste is not difficult to spot. Describing the issue, he said, “Most of what we do is not Sherlock-Holmes-level detective work. It’s very obvious, basic stuff.” He revealed that each federal department showed similar patterns. He said, “In every government department—I say every because we’ve not yet found a single exception—there are far too many software licenses and media subscriptions, more than there are humans in the department.” Cruz gave a hypothetical example, mentioning an agency with 15,000 employees and 30,000 licenses. Musk confirmed this was not unusual. He also cited departments paying for media subscriptions that no one in the department was using. At another point, Musk touched upon credit card usage, explaining that “we found there are twice as many credit cards as there are humans… and these are $10,000-limit cards.” When Ferguson asked if this might be “the biggest money-laundering scheme in the history of the world” or mere incompetence, Musk offered a blended response. He said that the ratio of waste to fraud is 80 to 20 but with certain grey areas. He gave an example of payments leaving the Treasury with no record or explanation, sometimes because a contract had never been shut off. Musk said, “Someone forgot to shut off that contract, so the company kept getting money. Now, is that waste or fraud? Both.” Elon Musk talks about the waste to fraud ratio in the government. Source: Verdict with Ted Cruz Cruz then brought up a $1.9 billion payment to what Musk called a “fake NGO” connected to political figures. Musk labeled it “utter insanity,” adding, “That’s just corrupt. I think that’s paying off cronies.” In his view, certain nonprofit organizations were receiving large sums without providing tangible services. Musk singled out an arrangement he believed was “basically paying $2 billion for maybe 100 appliances… that’s a very expensive toaster.” As part of the problem, Musk noted the lax oversight after funds are transferred: “The government can give money to a so-called nonprofit with very few controls, and there’s no auditing.” He explained that such nonprofits then use those funds for personal gains like “jets and homes,” all at the taxpayer’s expense. Cruz then moved the discussion to “magic money computers.” He said that he had never heard the term. Musk clarified it by saying that magic money is “any computer which can just make money out of thin air.” He said that there are likely 14 magic money computers in government agencies. Most of these are at the Treasury Department, but also at HHS, State, and the Department of Defense. According to him, these systems tend to send money out of nothing. Musk argued that to fix these spending irregularities, direct access to the computer systems is critical, because they drive every transaction: “You have to look at the actual electronic money flows.” Cruz concurred, recalling Musk’s earlier statement before the election: “All I want is the login for every computer.” Musk explained that it was essential because computers run the government. He added, “That’s what you need to look at to reconcile the databases and get rid of waste and fraud.” Cruz noted that few in Congress consider an alternative route, preferring to request reports instead. By contrast, Musk said that is insufficient. He stated, “If you’re just asking a human, who asks another human, who asks another human, who finally asks a contractor to do a query, you’ll never see the whole picture.” D.O.G.E expects to cut a trillion dollars of waste by FY 2026 Ferguson asked about the scale of the cuts or improvements Musk expected. Musk said that he’s confident that D.O.G.E will cut a trillion dollars of waste and fraud by fiscal year 2026. He noted that this assumes nothing impedes the process and that they can operate with full transparency. Cruz then raised Musk’s sudden transition from a “hero to the left” five years ago to a high-profile target. He observed that Musk was once widely celebrated for his involvement in electric cars and space travel. Musk replied, “Yes, I appear to be number two,” explaining that he has seen “Trump Derangement Syndrome and Elon Derangement Syndrome.” Cruz added that he believed many on the left hated Musk “after Donald Trump, more than any person on Earth.” Donald Trump with Elon Musk at the White House. Source: US White House Addressing why he attracts so much hate, Musk attributed it to his efforts in government cost-cutting: “They hate me because DOGE is being effective, and the fraud we’re seeing is overwhelmingly on the left.” He then gave his remarks on Social Security and Medicare payments, along with unemployment and disability. According to Musk, these payments often go to illegal immigrants. He added that these amount to over a hundred billion dollars, or perhaps 200 billion dollars. He alleged, “By using entitlement fraud, the Democrats have been able to attract and retain vast numbers of illegal immigrants.” Cruz asserted that those illegals may eventually be legalized, further securing certain states. Musk claimed that, in his view, these policies point to “a permanent deep-blue socialist state.” The U.S. may lose the AI race if it fails to maintain control of AI chip fabrication Their conversation later shifted to artificial intelligence and potential global competition. Cruz asked, “In 10 years, how is life going to be different because of AI?” Musk replied that within a decade, “AI will probably be able to do anything better than a human can, cognitively,” and that it would be “smarter than the smartest human.” He also predicted a large number of robots: “Probably billions of humanoid robots.” Elon Musk talks about the future of AI. Source: Verdict with Ted Cruz Cruz brought up concerns about “Killer Robots annihilating humanity,” referencing concepts akin to Skynet. Musk estimated, “Maybe 10% or 20% likely, on a 5-to-10-year timeframe.” He reminded listeners that “the glass is 80 or 90% full,” meaning he sees an 80% or 90% chance AI leads to greater prosperity. Cruz also asked which country might win the AI race. Musk answered that, for a few years, “America is likely to win,” but the deciding factor is “who controls the AI chip fabrication.” He said nearly all advanced AI chip factories—or “fabs”—are in Taiwan and warned that if China were to “invade Taiwan in the near term, the world would be cut off from advanced AI chips.” He believed this matter was “essential for national security.” Cruz closed by asking Musk about his legacy after he’s gone. Musk replied, “If SpaceX got humans to Mars, that’s what they would remember me for, even a hundred or a thousand years from now.” When asked if he planned to go to space himself, Musk stated, “I’d like to go to Mars at some point… People have asked if I want to die on Mars. I say yes, just not on impact.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Hyperliquid, a blockchain network specializing in trading, allows traders to publicly observe what type of positions a whale is holding, and since these positions are leveraged, the market can assess the liquidation levels unless an additional margin is added, Markus Thielen said in a March 17 report . Source: 10x Research “This transparency opens the door for coordinated efforts, where groups of traders could intentionally target these stop levels to trigger liquidations,” he said. It’s a common belief in the crypto market that whales with substantial holdings can influence the market through their trading tactics, such as stop-loss hunting , to deliberately trigger other traders’ stop-loss orders and liquidate their positions. Thielen says the recent actions from traders show this balance of power could be shifting. “In effect, stop-hunting is being ‘democratized,’ with ad-hoc groups now playing a role once reserved mainly for market-making desks, or treasury teams, at exchanges before tighter regulatory scrutiny,” Thielen added. Thielen told Cointelegraph that it’s still “unclear if this type of activity will become widespread onchain, but as always, transparency can cut both ways.” Why are traders trying to liquidate whales? This isn’t the first time smaller traders have attempted to take down larger entities through coordinated trading tactics. Thielen says crypto traders trying to liquidate whales have echoes of the GameStop short squeeze , which saw small traders flip the table on Wall Street short-sellers by buying GameStop’s stock, sending it to all-time highs of over $81 to liquid their positions. “This reminds me of the dynamics we saw during the GameStop saga in 2020/2021, where aggressive short squeezes drove rapid price spikes,” he said. Related: Bybit CEO on ‘brutal’ $4M Hyperliquid loss: Lower leverage as positions grow “When stop levels get triggered, prices often accelerate in that direction, providing liquidity for others to cover. We’ve seen similar tactics from market makers and exchanges in the crypto space over the years.” Hunt is still on for 40x leveraged Bitcoin short-seller On March 16, a crypto whale known for placing large, highly leveraged positions on Hyperliquid opened a 40x leveraged short position at $84,043 for over 4,442 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth over $368 million on March 16, facing liquidation if Bitcoin’s price surpassed $85,592. The move didn’t go unnoticed, and pseudonymous trader CBB sent out the call on X to gather a team of traders with enough funds to liquidate the whale’s position. Source: CBB Thielen said in the 10x report that on March 16, Bitcoin surged by 2.5% within minutes, partly because of a coordinated effort to liquidate a whale’s short position on Bitcoin perpetual via Hyperliquid. The whale has since increased their position to $524 million, and at one point, the whale hunters nearly got their wish when the price of Bitcoin hit $84,583.84, according to CoinGecko. Source: CRG However, some speculate the exposed short position could be intentional. Hedge fund trader Josh Man said in a March 17 post to X that the whale might be purposefully trying to get liquidated. “So this there is a fairly rare and not widely used technique of self-liquidation and this FEELS a little like that,” he said. “In such events, the seller is actually creating a bomb designed to go off and create a rally from the liquidation of his own short. One would expect that he has a large offsetting long versus short.” Source: Josh Man Magazine: Crypto fans are obsessed with longevity and biohacking: Here’s why",,EN,0,0,ZRX|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-18 01:29:01

In prepared remarks to an investment industry conference in San Diego on March 17, Uyeda said the rule proposed in February 2023 had seen commenters express “significant concern” over its “broad scope.” “Given such concern, there may be significant challenges to proceeding with the original proposal. As such, I have asked the SEC staff to work closely with the crypto task force to consider appropriate alternatives, including its withdrawal,” Uyeda said. The rule was floated under the Biden administration during Gary Gensler’s tenure leading the regulator. It aimed to expand custody rules for investment advisers to any and all assets held for a client, including crypto, and upped the requirements to protect them. Source: SEC This meant that investment advisers would have to custody their clients’ crypto with a qualified custodian. Gensler said at the time that investment advisers “cannot rely on” crypto platforms as qualified custodians due to how they operate. The proposal caused friction with Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce, along with industry advocacy bodies who claimed the rule was unlawful and dangerous. “How could an adviser seeking to comply with this rule possibly invest client funds in crypto assets after reading this release?” Uyeda remarked at the time. He did, however, support the proposal despite disagreeing “with a number of provisions.” Peirce, who was the sole commissioner of the five to vote against the rule, said at the time that the proposed rule “would expand the reach of the custody requirements to crypto assets while likely shrinking the ranks of qualified crypto custodians.” Related: Congress repealed the IRS broker rule, but can it regulate DeFi? Uyeda’s latest remarks come days after he said on March 10 that he had asked SEC staff “for options on abandoning” part of a proposal pushing for some crypto firms to register with the regulator as exchanges. The Trump-era SEC has also killed a rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets, called SAB 121. In December, President Donald Trump picked former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to take over from Uyeda to chair the agency. This is now a step closer, with a Senate hearing reportedly slated for March 27.

That’s because those blockchains are run by an algorithm called Proof of Work – it takes work only high-performing computers can do to get rewards worth the cost of doing that work. There’s also Proof-of-Stake blockchains, like Ethereum and Solana, which require participants to put cryptocurrencies at stake, instead of owning expensive hardware. Staking aims to lower the barriers of entry for those who want to participate in blockchain networks, as it requires mostly putting up cash, and in a lesser degree, minimal hardware requirements, compared to the highly specialized equipment required for Proof-of-Work. In theory, greater participation should make blockchains more decentralized and secure. This guide will break down everything about staking—how it works, why it matters, and what you need to know before jumping in. Let's get started.

In a recent post on X, the analyst discussed key targets based on historical cycles and percentage-based calculations. He wrote, “I’ve been closely analyzing the strength of Wave 1 across various crypto charts, and after reviewing multiple projects, I’ve noticed a compelling pattern in #XRP that could signal a potential cycle top.” He further explained that by applying percentage formulas, he determined two primary targets: Stick 2 and Stick 3. #XRP – 3rd Stick Post ($33 – $70) I’ve been closely analyzing the strength of Wave 1 across various crypto charts, and after reviewing multiple projects, I’ve noticed a compelling pattern in #XRP that could signal a potential cycle top. By applying percentage formulas, I am… pic.twitter.com/EXok7CBTW1 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 16, 2025 Technical Analysis and Market Trends Egrag Crypto emphasized that his predictions rely on mathematics, rationality, and logic rather than speculation. He broke down his analysis into several stages, including examining past cycles, focusing on the current cycle, and extrapolating percentage-based formulas. He also mentioned factoring in 50% and 80% discounts before finalizing his targets. While his analysis suggests significant upside potential for XRP, broader market conditions may influence the asset’s trajectory. The crypto market experienced volatility, as traders debated whether technical patterns or external financial pressures dictated current price movements. Market Conditions and Diverging Opinions Not everyone in the XRP community shares Egrag Crypto’s bullish sentiment. An X user, GoLD MiNDeR!, offered a contrasting view, arguing that XRP’s price movements are driven by market makers and large financial entities rather than technical factors. “Market Makers and Wall Street Whale traders are desperate to raise cash in case the stock market destabilizes further… they are dumping the market on low volume on Sundays and scooping up liquidity,” he commented. He expressed frustration with the current trading environment, saying he exited his XRP position at $2.38 after holding through fluctuations down to $1.90. According to him, the repeated pattern of price drops and rebounds is being orchestrated to trap traders. He advised that instead of being part of this cycle, investors should sell and wait for lower prices before re-entering. Uncertainty Surrounding XRP’s Price Action Egrag Crypto’s analysis points to a potential rally, but skepticism remains regarding whether XRP will reach such high targets . His forecast suggests that historical patterns support a move to $33–$70 , yet market sentiment remains divided. With differing opinions on whether technical analysis or broader financial conditions dictate XRP’s price, investors must carefully assess both perspectives before making decisions.

Ripple seeks to offer downloadable software for the custody, transmission, and storage of various currencies, including cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency. The trademark also covers financial services related to the safekeeping of these assets for financial management purposes. Ripple’s application includes offerings in multiple categories, including: Downloadable software for custody and transmission of various digital currencies. Custodial services , maintaining the storage and possession of digital and fiat currencies for financial management. Peer-to-peer network services , enabling the electronic transmission of financial data over networks for custody and storage. Software as a Service (SaaS) , providing temporary online software for cryptocurrency custody, transmission, and storage. Ripple’s recent trademark filing for “Ripple Custody” has sparked speculation about whether the company will launch a crypto wallet. The filing shows that Ripple is focused on offering secure storage and management for digital assets. While it doesn’t directly mention a wallet, this move suggests Ripple may expand its services to include wallet features in the future, helping users and businesses manage their cryptocurrencies more securely. The application is currently in its early stages, with a status of “New Application” and no examiner yet assigned. While the filing process can take several months, Ripple’s move into custody services could further bolster its position within the crypto ecosystem, expanding its reach beyond cross-border payments to secure asset management solutions. The global cryptocurrency custody market is expected to surge to $100 billion within the next decade, driven by growing institutional adoption and increasing regulatory clarity. As the demand for secure asset storage solutions rises, Ripple’s strategic moves to expand in this space position the company well to meet the needs of institutional clients, who require secure custody services for their digital assets.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|ALTCOIN|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-18 01:56:47

The now-deleted spot imagines ""America"" in therapy. A human embodiment of the nation desperately wants to think big – about tech, crypto, space travel. But he can't: his therapist wants him to ""focus on pronouns"" and on ""coming up with new genders."" ""America, numbers are non-binary,"" the therapist insists after chiding his ""rational thinking syndrome."" America eventually snaps and yells out, ""I want to invent technologies, not genders. That the Solana Foundation – a Swiss nonprofit whose mission is to evangelize the Solana blockchain – would call upon right-wing talking points to promote its first U.S. conference sparked immediate controversy. Some influential voices within Solanaland called it pandering ; others, offensive . It's also a reversal for an organization that previously called diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) part of its ""core values"" and insisted attendees of its flagship event show respect to others regardless of gender. Just weeks before President Donald Trump retook the White House in part on an anti-trans campaign, the foundation held a conference in Singapore. The event's code of conduct prohibited ""deliberate verbal or physical intimidation"" based on ""gender,"" ""gender identity and expression,"" or other traits often lumped in with DEI. It threatened infractors with ejection and a ban from attending future events. ""The Solana Foundation is committed to the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect,"" the Code of conduct read . It's not clear whether the Solana Foundation's ad strategy also portends a shift in its ""core values."" CoinDesk could not immediately locate the code of conduct for the upcoming event. A representative for the Solana Foundation did not return a request for comment. Regardless, the ad threatened to thrust crypto deeper into partisan politics than many in the industry are comfortable with. The crypto industry's embrace of President Trump had previously been an exercise of single-issue alignment: Trump promised to embrace crypto, and the industry's high-rollers hugged him back. The arrangement has left room for proponents to work alongside Democrats too, and many have.

Imagine a digital finance firm needing seamless smart contract deployment without hiring an expensive development team. With QubeQode, businesses can utilize pre-built templates, integrate decentralized applications with ease, and automate financial processes—all while significantly lowering transaction costs. The result? Greater adoption of blockchain technology across industries. The Qubetics crypto presale has been met with overwhelming demand. Currently in its 26th stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.1181, with over 501 million tokens sold, 23.300 token holders, and a staggering $15.2 million raised. With expectations of 746% ROI at $1 and even higher at future milestones, it’s clear why early buyers are securing their stake in Qubetics before the price surges further to one of the best cryptos with low fees. Render (RNDR): Decentralizing GPU Power Render is tackling one of the most expensive bottlenecks in modern computing—GPU rendering. The network allows users to access decentralized GPU power for high-quality rendering at a fraction of the cost. This is particularly valuable for industries like gaming, AI, and visual effects, where rendering expenses can be prohibitively high. Currently, Render’s token price has seen a 2.68% decline, sitting at approximately Rs 277 as of March 17, 2025. Despite this, market projections suggest a bullish outlook, with potential price surges to $6.838 or even $15, depending on adoption rates and demand for decentralized GPU processing. Render’s technology is already being utilized in AI model training, movie special effects, and 3D content creation, proving its value beyond speculation. As demand for high-performance computing grows, Render remains a critical player in the decentralized infrastructure space, offering cost-efficient solutions to a global audience. Cosmos (ATOM): Strengthening Blockchain Interoperability Cosmos continues to lead the charge in interoperability, ensuring seamless communication between independent blockchains. Its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol allows projects to transfer assets and data across networks without centralized intermediaries. With a 0.30% price decline, ATOM is currently trading at $4.65. However, analysts remain optimistic about its long-term potential, citing increasing adoption among developers looking for secure and scalable interoperability solutions. Cosmos has enabled multiple blockchain ecosystems to collaborate, fueling innovation in DeFi, gaming, and enterprise applications. Its architecture provides a sustainable alternative to high-fee networks, making it one of the best cryptos with low fees. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Holds the Most Potential? Each of these projects is driving blockchain innovation in different ways. Qubetics is revolutionizing smart contract development, Render is decentralizing GPU power, and Cosmos is enabling seamless blockchain interactions. Among them, Qubetics stands out as a rising force, with its presale numbers signaling strong demand and real-world use cases ensuring long-term viability as one of the best cryptos with low fees . The future belongs to projects that offer real utility and efficiency—Qubetics, Render, and Cosmos are leading that charge. Those who recognize this early will be well-positioned for the next wave of blockchain transformation.

Offchain Labs said this support will primarily come in the form of product and go-to-market advice and won’t provide engineering or other operational resources. It also added that while it’s possible — there’s no guarantee that its venture capital arm, Tandem, will purchase any of these project tokens in public markets. Source: Offchain Labs Offchain Labs said the continued development of Arbitrum over the past few years has seen it grow to become one of the “most performant ecosystems in the space.” But now, with the launch of Onchain Labs, the focus will shift to building out the network’s application landscape. “Through Onchain Labs, we’re dedicating resources to support developers looking to rapidly expand the application layer by ideating with them from the ground floor to bring the best user experiences to Arbitrum,” the company said. “With Offchain Labs’ support, we’re confident we’ll see industry-leading applications that are uniquely possible on Arbitrum.” However, it’s not just about building more applications. The firm has also said it will only support projects that launch fairly. Offchain Labs claimed the industry’s recent trend toward extractive zero-sum launches “stands in stark contrast to the core ethos of crypto,” adding that “as an industry, we can — and must — do better.” It will seek to counter this trend by only working with teams that commit to equitable launches, which it said was “essential for fostering community alignment. There’s no reason why all participants in an ecosystem can’t succeed together.” The rise of layer 2s is creating problems for Ethereum Arbitrum was one of the earliest layer 2s (L2s) on Ethereum, but there’s been an explosion in new L2 networks since Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade last year. According to L2Beat, there are now over 70 layer 2s and many more on the way. This has created some issues for Ethereum, according to some industry professionals. The first is the fracturing of the Ethereum ecosystem, as different DApps run on different layer 2s, which may or may not be interoperable. “We currently have too many, the more L2s we build, the less interoperability we will have, creating other problems around infrastructure,” Vitali Dervoed, the co-founder and CEO of perpetual exchange Composability Labs, told Cointelegraph in August. Related: DigiFT launches Invesco private credit token on Arbitrum “Developers might have good intentions when building the next super-fast, low-gas-fee, easy-to-use blockchain, but in the long run, it’s counterproductive as it creates a more fragmented ecosystem,” he added. Another issue is that lower-cost layer 2s like Base and Arbitrum are eating into Ethereum’s revenue and impacting the layer 1’s market cap. It comes on the same day Standard Chartered downgraded its 2025 price target for Ethereum by a whopping 60%, from US$10,000 to just US$4,000, with the bank’s head of digital asset research, Geoff Kendrick, saying, “We expect ETH to continue its structural decline.” Kendrick cited the impact of low-cost layer 2s like Base and Arbitrum as one of the key drivers of this decline. “Layer 2 blockchains were meant to improve ETH scalability, but we estimate that Base (a key layer 2) has removed USD 50bn from ETH’s market cap.” Magazine: ETH may bottom at $1.6K, SEC delays multiple crypto ETFs, and more: Hodler’s Digest, March 9 – 15",,EN,0,0,ARB|ETH|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-18 02:26:47

A key reason for this sluggish price action is the ongoing sell-off in Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have seen outflows exceeding $945 million in recent weeks. This marks the fifth consecutive week of institutional selling, adding pressure on BTC. Investor sentiment remains weak, as reflected in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which currently stands at 22 (Fear). The uncertainty stems from multiple factors, including fears of U.S. recession risks, Trump’s trade policies, and regulatory uncertainty in the crypto sector. Last week's market update: Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a net outflow of -$921.4 million (compared to -$739.2 million the previous week) Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a net outflow of -$189.9 million (compared to -$93.9 million the previous week) Stay informed on the latest… pic.twitter.com/miw1sR8UBM — Solix Trading (@Solix_Trade) March 16, 2025 Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin briefly rebounded by 4.33%, driven by optimism around Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act, which suggests that the U.S. government should accumulate BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Key Market Insights: Bitcoin struggles below $84K as ETF outflows hit $945M. Market sentiment remains fearful, keeping investors cautious. BTC rebounds 4.33% on U.S. government Bitcoin reserve speculation. Fed’s Rate Decision & Geopolitical Tensions Could Drive BTC’s Next Move Bitcoin’s next major price move could be determined by the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on March 19. Investors are closely watching U.S. Retail Sales data and the FOMC meeting, as any signals of a dovish stance could boost Bitcoin. A rate cut would increase liquidity, potentially fueling BTC’s next rally. However, if the Fed maintains a strict stance, it could trigger a fresh wave of selling pressure, especially amid Nasdaq’s continued weakness. Historically, Bitcoin follows Nasdaq’s trend. When the Nasdaq falls, BTC tends to drop at a higher magnitude (often 2x). Tech stocks and Bitcoin are both considered high-risk assets, meaning institutional investors often treat them similarly. Key Points to Watch in This Week’s FOMC Meeting 1⃣ Interest Rate Decision – The Fed’s rate decision is set for Wednesday, March 19 (U.S. time). – Investors are 99% certain the Fed will hold rates steady. – If rates remain unchanged, attention will shift to the Dot Plot. pic.twitter.com/mugStnsVR8 — Cobak (@CobakOfficial) March 17, 2025 Geopolitical tensions are also in focus. Trump’s tariff policies and potential trade restrictions could further impact market sentiment. Any escalation in U.S. economic policies may influence the Fed’s next move, directly affecting Bitcoin’s trajectory. What to Watch: FOMC meeting outcome – A dovish stance could drive BTC higher. Nasdaq correlation – Stock market weakness could lead to BTC declines. Geopolitical risks – Trade wars and global uncertainty may fuel volatility. Bitcoin’s Correlation With Nasdaq Poses Downside Risks Bitcoin’s price remains closely tied to U.S. stock market performance, particularly the Nasdaq index, which has dropped 12% in recent weeks. Historically, BTC tends to decline twice as much as Nasdaq, implying a potential 24% BTC drop to $65,000 if the tech index extends its slide. Bitcoin Price Crash to $20K Possible If Nasdaq Enters Bear Market, Says Peter Schiff https://t.co/nNekFxrNeg — Capernaum (@CapernaumMedia) March 17, 2025 If Nasdaq declines further by 20%, Bitcoin could fall to $55,000, while a full-blown bear market in stocks—potentially a 40% Nasdaq crash—could send BTC tumbling toward $20,000, according to economist Peter Schiff. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone warns that BTC could even drop to $10,000 if gold continues to outperform. Meanwhile, gold prices have surged 13% since December 2023, strengthening its position as a safe-haven asset. Schiff predicts that if Nasdaq crashes by 40%, gold could climb above $3,800 per ounce, drawing more institutional investors away from Bitcoin. Key Takeaways: Nasdaq’s 12% decline hints at potential BTC drop to $65K. Economists warn of Bitcoin falling to $20K–$10K in a bear market. Gold’s 13% rally challenges BTC’s store-of-value appeal. Bitcoin Consolidates Near $83K – Breakout or Breakdown Ahead? Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading near $83,200, consolidating within a symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart. The 50-period EMA at $83,490 is acting as immediate resistance, while the trendline support near $82,050 is keeping prices stable. A breakout from this formation is imminent, with key resistance at $85,038—a break above this could push BTC toward $87,400 and $90,295. On the downside, $82,050 remains a crucial support level. If BTC breaks below this level, the next key supports are $79,050 and $76,600. Bitcoin remains indecisive ahead of the FOMC meeting on March 19, with traders watching for a breakout. A volume-backed move above $85,000 could confirm bullish momentum, while failure to hold support may lead to a sharper correction. BTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is making waves as a community-driven token that automatically rewards holders with real Bitcoin when BTC hits key price milestones. Unlike traditional meme tokens, BTCBULL is built for long-term investors, offering real incentives through airdropped BTC rewards and staking opportunities. Staking & Passive Income Opportunities BTC Bull offers a high-yield staking program with an impressive 119% APY, allowing users to generate passive income.

Don’t Worry—Arctic Pablo Coin Is Rising as the Next Top Crypto Coin,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-out-on-binance-coin-dont-worry-arctic-pablo-coin-is-rising-as-the-next-top-crypto-coin/,"Cryptocurrency has changed the financial market forever, and the early days of many top crypto coins are a reminder of how investors who took a leap of faith have reaped massive rewards. One of the most notable stories is that of Binance Coin (BNB), which began as a modest project but skyrocketed to become one of the largest and most successful cryptocurrencies in the market. But what about those who missed the chance to get in early on BNB? Fortunately, there’s another opportunity on the horizon: Arctic Pablo Coin . For those who regret missing out on BNB’s initial coin offering (ICO), Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale success could be a game-changer. The Early Days of Binance Coin: A Missed Opportunity? When Binance Coin (BNB) was first launched in 2017, it was priced at just $0.10 per token during its ICO. At the time, few could have predicted that this relatively small coin would go on to become one of the top crypto coins in the world. Fast forward to today, and Binance Coin has experienced astronomical growth, with its value reaching over $300 at its peak in recent years. For investors who bought BNB during the early ICO, their investments would have yielded staggering returns. Binance Coin’s rise serves as a testament to the potential for early-stage investments in promising blockchain projects. However, for those who missed the ICO, the regret of not jumping in early can be hard to shake. But there’s good news. Arctic Pablo Coin presents an almost identical opportunity, offering a chance to get in early and enjoy significant growth potential, just like the early days of Binance Coin. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Thing in Cryptocurrency? Just like Binance Coin (BNB) transformed the crypto landscape, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the next powerhouse in the market. With its ongoing presale success, this top crypto coin has garnered significant attention from investors looking to capitalize on early-stage opportunities. Unlike traditional presales that follow a fixed roadmap, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is uniquely divided by locations, with the coin metaphorically “traveling” to new regions. Currently, the meme coin presale is in Nippy Nook, but as the presale moves across different locations, the price per token is expected to rise. At the moment, Arctic Pablo Coin is priced at a modest $0.000079, offering a compelling entry point for new investors. This is a far cry from its anticipated launch price of $0.008, which represents a potential ROI of over 10,027.85% for early investors who participate in the 15th stage of the presale. The top crypto coin has already raised over $1.92 million, and the momentum continues to build as the presale progresses. Why Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale is a Must-Watch Opportunity The presale of Arctic Pablo Coin is not just another crypto project—it’s an opportunity for savvy investors to take advantage of a rare and lucrative moment. The early price point is incredibly attractive, and the project’s unique approach to its presale is a key part of its appeal. By “traveling” across locations, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a sense of excitement and urgency that traditional presales simply can’t match. Early investors in Arctic Pablo Coin could see massive returns once the coin hits its full potential. For those who missed out on the Binance Coin (BNB) ICO, this could be a second chance to get in on the ground floor of a cryptocurrency poised to take the market by storm. What Makes Arctic Pablo Coin Stand Out? Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a copycat project; it’s innovating in ways that make it stand out among other top crypto coins. For one, the token burn mechanism ensures that the total supply decreases over time, helping to drive up the value of each individual coin. The project’s high APY (annual percentage yield) and staking rewards offer additional incentives for investors who want to lock in their holdings and watch them grow. By combining cutting-edge technology with a strong community focus, Arctic Pablo Coin is building the foundation for long-term success. As the presale continues to gain traction, it’s becoming clear that this is one top crypto coin to watch in the coming months. Final Words: A Second Chance at Early Investment Success For those who missed out on Binance Coin’s initial ICO and are still wondering “What if?”—now is the time to act. Arctic Pablo Coin presents an incredible opportunity for those looking to capitalize on an early-stage investment with massive potential. The presale has already raised over $1.92 million, and the token is still available at a low entry point. As the presale progresses and the price increases, those who invest now could see substantial returns once the coin launches. With its unique presale structure, strong tokenomics, and a clear roadmap for success, Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly emerging as one of the top crypto coins in the market. Don’t miss out on this opportunity—it could be your chance to make up for that missed Binance Coin ICO. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What is Arctic Pablo Coin? Arctic Pablo Coin is a new cryptocurrency project currently in presale. It offers a unique investment opportunity with a token burn mechanism and high APY rewards. How can I participate in the Arctic Pablo Coin presale? You can join the presale by visiting the official Arctic Pablo Coin website and purchasing tokens at the current price of $0.000079. The presale is divided by locations and is expected to increase in price as it “travels.” What is the potential return on investment for Arctic Pablo Coin? Investors who buy during the 15th stage of the presale could experience over 10,027.85% ROI when the coin reaches its launch price of $0.008. How does Arctic Pablo Coin differ from other cryptocurrencies? Arctic Pablo Coin stands out by offering a unique presale structure that is location-based, a deflationary token burn mechanism, and high staking rewards. Can Arctic Pablo Coin reach the same success as Binance Coin (BNB)? While there’s no certainty in cryptocurrency, Arctic Pablo Coin has all the right elements—strong community support, innovative features, and massive growth potential—to become a top crypto coin similar to Binance Coin.

The Russian media outlet Business Gazeta reported that the Central Bank has “approached the leadership of Tatarstan” with “a proposal to pilot” some of the CBDC’s “mechanisms.” Digital Ruble Smart Contract: Tatarstan Testing Ground The republic’s Ministry of Finance says it has responded by creating a working group that will help launch the digital ruble in Tatarstan. Tatarstan on a map of Russia. (Source: TUBS [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The ministry said that it would use the Central Bank’s “test platform” to “carry out experimental conditional spending of targeted funds for selected purposes.” The announcement comes less than a month after the bank “indefinitely delayed” the CBDC’s national rollout , originally slated for August this year. This led many to speculate that the coin launch plans could be scrapped altogether, under pressure form the domestic banking sector . However, the bank has remained cagey on its CBDC launch plans since its most recent announcement. And the news from Tatarstan appears to suggest that the digital ruble is far from dead and buried. The ministry said it would work with the bank to pilot “conditional CBDC subsidies” from the national budget. These will be “transformed into smart contracts.” The “digital ruble test platform will independently track transactions within the established rules,” the ministry said. The Kremlin confirms that Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to speak to President Donald Trump on Tuesday amid the US push for a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine https://t.co/tHvUACdqrC — Bloomberg (@business) March 17, 2025 Working Group Launches The parties expect to wrap up their testing by the end of the third quarter of 2025, the ministry added. The ministry said it had already created its working group, which will be chaired by the Tatarstan Finance Minister Marat Fayzrakhmanov. It also confirmed that Tartarstan’s Minister of Digital Development Airat Khairullin would join the group. The long-serving Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina last month claimed that a “new rollout date” for the CBDC “will be announced later.” Nabiullina said the Central Bank wanted more time to work out “details” in the “pilot,” which began in August 2023. She also added that she would hold “consultation sessions” with banks to establish “the economic model most attractive to their clients.” Nabiullina claims that the pilot is going “well.” Thus far, the pilot includes 15 banks, 1,7000 citizens, and about 30 companies. The pilot initially comprised test sites in 11 cities, including Kazan, the capital of Tatarstan. Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia. (Source: Amikeco/V. Ivanov) Moscow Also Testing Digital RUB Away from the key digital ruble smart contract development, the Moscow Metro has also announced plans to expand its own digital RUB pilot operations. A Moscow Metro station. (Source: Vyacheslav Argenberg [CC BY 4.0]) The metro system was the first transport network in the nation to begin working with the digital RUB back in 2023 . However, the media outlet RG.ru reported earlier this month that Moscow’s Deputy Mayor of for Transport and Industry Maxim Liksutov said the metro is “working on joint tests with the Central Bank and [the megabank] VTB.” Like the 2023 tests, the new pilot focuses on the Troika card, Moscow’s reusable contactless smart card. Liksutov said: “Focus group participants successfully purchased several Troika cards. They also topped up the balance of their cards using their digital ruble wallets’ universal QR code features.” The developments appear to closely mirror previous Chinese digital yuan pilots, which have also focused on delivering government subsidies to contractors and letting citizens make contactless CBDC payments on transport networks. However, Moscow has previously insisted one of the main functions of the CBDC could be to help Russian firms make cross-border payments with other digital fiat-using nations.

Dogecoin Season Depends On The Fed In one of his updates, Kevin explained the crux of his position: “Everything is continuing to go exactly as planned. We never hopped on the #ALTSEASON bandwagon that the gurus have been pushing for 6-12 months that got people wrecked. I have continued to let my altcoins guidance be backed up by facts and fundamentals Based on all my evidence gathered I do still believe that between March-June we will see Powell come out and say that bank reserves have hit levels to where they feel it is necessary to end the run off of the balance sheet which in turn will end QT.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Alert! This Pattern Could Trigger A ‘Parabolic’ Surge He further emphasized that this potential pause—and eventual reversal—of quantitative tightening (QT) should initiate a new cycle of rate cuts and broader financial easing. According to Kevin, that combined macro shift would signal the beginning of a sustained altcoin rally: “This will then start a new cycle of easing along with further rate cuts and the combination should mark the beginning of Altcoins out performance and BTC Dominance durably heading lower. That is my call based of Macro Fundamental and Technical analysis being combined into one form of Analysis.” Digging deeper into market structure, Kevin forecasts a drop in Bitcoin dominance, a metric that measures BTC’s market capitalization relative to the entire crypto sector: “All the data I have been analyzing is telling me between March – June QT will end. Then altcoins durable out performance will begin and BTC Dominance will durably fall below 54.51%.” He notes that inflation would need to “skyrocket” for the Federal Reserve to continue QT, a scenario he views as unlikely based on his research. Related Reading: Dogecoin Forms Explosive Cup And Handle Pattern With $4 Target Pointing to similarities between current market conditions and 2019, Kevin also explores a somewhat unconventional approach—performing technical analysis (TA) on the Fed’s balance sheet itself: “If we take a look at Total Assets held by the US federal Reserve […] we can see that similar to 2019 we are getting close to re-testing the 2W 200 ema and 2W RSI and LMACD are in the same spot they were before the Fed ended QT.” He anticipates that balance sheet levels could mirror 2019 conditions within the next 126 days—leading up to around the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting, give or take a couple of weeks. Should the Fed’s total assets hit that threshold, he believes it will confirm the timing he has been advocating. While Kevin references the broader altcoin market, Dogecoin, in particular, features in his strategic outlook. Last week, he underscored the importance of overall market fundamentals and chart positioning when it comes to purchasing DOGE: “If #BTC holds up and Macro Economic Data and Monetary policy adjust then you just got your last opportunity to buy Dogecoin relatively cheap. A lot of factors at play and lots of work to do. But the risk reward at this level is superb given the circumstances.” At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.17.

Remittix never fails to steal the show every time. Read on to learn more. Tron’s Price Decline Raises Concerns With a 6.62% decline in the previous week, Tron (TRX) has witnessed a clear price drop; its worth now comes to $0.2164. Though still in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, its performance has caused investors some questions. Although the network keeps showing high user activity, the price action points to increasing doubt about its future course. Although TRX’s blockchain use is still significant, market observers point out that more general market trends and investor attitude have helped to cause the drop. Several traders are now seeking fresh investment prospects, especially in projects with great development potential and real-world use cases—a change that has driven several TRX whales to investigate Remittix. Experts Speculate That Shiba Inu Price is Overvalued Although Shiba Inu’s lowest price since its fall is $0.0000115, the daily chart shows that the $0.000012 level has provided support on a few sporadic times during significant falls. Should SHIB’s downward tendency persist, this would be the primary tool for ongoing observation. The Fear and Greed Index shows that investors are in panic mode, therefore drastically lowering the market mood. The bybit hack sale-off scared off market participants. Right now, macroeconomic conditions are terrible for meme currencies given Trump’s aggressive trade rhetoric and the Fed’s refusal to raise rates. Shiba Inu now needs to rise above the $0.000013 barrier if it is to reverse its fall. Remittix Is Poised To Lead The PayFi Sector Remittix’s goal is to overcome long-standing issues in international finance by means of its creative solution for conventional remittance systems. Imagine being able to easily turn crypto into spendable money without KYC complications and costs free of sting.

While short-term price movements may occur, the overall trend suggests that a major upward movement is not expected at this time. Despite this, short-term bullish action may still arise, though the broader trend remains subdued. Short-Term Bullish Price Action In the last few days, XRP has experienced positive price movement. On the 8-hour chart, the price recently broke above a short-term resistance zone between $2.25 and $2.30. After breaking through, XRP successfully retested this level, turning it into support. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, this technical pattern is a positive sign, as turning resistance into support typically signals bullish price action. In the short term, this indicates a favorable outlook for XRP, with the next major resistance levels expected between $2.65 and $2.80. However, there is also resistance around $2.50 that will need to be overcome before reaching these higher levels. Sideways Range and Lack of Momentum Despite these recent bullish signs, XRP’s price has been stuck in a sideways range for the past month, moving within a narrow band. This lack of momentum in either direction is evident, and while short-term gains may occur, the overall market trend suggests caution due to the ongoing bearish divergence on the 3-day chart. Expecting More Sideways Movement Given the current technical situation and the continuing bearish divergence, XRP is likely to remain in a sideways trend in the near future. Bullish momentum is unlikely unless the broader bearish divergence is addressed. Traders should monitor the short-term bullish patterns, but the overall market direction is expected to stay sideways.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-18 03:07:04

CoinGlass data shows that on Feb. 20, Bitcoin's ( BTC ) open interest (OI) — a metric tracking the total number of unsettled Bitcoin derivative contracts such as options and futures — stood at $61.42 billion before dropping 19% to $49.71 billion by March 4. Bitcoin’s open interest is sitting at $49.02 billion at the time of publication. Source: CoinGlass It came amid volatile price swings due to uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s imposed tariffs and the future of US interest rates. “Following the recent panic triggered by political instability linked to Trump’s decisions, we witnessed a massive liquidation of leveraged positions on Bitcoin,” DarkFost said. Bitcoin’s price fell below two crucial price levels during the two-week period, bringing it closer to the levels seen in the days after Trump’s election win in November. Feb. 25 saw Bitcoin’s price retrace below $90,000, and just two days later, on Feb. 27, Bitcoin dropped below $80,000 for the first time since November. It’s now trading at $83,400, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 14.58% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitget chief analyst Ryan Lee recently told Cointelegraph that with Bitcoin hovering in the low $80,000s, its price and OI could see more volatility if the March 19 Federal Open Market Committee meeting delivers any surprises. “The market largely expects the Fed to hold rates steady, but any unexpected hawkish signals could put pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets,” he added.

Historically, when Bitcoin has tested these levels during bullish phases, it has managed to break through, hold its ground, and continue upward. However, current market conditions suggest caution, as the cryptocurrency is encountering key resistance and may experience a slowdown. The 50% Level: A Crucial Indicator Bitcoin’s price is currently at $83,000, approximately $10,000 away from the crucial 50% level at $93,000. This level is important because Bitcoin has historically shown strong reactions to it, both during upward and downward movements. The 50% level is particularly important for the current cycle, as it is derived from the price range between the August low and January’s all-time high. In recent weeks, Bitcoin has experienced sharp price movements, with major swings around the $79,000 level. Despite these fluctuations, the price has managed to hold above this level, suggesting the market is watching for further signs of either a breakout or a breakdown. Market Sentiment: A Potential Sell-off While Bitcoin’s short-term outlook may appear bullish due to recent price bounces, there are concerns that if Bitcoin fails to surpass the $93,000 level, it could experience a significant sell-off. This failure would resemble past failed rallies, where market sentiment turned bearish quickly, leading to sharp declines. Investors should be aware that these levels carry risk, and patience will be key in assessing the next move. CryptoQuant CEO Warns of Bear Market On-chain indicators are also pointing to a possible shift in Bitcoin’s market cycle. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has suggested that Bitcoin’s bull cycle may be over, predicting 6 to 12 months of bearish or sideways price action. #Bitcoin bull cycle is over, expecting 6–12 months of bearish or sideways price action. pic.twitter.com/f80bnNhjy4 — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) March 17, 2025 According to him, on-chain metrics such as MVRV, SOPR, and NUPL are signaling a bear market. He added that fresh liquidity is drying up and that new whales are selling Bitcoin at lower prices, which could dampen any bullish momentum. What’s Next for Bitcoin? As Bitcoin approaches these crucial levels, it remains to be seen whether it can break through resistance or if it will face another downturn. Investors should monitor the price action closely, particularly around the $93,000 level, as any failure to push past this could signal further challenges for Bitcoin in the coming months.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-18 03:34:09

The more than two-and-a-half-minute ad for the Solana Accelerate conference posted on March 17 with the caption “America is back. Time to Accelerate” depicted a man as “America” in a therapy session who said he was having thoughts “about innovation” such as crypto. The therapist responds he should do “something more productive, like coming up with a new gender” and later says the man should “focus on pronouns.” As the conversation meanders on, the man snaps and launches into a monologue amid swelling patriotic music, saying he wants to “build onchain and reclaim my place as the beacon of innovation” and wants “to invent technologies, not genders” in an apparent dig at progressive values. Before its deletion, the ad was viewed over 1.2 million times and racked up over 1,300 comments and 1,400 reposts, a majority of which derided it for its handling of gender identity and for making light of a highly divisive political issue. “They rolled it back because it hurt their business, not because they thought it was wrong,” Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran wrote to X on March 18. Took them 9 hours to delete it. Also all the major players in the Solana ecosystem suddenly delete their tweets promoting/supporting the ad and RT’d and liked takes about it being bad. They approved this, supported it and celebrated it. They rolled it back because it hurt… pic.twitter.com/kPMERDpTcn — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) March 18, 2025 Solana has not stated why it deleted the ad. The Solana Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sean O’Connor, operating chief at Web3 infrastructure firm Blocknative, wrote on X, “This is so fucking tone deaf.” “At a time when trans people are getting denied passports and being erased by the government... this is the ad you put out?” he added. On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump revoked Joe Biden’s executive orders aimed at preventing discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation. He also signed an order recognizing only two sexes — male and female — and scrapped the option for Americans to choose “X” as a gender on passports. DoubleZero operating chief David McIntyre called Solana’s ad “horrendous” and questioned why Solana didn’t “keep the message positive instead of dunking on people and making light of serious cultural issues.” Nicolas Pennie, the co-founder of the Solana development platform Helius, said on X that “virtue signaling will always be cringe regardless of political ideology.” Others who initially backed the ad have also pulled their support amid the backlash. Related: Crypto firms spent $134M on 2024 US elections, raising influence concerns Multicoin Capital co-founder Tushar Jain wrote on X that he deleted his initial post praising the ad “after some reflection.” He previously called the ad “bold and risky” and said having former Vice President Kamala Harris play the role of therapist was the “only thing that could have made it better.” In his retraction statement, Jain said it would have been more effective to “focus on deeper culture war issues like the failings of the oppressor-oppressed world view, not surface culture war issues like pronouns,” and the ad could have sent a message “without alienating a portion of the audience.” X Hall of Flame: Solana ‘will be a trillion-dollar asset’ — Mert Mumtaz",,EN,0,0,SOL|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-18 03:38:32

Adoption is still growing, and the network’s hash rate in 2025 is at all-time highs, making it nearly impossible to attack. Transactions are up, proving Bitcoin is being used, not just held. But prices tell a different story. Bitcoin has struggled despite all the bullish fundamentals. And that has put companies tied to it—especially Strategy—under pressure. The firm is not just buying Bitcoin, it is using debt to buy more, making its stock a high-stakes leveraged play on Bitcoin’s future. This move has worked so far. In 2024, Strategy was the second-best performing stock in the Russell 1000, delivering a 358.5% total return—three times Bitcoin’s own gains. Investors have been willing to pay extra for exposure to Bitcoin through Michael Saylor’s financial engineering. As of March 14, 2024, Strategy’s 499,096 BTC was worth $42 billion, but the company’s market cap was sitting at $77.4 billion. Add in its debt, and the enterprise value was $84.6 billion. The stock was trading at double the value of the Bitcoin it holds. Michael, who has been pushing the Bitcoin Standard for years, made no apologies for the company’s aggressive strategy. “We see Bitcoin as the best asset in the world, and we are structuring our company around that belief,” he said . Leverage fuels growth, but the risks are stacking up Strategy isn’t just betting on Bitcoin—it’s borrowing billions to buy more. That leverage has amplified the gains, but it also means the stock can crash twice as hard if Bitcoin drops. Since the start of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has declined. But instead of following suit, Strategy has climbed 2.7% year-to-date. The stock isn’t just trading on Bitcoin’s value anymore—it has become a premium speculation play. The danger? The premium could vanish overnight. If Bitcoin drops further, Strategy’s debt-heavy balance sheet could become a liability. A trader looking to hedge against a potential drop might consider a June $250/$200 put spread, betting that Strategy’s stock price will fall. By buying one $250 put at $30 per contract and selling two $200 puts at $15 per contract each, the trader would make money if the stock lands between $150 and $250 by June. But if Strategy collapses below $200, the trader is forced to buy shares at that price. With Strategy’s book value at roughly $150 per share, that could still be an expensive bet. Wall Street braces for more volatility Bitcoin is not the only asset facing pressure. The entire market is feeling the weight of uncertainty. Deutsche Bank’s chief strategist, Binky Chadha, has warned that the sell-off in U.S. equities isn’t over. “We see the sell-off in U.S. equities as having further to go,” Binky wrote. “With trade policy uncertainty likely to continue to weigh, at least until April 2, we expect positioning to continue to unwind.” Binky believes that if the S&P 500 drops another 6.9%, it will put even more pressure on Bitcoin and Strategy. The benchmark index, which closed at 5,638.94 on Friday, is already 8% off its all-time high. And it’s not just about trade policy. Executives at major corporations are cutting spending and lowering earnings forecasts. The one thing that could stop the bleeding? Donald Trump. Wall Street has long believed in a “Trump put”—the idea that Trump will adjust policies to stabilize markets if things get too bad. But Binky is not so sure. “Compared to the level of consumer confidence, the current approval rating is high, implying plenty of room for downside with negative growth or inflation developments likely to speed the catch down,” Binky said . “We expect the net approval rating has to turn more significantly negative, at least -5%, before the administration starts to consider responding.” For now, Trump’s policies have not been enough to stop the market’s decline. But Binky still holds a bullish year-end target of 7,000 for the S&P 500, suggesting that once the uncertainty clears, stocks—including Bitcoin and Strategy—could stage a major rebound.

The acting head of the U.S. SEC, Mark Uyeda, announced on Monday that the agency might change or even scrap stricter rules proposed by the previous administration. Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda delivered keynote remarks at ICI’s Investment Management Conference today. https://t.co/W6sYt92mGb pic.twitter.com/zBdKIJNHNF — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) March 17, 2025 Acting Chair Cites Concerns Over A Rule Uyeda said that there were major concerns about a rule from February 2023 that would require investment advisers to store crypto with qualified custodians. At the 2025 Investment Management Conference in San Diego, Uyeda noted the challenges in moving forward with the rule and asked SEC staff to work with the crypto task force to find better alternatives. These rules would have forced investment advisors holding cryptocurrencies and other assets to meet stricter standards. Uyeda also revealed that the SEC is looking into altering a rule that requires mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to report their holdings monthly instead of quarterly. Uyeda’s Focus On Rule Making Uyeda outlined plans for a significant shift away from the approach taken by the Biden administration in overseeing Wall Street. Uyeda mainly discussed the SEC’s rulemaking process, including the possibility of withdrawing, re-proposing rules, or delaying compliance deadlines. Uyeda emphasized that the SEC “needs to prioritize effective and cost-efficient regulations that respect the limits of our statutory authority,” as per a copy of his prepared remarks. The custody rule, proposed during the Biden administration under Gary Gensler, would require advisers to store client assets, including crypto, with qualified custodians for added protection. This raised concerns about limiting banks willing to work with the crypto sector. Opposition Against Crypto Custody Rule Republicans, crypto firms, and financial companies opposed the rule, saying it could hurt their businesses. The proposal led to disagreements between Uyeda, Commissioner Hester Peirce, and industry groups, who called it unlawful and harmful. Uyeda questioned how advisers could invest in crypto under the rule, but still supported it despite some concerns. Peirce, the only commissioner to oppose the rule, said it would limit the number of qualified crypto custodians. Uyeda’s decision to reconsider this rule is the second time this month he has asked the SEC staff to revisit proposed changes, signaling a shift in the SEC’s approach under the Trump administration. Paul Atkins, nominated by Trump to replace Uyeda as SEC Chair, is awaiting Senate confirmation.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been trapped between highs of $84,000 and $82,000 with buyers finding it difficult to push higher. Although the market is still cautious, historical patterns and data point to the possibility of a breakout. According to analyst Rekt Capital’s Mar. 18 post on X, Bitcoin’s current price action and its movement in June 2021 are similar. Following a steep decline, Bitcoin was trapped between the 21-week and 50-week EMAs. It eventually broke out in late July and hit an all-time high in November. Currently, Bitcoin is once again in the same range, raising speculation that history could repeat itself. #BTC Back in June 2021, price was consolidating between the 21-week EMA (green) and 50-week EMA (blue) after a crash Right now, Bitcoin is consolidating between the same EMAs after a crash (By the way, $BTC indeed broke out from its triangle by late July 2021 to reach new All… pic.twitter.com/Ok4Grzvit8 — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 17, 2025 Rekt Capital further observed that Bitcoin’s selling pressure has also been decreasing. Recent sell-offs have come with lower-than-usual volume, showing that sellers are losing momentum. This has opened the door for buyers, making last week a buyer-dominated period. Strong uptrends have resulted from similar shifts in previous cycles. You might also like: Bitcoin recovery faces two potential risks, two opportunities According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin is currently undergoing a deleveraging phase, which involves the market’s excess leverage being removed. In the past, these phases have created short- to medium-term buying opportunities and paved the way for recoveries . Previous market cycles demonstrate that Bitcoin often sees strong price rebounds after leverage resets. The BTC market is undergoing deleveraging “This chart highlights such reset phases by identifying moments when the 90-day open interest change turns negative. Historically, each past deleveraging like this has provided good short-to medium-term opportunities.” – @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/8VRH2oVaTD — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 17, 2025 The rise in the 3-6 month UTXO age bands, which indicate how long Bitcoin has been held, is another important indicator. CryptoQuant’s Mar. 15 analysis revealed that number of coins in this category is rising, much like what happened during the mid-2024 correction. This suggests more investors are holding their Bitcoin instead of selling, reducing the available supply. In previous cycles, this type of accumulation has played a big role in forming market bottoms and driving new rallies. Despite these positive signs, outflows from US-based Bitcoin ETFs have continued for the fifth consecutive week, which is the longest run on record. In April 2024, four weeks of outflows set the previous record. Although this suggests short-term uncertainty, Bitcoin may be poised for a significant move if selling pressure falls and accumulation increases. A breakout could occur soon if previous patterns continue.

Chen announced his new role on Monday in a post on X, calling crypto the most dynamic sector in finance. “Gemini is at the forefront of this revolution — making it simple and secure to engage on the digital asset frontier,” he wrote. Before joining Gemini, Chen spent over two years at fintech Affirm, where he served as VP of capital markets and bank partnerships, helping secure over $20b in funding access. His experience in financial strategy and capital markets suggests Gemini may be positioning itself for a major growth phase—potentially through public listing. I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve joined @Gemini as its Chief Financial Officer. I will be working alongside @cameron and @tyler and the incredible team at Gemini to unlock the next era of personal, financial, and creative freedom. Crypto is the most dynamic sector in finance… — Dan Chen (@danchen13) March 17, 2025 Gemini Revives IPO Talks as Market Conditions Improve The CFO appointment comes amid reports that Gemini has reopened discussions about an IPO, with Bloomberg reporting last month that the company is in early talks with potential advisors . Gemini initially considered going public in 2021, but the plan never materialized. However, with crypto markets rebounding and regulatory pressures shifting, the timing may now be more favorable for a public listing. Winklevoss Brothers Back Trump, Blast Biden’s Crypto Policies Beyond its business moves, Gemini’s founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, have become increasingly vocal in crypto-related politics. Last year, both twins donated $1m each to Donald Trump’s election campaign, with Cameron publicly endorsing Trump’s pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business stance. Meanwhile, Tyler Winklevoss sharply criticized the Biden administration, accusing it of waging a “war against crypto” through legal and regulatory crackdowns. He claimed that multiple government agencies have been weaponized to harass and litigate against legitimate crypto companies. Taking their stance a step further, Gemini recently announced that it will no longer hire graduates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) unless the university removes former SEC Chair Gary Gensler from his faculty position. Gensler, known for his aggressive regulatory actions against crypto firms, previously led the SEC’s lawsuit against Gemini over its now-defunct Earn program. However, last month, the agency dropped its case without any charges —a move that some see as a shift in regulatory attitudes. Gemini Users Targeted in Latest Phishing Scam While Gemini focuses on growth, it is also dealing with security threats. Over the weekend, Gemini users were hit with a phishing scam , receiving emails that falsely claimed to be from the exchange. The messages urged users to move their crypto holdings to self-hosted wallets, citing a nonexistent court ruling as justification.

Whales of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are looking for substitutes, notably a rising PayFi star now trading around $0.07. As the market remains in disarray, traditional meme coins SHIB and DOGE are showing mixed signals, forcing traders to diversify. The recent rush to the Remittix (RTX) presale highlights one reality unequivocally: large-scale crypto holders are choosing tokens that hold true real-world applications. Has RTX positioned itself on the path to a giant price explosion that could catch up to meme coin giants? Shiba Inu Whales Abandon Ship as Confidence Plummets Shiba Inu is having a hard time with the dramatic reduction of whales. Recent on-chain statistics recorded that inflows from the whales dropped 85% within a week. Traditionally, large holders played a substantial role in the performance of SHIB’s market. This sharp decline is showing diminished confidence among big players with doubts over the prospects of SHIB’s recovery. Over the past 30 days, the activities of whales fell by 32%, extending to a record 80% decline over the past 90 days. With decreasing institutional and large retail support, the speculative allure of Shiba Inu is rapidly losing its steam. Those looking to bet on more rewarding and secure growth opportunities are now gravitating towards alternatives like Remittix. Source: Tradingview Dogecoin Eyes a Potential Parabolic Move Amid Market Optimism Dogecoin is back in the limelight among the traders. A crypto expert pointed out that the current price actions of DOGE were similar to its bull run during 2017 when it experienced wild price spikes. These trends suggest that DOGE could hit $1.1 at the start of June if the repetition of the past cycles happens. Technicals like the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) also support this possibility since, in the past, DOGE has bounced hard off this support. A recent Doji candle—a very popular bullish reversal pattern—adds further validity to estimates. Dogecoin is able to initiate another colossal rally if the buyers come in strongly at current levels. However, the volatility of meme coins has led to hedging of bets on the part of the whales with tokens that have practical use cases like Remittix. Source: Tradingview Whales Shift Towards Remittix (RTX) as Next Big Crypto Move With meme coin confidence waning, whales have increasingly turned their attention to Remittix . Trading at just $0.0734, RTX has raised over $13 million in presale funding, selling more than 520 million tokens. This impressive performance shows investor confidence, driven by Remittix’s real-world utility and solid growth potential. Unlike SHIB and DOGE, Remittix offers genuine, practical solutions through its PayFi platform. Users can swiftly convert crypto directly into local currency, simplifying international transactions and lowering fees. This model provides reliable value rather than speculative hype. Consider a small import business in Latin America regularly purchasing supplies from Asia. Traditionally, the business deals with fluctuating exchange rates, costly international fees, and long delays. By adopting Remittix, this business can quickly convert crypto payments directly to local currency, reducing costs and improving cash flow. This type of practical use has caught the attention of whales previously loyal to SHIB and DOGE. As more investors see the benefits of real-world crypto solutions, Remittix’s price could significantly outperform meme tokens, setting the stage for explosive growth in the near term. RTX: The Token Poised for Massive Returns The shift from speculative meme coins to utility-driven projects like Remittix is gaining momentum. While SHIB struggles with declining whale interest and DOGE relies on uncertain market cycles, Remittix offers clear value that solves everyday financial challenges. Given its solid foundation and the ongoing surge of interest from large crypto holders, Remittix could rapidly surpass meme coins in market performance. Analysts forecasting a potential 15,540% surge aren’t merely guessing; they’re seeing a project built on stable fundamentals and growing user demand. For investors, Remittix represents a compelling opportunity—backed by real-world usage, strategic innovation, and rising market confidence. Ready to join the next big crypto movement?

On-chain indicators and technical charts have both shown strength that could help the meme coin achieve new heights from here onwards. Dogecoin Price Rally to $1 Begins? Prominent crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has highlighted a significant development in Dogecoin’s weekly chart. The latest candle closed as a doji, a pattern often interpreted as a signal of potential trend reversals. Source: Trader Tardigrade As shown in the above image, the trend reversal can lead to a Dogecoin price recovery all the way to $1 and beyond. Drawing comparisons to historical patterns, Trader Tardigrade noted that a similar doji formation preceded the last major surge in DOGE price. The current chart formations in DOGE have led to growing trader optimism. As long the meme coin holds the support at $0.16, the chances of the uptrend remain intact. As of press time, the Dogecoin price is trading 3.05% up at $0.1675 with daily trading volumes jumping 13% to more than $1.06 billion. Also, as per the Coinglass data, the options trading volume has surged 31% to more than $96 billion. Some market analysts have also been predicting a parabolic DOGE rally to more than $20. DOGE Address Activity Sees Huge Spike Amid the strong correction in the meme coin sector over the past two months, the Dogecoin price has also been subject to 37% value erosion on the monthly chart. However, at the current support levels, DOGE is seeing a huge spike in address activity. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment highlights a promising trend: the number of wallets holding at least 1 million DOGE has been on the rise, even as prices declined. Source: Santiment Additionally, Dogecoin’s active addresses have surged, reaching their highest levels in four months. This uptick in activity suggests a renewed interest among holders and traders, signaling potential resilience for the meme coin in a challenging market environment. Note that DOGE will need a boost from the overall crypto market in order to support the uptrend. Also, any positive development around Dogecoin ETF could serve as an additional catalyst for further momentum.

Solana’s SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Crypto Race Solana is a popular blockchain platform that is solving various pain points of crypto. Ethereum and Cardano are quite popular for dapps. Solana is different because it has a unique architecture for faster and cheaper transactions. It also supports different programming languages which adds flexibility for developers. Investors can stake Solana to earn rewards as well. Solana has gained significant attention in the market at the moment. Part of this is due to meme coin activity. Other than that, Solana has the potential to support services without requiring second-layer solutions. It is, hence, quite attractive for developers and investors. If we compare it to other coins, Solana is a strong competitor due to its strong focus on speed and scalability. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Boosting Solana’s Community BONK is a new memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a cute Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by shifting power away from big venture capital holders to everyday users. After getting listed on Coinbase, BONK’s price surged over 100%, drawing attention from crypto enthusiasts. As a “community coin,” it airdropped half of its total supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi projects, spreading the tokens widely among users. Despite its playful image, BONK is making serious moves in the crypto world. It’s integrated into the Solana ecosystem, working with decentralized applications and even launching its own exchange called BonkSwap. This involvement shows potential for growth as part of Solana’s fast-growing network. However, like other memecoins, BONK faces challenges such as a huge total supply and price ups and downs. In the current market, BONK stands out as an interesting player, but it’s important to compare it with other cryptocurrencies and watch market trends before making any decisions. Conclusion Solana’s breakout could boost SOL, BONK, and XYZ; XYZ, the pioneering all-sport memecoin, combines meme culture and sports in a unique, community-driven ecosystem aiming for massive growth.

With major economic data being released and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting set for Wednesday, March 19th, it’s a week you won’t want to miss. FOMC Interest Rate Decision: What to Expect The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision is scheduled for Wednesday. As of now, analysts do not expect any changes to the current rate of 4.25% to 4.5%. However, the real focus will be on the press conference held by Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. During this time, Powell will address the media, and the Q&A session will provide valuable insights into the future outlook for the economy. Interest Rate Cuts May Not Be Immediate While no rate cuts are expected in the upcoming meeting, analysts are predicting the first rate cut of 2025 may occur in June. The Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates at this meeting, but many are hoping for some optimistic statements from Powell, which could send bullish signals to the markets. Quantitative Tightening and Market Impact Another key aspect to watch is the potential halt of quantitative tightening (QT). The Fed has indicated that it might stop the runoff of its balance sheet by mid-2025. While this is not a guarantee, any indication of a shift in monetary policy would be bullish for the markets, as it could signal more liquidity entering the economy. Markets Eyeing March 19th Decision Bitcoin’s price currently hovers around $83,000, with some support seen at the $78,000 level. The broader altcoin market remains volatile, with liquidity yet to show a significant uptick. Speculation is rising that the next altcoin rally will begin soon.

The sales took place in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. The first round, launched on October 15, 2024, raised $300 million, while the second round brought in $250 million according to a press release . Over 85,000 participants completed the Know Your Customer (KYC) process to be eligible for the token sales. Trump and Partners To Receive 75% Of Net Income Though Trump isn’t directly involved in World Liberty, he and his partners will get 75% of the project’s net revenue, including from WLFI token sales. After $30 million for expenses, Trump and his partners will earn $390 million for promoting the project and letting it use his name and image. The first token sale started in mid-October and was open to both U.S. and international investors. While the details of the DeFi project are still secret, it’s been buying millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies like Ether and Tron. Justin Sun, the creator of Tron, is also an investor. “This milestone proves that those who truly understand crypto and finance recognize what we’re building, and that WLFI is on track to supercharge DeFi as it transforms global finance in the coming years,” remarked Zach Witkoff, WLFI’s co-founder. He also shared that the token sales are just the beginning and they are gearing up to launch a wave of disruptive technology that will redefine the boundaries of what’s possible with digital assets. Notably, in the past six months, WLFI has formed strategic partnerships with top blockchain protocols and institutions like Ondo Finance, Ethena, Chainlink, Sui, and Aave. These collaborations are setting WLFI up to quickly build and launch its upcoming platform, designed to make finance more accessible to millions. WLFI Builds Strong Digital Asset Reserve WLFI’s “Macro Strategy” has built a strong digital asset reserve, including BTC, ETH, TRX, LINK, SUI, and ONDO tokens. This reserve helps support leading crypto projects, adds stability to WLFI’s treasury, and allows for future investment in new opportunities. The strategy will also help fund innovative projects, boost ecosystem growth, and create new possibilities in the fast-growing DeFi space. WLFI emphasized that it remains committed to advancing its mission to create a more inclusive financial future, backed by strategic partnerships, innovative technologies and a dedicated community.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS|ONDO|SPONSORED|BNB|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-18 04:45:21

Last week alone, the financial vehicles tracking both assets saw outflows exceeding $1.2 billion across several countries, including the United States, Switzerland, and Canada. Withdrawals from other digital asset products brought the outflows to $1.7 billion, and in the past five weeks, total outflows from this negative streak have exceeded $6.4 billion. $980M Leave U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs A Monday report from the digital asset investment company CoinShares disclosed that crypto investment products have marked their 17th straight day of outflows, with Bitcoin leading the trend. The firm said this is the longest negative streak it has seen since its records began in 2015. Due to this decline in prices and consistent outflows, the total assets under management for digital asset investment products have declined by $48 billion. The United States spot Bitcoin ETF market alone accounted for over $980 million in outflows from ETFs issued by several asset managers like BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Ark Invest/21Shares, and WisdomTree. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the largest outflows, amounting to $383 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC followed suit with $316 million in withdrawals. IBIT recorded just one day of inflow out of five trading days throughout the week. FBTC saw the same but recorded only three days of outflows and one day of no flows. From March 10 to 14, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market saw only one inflow day, per CoinGlass data . Occasional inflows recorded by IBIT, FBTC, Ark Invest’s ARKB, VanEck’s HODL, and Bitwise’s BITB were not enough to offset the massive outflows seen on about two trading days. The funds went on for two days without recording any inflows at all. Ethereum Funds Bleed For the U.S. spot Ethereum ETF market, the funds have been on an outflow streak since March 5. However, they lost $189 million last week. Once again, BlackRock’s ETHA led the losses with outflows surpassing $63 million, while Fidelity’s FETH followed behind with withdrawals exceeding $61 million. The spot ETFs recorded only two days of inflows – their only positive flows since March 5 – but the deposits were still not enough to offset the withdrawals. In fact, the inflows were less than $1.5 million on each occasion. Meanwhile, these outflows come as bitcoin and ether struggle to return to the $90,000 and $2,000 ranges, respectively.

An early trader of the meme coin has managed to earn a 4860x return just within two days of launch, converting his $232 investment to a $1.1 million return. Mubarak Meme Coin Trader Mints Huge Profit Blockchain analytics platform LookonChain recently pointed out that a trader has achieved extraordinary profits from the newly launched BNB Chain-based meme coin, the Mubarak token. A savvy trader managed to turn an initial investment of just 0.4 BNB ($232) into over $1.1 million, achieving a staggering 4,860x return. The trader purchased 10.5 million $MUBARAK tokens for $232 and later sold part of the holdings for 576 BNB, worth approximately $363,500. Currently, the trader retains 5.16 million tokens, valued at $764,000, spread across three wallets. Source: LookonChain What’s Behind This New Meme Coin Frenzy The Mubarak meme coin has gained significant traction in the last two days following an investment by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao . This announcement was enough to garnet significant trader attention leading to a sharp rally in a very short time period. Furthermore, the listing of this meme coin on the Binance Alpha platform has led to a huge trading activity around it. Pseudonymous crypto analyst Thanos has expressed strong optimism about the token, describing it as a “no-brainer” investment at its current price levels. According to Thanos, the recent Binance Futures listing triggered a market shakeout, eliminating overleveraged long positions. With this correction behind, the analyst believes the token can continue its upward trajectory. BNB Price Rally to Continue? The launch of the MUBARAK meme coin on the BNB Chain has led to a huge surge in network activity thereby pushing the BNB price higher to the breakout resistance of $630. As a result of this, the decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes on the BNB chain have also skyrocketed. In a recent milestone, the daily trading volumes on the BNB chain also surpassed that of the popular Solana network. Over the last few months, the meme coin market has been shifting from Solana to Binance, as the latter sees a strong surge in address activity.

Ju pointed to on-chain metrics that indicate a shifting trend. “Every on-chain metric signals a bear market,” he said, explaining that liquidity is drying up, and new whales are offloading Bitcoin at lower prices. He added that on-chain indicators such as Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), and Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL)—which analyze market valuation, investor profitability and overall sentiment—are showing key inflection points based on a 365-day moving average trend.

After briefly topping $100,000 in late 2024, Bitcoin is now in a classic post-rally consolidation phase, testing key support levels between $82,000 and $85,000. While institutional buying and speculation around a potential U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve have provided some optimism, resistance between $85,000 and $90,000 could make further gains difficult. A breakout won’t come easy, and traders are closely watching whether Bitcoin’s recent momentum has long-term staying power. BTC Faces a Critical Test as Bearish Indicators Gain Strength According to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, macro conditions remain a major wildcard. Any unexpected shifts in Federal Reserve (FOMC) policy could shake up the market. If sentiment turns bearish, Bitcoin could dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000. Meanwhile, crypto cynic and market commentator Peter Schiff has issued his own warning , suggesting that Bitcoin could face even steeper losses if broader markets tumble. “The NASDAQ is down 12%,” Schiff noted on X. “If this correction turns out to be a bear market, and the correlation where a 12% decline in the NASDAQ equates to a 24% decline in Bitcoin holds, when the NASDAQ is down 20%, Bitcoin will be about $65K.” With technical indicators turning bearish, Bitcoin faces a crucial test in the coming months. If macro conditions remain stable, the market could stabilize near current support levels. However, if institutional sentiment weakens or the NASDAQ extends its decline, Bitcoin’s correction could deepen, putting $65,000–$75,000 on the radar.

The market is flooded with meme coins, and while some fizzle out, others explode in ways no one saw coming. Investors who caught early waves on past meme coins know that timing is everything. And in 2025, the best cryptos to hold long term are shaping up to be the ones with strong momentum, thriving communities, and massive potential for gains. Leading the charge is BTFD Coin (BTFD), a breakout project that’s already raised over $6.33 million in its presale, with more than 71 billion tokens sold and a growing Bulls Squad of 11,400 holders. Analysts are watching closely as BTFD sets itself up for a 3,650% ROI post-launch, making it one of the best cryptos to hold long term . But it’s not alone—Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other meme coins are also making noise in the market. Let’s break down why these four cryptos are worth holding. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Presale That’s Breaking Records When it comes to the best cryptos to hold long term, BTFD Coin is turning heads with its explosive presale growth. Investors have already poured over $6.33 million into the project, pushing its total token sales beyond 71 billion BTFD. And with a listing price of $0.0006, early buyers are eyeing a massive 3,650% ROI potential if the token reaches its projected moon price of $0.006. But what makes BTFD Coin stand out? Aside from the hype, it’s the combination of strong community backing, exciting features, and an aggressive presale strategy. The Bulls Squad continues to grow, fueling the momentum as the project nears its next presale stage. With the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already live, BTFD is proving it has real engagement beyond speculation. If you’re wondering how much you could make, let’s put it in perspective. A $15,000 investment at the current $0.00016 presale price would secure you 93.75 million BTFD tokens. If BTFD hits $0.0006, that turns into $56,250—and if it reaches its moon price of $0.006, you’re looking at a jaw-dropping $562,500. That’s why early investors aren’t sleeping on this meme coin presale . Buying BTFD is easy. Just set up a digital wallet like MetaMask, load it with BNB or ETH, connect to the official buy page , and grab your BTFD before the next stage bumps the price. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme project—it’s a movement. Its presale numbers prove that demand is skyrocketing, and with a 100% bonus for new buyers, the time to jump in is now. Shiba Inu: The OG Meme Coin That Keeps Growing Few meme coins have achieved legendary status like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Launched in 2020 as the self-proclaimed “Dogecoin killer,” SHIB quickly built a passionate global community. Now, years later, it’s still one of the best cryptos to hold long term, thanks to its real-world adoption and ecosystem expansion. From being accepted as a payment method by major retailers to launching Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain, SHIB is continuously evolving. The development team is actively building out DeFi utilities, NFT integration, and even a Shiba Inu metaverse. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognized meme coins in the industry. Its massive liquidity and long-term roadmap make it a strong contender for those looking to hold through market cycles. Pepe Coin: A Pure Meme Play with Deflationary Hype Meme coins thrive on internet culture, and Pepe Coin (PEPE) taps directly into that energy. Inspired by the legendary Pepe the Frog meme, PEPE launched with a clear goal—to embrace meme culture without overcomplicating things. Unlike many meme tokens, PEPE has a no-tax policy and a deflationary model, meaning the supply decreases over time, potentially increasing value. Since its launch, PEPE has gained traction thanks to its simple yet effective branding. With a strong community of holders and no signs of slowing down, it’s making waves as one of the best cryptos to hold long term for those looking for pure meme-driven excitement. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Pepe Coin is riding the meme hype with a simple, no-frills approach. Its deflationary tokenomics make it an interesting option for long-term believers in meme coin culture. Bonk: The Solana-Based Dog Coin That Shook the Market Dog coins have dominated the meme space, and Bonk (BONK) is the first major dog-themed token built on Solana. Launched on December 25, 2022, BONK went viral due to its massive airdrop campaign, where 50% of its total supply was distributed to Solana users. This move instantly made it a Solana favorite, and the token surged in value in early 2023. Since then, BONK has maintained its place as one of the best cryptos to hold long term, benefiting from Solana’s fast transactions and low fees. Its meme status is solidified, and with growing liquidity and ongoing community support, it continues to attract both traders and long-term believers. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Bonk revitalized interest in meme coins on Solana. Its grassroots approach and strong airdrop strategy cemented its place in the ecosystem. Final Thoughts Based on market trends and community strength, the best cryptos to hold long term are those that combine strong fundamentals with massive hype. BTFD Coin is leading that charge, with its record-breaking presale and $6.33 million already raised, setting the stage for potential 3,650% ROI gains. Meanwhile, coins like SHIB, PEPE, and BONK continue to hold strong, proving their staying power in the ever-evolving crypto space. But time is running out. BTFD Coin’s presale stages won’t last forever, and the current $0.00016 price is a fleeting opportunity. Once it lists at $0.0006, the early-bird window will be closed. Don’t miss out— join the BTFD Coin presale now before prices increase again. FAQs What are the best cryptos to hold long term in 2025? The best cryptos to hold long term include projects with strong community backing and solid roadmaps, such as BTFD Coin, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK. Why is BTFD Coin’s meme coin presale attracting so much attention? BTFD Coin’s meme coin presale has already raised $6.33 million and sold 71 billion tokens, setting it up for a potential 3,650% ROI post-listing. How do I buy BTFD Coin? To buy BTFD Coin, set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, fund it with BNB or ETH, connect to the buy page, and purchase before the next presale stage.

Burwick Law filed the suit on behalf of its clients against Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol and Meteora on March 17 for launching the Libra (LIBRA) token in a “deceptive, manipulative and fundamentally unfair” manner. The token was then promoted by Argentine President Javier Milei on X as an economic initiative to stimulate private-sector funding in the country. The law firm slammed the two crypto infrastructure and launchpad firms behind LIBRA — KIP and Meteora — claiming that they used a “predatory” one-sided liquidity pool to artificially inflate the memecoin’s price, allowing insiders to profit while “everyday buyers bore the losses.” Within hours, the insiders “rapidly siphoned approximately $107 million from the liquidity pools,” causing a 94% crash in LIBRA’s market value, Burwick Law said in a March 17 filing shared on X. Source: Burwick Law President Milei was mentioned in the lawsuit but wasn’t named a defendant. Burwick accused the defendants of leveraging Milei’s influence to aggressively promote the token, deliberately creating a false sense of legitimacy and misleading investors about its economic potential. Approximately 85% of LIBRA’s tokens were withheld at launch and the “predatory infrastructure techniques” allegedly used by the defendants weren’t disclosed to investors, Burwick said. “These tactics, combined with omissions about the true liquidity structures, deprived investors of material information.” Burwick is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, the disgorgement of “unjustly obtained” profits and injunctive relief to prevent further fraudulent token offerings.

Only 2,101 profitable wallets were able to take home a combined $180 million in profit, Nansen noted in a Feb. 19 report. The venture capital firm behind the LIBRA token, Kelsier Ventures, and its CEO, Hayden Davis, were apparently two of the biggest winners from the token launch. They claim to have netted around $100 million. Davis, who is now facing a potential Interpol red notice following an Argentine lawyer’s request, said on Feb. 17 that he didn’t directly own the tokens and wouldn’t sell them. Meanwhile, Milei has distanced himself from the memecoin, arguing he didn’t “promote” the LIBRA token — as fraud lawsuits filed against him have alleged — and instead merely “spread the word” about it. Argentina’s opposition party called for Milei’s impeachment but has had limited success thus far.

The company has recently filed a trademark for ”Ripple Custody,” signaling its intent to enter the growing crypto custody market, a move that could broaden its services beyond payments. At the same time, speculation is mounting that Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be nearing its conclusion, with potential implications for XRP’s regulatory classification and the broader crypto industry. Ripple Labs Expands Into Crypto Custody With New Trademark Filing Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP token, is making strategic moves to solidify its presence in the cryptocurrency custody space. A recently filed trademark application for “Ripple Custody” suggests that the fintech firm is gearing up to offer crypto storage solutions for both individuals and institutions. The trademark filing, submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), details four primary use cases for the new brand. One of the most significant descriptions states that the mark applies to “financial services, namely, custodial services in the nature of maintaining storage and possession of cryptocurrency for financial management purposes.” This move signals Ripple’s intent to enter the growing crypto custody market, which has become increasingly competitive amid rising institutional interest in digital assets. Cryptocurrency custodians provide secure storage solutions for digital assets, reducing risks associated with private key loss, cyber threats, and unauthorized access. These services are particularly valuable to institutional investors, who require robust security measures and regulatory compliance. The crypto custody industry has witnessed a surge in demand, especially after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. With ETFs attracting billions of dollars in inflows, the need for institutional-grade custody solutions has become more critical than ever. Several major financial institutions, including Coinbase, Citi, and BNY Mellon, have established themselves as key players in this sector. Ripple’s entry into the space could challenge these incumbents, particularly if it leverages its blockchain technology and existing network of financial partners. Given its history of providing enterprise solutions in cross-border payments, Ripple’s move into custody services could be a natural expansion of its offerings. The trademark filing follows Ripple’s launch of a custody service in October 2024, marking its initial foray beyond its traditional focus on payment settlements. At the time, the company positioned the service as a means to diversify its revenue streams and expand its role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Despite its latest trademark application, Ripple has remained tight-lipped about its specific plans for Ripple Custody. Beyond custodial services, the trademark filing also references “downloadable software for custody of cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency; downloadable software for transmission and storage of cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency.” This suggests that Ripple could be exploring the launch of a crypto wallet. A proprietary wallet would allow Ripple to offer secure storage and transaction capabilities for XRP and potentially other digital assets. This move could serve as another revenue stream for the company, with transaction fees contributing to its financial model. If Ripple were to introduce a wallet solution, it would enter a competitive market already dominated by hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor, as well as software wallets such as Trust Wallet and Exodus. Given the company’s history, a Ripple-branded wallet could be deeply integrated with the XRP Ledger, offering seamless interaction for users holding XRP and other supported assets. It could also cater to institutional clients looking for enterprise-grade solutions. Ripple’s expansion into custody services comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. The company has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC since December 2020 over whether XRP should be classified as a security. While Ripple has achieved partial victories in court, the case remains ongoing, influencing the company’s strategic decisions. By entering the custody space, Ripple may be positioning itself as a more traditional financial services provider, aligning with regulatory expectations and institutional standards. Crypto custody is a highly regulated business, with custodians required to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. If Ripple secures the necessary approvals, it could enhance its credibility among financial institutions and regulators. What This Means for XRP and Ripple’s Future Ripple’s move into custody services and potentially wallets could be a significant boost for the XRP ecosystem. By providing secure storage and transaction infrastructure, Ripple could enhance the utility and adoption of XRP beyond just cross-border payments. Additionally, these developments could drive greater institutional engagement with Ripple’s offerings. If financial firms and investment funds begin using Ripple Custody, it could open the door for broader XRP adoption in institutional portfolios. While Ripple has not officially confirmed the launch of any new products under the Ripple Custody brand, the trademark filing is a strong indication that the company is preparing to expand its footprint in the digital asset space. With institutional demand for secure crypto solutions growing, Ripple’s potential entry into custody services and wallets could mark a major milestone for both the company and the broader crypto industry. Ripple vs. SEC: Is the Legal Battle Finally Coming to an End? For nearly four years, Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a high-stakes legal battle with the SEC, a case that has been closely watched as a defining moment for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. But according to new claims making waves in the crypto space, the lawsuit could be reaching its final chapter—sooner than many expected. The latest buzz comes from Andrew “AP_Abacus” Parish , a well-known figure in the crypto space, who claims that two SEC insiders have confirmed that the case is ”very close to being over.” While this information remains unverified and unofficial, it has sent ripples of speculation through the crypto community. If true, the implications of a conclusion to this lawsuit could be far-reaching. The case, which began in December 2020, has been a crucial test of how the SEC intends to regulate cryptocurrencies, particularly those issued by private companies. Initially, the SEC accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through its sale of XRP , a claim Ripple has vehemently denied. Now, new discussions are emerging about what XRP’s legal status might be once the dust settles. Perhaps the most surprising rumor surrounding the case’s potential resolution is the idea that XRP could be reclassified as a commodity rather than a security. If true, this would move its oversight from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a shift that could change the way XRP is traded, regulated, and perceived by the broader financial world. For years, Ripple has fought against the SEC’s classification of XRP as a security, arguing that it functions more like a currency or commodity than a stock. The idea that XRP could emerge from this legal battle with commodity status is a development few had anticipated. If this happens, it would not only be a victory for Ripple but also set a precedent for other cryptocurrency projects facing similar regulatory scrutiny. One of the biggest concerns for Ripple throughout this legal saga has been the potential financial consequences. Originally, the SEC sought a staggering $2 billion fine from Ripple, a figure that threatened to cripple the company’s operations. However, that number was significantly reduced to $125 million in 2024—a major win for Ripple at the time. Now, sources suggest that the final penalty could be ”greatly reduced” even further. If this turns out to be true, Ripple may walk away from this battle with far fewer damages than initially feared. More importantly, it would indicate that the SEC itself is re-evaluating its position on Ripple, XRP, and possibly its broader approach to crypto regulation. Shifting Sentiment Within the SEC A major factor that could be influencing this potential outcome is the changing leadership and priorities at the SEC. Under Gary Gensler, the agency has aggressively pursued legal actions against crypto companies, often without clear regulatory guidelines. However, increasing pressure from lawmakers, legal defeats in court, and growing institutional acceptance of crypto have forced the SEC to rethink its stance. Ripple’s case is more than just a legal battle—it has become a symbol of how the US government handles cryptocurrency regulation. If the SEC is indeed close to settling, it may reflect a strategic decision to avoid setting a precedent that could backfire on the agency in future cases. The speculation about an impending resolution has caught the attention of major crypto figures, including John Deaton, the attorney representing XRP holders in the case. His response? A simple eye emoji—a cryptic but telling signal that something significant may indeed be happening behind the scenes. Other prominent voices in the crypto space have also chimed in, highlighting the potential impact of XRP securing a favorable outcome. If the SEC backs down, it could open the door for greater regulatory clarity for other cryptocurrencies, many of which have been waiting in limbo due to the uncertainty surrounding the Ripple case.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-18 05:30:00

Companies seldom meet their previously announced ambitions after intense launch excitement dies out. Remittix operates as a project that drew sufficient funding through its presale amounting to nearly $14 million which distributed 520 million tokens at $0.0734 each. Experts who analyze the chances of a 42x return dispute that this prediction represents conventional crypto market madness. Different Kind of Altcoin The Remittix platform focuses on providing a solution for universal financial needs because it connects digital assets to everyday monetary transactions. The solution emphasizes fast crypto-to-fiat transactions to eliminate the typical complications which slow down cross-border transfers and standard payments. The system operates without exceptional technology while providing basic interfaces that users can easily grasp. The simplified design of this product solution attracts users who dislike complex blockchain technology. The user-friendly model has likely become the main reason why Remittix achieved success during its presale campaign. Remittix has established itself by targeting various user groups including financial experts working at shops or doing freelance jobs or traveling the world while seeking straightforward currency conversion capabilities. The successful completion of this token could measure genuine service demand in place of brief-market frenzy. Practical Goals Backed by Nearly $14 Million The company successfully generated almost $14 million through its presale stage operations. Remittix’s investors clearly see past marketing hype to understand the complete vision of the company’s strategy. Financial resources gathered early allow the team to construct powerful infrastructure combined with regulatory licenses and develop regional compliance solutions. Its preparedness allows it to bypass the legal issues which destroyed many alternative cryptocurrencies. Powerful funding driven from investors provides established remittance companies and payment gateways with substantial interest. Rapid deals securing access to existing businesses can make real-world usage for Remittix increase swiftly. The sustainable power of prices in cryptocurrency depends more on use than speculation. The 42x potential could become achievable through both swift adoption of the project and its capability to navigate mainstream processes faster than established complex platforms. Potential Path to a 42x Leap How might Remittix climb to 42 times its current presale price? Several major elements will decide the outcome according to observer predictions. The token requires execution of major collaborations either through remittance services or international e-commerce platforms. Additionally the platform needs to demonstrate steady transaction activity which establishes the effectiveness of its solution for actual end users. It should pass through every compliance or regulatory requirement with ease to protect trust among both its expanding user base and outside businesses. A rapid price increase of Remittix will likely occur after its first major exchange platform listing if the project’s business factors remain favorable. The market demand could surpass available supplies because major players are inclined to include Remittix within their transaction process. The planned developments seem to condense timeframes so that the kind of swift price increase which expert analysts predict can become possible while overall crypto sentiment remains optimistic. Digital assets have frequently shown promises of massive profitability throughout history. Supporters claim Remittix stands apart by establishing immediate solutions for an existing industry-wide problem. Customers must endure lengthy transfer times along with excessive fees while moving money across borders or exchanging digital currency into local wallets. The improved payment processing at Remittix could potentially win two populations: domestic shoppers and international cross-border senders. Final Reflection According to Remittix’s systematic approach both investors and users can see beyond the hype that the platform will achieve its projected 42x returns. At its core Remittix provides user-friendly crypto conversion solutions supported by almost $14 million of presale funding. Success within the crypto world depends on delivering functional solutions that normal users encounter as valuable. The likelihood of Remittix succeeding appears better as it demonstrates practical daily usage while quickly establishing key partnerships in the market.

According to Maxime Pizzolitto, WhiteRock’s CEO, WhiteRock is combining the best of traditional finance (regulations, safety, and trust) and the crypto world (efficiency, high yields, and innovation). “Imagine a world where a pension fund holding billions in government bonds can deploy those assets in a lending pool generating yields of 20% or higher, yields that were only accessible to crypto narratives.” _ Maxime Pizzolitto. In this article, we will explore WhiteRock’s key offerings and upcoming developments and ultimately determine whether it is a legitimate product or a scam. What is WhiteRock? WhiteRock is a real-world asset (RWA) protocol designed to tokenize economic rights to traditional financial assets like stocks, bonds, property, options, and derivatives. The platform has quickly gained adoption and now boasts over $150 million of assets locked in their smart contracts and over $100 million in trading volume processed. WhiteRock’s key offerings USDX stablecoin for passive income with no lockups WhiteRock cuts the bureaucracy of investing in US treasury bills through its USDX stablecoin , which combines the stability of the US dollar and the returns of US Treasury bills. The value of each USDX token is pegged to the value of the US dollar. To achieve yield, WhiteRock invests the funds backing USDX in US Treasury bills, which then generate steady interest, creating a reliable source of passive income. The interest is distributed to all USDX holders using a rebase system where the number of tokens in your wallet increases automatically with no extra steps or lock-up periods. Tokenized stocks WhiteRock makes investing in stocks easy for anyone to invest and own fractions of stocks regardless of their geographical background or capital through tokenized stocks. Tokenized stocks are digital copies of company stocks coded into the blockchain. By leveraging the blockchain, the stocks remain tamper-proof and transparent while mirroring both the value and price movements of company stocks. Registration and my initial impressions The WhiteRock application is a simple yet feature-rich platform with a black-and-white theme and a signup process that cuts out crypto jargon. The application is user-friendly, and I was able to create an account in minutes. Email and phone are supported sign-up methods. Other options include social media sign-up methods like Telegram, X (formerly Twitter), Discord, and LinkedIn. WhiteRock application sign-in methods On signing in, I was assigned an Ethereum crypto address for making USDT deposits. Once deposited, they were automatically converted to USDX at a 1:1 ratio. ‘Assigned USDT deposit address’ The deposits are credited once the transactions are confirmed on the blockchain. While the sign-up process is a breeze, you must pay a one-off ‘Meta-transaction’ fee, 3.87 USDX at press time. While it may sound inconvenient, the fee allows you to settle transaction fees on the platform in USDX. WhiteRock application interface $WHITE token $WHITE is the native currency that will be used throughout the WhiteRock ecosystem. Notably, $WHITE has maintained an impressive price run since its inception, outperforming most major cryptocurrencies this year, including $BTC and $ETH. $WHITE token performance The bull run contributed to WHITE’s market cap, which is now at $404 million and rising. In addition to the WhiteRock platform, you can purchase WHITE tokens on MEXC and BingX cryptocurrency exchanges. Future outlook for WhiteRock The blockchain space is evolving constantly, with emerging trends every season amidst growing adoption and acceptance across many jurisdictions. This year, we saw the approval of cryptocurrency ETFs and a pro-crypto administration win the US elections. This means that it is paramount that every crypto project adapts to the changing trends and developments. WhiteRock is set to roll out new developments and features in 2025 in its bid to unlock a tokenized future in this fast-evolving space. Decentralized exchange WhiteRock is in the process of launching a fast and cost-effective decentralized crypto exchange that will use an order book system. An order book system comprises a list of buy and sell orders that execute at the best prices or market orders, similar to centralized exchanges. WhiteRock DEX WhiteRock will use the DEX to provide users with a seamless and secure trading experience that satisfies global financial regulations. XRP Ledger integration – for more institutional adoption WhiteRock is working on completing their XRP ledger integration following a successful testnet that reportedly outperformed “expectations in both adoption and volume.” XRP Ledger is a fast and cost-effective blockchain system that is increasingly being integrated into various institutional frameworks, particularly in finance. Use cases have included the creation of Central Bank Digital Currencies and a settlement layer for remittances and international payments. The integration has received considerable traction from the investing public. WhiteRock reported a combined $1.8M in AUM from submitted applications in the mainnet whitelist. Funds representing a combined $1.8B AUM have submitted applications to our whitelist. Demand for our XRPL integration has surpassed all projections.

WhiteRock is a fast-growing RWA ecosystem attracting interest from both institutional and individual investors. In an AMA on X , Pizzolitto, WhiteRock’s CEO, came out and explained WhiteRock’s vision and cleared all rumors of WhiteRock being a scam. The company’s contract is also audited and approved by PeckShield, a top-tier blockchain security firm. In conclusion, WhiteRock is leveraging the best of traditional finance and the crypto world to simplify access to diverse investments, promote transparency, and enhance liquidity on a global scale. As the lines between traditional finance and the blockchain continue to Blur, WhiteRock’s offerings and impact on the financial ecosystem is both significant and inspiring.

Over the past week, ADA has been trading within a tight range between $0.69 and $0.75. However, the prevailing market uncertainty has left investors and traders uncertain about building positions, as they await clearer market direction in the coming days. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA is currently at the lower boundary of its consolidation zone and is poised for upside momentum, provided it holds above the $0.69 level in the coming days. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if ADA remains above this lower boundary, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 9% to reach the $0.75 level. However, if the asset falls below the $0.68 level, it could decline further to $0.65.

Current Price Momentum and Over-Leveraged Levels ADA is currently trading near $0.70 and has experienced a 1.5% price drop in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume declined by 12%, indicating traders’ and investors’ fears, as they have reduced their participation compared to the previous day.

All signals are currently bearish, says Ju Ju said that all Bitcoin ( BTC ) onchain metrics indicate a bear market. “With fresh liquidity drying up, new whales are selling Bitcoin at lower prices,” Ju said. It comes only days after Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin funding rates, which reflect the cost of holding long or short positions in crypto futures , are hovering close to 0%, indicating increasing indecisiveness among traders. Ju’s claim is in stark contrast to his March 4 post, where he said the Bitcoin bull cycle will remain slow but “is still intact,” pointing to neutral readings on key indicators. “Fundamentals remain strong, with more mining rigs coming online,” Ju said in a March 4 X post. Other analysts aren’t as bearish. Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that “there is no reason to panic.” Hundal explained that while investors are “spooked” by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, “all the numbers show a global economy that is pointing in the right direction.” “Money will move to on-risk assets when the market is ready to take on risk.” At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $83,030, down 14.79% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 14.89% over the past month.

We are about to see Bitcoin rally again,” crypto analyst Seth said in a recent X post. Likewise, CoinRoutes CEO Dave Weisberger said that if the historical trend persists, Bitcoin could reach all-time highs by late April. “Expect Bitcoin to hit a new ATH within a month if its BETA correlation to money supply holds,” Weisberger said in a March 17 X post.

Hoskinson’s remarks come after years of intense regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry, with government agencies like the SEC launching numerous lawsuits and investigations against major cryptocurrency firms. Hoskinson criticized the SEC’s aggressive stance, stating that the regulator had branded the entire industry as criminal, suing companies from the largest firms to the smallest projects, costing the sector hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees and wiping out billions in market cap. He also pointed out the hypocrisy of federal employees who, according to him, take no accountability for the damage caused by their actions and yet play the victim when faced with the consequences.

He went on to call out what he described as “unelected, career federal employees” who have inflicted significant harm on the crypto sector, saying that those in charge of such actions lacked moral character. Hoskinson’s remarks were particularly pointed toward SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, whose leadership has been central to the Commission’s enforcement actions. Hoskinson’s comments come after reports suggesting that some SEC staff members are facing backlash, with law firms refusing to interview them due to their work with crypto. William McLucas, a former SEC official, criticized these attacks, saying it’s unfair to target staff members who are just doing their jobs. “We will never forget or forgive as an industry because we know what would have happened if the other side won.

41846408,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140918,1742277044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: Asia FX Under Pressure as Dollar Dominates Amid Fed & BOJ Rate Hike Anticipation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-fed-boj/,"Navigating the turbulent waters of cryptocurrency and Forex markets requires staying ahead of global financial shifts. Right now, all eyes are on Asia FX as it experiences downward pressure against a resurgent US dollar. This movement comes as traders brace themselves for potentially impactful interest rate decisions from two of the world’s most influential central banks: the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ). What does this mean for the broader financial landscape, and how should you interpret these market signals? Why is Asia FX Feeling the Heat? Several factors are contributing to the current weakness in Asia FX . The primary driver is the strengthening US dollar. When the dollar gains strength, it typically exerts downward pressure on other currencies, particularly those in emerging markets like many within Asia. This phenomenon is amplified by: Anticipation of Fed Rate Hike: The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain a hawkish stance on monetary policy, which could involve further interest rate hikes to combat inflation. Higher US interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors, increasing demand for the dollar and thus its value. BOJ Policy Uncertainty: While the Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy for a long time, there are growing expectations that they might consider adjusting their stance. Any hint of a shift in BOJ policy can create volatility in currency markets, and currently, the uncertainty seems to be favoring dollar strength over Asia FX . Global Economic Concerns: Broader global economic uncertainties, including concerns about slowing growth in major economies and geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to seek the safety of the US dollar. This ‘flight to safety’ further boosts Dollar Strength at the expense of other currencies, including those in Asia. Decoding Dollar Strength: What’s Driving the Greenback? The recent surge in Dollar Strength isn’t happening in isolation. It’s a confluence of factors painting a bullish picture for the US currency: Safe Haven Appeal: In times of global economic uncertainty, the US dollar is often perceived as a safe haven asset. Investors flock to the dollar when they become risk-averse, increasing demand and driving up its value. Interest Rate Differentials: As the Fed is expected to continue raising interest rates while other central banks might be less aggressive or even pausing, the interest rate differential favors the dollar. Higher interest rates in the US attract foreign investment, boosting Dollar Strength . US Economic Data: Relatively robust US economic data, particularly in areas like employment, provides further support for the dollar. Strong economic indicators reinforce the expectation of continued Fed tightening and overall positive sentiment around the US economy. Impact of Fed Rate Hike Expectations on Currency Markets The anticipation of a Fed Rate Hike is a major catalyst for current market movements. Here’s how it impacts currency markets, and specifically Asia FX : Impact Area Effect on Asia FX Effect on US Dollar Capital Flows Outflows from Asia FX as investors seek higher returns in dollar assets. Inflows into US dollar assets, increasing demand. Exchange Rates Depreciation of Asia FX currencies against the dollar. Appreciation of the US dollar against Asia FX. Borrowing Costs Increased borrowing costs for Asian economies with dollar-denominated debt. Potentially reduced borrowing costs in dollar terms, relatively. Inflation Imported inflation for Asian economies as goods priced in dollars become more expensive. Potential dampening of inflation in the US over time due to tighter monetary policy. BOJ Policy in Focus: Will They Shift Away from Ultra-Loose Stance? The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) upcoming policy decision adds another layer of complexity to the Forex landscape. For years, the BOJ has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, characterized by negative interest rates and massive asset purchases. However, rising inflation and global central bank tightening are putting pressure on the BOJ to consider a shift. Any indication that the BOJ might be contemplating a change in policy could have significant implications for Currency Markets and, in particular, pairings involving the Japanese Yen and Asia FX . Here are potential scenarios and their impact: Scenario 1: BOJ hints at policy normalization: If the BOJ signals a potential shift towards tightening, even subtly, the Japanese Yen could strengthen. This might offer some relief to Asia FX if the dollar’s rally pauses, but it could also create new dynamics in cross-currency pairs involving the Yen. Scenario 2: BOJ maintains ultra-loose policy: If the BOJ sticks to its current ultra-loose policy, it could further reinforce Dollar Strength . The contrast between a hawkish Fed and a dovish BOJ would likely widen interest rate differentials, making the dollar even more attractive. In this case, Asia FX could face further downward pressure. Scenario 3: BOJ surprise policy tweak: A surprise policy tweak from the BOJ, such as adjusting yield curve control or hinting at future rate hikes, could trigger significant volatility in Currency Markets . This could lead to a sharp strengthening of the Yen and potentially a broader reassessment of Dollar Strength . Actionable Insights for Navigating Currency Market Volatility In this environment of heightened uncertainty and potential volatility in Currency Markets , what actionable steps can traders and investors consider? Stay Informed: Closely monitor news and analysis related to the Fed and BOJ policy decisions. Pay attention to economic data releases and central bank communications, as these can provide clues about future policy direction. Diversify Currency Exposure: Avoid over-concentration in any single currency. Diversifying your currency holdings can help mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in specific currency pairs, including those within Asia FX . Manage Risk Prudently: Employ robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and using appropriate position sizing. Volatile Currency Markets can lead to rapid and unexpected price swings, making risk management crucial. Consider Hedging Strategies: For businesses and investors with significant exposure to Asia FX or dollar-denominated assets, consider using hedging strategies to protect against adverse currency movements. Currency forwards, options, and other derivatives can be used for hedging purposes. Seek Expert Advice: If you are unsure about how to navigate these complex market dynamics, consider seeking advice from financial professionals who specialize in Forex and currency markets. Conclusion: Navigating the Forex Crossroads The current landscape of Asia FX and the broader Forex market is shaped by the looming decisions of the Fed and BOJ. Dollar Strength is prevailing for now, fueled by expectations of continued Fed tightening and uncertainty surrounding BOJ policy. Staying informed, adapting to evolving market conditions, and employing prudent risk management are key to navigating this period of potential volatility. The coming days and weeks promise to be critical for understanding the near-term direction of Currency Markets and the fate of Asia FX in the face of global monetary policy shifts.

An in-principle approval indicates that Cumberland has met the first set of regulatory requirements for a payment services license. However, it still needs to meet several other conditions to obtain a full license. MAS retains the right to revoke approval if necessary. We are pleased to announce that Cumberland SG Pte. Ltd. has received in-principle approval for the Major Payment Institution (MPI) License from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). We look forward to expanding our presence in this important region, bringing our disciplined… pic.twitter.com/G14XvB4VVg — Cumberland (@CumberlandSays) March 18, 2025 After obtaining a full license, Cumberland will be able to offer institutional clients in Singapore a wider range of compliant digital asset services. According to the firm, the approval strengthens its presence in Singapore, which it considers a major financial hub for digital assets. Cumberland caters to institutional clients worldwide by offering market-making and liquidity services for a range of cryptocurrencies. The company is a division of DRW, a major player in both the traditional and digital asset markets, with its headquarters located in Chicago.

Coinbase, BitGo, and Anchorage are among the 29 companies that have secured digital payment token licenses from the MAS. In recent months, Gemini and OKX have also received approvals, reinforcing Singapore’s position as a rising hub for top regulated cryptocurrency firms. The announcement comes on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s move to dismiss its case against Cumberland on Mar. 4. The case was part of a larger regulatory crackdown in which the SEC accused the company of dealing in unregistered securities. Under the new, crypto-friendly SEC leadership , several investigations have also been dropped, including those against Consensys and Kraken. With progress in both Singapore and the U.S., Cumberland is making strides toward regulatory clarity as it expands its institutional digital asset services in key markets.

In a March 17 Form S-1 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the crypto investment firm requested to list the Canary SUI ETF, which didn’t include information on what exchange it would trade on or the proposed ticker symbol. The ETF would directly hold Sui ( SUI ), the native token of the layer-1 blockchain used for fees and staking, which is the 23rd largest cryptocurrency with a market value of around $7.36 billion, per CoinGekco. Sui is trading up 1.3% over the last day to $2.31 and has gained 7.3% over the week. It has, however, fallen 56.5% from its Jan. 5 all-time peak of $5.35. Sui’s price over the last 24 hours hit a high of $2.38 but has since slightly fallen. Source: CoinGekco Canary had registered a trust in Delaware on March 6 for the fund, and it must also file a Form 19b-4 with the SEC before the agency can consider whether to list it for trading. Canary’s Sui filing is its sixth crypto ETF bid with the SEC. In the past few months, it filed for ETFs tracking Solana ( SOL ), Litecoin ( LTC ), XRP ( XRP ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Axelar ( AXL ). The filing comes after Sui said on March 6 that it partnered with World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by US President Donald Trump. Part of the partnership saw World Liberty include the Sui token in its so-called “Macro Strategy” token reserve and explore further product opportunities together.

The SEC has delayed making decisions on multiple crypto ETF filings, but Commissioner Hester Peirce said last month that the agency would wait until the Senate confirms Trump’s pick to chair the SEC, Paul Atkins , before deciding on an agenda for crypto. A Senate confirmation hearing for Atkins is reportedly slated for March 27, having been delayed due to issues with financial disclosures.

The analyst highlighted similarities between the current ETH price action and that of 2020, following the COVID market crash. Ethereum On The Cusp Of Trend Reversal? Ethereum’s subdued price action may soon come to an end, as multiple analysts point toward a potential trend reversal for the second-largest cryptocurrency by reported market cap. Analyst Mister Crypto shared the following chart, outlining the similar chart patterns. In the chart, the analyst illustrates how ETH is currently forming a price pattern similar to what was observed during the COVID pandemic in 2020. At that time, ETH experienced a sharp trend reversal to the upside following the infamous March 2020 crash. Related Reading: Ethereum Gained 160% The Last Time This On-Chain Indicator Flashed – Will ETH Soar Again? Similarly, ETH may be preparing to resume bullish momentum after the recent Bybit exchange hack. For the uninitiated, the Bybit crypto exchange hack resulted in ETH worth $1.5 billion being stolen. Mister Crypto’s thoughts were echoed by fellow crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader. In a separate X post, the analyst stated that ETH is likely repeating its historical cycle, which typically sees capitulation before a massive run-up. In addition to the COVID crash, the analyst highlighted the Luna crash of 2022 as another instance when bearish sentiment surrounding ETH was at its peak. However, the digital asset quickly overcame the pessimism, going on to experience a massive 270% rally. Multiple Indicators Point Toward ETH Rally Beyond the bullish historical patterns, multiple indicators suggest a potential rally for ETH. In an X post, crypto analyst TraderPA remarked that Ethereum is currently oversold at its present price and that the weekly Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) is signaling a potential rebound. To explain, the weekly Stochastic RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the relative position of an asset’s current price within its recent price range over a week. When the fast line (blue) crosses above the slow line (orange) in the oversold zone, it signals potential upward momentum, indicating a buying opportunity. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly RSI Drops To Lowest Level Since May 2022 – More Selling Pressure Ahead? Furthermore, crypto analyst Decode highlighted the importance of Elliott Wave Theory in predicting ETH’s price momentum. The analyst explained: Sentiment on Ethereum is bearish beyond anything I have ever seen, so whilst lower targets are still available, it’s possible we’ve done enough at the 1.236 extension of C vs A to complete this wave 4. The eventual reversal will be the most hated rally ever seen in crypto. That said, rising ETH exchange reserves could delay any quick price recovery. At press time, ETH trades at $1,911, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

Altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) followed suit, sinking into the red. With the Market Fear & Greed Index stuck at 25 (Fear), it’s clear that uncertainty is ruling the game right now! However, amid the downtrend, investors have high hopes for ETFs as they expect good investment in the near term helping the market rebound. Meanwhile, Hashdex, a well-known asset manager, has filed an amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to expand its cryptocurrency index exchange-traded fund (ETF). The updated proposal aims to include seven altcoins—Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI)—alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This is the biggest amendment so far and gives hope to the shaking altcoin market. A Push for Diversified Crypto Exposure Launched in February 2024, the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF currently tracks only Bitcoin and Ethereum . The latest filing signals a shift toward a broader investment strategy, aligning with the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), which includes multiple digital assets rather than just the top two by market capitalization. This move is significant because previous filings hinted at expanding the ETF’s asset mix but never named specific altcoins until now. Hashdex has not given a timeline for the change, as it still needs approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Rising Interest in Multi-Asset Crypto ETFs Regulatory shifts may speed up ETF approvals. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President recently directed federal regulators to take a more relaxed approach to digital assets. This could make it easier for Hashdex to secure approval for its expanded ETF. Industry experts see multi-asset ETFs as the next big step in making crypto more accessible to mainstream investors. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store sees this as a potential game-changer, as it would allow firms to introduce multiple share classes within a single ETF, improving efficiency and expanding investment options. Other major players, like Grayscale , are also working on expanding their ETF offerings. Grayscale has proposed converting its Digital Large Cap Fund—comprising BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP—into an ETF, which could bring another multi-asset investment vehicle to the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Canary Capital Files for SUI ETF, SUI token Jump by 8% , Regulatory Uncertainty Remains The SEC has been flooded with crypto ETF proposals this year, including those featuring staking mechanisms and in-kind redemptions.

The law firm alleged that Kelsier, KIP, Meteora, and related parties set up an unfair token launch of LIBRA. The law firm believes that the accused parties allegedly misled purchasers and harmed retail investors through their unfair LIBRA launch. The firm noted that this pattern was similar to many of the other tokens launched by the Defendants. The lawsuit noted that the Defendants gained at the cost of participants through misleading marketing tactics and a failure to disclose material facts that would have raised concerns about the project’s viability. Burwick Law files complaint against Kelsier, KIP, and Meteora Tonight, our firm filed a class action complaint in the Supreme Court of New York on behalf of our client. We allege that Kelsier, KIP, Meteora, and related parties orchestrated an unfair token launch ($LIBRA), allegedly misleading purchasers and harming retail investors. pic.twitter.com/H7dD2LaARK — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) March 18, 2025 Burwick Law firm filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of New York on behalf of its client. The firm acknowledged that the plaintiff’s information was based on their counsel’s investigation, which included reviewing and analysing press releases, news articles, websites, state corporate filings, and other publicly available information regarding the LIBRA token. The law firm alleged that Kelsier Ventures, Meteora, and KIP Protocol orchestrated a deceptive, manipulative, and fundamentally unfair launch of the LIBRA token. The firm believes that the Defendants promoted the digital asset as a meaningful economic initiative designed to boost economic growth in Argentina by funding small businesses and startups. LIBRA’s official website read in part “ In honor of Javier Milei’s libertarian ideas, we are launching $LIBRA Token, designed to strengthen the Argentine economy from the ground up by supporting entrepreneurship and innovation.” The token’s promotional efforts leveraged the endorsement of Argentina’s President, Javier Milei, which created the appearance of legitimacy and significant investment value for the token. The law firm noted that purchasers didn’t know the Defendants had implemented an unfair and manipulative token distribution strategy utilizing liquidity pools on the Meteora decentralized exchange platform. Defendants leverage a single-sided liquidity model Burwick Law firm alleged that the Defendants employed a single-sided liquidity model unlike typical decentralized finance structures, which rely on genuine two-sided liquidity. Two-sided liquidity often pairs tokens like LIBRA with stable assets such as USDC or SOL. The law firm highlighted that the single-sided liquidity model inflated the price of LIBRA and created an illusion of market stability and value where none truly existed. The complaint also indicated that the Defendants artificially controlled the token’s price and manipulated market dynamics by structuring the liquidity pools exclusively with LIBRA tokens. The firm acknowledged that the defendants strategically withheld roughly 85% of the token’s total supply at launch, which directly maintained exclusive control over the token’s valuation and liquidity. Burwick Law also alleged that the Defendants were able to discretely extract stable assets such as USDC and SOL from retail purchasers once trading commenced. The lawsuit noted that the Defendant’s insiders rapidly siphoned around $107 million from the liquidity pools within hours, which caused an immediate 94% collapse in the token’s market valuation. The law firm also accused the Defendants of failure to disclose critical material facts to purchasers about the LIBRA token. Defendants didn’t inform potential purchasers about the true liquidity structures, insider control of token supply, and deliberate mechanisms allowing insiders to monetise token holdings secretly. Burwick Law firm alleged that the Defendants instead created a misleading narrative that promoted LIBRA as a legitimate product intended to support economic growth in Argentina. The lawsuit highlighted that Meteora was involved in both the technology and market management aspects of the token’s launch. It directly enabled and supported the insider trading mechanism that caused significant harm to the retail investor class. The law firm said the Plaintiff and the Class suffered financial losses due to the Defendants’ deceptive and fraudulent conduct. Burwick Law firm noted that the plaintiff was seeking compensatory and punitive damages and disgorgement of the Defendants’ unjustly obtained profits. The plaintiff was also seeking injunctive relief to prevent further fraudulent token offerings and the appointment of a receiver to protect the public and secure remaining investor assets.

In a significant development, New York-based litigation powerhouse Burwick Law has officially filed a class action lawsuit. This legal action, lodged in the New York Supreme Court, targets key entities allegedly associated with the LIBRA memecoin. Is this a crucial turning point for memecoin projects and investor protection? Let’s dive into the details of this unfolding situation. What Sparked the LIBRA Memecoin Lawsuit? According to a report by Cointelegraph, which broke the news on X (formerly Twitter), Burwick Law’s complaint centers around the launch and subsequent handling of the LIBRA token. The lawsuit names several defendants, including Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol, and Meteora. The core allegation is that these entities orchestrated a token launch that was fundamentally unfair and misleading to purchasers, ultimately causing financial harm to retail investors . Here’s a breakdown of the key accusations: Unfair Token Launch: The lawsuit claims the token launch was structured in a way that disadvantaged ordinary investors, potentially favoring insiders or specific groups. Misleading Purchasers: Accusations of deceptive practices and misrepresentations made to investors to entice them to purchase LIBRA tokens. Harm to Retail Investors: The core of the complaint is the financial losses suffered by individual, non-institutional investors as a result of the alleged misconduct. The legal action underscores the growing scrutiny and potential liabilities surrounding memecoin projects, particularly concerning their launch mechanisms and investor communications. Who are the Key Players in this Class Action Lawsuit? Understanding the parties involved is crucial to grasping the lawsuit’s scope. Let’s examine the defendants named in the class action lawsuit : Burwick Law: The plaintiff firm, specializing in complex litigation and representing the class of affected investors. Their involvement signals a serious legal challenge. Kelsier Ventures: Described as a defendant, suggesting they played a role in the LIBRA project’s development or launch. Their exact involvement will be a point of investigation. KIP Protocol: Another named defendant, KIP Protocol’s connection to the LIBRA memecoin project and the alleged misconduct is yet to be fully detailed in public reports. Meteora: Completing the list of defendants, Meteora’s role and responsibilities concerning the token launch and investor relations are under scrutiny as part of this legal process. It’s important to note that these are allegations at this stage, and the defendants will have the opportunity to respond and defend themselves in court. The lawsuit is just the beginning of a potentially lengthy legal battle. Why is Investor Protection a Central Theme in Cryptocurrency? This cryptocurrency lawsuit highlights a persistent and critical issue within the digital asset space: investor protection. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, especially memecoins, combined with often opaque project structures, creates a risky environment for investors, particularly those new to the market. Here’s why investor protection is paramount: Aspect Importance for Investor Protection Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Investors need clear information and fair practices to make informed decisions and manage risk. Information Asymmetry Project teams often possess significantly more information than retail investors. Fair disclosure and transparency are vital to level the playing field. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. This uncertainty can be exploited, making legal recourse like class action lawsuits crucial for accountability. Memecoin Risks Memecoins, often driven by hype and social media sentiment, carry even higher risks. Robust investor protection mechanisms are essential to prevent scams and unfair practices. The LIBRA memecoin lawsuit serves as a stark reminder of the need for greater accountability and safeguards within the crypto industry to protect retail investors from potentially harmful projects and practices. What are the Potential Implications of the LIBRA Memecoin Lawsuit? The outcome of this lawsuit could set significant precedents for the memecoin market and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Several potential implications are worth considering: Increased Scrutiny of Token Launches: The case could lead to heightened regulatory and legal scrutiny of how new cryptocurrency tokens are launched, especially memecoins. Precedent for Class Action Lawsuits: A successful outcome for the plaintiffs could empower other investors to pursue class action lawsuits against projects they believe have acted unfairly or deceptively. Impact on Memecoin Market Sentiment: The lawsuit and its media coverage could dampen enthusiasm for memecoins, at least temporarily, as investors become more cautious. Focus on Disclosure and Transparency: Projects might be compelled to adopt more transparent and comprehensive disclosure practices to mitigate legal risks and build investor trust. Regulatory Attention: The case could further fuel the ongoing debate about cryptocurrency regulation and potentially accelerate the development of clearer rules and guidelines. The legal proceedings will be closely watched by the crypto community, legal experts, and regulators alike, as they could shape the future landscape of digital asset investments. Staying Informed About the LIBRA Memecoin Lawsuit and Cryptocurrency Developments The Burwick Law LIBRA memecoin lawsuit is a developing story, and it’s crucial to stay informed about updates and legal proceedings. Here are some actionable insights for staying on top of this and other cryptocurrency news: Follow Reputable Crypto News Sources: Rely on established news outlets like Cointelegraph, and other reputable sources for accurate and timely updates. Monitor Legal News Outlets: Keep an eye on legal news websites and publications for analysis of the lawsuit and its potential legal ramifications. Engage in Crypto Communities Cautiously: While online crypto communities can offer insights, always verify information and be wary of biased opinions. Seek Professional Financial Advice: If you’re considering investing in cryptocurrencies, especially memecoins, consult with a qualified financial advisor to understand the risks involved. The LIBRA memecoin lawsuit is a stark reminder of the inherent risks and complexities within the cryptocurrency market. Staying informed and exercising caution are paramount for navigating this evolving landscape. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Memecoin Market? The class action lawsuit against the LIBRA memecoin project is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a potential watershed moment for the memecoin market and the broader cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the critical need for investor protection, transparent token launches, and responsible project management. As the legal proceedings unfold, the crypto world will be watching closely to see what precedents are set and what lessons are learned. This case serves as a powerful reminder that in the exciting but often volatile world of cryptocurrency, due diligence, informed decision-making, and a healthy dose of skepticism are essential for all participants.

Microsoft’s Incident Response Team said in a March 17 blog post that it first discovered the malware StilachiRAT last November and found it can steal information such as credentials stored in the browser, digital wallet information and data stored in the clipboard. After deployment, the bad actors can use StilachiRAT to siphon crypto wallet data by scanning for the configuration information for 20 crypto wallet extensions, including Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, MetaMask and OKX Wallet. The malware StilachiRAT can target crypto held in 20 different wallet extensions. Source: Microsoft “Analysis of the StilachiRAT’s WWStartupCtrl64.dll module that contains the RAT capabilities revealed the use of various methods to steal information from the target system,” Microsoft said. Among its other capabilities, the malware can extract credentials saved in the Google Chrome local state file and monitor clipboard activity for sensitive information like passwords and crypto keys . It can also use detection evasion and anti-forensics features, like the ability to clear event logs and check for signs it’s running in a sandbox to block analysis attempts, according to Microsoft. At the moment, the tech giant says it can’t pinpoint who is behind the malware but hopes that publicly sharing information will lower the number of people who might be snared. Related: New MassJacker malware targets piracy users, steals crypto “Based on Microsoft’s current visibility, the malware does not exhibit widespread distribution at this time,” Microsoft said. “However, due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor, analyze, and report on the evolving threat landscape.” Microsoft suggests to avoid falling prey to malware; users should have antivirus software, cloud-based anti-phishing and anti-malware components on their devices. Losses to crypto scams, exploits and hacks totaled nearly $1.53 billion in February , with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack accounting for the lion’s share of losses, according to blockchain security firm CertiK.

This strategic appointment arrives amidst swirling rumors of a potential Initial Public Offering (IPO) for Gemini, adding fuel to the fire of anticipation within the crypto community. Is this the definitive step towards Gemini going public? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. Why Gemini’s CFO Hire is a Game Changer for Crypto IPO Aspirations The appointment of Dan Chen is not just another corporate shuffle; it’s a calculated maneuver that speaks volumes about Gemini’s future trajectory. Chen brings a wealth of experience from traditional finance powerhouses like Morgan Stanley and MetLife Investments. His background is deeply rooted in managing complex financial operations and navigating the intricacies of established financial markets. Here’s why this is significant for Gemini and the broader crypto landscape: Traditional Finance Expertise: Chen’s pedigree from Morgan Stanley injects a dose of traditional financial rigor into Gemini’s leadership. This is crucial as crypto firms increasingly seek legitimacy and acceptance from mainstream investors. IPO Readiness: Hiring a CFO with IPO experience, especially from a firm like Morgan Stanley known for its IPO prowess, strongly suggests Gemini is serious about going public. Chen’s expertise will be invaluable in preparing Gemini for the scrutiny and compliance demands of an IPO. Investor Confidence: A CFO from a reputable institution like Morgan Stanley can significantly boost investor confidence. It signals to both institutional and retail investors that Gemini is maturing and adopting best practices in financial management. Strategic Financial Planning: Beyond IPOs, a seasoned CFO is essential for strategic financial planning, managing growth, and ensuring long-term financial health. Chen’s role will be pivotal in steering Gemini through the volatile crypto market and positioning it for sustained success. Decoding the Crypto IPO Buzz: Is Gemini Next? Bloomberg’s report on Gemini considering an crypto IPO has ignited intense speculation. While Gemini has not officially confirmed these plans, the timing of Chen’s appointment is hard to ignore. An IPO would mark a significant milestone for Gemini and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Let’s consider what an IPO could mean for Gemini: Potential Benefits of a Gemini IPO Potential Challenges of a Gemini IPO Capital Infusion: An IPO could raise substantial capital for Gemini to fuel expansion, innovation, and acquisitions. Enhanced Credibility: Public listing would enhance Gemini’s credibility and transparency, attracting a broader range of investors. Liquidity for Early Investors: An IPO provides liquidity for early investors and employees holding equity. Brand Recognition: Going public can significantly boost brand recognition and market presence. Regulatory Scrutiny: Public companies face intense regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements. Market Volatility: Crypto market volatility can impact stock price and investor confidence post-IPO. Short-Term Pressure: Public companies are subject to quarterly earnings pressure, potentially hindering long-term strategic decisions. Compliance Costs: Maintaining public company compliance is expensive and resource-intensive. Morgan Stanley Executive to Crypto CFO: A Growing Trend? Dan Chen’s move from Morgan Stanley executive to Gemini CFO is part of a broader trend of traditional finance professionals migrating to the cryptocurrency sector. This influx of talent underscores the increasing maturity and institutionalization of the crypto market. Why are we seeing this shift? Crypto’s Growth Potential: Traditional finance professionals recognize the immense growth potential of the cryptocurrency industry and are seeking opportunities in this burgeoning space. Innovation and Disruption: The crypto sector is at the forefront of financial innovation and disruption, attracting individuals who want to be part of cutting-edge developments. Higher Compensation and Equity: Crypto companies often offer competitive compensation packages, including equity, which can be highly lucrative, especially in rapidly growing firms. Desire for Change: Some professionals are seeking a change from the traditional, often rigid structures of established financial institutions and are drawn to the more dynamic and entrepreneurial environment of crypto companies. What Does This Mean for the Cryptocurrency Exchange Landscape? Gemini’s strategic hire of a seasoned cryptocurrency exchange CFO and potential IPO aspirations could have ripple effects across the industry. It could: Set a Precedent: Gemini potentially going public could pave the way for other major crypto exchanges to follow suit, further legitimizing the industry. Increase Competition: A publicly traded Gemini could become an even more formidable competitor, intensifying competition among crypto exchanges. Attract Institutional Investment: Publicly listed crypto exchanges could attract more significant institutional investment, driving further market growth. Drive Regulatory Clarity: The process of going public may necessitate and encourage greater regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For crypto enthusiasts and investors, here are some actionable insights to consider: Monitor Gemini’s IPO Developments: Keep a close eye on any official announcements from Gemini regarding their IPO plans. This could be a significant event for the crypto market. Analyze Gemini’s Financial Performance: As Gemini moves towards potential public listing, pay attention to their financial reports and performance metrics. Observe Industry Trends: Track the broader trend of traditional finance executives moving to crypto and the potential for more crypto IPOs. Consider Investment Opportunities: If Gemini goes public, evaluate it as a potential investment opportunity, considering both the risks and rewards of the crypto market. Conclusion: Gemini’s Bold Move Sets the Stage for a Thrilling Chapter Gemini’s appointment of Dan Chen as CFO is a powerful signal of its ambitions and maturity. Coupled with the whispers of a potential IPO, it paints a picture of a company poised for significant growth and mainstream integration. This move not only strengthens Gemini’s leadership but also underscores the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency industry, where traditional finance expertise and digital asset innovation are increasingly converging.

According to a report from Unchained, the proposal had struggled to reach the required 33.4% quorum for most of the voting period. However, in the final hours, a sudden influx of 3.35 billion Cronos ( CRO ) votes pushed it past the threshold, securing a 61.18% approval. The proposal in question was aimed at creating a Cronos Strategic Reserve by effectively reversing a 2021 token burn that was meant to remove the same number of tokens from circulation permanently Crypto.com argued that reinstating these tokens would support the long-term growth of the Cronos ecosystem and help fund initiatives like AI-driven applications and a potential CRO-based exchange-traded fund. The newly minted CRO will be placed in an escrow wallet and released over a five-year vesting schedule. The reserve will reportedly follow strict controls, including adjustments to CRO’s emission parameters to prevent inflation from affecting validator rewards. Critics have argued that reviving previously burned tokens undermines trust and raises concerns about Cronos’ decentralization. (See below.) https://twitter.com/Wyll_BBK/status/1896452917722296775 Another community member slammed the decision, calling it proof that Cronos operates as a centralized entity. They argued that only Crypto.com’s core team would back such a move. You might also like: Crypto.com joins CF Benchmarks, enhancing Bitcoin and Ethereum indices Most independent validators opposed the plan, but Crypto.com’s own validators, including Starship, Falcon Heavy, Electron, Antares, and Minotaur IV, ultimately tipped the scales in its favor. According to Unchained, until Mar. 10, only two of the company’s validators, Starship and Falcon Heavy, had backed the proposal. By the time voting closed, they were joined by three more Crypto.com-run validators—Electron, Antares, and Minotaur IV. While a few independent validators, including Cosmostation and Polkachu.com, also voted in support, their influence was minimal compared to Crypto.com’s internal votes. One large CRO holder told Unchained they were concerned that Crypto.com’s last-minute votes set a precedent where projects with enough validator control could push decisions through despite opposition. With the proposal now approved, the Cronos blockchain is set to undergo an upgrade that will officially mint the 70 billion tokens. However, frustration among CRO holders remains high, with some calling the decision a betrayal of the original burn commitment. Further, on the same day voting ended, Crypto.com introduced a proposal to burn 50 million CRO, which is just 0.07% of the newly minted supply. The move drew further criticism, with a CRO validator calling it a “spit in all CRO holders’ faces.” Meanwhile, CRO has been on a downward trend since the vote passed, sliding over 3% to $0.08 at the time of writing. crypto.news reached out to Crypto.com for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

According to the lawsuit filed on Mar. 18, the token’s developers secretly manipulated liquidity to defraud retail traders of millions of dollars while misleading investors with false promises. LIBRA was marketed as an initiative to boost Argentina’s economy, even getting President Javier Milei’s support. However, the token’s developers allegedly inflated prices using a one-sided liquidity pool rather than a fair launch. Tonight, our firm filed a class action complaint in the Supreme Court of New York on behalf of our client. We allege that Kelsier, KIP, Meteora, and related parties orchestrated an unfair token launch ($LIBRA), allegedly misleading purchasers and harming retail investors. pic.twitter.com/H7dD2LaARK — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) March 18, 2025 To maintain control over the token’s value, they withheld 85% of its supply. Insiders allegedly withdrew $107 million when trading began, resulting in a 94% price collapse. Court documents claim this allowed insiders to “discreetly and systematically extract stable assets” from unsuspecting buyers.

In a similar development, on Mar. 12, Argentine attorney Gregorio Dalbón requested an Interpol Red Notice for Hayden Davis, the CEO of Kelsier, claiming that his wealth would allow him to escape. A Red Notice is essentially an Interpol alert requesting global law enforcement to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition. The LIBRA token launched on Solana ( SOL ) in Feb. 14 and quickly reached a $4.4 billion market cap before crashing, wiping out over $280 million in value across nearly 75,000 traders. Dubbed “Cryptogate,” the controversy has given rise to multiple allegations of insider trading and market manipulation. According to a Mar. 14 report by Crypto.news, insiders such as Kelsier Ventures were able to access LIBRA tokens before the public launch, making more than $100 million through early trades and liquidity provision. Beyond legal action, the Libra memecoin scandal has garnered political attention. Opposition politicians in Argentina have called for Milei’s impeachment, citing allegations of fraud.

The flagship coin has been attempting to regain bullish sentiment after being trapped in a bearish outlook since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President which turned out to be a classic sell-the-news event. The crowd’s fear of Bitcoin’s potential dip below $80k again is still evident as the BTC fear and greed index hovers around 34 percent. However, the lack of major FUD in the market could rekindle hope for a bullish rebound toward price discovery soon. Bitcoin Whales Arises Amid Gold Rush As the United States continues with its tariff war policy, more investors have been rushing to take refuge in the gold market. Consequently, gold price has rallied around 4 percent in the last five days to hit its all-time high (ATH) of about $3,017 per ounce on Tuesday, March 18, during the early European session. With Bitcoin regarded as the digital gold by top central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, institutional investors have begun re-accumulating. According to market data from Intotheblock , Bitcoin transactions greater than $100k have increased from 6,332 txs on March 16 to about 9,291 txs on Tuesday, March 18. After five weeks of conservative cash outflows, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs might end the losing streak. On Monday, none of the U.S. spot BTC ETF issuers recorded a net cash outflow. Fidelity’s FBTC led in a cash inflow of about $127 million, thus the net cash inflow was about $274 million. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Bull Market Over, CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Bearish Trend for Next 6–12 Months , Midterm Targets From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin price is attempting to shift its momentum to follow gold price action.

According to a recent notice , the Tokyo-based investment firm is issuing ¥2 billion to EVO FUND, based on a decision made at the company’s board of directors meeting. This marks the ninth issuance of ordinary bonds by the Japanese firm overall. In a Mar. 18 regulatory filing, it is stated that the funds gained from the ordinary bonds issuance will be used to purchase more Bitcoin ( BTC ). This decision is in line with the firm’s ongoing strategy to grow its BTC holdings as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in Asia. The bonds carry no interest and can be redeemed in full on Sept. 17, at ¥100 per ¥100 of the bonds’ face value. However, EVO FUND is granted the option to redeem the bonds before the redemption date by providing a written notice to Metaplanet at least one business day before the desired date. Early redemption can be made for all or part of the outstanding bonds.

The bond issuance will be fully allocated to EVO FUND, with no guarantee or collateral attached to the bonds. Despite the bond issuance, Metaplanet’s shares dipped by nearly 0.5% to a price of ¥4,030, according to Google Finance . Earlier on Feb. 27, Metaplanet also issued ordinary bonds to EVO FUND at the same amount of ¥2 billion, which were worth $13.6 million at the time. The investment firm declared that the funds would be used to purchase more Bitcoin. Since April 2024, Metaplanet has been gradually acquiring more BTC after it launched its own Bitcoin Treasury Operations. Most recently on March 12, the firm purchased 162 BTC, which brought its total holdings to 3,050 BTC or equal to over $251 million at current market prices.

The operation, led by Spain’s National Police Corps (CNP) , resulted in the arrest of eight individuals across multiple cities, including Malaga, Madrid, and Meria. The group, consisting of various professionals such as marketing experts and web designers, ran a complex operation that promoted fake Bitcoin investment plans to unsuspecting individuals, many of whom had no prior knowledge of cryptocurrencies. The scam operators made it simple for victims to convert large sums of money, often hundreds or thousands of euros, into Bitcoin. Some victims were even manipulated into surrendering control of their electronic devices, enabling the scammers to perform crypto transfers and steal personal and banking information. Growing Threat of Scams The police first learned of the scheme in 2022 when a victim filed a complaint in Murcia, and the investigation revealed a fraudulent network in which new investors’ funds were used to pay older investors, a typical characteristic of a pyramid scheme. The CNP found that the scammers had promised unrealistic returns of 40% after one month and up to 300% after a year. Investigators discovered substantial Bitcoin holdings in the criminals’ wallets, as well as a worthless token they issued to investors. The scam affected victims across 36 countries, with the majority of the victims residing in Spain. In response, the authorities froze 73 bank accounts, seized vehicles, and impounded cash and computer equipment. The operation serves as a reminder of the risks of unregulated crypto investments and the growing threat of scams in the industry.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-18 07:25:02

Despite the buzz around the coin, the crypto has recorded significant losses lately, especially due to a lack of major announcements and updates regarding the token. Amid this, a Pi Coin enthusiast has revealed key reasons that might have triggered the recent selloff in the market. Pi Network Price Slips 17% Pi Network was one of the top laggards in the crypto market today, sparking concerns among traders. Pi Coin value was down more than 17% and exchanged hands at $1.16, while its one-day trading volume rose 54% to $551 million. Notably, the latest loss comes as a huge Pi token unlock looms . For context, the unlock eventually increases the supply, causing pressure on the price. Besides, it has dampened the traders’ sentiment, resulting in the recent decline in the value. Pi Coin Faces Major Selloff Amid Investor Concerns Pi Coin’s recent price plunge has left many investors questioning the project’s long-term viability. Enthusiasts note that the drop directly correlates with declining public sentiment. One of the key triggers was Pi’s failure to secure a Binance listing, despite 86% of its community voting in favor. This rejection has shaken investor confidence, further pressuring the token. Adding to the concerns, the Pi Core Team failed to deliver any groundbreaking updates on Pi Day, a crucial event for the community. Many early miners, who have supported the project for years, are now openly criticizing the team for the lack of visible progress. With the project in development for six years, frustrations are mounting as expectations remain unfulfilled. Lack of Development Roadmap Raises Red Flags A major complaint among Pi Coin investors is the absence of a clear roadmap for the Open Mainnet launch. Unlike other crypto projects that provide transparent timelines, Pi Network has remained vague about its future developments. This uncertainty has led to growing skepticism, with some fearing that the project may never reach full decentralization. In a recent social media post, Pi enthusiast Dr Altcoin pointed out that the crypto’s ranking has fallen to #13, with its price dropping below $1.30. He emphasized that the declining value reflects the community’s disappointment in the project’s progress. Without a roadmap, investors remain hesitant, leading to increased sell-offs. Community Demands Transparency & Progress The Pi Network community is calling for immediate action from the core team. Investors believe that for Pi Network price to regain momentum, the team must address the lack of trust by: Releasing a clear Open Mainnet roadmap. Launching the long-awaited 100 decentralized applications (DApps). Disclosing key investors and partnerships. According to Dr Altcoin, these steps are crucial in restoring faith in the project and preventing further price declines. Without transparency and real progress, Pi Coin risks losing more support. However, a recent Pi price analysis hints at a 3X rally if Binance lists the token on its platform.

While DOGE remains a household name in crypto, many investors are shifting focus to new high-upside opportunities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project shows strong performance growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector through its dual-lending model innovation. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $3.9 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 6100 investors while simultaneously raising funds. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback. MUTM could hit $3 to deliver 50x returns much like DOGE did in its early days. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 6100 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $3.9 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $2 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) dominance may be fading as its price stabilizes around $0.17, leading investors to explore high-upside alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With $3.9 million raised and over 6,100 investors onboard, MUTM’s dual-lending model is driving strong growth. The next presale phase will push its price to $0.025, with early investors eyeing 200% returns. Analysts predict a surge past $2, positioning it as the next potential 50x crypto. As Mutuum Finance enhances DeFi lending and prepares for a CertiK audit, now is the time to invest, secure your share before prices rise.

Bitcoin Miner Exchange Netflow Has Been Seeing Positive Spikes In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author IT Tech has discussed about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow vs. Exchange To Miner Flow metric. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the netflow happening between miner-associated wallets and centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the miners are depositing a net number of tokens to these platforms. Generally, these chain validators transfer to the exchanges whenever they want to sell, so this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resets With 14% Deleveraging—Here’s What Past Events Led To On the other hand, the indicator having a negative value implies the the miner exchange outflows are outweighing the miner exchange inflows. Such a trend suggests this cohort may be accumulating, which can naturally be bullish for BTC. Now, here is the chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow vs. Exchange To Miner Flow over the last year: As displayed in the above graph, the indicator has been registering significant positive values since the bull rally from the last couple of months of 2024, implying miners have been depositing big to these platforms. The metric has also been flagging some net outflows during this period, but the scale of them has been significantly lesser compared to the net inflows. Given that the deposits started when the rally began, it would appear likely that the motivation behind them was for profit-taking purposes. Recently, though, bullish momentum has seen a cooldown and BTC’s price has declined, but the miner inflows have nonetheless continued. It’s possible that this group is now just panic selling, in fear of a bear market. Miners are entities that regularly participate in distribution, due to the fact that they have constant running costs in the form of electricity bills that they have to pay off somehow. Usually, this selling isn’t of a scale that can’t be absorbed by the market, so Bitcoin doesn’t tend to be affected much by it. In the periods where miner selling is significant, however, BTC can indeed suffer from a bearish setback. Compared to during the rally last year, miner inflows are currently lower, but are of a notable level nonetheless. “If miner selling accelerates, it could introduce short-term volatility into the market,” notes the analyst.

This Data Suggests Otherwise, Analytics Firm Says It now remains to be seen what the Bitcoin miners would do next and whether their potential selling would have any influence on the asset or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $83,400, up almost 6% in the last seven days.

41850042,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140887,1742283056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking $5 Million Seed Investment Ignites Opinion Labs’ Prediction Market Revolution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/opinion-labs-seed-investment/,"Exciting news is making waves in the crypto sphere! Opinion Labs, a platform focused on blockchain-based prediction markets, has just announced a significant milestone in its journey. They’ve successfully closed a $5 million seed funding round, setting the stage for accelerated growth and innovation in the decentralized prediction space. Let’s dive into what this seed investment means for Opinion Labs and the broader crypto ecosystem. What’s the Buzz About Opinion Labs’ Seed Investment? The announcement, made via X (formerly Twitter), reveals that this crucial seed investment round was spearheaded by YZi Labs, previously known as Binance Labs, a prominent player in the crypto venture capital world. This leadership from YZi Labs signals strong confidence in Opinion Labs’ vision and potential. But they weren’t alone. A robust consortium of investors also participated, including: Echo, a crypto angel investment platform known for backing promising early-stage projects. Animoca Ventures, a powerhouse in the blockchain gaming and NFT space, bringing expertise in digital collectibles and decentralized entertainment. Manifold, an NFT issuance platform, suggesting potential integrations with NFTs within Opinion Labs’ platform. Amber Group, a global digital asset platform, indicating strategic partnerships and market access. This diverse and influential group of investors underscores the broad appeal and potential of Opinion Labs within various sectors of the crypto industry. While the specific use of the funds wasn’t explicitly detailed in the announcement, it’s safe to assume this capital injection will fuel key areas like platform development, team expansion, marketing initiatives, and strategic partnerships. Why Prediction Markets and Why Now? Prediction markets , at their core, are exchange-traded markets where participants can trade contracts that pay out based on the outcome of future events. Think of it as placing bets, but in a more structured and transparent environment, often leveraging blockchain technology for decentralization and security. Why are prediction markets gaining traction now, especially within the crypto space? Decentralization and Transparency: Blockchain technology enables prediction markets to operate without central intermediaries, fostering greater transparency and reducing the risk of manipulation. Information Aggregation: Prediction markets are powerful tools for aggregating information and gauging public sentiment on future events. The collective wisdom of the crowd can often be surprisingly accurate. Hedging and Risk Management: Businesses and individuals can utilize prediction markets to hedge against future uncertainties and manage risks across various domains. Engagement and Gamification: The inherently engaging nature of prediction markets, combined with crypto incentives, can drive user participation and create vibrant communities. Data-Driven Insights: The data generated by prediction markets offers valuable insights into market sentiment, potential trends, and future outcomes, applicable across various industries. Opinion Labs is positioning itself to capitalize on these growing trends, building a platform that leverages the strengths of blockchain to create a robust and user-friendly prediction markets ecosystem. YZi Labs Leading the Charge: What Does it Mean for Opinion Labs? Having YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs) lead this seed investment round is a significant vote of confidence for Opinion Labs. YZi Labs has a track record of identifying and supporting promising blockchain projects that go on to become industry leaders. Their involvement brings more than just capital; it offers: Benefit Description Industry Expertise YZi Labs brings deep knowledge of the crypto market, tokenomics, and blockchain technology, guiding Opinion Labs strategically. Network and Connections Access to YZi Labs’ extensive network of partners, exchanges, and industry players, opening doors for collaborations and growth. Reputation and Credibility YZi Labs’ backing enhances Opinion Labs’ credibility and visibility within the crypto community, attracting users and partners. Strategic Guidance YZi Labs can provide valuable insights and mentorship on navigating the complexities of the crypto landscape and scaling a blockchain platform. This strategic partnership with YZi Labs, coupled with the support of other notable investors, positions Opinion Labs for accelerated growth and strengthens its potential to become a leading platform in the decentralized prediction market space. Unlocking Blockchain Innovation in Prediction Markets The blockchain innovation that Opinion Labs is bringing to prediction markets is crucial for several reasons. Traditional prediction markets often face challenges related to: Lack of Transparency: Opaque platforms can lead to concerns about fairness and potential manipulation. Centralization Risks: Centralized operators can be single points of failure and control user funds and data. High Fees and Inefficiencies: Traditional systems can involve intermediaries, leading to higher fees and slower transaction times. Limited Accessibility: Geographic restrictions and regulatory hurdles can limit participation in traditional prediction markets. Blockchain technology addresses these challenges by offering: Transparency and Auditability: All transactions and market outcomes are recorded on a public ledger, ensuring transparency and auditability. Decentralization and Security: Smart contracts and decentralized infrastructure eliminate central points of failure and enhance security. Lower Fees and Faster Transactions: Blockchain can streamline processes and reduce reliance on intermediaries, lowering fees and speeding up transactions. Global Accessibility: Decentralized platforms can be accessible to a global audience, removing geographical barriers. Opinion Labs is leveraging this blockchain innovation to build a platform that is more transparent, secure, efficient, and accessible, potentially democratizing access to prediction markets and unlocking their full potential. Crypto Funding Fuels the Future of Decentralized Predictions This successful crypto funding round for Opinion Labs highlights the continued investor interest in innovative blockchain applications. Despite market fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties, venture capital continues to flow into projects that demonstrate strong potential and address real-world needs within the crypto ecosystem. Crypto funding like this is essential for: Driving Innovation: Capital injection allows projects like Opinion Labs to invest in research and development, pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Scaling Growth: Funding enables startups to expand their teams, infrastructure, and marketing efforts, accelerating user adoption and platform growth. Building Robust Ecosystems: Financial resources empower projects to build comprehensive ecosystems, including partnerships, integrations, and community engagement initiatives. Fostering Competition: Increased funding in the crypto space fosters healthy competition, driving innovation and pushing projects to deliver greater value to users. The $5 million raised by Opinion Labs is a testament to the ongoing dynamism of the crypto funding landscape and the belief in the transformative potential of blockchain-based prediction markets. What’s Next for Opinion Labs? While the official announcement didn’t detail the specific roadmap for the funds, we can anticipate that Opinion Labs will focus on several key areas: Platform Development: Enhancing the platform’s features, user interface, and scalability to accommodate growing user demand. Team Expansion: Bringing in more talent across engineering, marketing, and business development to accelerate growth. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with other projects and platforms within the crypto ecosystem to expand reach and functionality. Community Building: Focusing on community engagement and building a vibrant ecosystem around the Opinion Labs platform. Marketing and Awareness: Increasing brand visibility and attracting users to the platform through targeted marketing campaigns. The future looks bright for Opinion Labs. With strong investor backing, a compelling vision, and the growing interest in decentralized prediction markets, they are well-positioned to make a significant impact in the crypto space. Keep an eye on this project as they continue to build and innovate! In Conclusion: A Strategic Leap Forward Opinion Labs securing a $5 million seed investment , led by YZi Labs, is more than just a funding announcement; it’s a strategic leap forward for the platform and a strong indicator of the growing potential of blockchain-based prediction markets. With a solid foundation of investors, a clear vision, and the power of blockchain technology, Opinion Labs is poised to revolutionize how we access and utilize prediction markets. This funding round is a significant step towards realizing that vision and further solidifying the role of decentralized platforms in the future of information aggregation and forecasting.

At this point, while ETF applications for many altcoins such as XRP, Litecoin (LTC) and Solana (SOL) are waiting before the SEC, a new move regarding six altcoins came from asset manager Hashdex. Accordingly, Hashdex has requested permission from the SEC to add more cryptocurrencies to the SEC-approved Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ), which currently only includes BTC and ETH. Hasdex's request includes the addition of six altcoins to the ETF: Solana, XRP, Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), Litecoin, and Uniswap (UNI). The ETF, which opened for trading on February 13 after SEC approval, is traded on Nasdaq under the ticker NCIQ. While this ETF can already invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum, it has the distinction of being the first dual-asset (BTC and ETH) ETF in the US.

Blur Treasury, a key player in the NFT marketplace ecosystem, has deposited a substantial amount of BLUR tokens into Coinbase Prime. This development, first highlighted by astute on-chain analyst @EmberCN, has sparked considerable discussion and speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Let’s delve into the details of this intriguing transaction and explore its potential implications for the market and holders of BLUR tokens . What’s Behind the Blur Treasury’s Massive Crypto Deposits into Coinbase Prime? According to reports, approximately four hours prior to the news breaking, Blur Treasury transferred 21.69 million unlocked BLUR tokens , valued at a staggering $2.32 million, to Coinbase Prime. This single transaction is noteworthy in itself, but it’s part of a larger, more revealing pattern. Since June 15, 2023, when Blur initiated its monthly token unlock schedule, a colossal 1.044 billion BLUR tokens , representing 35% of the total supply, have been released. The consistent destination for all these unlocked tokens? Coinbase Prime. To put this into perspective, the total value of BLUR tokens deposited into Coinbase Prime over these months amounts to a massive $337 million. This begs the question: what is the strategic rationale behind Blur Treasury’s consistent and substantial crypto deposits into Coinbase Prime? Unpacking the Numbers: Key Statistics at a Glance Let’s break down the key figures to fully grasp the scale of these transactions: Recent Deposit: 21.69 million BLUR tokens Value of Recent Deposit: $2.32 million Total BLUR Unlocked Since June 15, 2023: 1.044 billion BLUR tokens (35% of total supply) Total Value of Unlocked BLUR: $337 million Destination for All Unlocked BLUR: Coinbase Prime These numbers paint a clear picture of a deliberate and large-scale movement of BLUR tokens . But what exactly is Coinbase Prime, and why is Blur Treasury choosing it for these significant crypto deposits ? Coinbase Prime: More Than Just an Exchange for BLUR Tokens Coinbase Prime is not your average cryptocurrency exchange platform. It’s a sophisticated institutional-grade platform designed for corporations, hedge funds, and high-net-worth individuals. It offers a suite of services that go far beyond simple trading, including: Custody Solutions: Secure and regulated storage for large amounts of digital assets. This is crucial for treasuries managing substantial token holdings like Blur Treasury . Advanced Trading Tools: Access to sophisticated trading algorithms and execution services, enabling efficient and potentially less market-impactful trading of BLUR tokens . Prime Brokerage Services: Offering services like lending, borrowing, and reporting, essential for institutional-level financial management of crypto deposits . OTC (Over-the-Counter) Trading: Facilitating large-volume trades directly between parties, bypassing public order books and minimizing price slippage, particularly beneficial for moving large quantities of BLUR tokens . Given these features, Blur Treasury’s choice of Coinbase Prime suggests a strategic approach to managing and potentially utilizing these unlocked BLUR tokens . It’s highly unlikely that such a move is solely for simple selling on the open market, considering the potential price impact of such large volumes. Decoding the Strategy: What Could Blur Treasury Be Planning with These BLUR Tokens? The consistent flow of BLUR tokens into Coinbase Prime raises several intriguing possibilities. While the exact intentions of Blur Treasury remain undisclosed, we can explore some plausible scenarios: Staking or Yield Generation: Coinbase Prime may offer staking or yield-generating opportunities for BLUR tokens . By depositing tokens, Blur Treasury could be aiming to earn passive income on their holdings, increasing their overall returns. OTC Sales to Institutional Investors: Coinbase Prime’s OTC desk could be facilitating private sales of BLUR tokens to institutional investors. This would allow Blur Treasury to offload tokens in large blocks without causing significant price drops on public exchanges. This could be a strategic move to diversify holdings or secure funding for future developments. Liquidity Provision for Market Making: Blur Treasury might be working with market makers on Coinbase Prime to provide liquidity for the BLUR token market. By depositing tokens, they could be enabling smoother trading and potentially reducing volatility. Preparation for Future Ecosystem Initiatives: The deposited tokens could be earmarked for future ecosystem development, partnerships, or strategic acquisitions. Having a readily available reserve of BLUR tokens on a platform like Coinbase Prime provides flexibility for swift action when opportunities arise. Hedging or Risk Management: In a more complex scenario, Blur Treasury could be using Coinbase Prime’s sophisticated financial tools to hedge against market volatility or manage risks associated with their BLUR token holdings. It’s important to note that these are speculative scenarios, and the actual reason could be a combination of these or something entirely different. However, the scale and consistency of these crypto deposits strongly suggest a well-thought-out strategy rather than random or impulsive actions. Impact on the BLUR Token Market: Will We See Price Volatility? The movement of such a significant portion of the BLUR token supply naturally raises concerns about potential price volatility. The market’s reaction to these crypto deposits can be influenced by various factors: Market Sentiment: Overall market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies and NFTs will play a role. Positive sentiment could absorb selling pressure more easily, while negative sentiment could exacerbate price drops. Transparency and Communication from Blur: If Blur Treasury provides clarity on their intentions, it could mitigate uncertainty and reduce speculative selling. Lack of communication could lead to increased anxiety and potential price declines. Absorption Capacity of Coinbase Prime: Coinbase Prime’s ability to handle the volume of BLUR tokens without causing market disruptions is crucial. Their institutional-grade infrastructure is designed for large transactions, but significant selling pressure could still impact the price. Trader and Investor Behavior: How traders and investors react to this news will be a key determinant of price movement. Fear of potential dumping could trigger sell-offs, while belief in Blur Treasury’s long-term strategy could lead to buying opportunities. Historically, large token unlocks can sometimes lead to increased selling pressure. However, the fact that these BLUR tokens are being deposited into Coinbase Prime, rather than directly onto public exchanges, suggests a more controlled and potentially less market-disruptive approach. It signals that Blur Treasury is likely considering the market impact and opting for a more strategic execution. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for BLUR Token Holders and the NFT Space? For those holding BLUR tokens or interested in the NFT space, this development offers several key takeaways and actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements from Blur and any further on-chain data regarding these crypto deposits . Transparency will be crucial in understanding the implications. Monitor Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment surrounding BLUR tokens and the broader NFT market. News and community discussions can provide clues about potential price movements. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Evaluate your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and long-term outlook for Blur and the NFT market. Short-term volatility might present buying opportunities for those with a bullish long-term view. Diversification: As always, diversification remains a sound strategy in the volatile crypto market. Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket and spread your investments across different assets. Understand Coinbase Prime’s Role: Recognizing Coinbase Prime as an institutional platform provides context to Blur Treasury’s actions. It suggests a strategic, rather than purely reactive, approach to managing their token holdings. The Blur Treasury’s consistent crypto deposits into Coinbase Prime are undoubtedly a significant event in the BLUR token ecosystem. While the precise motivations remain under wraps, the scale and strategic nature of these transactions point towards a calculated approach to managing their token supply and potentially positioning themselves for future growth and development within the NFT space. Conclusion: A Strategic Move or a Looming Liquidation? The $2.32 million BLUR token deposit into Coinbase Prime, part of a larger $337 million trend, is more than just a routine transaction. It’s a strategic maneuver by Blur Treasury that warrants close attention. Whether this is a power play to fuel future growth, a calculated move for institutional sales, or something else entirely remains to be seen. For now, the crypto world watches, analyzes on-chain data, and speculates on the next chapter in the BLUR token saga. The coming weeks and months will likely reveal more about the true intentions behind these crypto deposits and their ultimate impact on the BLUR token market and the wider NFT landscape. This massive token movement is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, where strategic treasury management can significantly influence token ecosystems.

Zuger Kantonalbank, a Swiss universal bank, has expanded its cryptocurrency offerings to include Cardano ( ADA ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ) through a partnership with crypto-focused Swiss bank Sygnum. In a blog announcement on March 17, Sygnum said the expansion was driven by “increased customer demand” amid what it described as growing regulatory clarity in the U.S. and E.U., as well as the establishment of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The bank’s fiat-to-crypto transactions are facilitated through Sygnum’s gateway, while Zuger Kantonalbank customers can access the service via e-banking and its mobile app. Jan Damrau, head of corporate management and member of the Zuger Kantonalbank executive board, says the addition of ADA and AVAX enables the bank’s clients to “further develop their crypto portfolios conveniently with their principal bank – at a time when digital assets are approaching a global inflection point in terms of adoption.” “The latest expansion of Zuger Kantonalbank’s token universe illustrates the strong demand for additional tokens with diverse use-cases to complement major protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum.” Fritz Jost, Sygnum Bank chief B2B officer In early January, Sygnum raised $58 million in its Strategic Growth Round, pushing its value to over $1 billion and making it a “unicorn.” The funding round was oversubscribed, with Fulgur Ventures, a Bitcoin-focused venture capital firm, as the cornerstone investor. New and existing investors, along with Sygnum team members, also participated in the funding.

Filecoin’s historic price sentiment Filecoin price history | Coinmarketcap Filecoin (FIL) started trading in December 2017, a short period after conducting its ICO.

Filecoin (FIL) experienced notable price fluctuations between 2022 and 2023. Starting 2022 at a higher value, FIL’s price declined amidst the broader crypto market downturn. The price fluctuated throughout 2022, influenced by market sentiment, technological developments, and broader economic conditions. Entering 2023, Filecoin (FIL) exhibited a dynamic price trajectory.

Since March 12, BTC has settled in the $80K-$85K range in a consolidation typically seen after a notable directional move. Prices tanked from $100K to under $80K in preceding weeks due to several factors, including President Donald Trump's tariffs and disappointment about the lack of new purchases in the U.S. strategic BTC reserve. With the latest consolidation, key volatility metrics have declined, nearing monthly lows. Volatility, however, is mean-reverting, meaning the low-volatility regime could soon pave the way for price turbulence, according to Derive. ""BTC’s weekly at-the-money (ATM) volatility has dipped below 50% to 49%, approaching monthly lows of 45%. Realized volatility has also dropped from 91% at the start of the month to 54% today,"" Nick Forster, founder of Derive, wrote in a recent note shared with CoinDesk. It is important to remember that volatility is price agnostic, meaning that the expected increase in volatility does not indicate the direction of the price movement in bitcoin. “Volatility is mean-reverting, so we can expect it to rise soon, likely to levels seen in February (60-70%),"" Forster added. Whether prices rise or fall, volatility can increase, suggesting that significant price swings could occur in either direction. According to Derive, several factors could trigger volatility, including ""a ceasefire (or lack thereof) in Ukraine, or significant shifts in crypto regulatory policy under the Trump administration."" Derive is the world's leading on-chain AI-powered options protocol with a total value locked of nearly $100 million. The protocol has registered a cumulative trading volume of $15 billion to date. Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision could move markets as well. The central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged, with traders pricing two to three rate cuts later this year. But a dovish surprise could recharge bulls' engines for a sharp move higher. Potential Fed rate cuts, however, could be limited, according to BlackRock. ""Markets have priced in about two to three 25 basis point rate cuts this year, versus expectations for just one earlier this year. We think this reflects U.S. recession fears even though economic condition don’t point to a downturn. Even if prolonged uncertainty hurts growth, we still see persistent inflation limiting how much the Fed can cut,"" BlackRock said in a weekly note. The expected volatility boom could happen to the downside should equity markets continue to fall, accelerating the decline in crypto prices.",Markets|Bitcoin|Blockchain|On-chain Data|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-18 07:46:47

The total market cap sits at $2.72T, down 0.45%, with trading volume hitting $72.59B in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin and altcoins are at a turning point, and according to Altcoin Daily, history shows that tough times create big opportunities. They predict a massive surge before 2025, driven by growing institutional interest, media hype, and clearer regulations. Why Crypto’s Future Looks Bright The analyst believes we are near a local market bottom, making this the perfect accumulation phase before a major rally. Several catalysts, including mainstream media attention, institutional involvement, and favorable US policies, indicate that crypto is far from over. BlackRock and Wall Street’s increasing participation, along with bullish narratives from major financial outlets like CNBC and Fox News, are strong green flags for Bitcoin’s long-term growth. In a recent interview with Lara Trump, Michael Saylor, shared his journey from doubting Bitcoin to strongly supporting it as “digital gold.” He explained that Bitcoin isn’t just an investment but a major technological shift. With its fixed supply and resistance to control, he sees it as a key financial tool, especially during economic uncertainty and growing concerns about traditional banking systems. Saylor further emphasized Bitcoin’s dominance, describing it as the “safest bank in the world.” He pointed out that institutions, banks, and even governments will eventually embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Saylor believes that tech giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft will integrate Bitcoin into their systems, further cementing its place as a global financial standard. Another notable perspective came from financial experts and former government officials, who highlighted the US’s past missteps in selling Bitcoin holdings at undervalued prices. With lawmakers now pushing for smarter regulations, there’s a growing effort to make the US a crypto hub, further fueling long-term bullish sentiment. Top 11 Coins to Watch for April 2025 Despite the hype around altcoins, Bitcoin tops the list as the most dominant asset. Analysts acknowledge that this cycle is Bitcoin-driven, not Ethereum-led. However, Ethereum remains a solid pick, with potential upside even though Standard Chartered has lowered its year-end target from $10K to $4K. Other top picks include Avalanche and Mantle, which have seen major institutional backing, particularly from the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Finance. XRP, Cardano, Solana, and Chainlink also made the list due to growing institutional adoption, including their inclusion in Hashdex’s Crypto Index ETF. Meanwhile, Injective is also making waves in DeFi, Kaspa is gaining traction for its innovative blockchain model, and Dogecoin remains a community favorite with potential mainstream adoption. Final Thoughts With liquidity returning to the market, analysts remain highly optimistic about the next bull run. They stress that while Bitcoin will lead, however only selective altcoins will survive as adoption increases. Institutional support, regulatory clarity, and media-driven exposure are setting the stage for an explosive 2025. Will this be the last great buying opportunity before a crypto explosion?

The unrealized losses of US banks have also soared to $500 billion, fuelling market fears. As macroeconomic factors weigh on the market, is the cryptocurrencies price prediction bullish or bearish? Let’s explore. Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction Amid $500B US Banking Loss A looming crisis in the US banking sector shows a bearish cryptocurrencies price prediction. Market analyst Stefan Rust identified the hidden insolvency risk after unrealized losses ballooned to $500 billion. These losses stem from rising interest rates and the Fed’s hawkish monetary policy. US banks hold $4 trillion in government bonds purchased between 2020 and 2022 when interest rates were around 1%. Bond prices tend to move inversely to interest rates. Therefore, as the Fed hiked rates aggressively, the older bonds lost significant market value, causing $500 billion in unrealized losses. US Banks Unrealized Losses If US banks sell these assets and realize the losses, it could trigger another banking crisis as seen in 2023 when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. This will lead to a steep decline in cryptocurrencies price. During this week’s FOMC meeting, 99% of investors on CME expect that the Fed will leave rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50%. Therefore, US banks will continue facing a risk of insolvency until the Fed ends Quantitative Tightening and returns rates to 1% or less. Such a move will boost crypto prices. Analysts Share Mixed Predictions on Crypto Prices During FOMC Week The macroeconomic fears have led to mixed market predictions on cryptocurrencies price. Bitcoin trader @21_XBT attributes the weak BTC price moves to short-term macro fears. Once these concerns die down, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals like institutional adoption will drive price recovery. X Likewise, crypto analyst Seth notes that the global money supply is rising as other central banks ease monetary policies. Bitcoin and most altcoins will likely follow this trend and rally higher. However, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju predicts that cryptocurrencies have entered a bear market. He noted that the Profit and Loss Index Cyclical Signals forecast that now is the right time to sell. PnL Index Cyclical Signals Ju’s bearish cryptocurrencies price prediction may be proven true later this week if selling pressure rises later this week if the Fed maintains its hawkish policy. What’s Next for Altcoins? Altcoin prices have been hit the hardest amid the bearish trends in the cryptocurrencies market. The gradual decline has pushed the altcoin season index to 29. Ethereum price has been trading below the $2,000 support level for more than a week. As Coingape reported, Standard Chartered has shared a bearish ETH price prediction as it loses its market share in the cryptocurrencies market. The institution has also slashed its Ethereum price target by 60%. Despite Ethereum’s grim outlook, other top altcoins like XRP and Cardano still show positive momentum. Ripple has formed a double-bottom, with analysts forecasting an XRP price rally to $30. On the other hand, Cardano price could see an independent rally later this month despite the results of this week’s FOMC meeting. This is due to the launch of ADA futures on Coinbase. Summary of Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction Cryptocurrencies are facing intense price volatility this week. The FOMC meeting and the Fed decision on interest rates will impact investor sentiment after aggressive rate hikes caused $500 billion in unrealized losses for US banks. Bitcoin price is teasing a sub-$80K drop while Ethereum faces rejection at $2,000. However, other altcoins like XRP and Cardano could post massive rallies if macro fears ease.

PI Continues Its Freefall Pi Network’s native token began trading less than a month ago, and since then, it has experienced massive turbulence. On February 20 (the day when the project finally launched its Open Network), the price climbed above $1.80. A day later, though, PI briefly tanked below $0.65 before starting a major rally that took it to an all-time high of almost $3 at the end of last month. The peak was short-lived, and the valuation has been on a downtrend ever since. Currently, PI trades at around $1.17 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 16% decline on a 24-hour scale. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko One potential factor negatively affecting the asset’s performance could be the end of the KYC verification process. The Grace Period (as it is known) ran until March 14 , and this time, the team did not extend it. Previously, the developers behind the project warned users to complete the necessary steps before that date to avoid forfeiting most of their mined PI tokens. This could have caused uncertainty and panic across the community and might have triggered downward pressure on the price. Another element worth mentioning is Binance’s intervention, or more precisely, its lack of action. In February, the world’s biggest exchange was rumored to follow the example of OKX, Bitget, and MEXC, which were the first to embrace PI. Binance even held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see the token available for trading. While over 86% of the voters were supportive, the company has yet to respect their wish . Meanwhile, other leading cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken, have also preferred to stay aside from Pi Network’s native token. Others, like Bybit, have specifically said they will not list the asset, while its CEO Ben Zhou labeled the project a scam. PI Price Predictions Contrary to the falling price, PI bulls remain optimistic that a resurgence could be on the horizon. The X user Coinvo suggested that the current bearish period might soon be replaced by a rally that may push the price to a new ATH. Another market observer assumed that PI is headed towards $1, “and once it touches, the pump begins.” For their part, the industry participant using the X moniker Pi Network News Global assured that if the price drops to $0.60, they will “buy more and more and more.” The post Why Is the Pi Network (PI) Price Down Today? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-18 08:02:20

This network aims to act as a settlement layer for tokenized assets and digital dollars, with a developer testnet set to launch soon and a mainnet rollout expected in the second quarter of 2025. Built to support developers and institutional investors, Converge will integrate key blockchain infrastructure providers such as LayerZero, Pyth Network, Wormhole, and RedStone. The network’s staking mechanism will utilize ENA, Ethena’s governance token, while USDe and USDtb will serve as the platform’s native gas tokens, enabling seamless transactions. According to the project’s announcement, the goal is to create a purpose-built financial ecosystem secured by ENA and centered around digital asset settlements. As part of its strategic vision, Converge will incorporate real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, with Securitize leading the initiative. The company has already issued around $2 billion in tokenized assets and will use Converge to expand beyond treasury-backed products. This shift aims to bring a wider range of securities, including credit, equities, and fixed-income instruments, into the blockchain space. One of Converge’s major innovations is its hybrid approach to financial integration . The platform will offer permissionless DeFi access, allowing users to engage in financial activities without requiring KYC verification. Simultaneously, it will provide permissioned applications tailored for TradFi institutions, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. This dual approach is expected to facilitate institutional capital flows into DeFi, addressing the growing demand for blockchain-based financial solutions. The introduction of Converge comes at a time of rapid growth in the tokenized asset market. Recent reports indicate that the total value of real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain has significantly increased, reflecting a surge in adoption. The market now includes thousands of asset holders and issuers, demonstrating the sector’s expanding reach. This shift is further supported by the rise in stablecoin adoption. The total stablecoin market cap has climbed steadily, with Ethena’s USDe emerging as one of the top stablecoins in the ecosystem. These trends highlight the increasing convergence of traditional and decentralized finance, positioning Converge as a key player in this evolving landscape.",,EN,0,0,ENA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|PYTH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-18 08:03:45

Chen, who previously held leadership positions at Affirm, MetLife Investments, and Morgan Stanley, brings extensive experience in capital markets and financial strategy to the company. Chen's appointment comes at a crucial moment, as Gemini is reportedly in talks with major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to explore an IPO. In a recent post, Chen described the cryptocurrency industry as one of the most dynamic sectors in finance and expressed his excitement about helping Gemini scale as it enters a new phase of growth. The company’s IPO ambitions have gained momentum following key regulatory developments. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its investigation into Gemini, removing a significant hurdle. Additionally, a legal dispute with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) was resolved earlier this year, further clearing the way for a public listing. Gemini’s co-founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, have also been strengthening their political connections. They recently participated in the first-ever Crypto Summit at the White House, positioning themselves as key figures in shaping the future of digital asset regulations. This engagement with policymakers could play a crucial role in securing favorable conditions for Gemini’s potential IPO.

As the industry matures, the threats facing digital assets have become increasingly sophisticated. From high-profile hacks to state-sponsored cybercrime, 2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for crypto security with the latest shock being the $1.5 Billion Bybit Heist last month. Fraudsters are exploiting the anonymity, speed, and lack of regulation in the digital asset ecosystem to execute scams, including Ponzi schemes, rug pulls, and fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs). Such acts use deceptive marketing, fake identities, and insider manipulation to create artificial market hype, misleading victims into investing in non-existent or overvalued projects. Thus, as the industry witnesses the shocking and traumatising saga of financial crimes and frauds in Web3, BrandTalk speaks to Erin Fracolli, the Global Head of Intelligence and Investigations at Binance, to understand the security threats facing web3 and the Strategies to Prevent such crimes from defrauding users and entities. Specializing in fraud detection, blockchain analytics, and cybersecurity, Erin also discusses the role of centralized exchanges vs. DeFi in Crime Prevention and the need for collaborative approach. Read on.. On the increasing numbers of financial crimes, Binance Intelligence Head Erin says, “Over the past year, the landscape of crypto-related fraud and financial crimes has evolved significantly. In February 2025 alone, cryptocurrency thefts saw an unprecedented surge, with nine major hacking incidents leading to a total loss of $1.53 billion, a 20-fold increase compared to the previous month. One of the most notable incidents involved a leading cryptocurrency exchange, which suffered a security breach resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum, the largest digital heist in cryptocurrency history. Investigations indicate that state-affiliated cybercriminal groups, particularly from North Korea, were responsible for over $1.3 billion of these stolen funds, underscoring the growing involvement of nation-state actors in large-scale crypto crimes. These events highlight the evolving tactics of cybercriminals and the increasing sophistication of illicit activities in the crypto space. Evolving nature of financial crimes In the year 2024 alone, the Web3 ecosystem experienced over 760 security incidents, resulting in losses exceeding $2.3 billion. This marks a 31.6% increase compared to 2023. Notably, phishing attacks became the most costly vector, accounting for $1.05 billion across 296 incidents. In Bitcoin’s early days (2009-2013), fraud was mostly Ponzi schemes (e.g., Bitcoin Savings & Trust) and darknet market transactions. From 2014-2017, ICO scams surged, with projects like OneCoin defrauding investors. The DeFi boom (2018-2021) introduced rug pulls, flash loan exploits, and governance attacks. NFTs (2021-2022) saw wash trading, phishing, and insider trading. Today, AI-driven scams, cross-chain bridge attacks, and state-sponsored hacking (e.g., North Korea’s Lazarus Group) dominate, reflecting the increasing complexity of Web3 financial crimes. Erin says, “However, they also reinforce the industry’s commitment to strengthening security measures. Crypto exchanges, blockchain analytics firms, and regulatory bodies are enhancing security frameworks, improving real-time monitoring, and fostering global cooperation to mitigate risks and protect investors As the crypto ecosystem matures, proactive measures such as enhanced KYC/AML procedures, on-chain analytics, and industry-wide collaborations will be essential in addressing emerging threats and fostering a more secure digital asset environment.” When asked if there are specific regions where she sees a higher concentration of illicit activities, Erin opines: While we do not publicly disclose specific regions with higher concentrations of illicit activities, we continuously monitor and analyze transaction patterns globally to identify and mitigate any potential risks. Our goal is to ensure a safe and secure trading environment for all our users, regardless of their location. Source: https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/oj/2023/01/10045768/1KOqGII3pJe Strategies for Preventing and Detecting Financial Crime Cybercriminals exploit decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and cross-chain protocols, making fraud detection increasingly complex. From smart contract vulnerabilities to money laundering through crypto mixers, the risks are vast. On the strategies to prevent such crimes, Erin argues, “Detecting and preventing financial crime in the digital asset space requires a multi-layered approach, combining advanced technology, regulatory collaboration, and user education. The industry has seen increasing threats, from sophisticated hacks to state-affiliated cybercriminals, making robust security measures more critical than ever. Exchanges globally are leveraging transaction monitoring, strict KYC/AML protocols, and partnerships with law enforcement to track illicit activities and enhance transparency. At the same time, we’re exploring the potential impact emerging technologies like AI can have in improving systems and threat detection. The Role of Centralized Exchanges vs. DeFi in Crime Prevention Centralized exchanges (CEXs) serve as gatekeepers against financial crime, implementing KYC/AML checks , transaction monitoring, and regulatory cooperation to detect illicit activities. They can freeze assets and assist law enforcement. In contrast, DeFi platforms , while transparent, face challenges due to pseudonymity and decentralization , making enforcement difficult. As the entities that most often become target of financial crimes, Erin thinks CEXs can inculcate certain practices to stop becoming victim of such crimes. Centralized exchanges play a crucial role in preventing financial crime, trying to offer a structured and highly regulated environment. Sharing an example from Binance, Erin says At Binance, we leverage a proactive, multi-layered security approach that includes transaction monitoring, KYC/AML verification, and real-time risk assessments. In 2024 alone, we helped prevent over $2.4 billion in potential fraud losses and froze millions in illicit transactions linked to high-profile cyberattacks. Our active collaboration with global law enforcement, including recent efforts at the APAC Regional Law Enforcement Day, has been instrumental in tracking illicit actors, recovering stolen assets, and setting industry standards for security That said, we believe the future of crypto security lies in a hybrid approach combining the transparency and innovation of DeFi with the regulatory safeguards and security measures of centralized platforms. By fostering collaboration between regulators, industry leaders, and DeFi developers, we can build a safer and more resilient digital asset ecosystem Emerging Threats in 2025 and Beyond As digital assets and Web3 continue to evolve, so do financial crime tactics. Looking ahead, Erin sheds light on the most pressing security threats, including: The crypto industry faces increasingly sophisticated security threats, driven by AI-powered cybercrime, state-sponsored attacks, and vulnerabilities in emerging technologies. Deepfake fraud and AI-driven phishing are enabling social engineering scams, as seen in a 2024 attack where a deepfake CEO tricked an exchange employee into approving fraudulent transfers. State-backed hacking groups stole over $1.3 billion in crypto last year, targeting exchanges and DeFi platforms. Cross-chain bridges remain a major weak spot, with the 2024 Multichain hack exposing their security risks. Additionally, API exploits and wallet vulnerabilities highlight the need for stronger authentication and encryption. To counter these threats, Binance and the industry are and must been investing in AI-driven fraud detection, real-time monitoring, multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, and robust frameworks, while strengthening collaboration with regulators and cybersecurity agencies. Proactive security measures will be critical in maintaining trust and resilience in the evolving digital asset ecosystem Exchanges & Regulators Must Work Together, says Erin In an era of rising financial crime in the digital asset space, Erin Fracolli emphasizes the need for greater collaboration between crypto exchanges and regulators. Effective collaboration between crypto exchanges and regulators is essential for mitigating risks in the digital asset space. Binance emphasizes the importance of such partnerships, highlighting that obtaining licenses from crypto regulators facilitates international cooperation and attracts large investors Furthermore, Binance’s partnership with regulators underscores its commitment to enhancing compliance standards in line with evolving global cryptocurrency regulations By working closely with regulators, exchanges can foster a compliant ecosystem, ensuring transparency and security within the industry Notably, in a response submitted by the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies (CFCS) at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) to the UK Parliament, CFCS also mentioned that regulators need to understand the emerging trends within the crypto and digital asset space and associated risks. Consistent training of regulators on these new avenues can aid in combatting financial crime. How can investors protect themselves from financial crime As financial crimes in the digital asset space grow, both institutional and retail investors must adopt robust security measures to safeguard their assets. Sharing her strategic advice, Erin says, For institutional investors, it’s crucial to use regulated exchanges, as they adhere to strict compliance and security standards. Additionally, implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), using cold storage for the majority of assets, and conducting regular security audits are essential. Employee training and having a robust incident response plan are also key. For retail investors, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), using reputable wallets, and being cautious of phishing scams are vital. Regularly updating software, using strong passwords, and monitoring accounts for suspicious activity are also important steps. Overall, staying informed about the latest security trends and diversifying storage solutions can help both institutional and retail investors protect their digital assets.

The lawsuit claims the creators misled investors and took over $100 million from its one-sided liquidity pools. The case is gaining attention as it could have significant implications for how crypto projects handle investors’ money. Burwick Law filed a lawsuit on behalf of its clients on March 17 against Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol, and Meteora for launching the Libra (LIBRA) token in a deceptive and unfair way. The token was then promoted by Argentine President Javier Milei on X as a way to boost private-sector funding in the country. Tonight, our firm filed a class action complaint in the Supreme Court of New York on behalf of our client. We allege that Kelsier, KIP, Meteora, and related parties orchestrated an unfair token launch ($LIBRA), allegedly misleading purchasers and harming retail investors. pic.twitter.com/H7dD2LaARK — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) March 18, 2025 $107M Drained from Pools The law firm criticized KIP and Meteora, the two companies behind LIBRA, for using a “predatory” one-sided liquidity pool to artificially raise the price of the token. This allowed insiders to profit while ordinary buyers took the losses. Burwick Law claims that within hours, insiders drained about $107 million from the pools, causing LIBRA’s value to crash by 94%. While President Milei was mentioned in the lawsuit, he was not named as a defendant. Burwick accused the companies of using Milei’s influence to aggressively promote LIBRA, creating a false sense of legitimacy and misleading investors about its potential. Approximately 85% of LIBRA’s tokens were held back at launch, and the “predatory tactics” used by the companies were not disclosed to investors. Burwick Seeks Compensation Burwick is seeking financial compensation for damages, punishment for wrongdoing, the return of profits made unfairly, and a court order to prevent future fraud in token offerings. A blockchain research firm, Nansen, found that more than 86% of the largest 15,430 Libra wallets sold at a loss, losing a total of $251 million. Only 2,101 wallets made a profit, totaling $180 million. Kelsier Ventures and CEO Made $100M Kelsier Ventures, the company behind the LIBRA token, and its CEO, Hayden Davis, were among the biggest winners, making around $100 million. Davis, now facing a potential Interpol red notice, said that he didn’t directly own or sell the tokens. Meanwhile, Argentina’s president-elect, Milei, has said he didn’t promote the LIBRA token, only “spread the word,” despite lawsuits claiming otherwise.

They argue that despite Ethereum’s current market struggles, its long-term trajectory could mirror the rise of these companies, making it a high-growth asset in the coming years. Some analysts believe that Ethereum is being mispriced by investors who treat it like a stable, low-growth asset rather than recognizing its potential dominance in blockchain technology. One expert suggested that Ethereum’s approach to innovation resembles Amazon’s early strategy, focusing on security and infrastructure rather than rapid expansion. This emphasis on reliability has positioned Ethereum as the most trusted settlement layer in the blockchain industry. Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions are another key factor in this outlook. While they are not yet generating significant profits, they function as an essential distribution network that enhances Ethereum’s ecosystem. Experts believe that as adoption grows, these scalability solutions could drive long-term value, attracting institutional investors and traditional financial players who were once skeptical of cryptocurrencies. However, Ethereum’s recent market performance tells a different story. The asset has been on a prolonged downtrend, with its value dropping significantly in recent months. Its market dominance has declined to levels last seen in 2020, raising concerns about its position in the broader crypto space. Additionally, major financial institutions have lowered their price targets for Ethereum, reflecting cautious investor sentiment. Despite these challenges, on-chain data suggests that large investors continue to accumulate Ethereum. Analysts point out that whale wallets are actively buying, indicating that institutional players still see value in ETH’s future. While short-term price movements remain uncertain, the ongoing accumulation by high-net-worth investors hints at a potential long-term bullish outlook.

Trump-Backed World Liberty Financial Raises $550 Million in Token Sale Launched in October 2024, just weeks before Trump’s election victory, WLFI describes itself as a crypto banking platform that aims to “supercharge DeFi.” The Trump family will receive up to 75% of the venture’s net proceeds, according to an early filing. The company said in a statement that the latest token sale was attended by over 85,000 verified investors who completed know-your-customer (KYC) verification to access the offering. Key Investors and Regulatory Developments Tron founder Justin Sun increased his stake in WLFI to $75 million in January. A court filing in February revealed that Sun and the SEC were discussing a settlement of a civil fraud lawsuit the regulator had filed against it. The Trump administration has been pushing a crypto-friendly agenda, including an executive order signed this month to establish the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

This flaw allowed an attacker to manipulate the platform’s smart contract, exploiting its token launch and liquidity pool. Four.meme, a relatively new meme coin launchpad, has already faced security issues in the past. The latest exploit took advantage of a function within its smart contract, enabling the attacker to acquire pre-launch tokens before they were officially available. By sending these tokens to a PancakeSwap address that had yet to be created, the attacker managed to set up a liquidity pair and bypass the platform’s transfer restrictions. As a result, the attacker was able to manipulate liquidity pricing and drain assets from the liquidity pool. This incident is not an isolated case. Back in February, four.meme suffered a separate security breach that led to a loss of approximately $183,000. In that attack, the exploiter manipulated liquidity by creating a fraudulent liquidity pool on PancakeSwap V3 before the real one went live. In response, four.meme temporarily halted liquidity functions and reassured users that protective measures would be implemented. Following the latest attack, the four.meme team issued an urgent statement acknowledging the security breach. They suspended the liquidity pool (LP) on PancakeSwap to contain the damage and are working to strengthen security protocols. However, these repeated breaches highlight the ongoing risks in decentralized finance ( DeFi ) platforms and emphasize the need for robust security measures to protect user funds. This comes at a time when PancakeSwap, a leading DEX on the BNB Chain, is experiencing significant growth. In February 2025, its trading volume surged to levels not seen since 2021, with its total cumulative volume surpassing $1.1 trillion. Meme coins and BNB Chain’s recovery have fueled this expansion, with PancakeSwap commanding a dominant share of the BNB Chain’s DEX market. Despite its success, security incidents like the four.meme exploit underline the vulnerabilities within DeFi ecosystems. As meme coins and decentralized exchanges gain traction, ensuring security and protecting investors becomes increasingly important. Users should remain cautious and conduct due diligence before engaging with new projects, while developers must prioritize security to maintain trust in DeFi platforms.",,EN,0,0,BNB|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-18 08:13:23

Authorities in New Zealand, Australia, the UK, and the US have raised alarms about their potential role in scams, money laundering, and other financial crimes. While no full-scale ban has been implemented, growing regulatory pressure suggests tighter restrictions may be on the horizon. New Zealand law enforcement has called for urgent action, mentioning Bitcoin ATMs multiple times in a recent National Risk Assessment. Authorities claim these kiosks are linked to fraud, drug trafficking, and extortion. Neighboring Australia has also initiated a crackdown, signaling a broader effort to regulate these machines. In the UK, efforts to combat unregistered crypto ATMs have escalated. A London court recently sentenced a man to four years in prison for operating unregistered Bitcoin ATMs, calling it a serious offense. Scottish authorities have also issued warnings to citizens about scams linked to these kiosks, reinforcing concerns about their misuse. Meanwhile, the US is moving toward stricter regulations rather than outright bans. Nebraska recently introduced a bill imposing transaction limits, licensing requirements, and compliance rules for Bitcoin ATMs. Governor Jim Pillen emphasized the need for security, stating that while cryptocurrency is an important industry, safeguards must be in place to prevent exploitation by criminals. Although no government has yet launched an outright attack on Bitcoin ATMs, regulatory moves suggest a growing consensus that these kiosks pose risks .

The Central Bank of Russia has approached the Tatarstan region with a proposal to help pilot the digital ruble, with a specific focus on testing smart contracts, as originally reported by Business Gazeta . Specifically, the goal is to experiment with the conditional spending of funds earmarked for specific purposes, which will be done through the bank’s testing platform. The Ministry of Finance of Tatarstan has agreed to the CBR’s proposal and has already established a working group that will oversee the testing of digital ruble transactions in the region. After testing, Tatarstan’s Finance Ministry and the CBR will define requirements for the targeted use of hypothetical budget subsidies. These requirements will then be formalized into a smart contract. The experiment is slated to conclude in the third quarter of 2025.

A new launch date will be announced later. According to Nabiullina, the large-scale rollout will only take place after thorough testing and consultations with banks about the most economically viable model for clients. However, the pilot program has been progressing successfully so far. To put this development into context, the law about the launch of the digital rubble in Russia took effect in August 2023, with the first phase of testing starting on August 15. However, the Central Bank of Russia delayed its national rollout, sparking concerns that the initiative might be scrapped altogether. The launch of the digital ruble by the Central Bank of Russia is part of a growing trend where national banks are exploring and testing Central Bank Digital Currencies. In Sep. 2024, Reuters reported that 134 countries were exploring launching national CBDCs. Several countries have already launched testing of their CBDCs, including China, Korea , Papua New Guinea , United Kingdom , to name a few. The European Central Bank is also running its multi-year testing of digital euro . Furthermore, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria have already launched their CBDCs, becoming pioneers in digitizing national fiat currencies.

Large investors offloaded over $70M in ADA, increasing selling pressure, though a spot ADA ETF approval could reverse the trend. Shiba Inu’s former lead developer remains inactive on X, but insiders are reassured that they are focused on the new ambassadorial role. Binance’s Latest Listings/Delistings Despite remaining silent on potential support for Pi Network’s native token, Binance has recently conducted numerous other amendments to its platform. Earlier this week, it revealed that it will list the stablecoin StraitsX USD (XUSD) on March 19. Shortly after the disclosure, the asset, which is pegged 1:1 to the American dollar, experienced a major rally to almost $1.80 before returning to its target. The world’s largest crypto exchange also introduced BMT/USDT and MUBARAK/USDT perpetual contracts with up to 25x leverage. The prices of both assets have soared by double digits due to the inclusion. Contrary to the new additions on the platform, Binance said it will remove some existing margin trading pairs on March 25. ALPHA/BTC, CTXC/BTC, DODO/BTC, IDEX/USDC, LISTA/FDUSD, NKN/BTC, and SAGA/BTC will be excluded from the cross margin section , whereas ALPHA /BTC, CTXC/BTC, DODO/BTC, FLM/BTC, IDEX/USDC, LISTA/FDUSD, and NKN/BTC will be scrapped from the isolated margin category. The majority of the affected assets have witnessed minor losses, and their prices have remained relatively stable after the announcement. It is worth mentioning that a major pullback is usually observed when Binance terminates all services with a certain cryptocurrency. Such was the case in October last year when UNFI, OOKI, and other tokens crashed by double digits after the company withdrew its support. ADA Whales on a Selling Spree Cardano’s native token has lost some steam lately, and some important developments suggest that the correction might intensify in the short term. According to the X user Ali Martinez, whales offloaded over 100 million ADA tokens last week. Similar continuous efforts increase the circulating supply of the asset, which could be a precursor of a further decline (if demand doesn’t catch up the pace). Additionally, large sell-offs coming from whales may scare other smaller investors and make them cash out, too. On the other hand, a new resurgence of the cryptocurrency market or the potential approval of a spot ADA exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US might significantly push the price in the opposite direction. How’s SHIB Doing? Lastly, we will touch upon the second-biggest meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), whose former lead developer, using the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama, has been surprisingly inactive on X lately. LUCIE (Shibarium’s marketing strategist) assured the community that this is not a cause for concern, reminding that Kusama has become an ambassador of the project and “is doing exactly what he announced he would.” Many X users commenting on the post appreciated the information, with some predicting that the former leader may announce “groundbreaking” partnerships for Shiba Inu once they break their silence.

The recent stock price decline due to speculative concerns presents a compelling investment opportunity, with a conservative valuation indicating a 64% upside. CoreWeave's $12 billion contract with OpenAI reaffirms strong demand for AI infrastructure, mitigating fears over Microsoft's commitment and reinforcing CORZ's business model. Insider purchases at $8 per share and ongoing HPC contract announcements validate confidence in CORZ’s future prospects amidst AI-driven compute demand growth. Investment Thesis Core Scientific's (CORZ) transformation from a struggling bitcoin miner to a key AI-Infrastructure marks one of the most significant strategic pivots in the industry. By leveraging its existing power capacity and data center infrastructure, CORZ has positioned itself as a leading provider of high-performance computing (HPC) hosting, securing 10.2 billion in long-term revenue contracts with CoreWeave (CRWV). This shift offers a far more stable and predictable revenue stream than bitcoin mining, which remains highly volatile due to price fluctuations, energy costs, and other mining dynamics like hash rate which are very difficult to forecast. The recent decline in CORZ’s stock price, driven by markets concern over compute demand following DeepSeek’s (DEEPSEEK) and speculative concerns around CoreWeave’s relationship with Microsoft (MSFT), has created a compelling investment opportunity. While execution risk remains in the transition to AI infrastructure, the long term contracted nature of CORZ’s HPC deals mitigate much of this uncertainty. Our conservative valuation indicates a 64% upside, CORZ presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the rapid expansion of AI driven compute demand. Investors should view the current stock weakness as a chance to build a position ahead of further execution milestones, leasing announcements, and markets realization of the current issues as purely speculative. HPC Business Overview Core Scientific, originally a pure bitcoin miner, was struggling with bankruptcy in late 2022 but managed to save itself and reemerge with a complex capital structure. With the increasing power and operational costs, coupled with the volatile nature of the bitcoin prices, and the impact of halving event, bitcoin miners became less attractive to investors. It was at this critical juncture, CORZ pivoted towards the hosting business, announcing the first small 16mw hosting contract with CoreWeave on March 6 th , 2024. This marked a fundamental shift in strategy, and CORZ embarked on a journey which would see them lease 590MW to CoreWeave for HPC hosting under twelve year agreements. CoreWeave’s contracts provide long-term revenue visibility. CoreWeave, originally a crypto miner, has transitioned into a GPU-as-a-service company. Being an AI hyperscaler, CoreWeave is providing computation power to major companies like Microsoft. In fact, 62% of the CoreWeave's revenue comes from Microsoft. CoreWeave also leases some of the capacity from companies like CORZ. An interesting fact at this point is CoreWeave’s previous attempt to acquire core scientific at a 1b valuation, 5.75 per share, which was rejected that we now see was for good reasons. CORZ has a capacity of 1,300MW, of which they are planning to dedicate 900MW to HPC hosting while using the remaining capacity for bitcoin mining. To date, CORZ has announced six different HPC contracts with CoreWeave, securing $10.2b in revenues over a period of 12 years at an EBITDA margin of 75-80%. The deal dynamics suggest revenues of $1.3-$1.5 million per megawatt annually. The capital expenditure (CapEx) required to transform bitcoin mining units into HPC data centers is around $1.5 million per megawatt. This CapEx is financed by CoreWeave and repaid through revenue sharing agreements, capped at 50% of revenues per year. However, for the most recent 70MW contracts, CoreWeave is not financing the CapEx, instead CORZ issued convertible notes at 0% interest rates. Each of these six contracts has a different completion target time for becoming operational. CORZ already has a small HPC hosting revenue from its first announced contract of 16mw, which was completed before the deadline. The revenue from the other contracted deals of 574mw is expected to start flowing by the end of this year and fully ramp up by the second half of 2027. In the last earnings call, Management announced that the conversion will be completed before the initially proposed deadlines. The remaining 310MW is yet to be contracted, but the management is targeting full lease executions and operational deployment by late 2028. Why does this Investment opportunity exist? Core Scientific’s stock rallied significantly as is continued to announce new HPC contracts, at one point gaining 386% from the date of it first HPC deal announcement. However, two major events resulted in a 57% decline in CORZ’s stock price. First, the announcement of DeepSeek - a new AI framework claiming significantly lower development cost and computation needs, casting doubts on the demand for AI compute capacity. This created a ripple effect, impacting AI hyperscalers like CoreWeave and big tech firms that had invested billions into AI infrastructure. However, industry experts largely refuted DeepSeek’s claims. CORZ further demonstrated ongoing demand by announcing a new CoreWeave contract in its latest earnings report. While some skeptics suggested this contract might have been signed before DeepSeek’s announcement, those concerns were laid to rest when CoreWeave recently signed a $12 billion contract with OpenAI, reaffirming strong demand for High-Performance data centers. Secondly, the Financial Times reported that Microsoft had scaled back a certain commitment with CoreWeave due to delivery issues. Given that CoreWeave disclosed in its S-1 filing that 62% of its revenue comes from Microsoft, this raised fears that if Microsoft pulled back, it could impact CoreWeave’s ability to fund its contracts with CORZ leading to a cut in commitment with CORZ. This news triggered a significant sell-off in CORZ stock. However, CoreWeave swiftly denied these claims, stating “We pride ourselves in our client partnerships and there have been no contract cancellations or walking away from commitments. Any claim to the contrary is false and misleading, CoreWeave consistently delivers high-performance AI infrastructure at scale, and that’s earned us the trust of the world’s leading AI labs and enterprises” While the Microsoft issue caused panic, it was alleviated when CoreWeave secured a $12 billion, five-year contract with OpenAI. Sam Altman himself labelled this deal as an “important addition”, reducing CoreWeave’s reliance on Microsoft to some extent and reinforcing its operational excellence. Additionally, Microsoft and CoreWeave have a 45-day contract cancellation window, meaning any major contract termination would have been reported in CoreWeave’s S-1 filing as it was recently filed. Additionally, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald have also dismissed the Financial Times claims as “unlikely”. Although Microsoft has not publicly commented on the issue, it is unlikely that such a major shift would occur without prior discussions with CoreWeave. In corporate settings, contract concerns are typically addressed between parties before any drastic action is taken. Even if Microsoft adjusts certain commitments, it will still source a significant amount of capacity from CoreWeave, indicating a strong relationship. If Microsoft were truly scaling back, CoreWeave would not have outright refuted the claims. Valuation Min ing Business The April 19 bitcoin halving reduced mining rewards in half from 6.25 btc to 3.125 BTC per block, increasing profitability challenges for bitcoin miners. CORZ continues to mine bitcoin but with a diminishing role. In February, it mined 215 BTC, averaging 7.7 BTC per day at an assumed average cost of $51,035 per BTC based on Q4 of last year, comprising $37,661 in power costs and $13,374 in operational expenses. This represents a substantial increase from its 2024 full-year average cost of $30,387 per BTC. Mining remains highly volatile and uncertain. From the valuation point of view, the mining business can be assessed in three ways: Assuming eventual conversion of mining assets into HPC, using the same valuation framework that you’ll see below but with conservative estimates yields a valuation of $1.47 per share. Valuing the mining segment using an EBITDA multiple of 7x, leading to a $1.53 per share valuation. The approach that we will use argues that creating an HPC data center takes a lot longer and is much more expensive than converting the existing mining datacenter. We can value the mining MW at $1.5m per MW, assuming the minimum price an HPC buyer will have to pay for them to acquire and convert them into hosting. This approach provides us with a valuation of $1.60. Moat Investing HPC Hosting CORZ’s multiple contracts with CoreWeave involve different revenue-per-MW terms, operational timelines, and deal structures. A discounted cash flow model was used to value these contracts with CoreWeave, employing a 6% discount rate due to the long term contracted nature of revenues. Management guides for 75-80% EBITDA margin, but a lower-bound estimate of 75% was used, with an additional 5% cost buffer for conservatism. The timeline for each contract is based on the guide provided by the management. The total share count of 373.94 million, accounting for potential dilution, was used in calculations. This contrasts with the share count of 294.12m that you’ll see on many financial platforms. I have also valued the remaining 310mw that CORZ is yet to lease. To reflect uncertainty, I am using 70% EBITDA margin lowered from the managements guide of 75-80%, with assumed full lease execution by late 2028. Moat Investing Moat Investing Moat Investing Moat Investing Moat Investing Moat Investing Consolidating the HPC valuation with the mining business and adding the value of 256 bitcoins that they hold on to their balance sheet, we get a valuation of $14.7 representing 64% upside. Moat Investing Conclusion Core Scientific’s transformation into an AI infrastructure provider, underpinned by its partnership with CoreWeave, offers a strong long-term growth trajectory. While near-term volatility exists due to execution risk, the company strategic pivot reduces its reliance on Bitcoin mining and enhances its profitability in the AI-driven compute sector. Despite market skepticism, CoreWeave’s recent $12 billion contract with OpenAI and increase in HPC leasing with CORZ underscores the growing demand for AI infrastructure, reinforcing the long-term viability of CORZ’s business model. As AI adoption accelerates, the need for High-Performance computing will only intensify. Market concerns over DeepSeek and Microsoft appear overblown, presenting an attractive investment opportunity. Additionally, recent insider purchases at $8 per share further validate confidence in CORZ’s future prospects.",CRWV|CORZ,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MINING|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-18 09:25:42

Based on information by Tokenomist, those unlocks can be characterized as either “cliff” releases – a major concentrated drop at one time – or linear drops across various projects. In terms of upcoming cliff unlocks, Fasttoken (FTN) is featured at the front of the line with 20 million tokens at a value of around $79.8 million worth of FTN, or 4.65% of the circulating supply. Crypto unlock schedule After the $79.8 million release of Fasttoken, QAI with 565.69 million tokens worth $41.64 million, will see the second-largest cliff unlock. OM comes in third with 5 million tokens that are worth $34.3 million. Other notable cliff unlocks include ZKJ releasing tokens valued at $31.83 million (25.72% of circulating supply), ID with $19.15 million (18.23% of supply), and the MELANIA token with a $19.54 million unlock. Immutable X (IMX), ApeCoin (APE), and MURA complete the major one-time releases with unlocks valued at $13.59 million, $8.15 million, and $7.1 million respectively. Source: Wu Blockchain On the linear unlock side, Solana takes the lead with 465,770 tokens worth $59.79 million. This is only 0.09% of its circulating supply, though. Worldcoin (WLD) comes in second with $31.82 million worth of tokens (3.19% of supply), followed by TIA, which will release $23.8 million worth (1.3% of supply). Well-known meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) will release 96.52 million tokens worth $16.6 million. Other large linear releases are OM with another $18.18 million on top of its cliff release, TAO with $12.34 million, Avalanche (AVAX) with $13.08 million, and Sui (SUI) with $8.56 million. The rest of the linear releases are JTO, NEAR, DOT, IP, and FIL, with ranges from $7.48 million to $12.76 million. Market liquidity after unlocks The aggregate influence of $486 million in tokens coming to market in one week gives rise to questions regarding how liquidity in trading could take this number of potential supplies. Although the aggregate number seems large, the effect differs for each individual token depending on their current market depth and trading levels. For liquid assets such as Solana, whose daily trading volumes consistently surpass $1 billion, the $59.79 million unlock is a modest fraction of average daily activity. Likewise, Dogecoin’s $16.6 million unlock is not likely to induce price pressure considering its well-established market presence. Conversely, ZKJ’s unlock of 15.53 million tokens valued at $31.83 million is 25.72% of its circulating supply. This is a major shift in token economics that may impact current market liquidity. Likewise, ID’s unlock of 18.23% of its circulating supply may challenge the market to absorb more tokens. Token releases occurring in a bullish environment typically experience less negative price effect as fresh buyers are able to absorb more supply. Unlocks in bearish or volatile market conditions, however, tend to create downward pressure. Token release impact on supply ZKJ faces the largest supply change, with tokens worth $31.83 million representing 25.72% of its circulating supply entering the market at once. Similarly, ID will see 18.23% of its circulating supply unlocked, worth $19.15 million. Fasttoken, despite having the largest unlock by dollar value at $79.8 million, will experience a more moderate 4.65% increase in circulating supply.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's recent $12 billion open interest shakeout is also seen by some as a necessary reset for future gains, though upcoming Fed decisions could drive further volatility. Bitcoin Bull Market Over? CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently made a stark reversal in his Bitcoin market outlook, and stated that the cryptocurrency’s bull cycle is now over and that it may face six to twelve months of bearish or sideways price action. This is a big shift from his stance earlier in the month when he expressed confidence that Bitcoin’s bull cycle, while slow, is still very much intact. According to Ju, on-chain metrics have turned entirely bearish, with fresh liquidity drying up and new whales offloading Bitcoin at lower prices. His latest statement was made just days after reports that Bitcoin funding rates, which measure the cost of maintaining long or short positions in futures markets, have hovered near zero. This suggests that there is growing uncertainty among traders. Despite Ju’s bearish outlook, not all analysts share his perspective. Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal dismissed the need for panic by explaining that while some investors have been spooked by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, the broader global economy is trending in the right direction. He believes that risk assets like Bitcoin will see renewed inflows once market conditions start to stabilize. Another argument for an impending Bitcoin recovery came from crypto analyst Seth , who pointed to the global M2 money supply reaching a new all-time high. This metric often correlates with Bitcoin’s price movements. He believes that this surge in liquidity could drive another Bitcoin rally in the near future. Supporting this theory, CoinRoutes CEO Dave Weisberger stated that if Bitcoin continues to follow historical trends, it could reach a new all-time high by late April. He placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that Bitcoin’s beta correlation with money supply suggests a strong probability of price appreciation. Former Phunware CEO Alan Knitowski offered an even more dramatic outlook by stating that Bitcoin’s current price is much lower than where it should be based on historical data. According to his calculations, Bitcoin’s lower bound at this stage of the cycle should be around $250,000. Meanwhile, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten is still optimistic, and estimated that there is more than a 50% chance that Bitcoin will surpass its previous all-time high before the end of June. Bitcoin’s current all-time high of $109,000 was reached on Jan. 20, just hours before Trump was inaugurated as US President. Bitcoin’s $12 Billion Shakeout May Set Up Next Rally Bitcoin’s recent $12 billion open interest shakeout may have been a necessary catalyst for the cryptocurrency to regain its bullish momentum, according to a crypto analyst. CryptoQuant contributor DarkFost described the event as a natural market reset, and an essential phase for sustaining a bullish continuation. Looking at historical trends, he noticed that past deleveraging events often presented strong buying opportunities for the short to medium term. (Source: CryptoQuant ) Data from CoinGlass shows that on Feb. 20, Bitcoin’s open interest, which tracks the total number of unsettled Bitcoin derivative contracts like options and futures, stood at $61.42 billion before plunging 19% to $49.71 billion by March 4. The decline occurred during heightened market volatility driven by uncertainty surrounding US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the future of US interest rates. Feb. 25 saw Bitcoin retracing below $90,000, and just two days later, on Feb. 27, it briefly dipped below $80,000 for the first time since November. Despite this turbulence, Bitcoin was able to slightly rebound, and is now trading hands at $82,424, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) On the other hand, Bitget chief analyst Ryan Lee warned that Bitcoin’s price and open interest could stay volatile, especially ahead of the March 19 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. While the market broadly expects the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged, any unexpected hawkish signals could put downward pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets. The CME Group’s FedWatch tool currently estimates a 99% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s open interest has seen a modest recovery, rising 6.5% over the past five days to $49.02 billion. Analysts Predict Crypto Rally if Fed Winds Down QT Betters on Polymarket are convinced that the US Federal Reserve will end its quantitative tightening program by May, which is a decision that many analysts believe could spark the next phase of the crypto bull market. On March 14, Polymarket’s odds that the Fed will halt QT by April 30 reached 100%. (Source: Polymarket ) The prediction market first gained notoriety for accurately forecasting Donald Trump’s rise during the 2024 US presidential election, and it has accumulated more than $6.2 million in trading volume for the wager titled “Will Fed end QT before May?” Quantitative tightening is a policy tool that is used by the Fed to withdraw liquidity from the financial system by allowing bonds on its balance sheet to mature. This approach contrasts with quantitative easing, which saw the central bank expand its balance sheet to inject liquidity after the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed’s QT program has been in place since June of 2022 as part of its broader efforts to curb inflation. By keeping short-term interest rates elevated and reducing its balance sheet, the Fed aimed to influence long-term borrowing costs and limit excess liquidity. While QT did not immediately hinder the performance of traditional and crypto markets, it has become a growing concern due to recent macroeconomic shocks linked to the Trump administration. In 2022, Cambridge Associates senior investment director TJ Scavone predicted that QT’s negative effects would only become apparent when a major financial stressor emerged. He warned that combining QT with an already volatile economic environment could heighten risks, increasing the likelihood that something critical in the financial system would break. Crypto markets have been particularly sensitive to these macroeconomic developments. In February, heightened volatility rocked digital assets, while by March, the S&P 500 Index entered correction territory. Bitcoin also declined by almost 30% by early March. The prevailing expectation that the Fed will soon wind down QT has fueled optimism among crypto analysts, as an influx of liquidity into financial markets could drive renewed interest in risk assets. Many also believe that expected rate cuts in the second half of the year could provide even more support to reverse the ongoing downturn in crypto prices. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen supports this thesis, and suggested that the end of QT will likely be followed by a broad market rally. While the Fed has yet to officially confirm any changes to its QT policy, minutes from its January Federal Open Market Committee meeting revealed that some officials were concerned about the effects of balance sheet reductions, particularly regarding their potential impact on the US debt ceiling debate. The minutes noted that some policymakers considered a temporary pause or slowdown in QT as an appropriate response to these economic uncertainties.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-18 09:27:37

The project has raised $3,900,000 with over 6,100 token holders since its presale launched, with investors excited to jump on the structured tokenomics. Now in Phase 3 and retailing for $0.02–investors are stacking their racks before nums rocket to $0.025 in Phase 4–25% jump a-ticking as the last of the allocation disappears. Given an exchange listing at $0.06, early investors could see 200% returns overnight, and post-launch predictions suggest it could pump past $1.50, making MUTM a serious contender for market dominance. Presale Momentum Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) generating speculation in the crypto arena with its presale stages going out of stock sooner than expected. Prices increased from $0.015 to $0.02 between Phase 2 and Phase 3, but demand continues to have no signs of cooling. Drawn in by the tiered pricing model as well as the platform’s underlying mechanics — a decentralized lending protocol allowing users to borrow against overcollateralized assets while earning passive yields. The advantage of MUTM is that it has this dual utility of trading a liquid currency whilst earning income, unlike its speculative competitors. The mtTokens system of the project adds to the attractiveness. Depositors are issued interest-bearing tokens such as mtETH or mtDAI, which accrue value as their underlying assets generate yield. These tokens are still transferable in the DeFi architecture, which adds a layer of flexibility. A buy-and-distribute mechanism uses platform revenue to execute regular buybacks of MUTM, delivering tokens to stakers, and keeping upward price pressure on MUTM. These tactics have already catapulted MUTM’s presale momentum, with Phase 3 allocations disappearing in a flash as investors lock in ahead of Phase 4’s price rise. Tokenomics Driving Accelerated Adoption The presale phase 3 participants can therefore guarantee instant gains when the coin lists at $0.06 — a hefty discount of 66% on the entry point of $0.02. Aside from this, analysts also point to a post-launch trajectory that could see MUTM cross the $1.50 in a matter of weeks, which would equal a 7,400% return for those who buy now. Such optimism is built upon the business, and relative success, of the platform’s revenue model, whereby 30% of fees are used to perpetually buy back MUTM tokens and fuel a self-evidencing cycle of demand. Legacy DeFi tokens (like Aave or Compound) are not even close. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) includes peer-to-peer lending, with the ability for users to negotiate specifically for fringe assets like meme coins, which relatively few traditional platforms support. Also, interest rates are dynamic and depend on the market activity so liquidity providers are incentivized with higher APYs during a higher demand. These innovations also make MUTM a scalable solution to the emerging demands of the decentralized finance landscape and not merely a passing fad. Security of and Roadmap for the Future Security functions as the prime concern for Mutuum Finance as we progress with its development. The team works to obtain a smart contract audit from Certik while this achievement will boost user and investor trust when the process completes. The project embraces full platform deployment preparedness by conducting this security move which demonstrates its commitment to operational transparency. The Mutuum ecosystem obtains stronger anchorage because the team plans to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin. All operations of this stablecoin run according to DeFi principles and support user-deposited assets because they follow an angelic free system. MUTM will establish dominance in its target niches through its current initiatives together with ongoing partnerships and exchange listings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is a rare field meeting of innovation and timing. This creates a recipe for explosive growth due to its presale structure, utility-driven model, and aggressive buyback mechanisms. With Phase 3 filling up fast and Phase 4 likely to increase the cost of entry significantly, the opportunity to extract maximum returns is closing fast. Once again investors have a pivotal decision to make in front of them after their predicted 15,000% rally.

On March 13, a French court gave the founder and CEO of the encrypted messaging app Telegram permission to leave for Dubai , where he had previously resided. Durov had been in France since August 2024, when he was arrested at the Le Bourget airport in Paris. Durov was part of an investigation containing allegations of negligence and complicity in crimes like narcotics trafficking, money laundering, child sexual exploitation and terrorism. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. More broadly, Durov’s case raises questions about developer responsibility for the cryptographic platforms and tools they create — a well-known issue in the cryptocurrency industry. Is Durov responsible for what happens on Telegram? The preliminary charges against Durov claimed he was responsible, at least in part, for the illicit activities allegedly enabled by the platform’s encryption and support for cryptocurrencies. The argument will sound familiar to crypto industry observers, who have been following the case of Alexey Pertsev , the developer of cryptocurrency mixer service Tornado Cash. As with Durov, prosecutors allege that Pertsev is responsible for the illicit activities that took place on the platform, namely money laundering. Pertsev was arrested in the Netherlands in 2022 and is currently out on bail while he waits for his trial to begin. Related: Tornado Cash dev Alexey Pertsev’s bail a ‘crucial step’ in getting fair trial, defense says In both cases, members of the crypto community have recognized the possible implications to free speech and privacy, and come to support the executives. Jose Fabrega, head of marketing at Ethereum-based blockchain Metis, called Durov’s arrest the “Tornado Cash case all over again.” Source: Jose Fabrega Natalia Latka, director of public policy and regulatory affairs at blockchain analysis firm Merkle Science, has previously told Cointelegraph that “Historically, software developers were seen as neutral creators of tools and platforms, responsible for their technical functionality but not for how those tools were used.” However, she said this has been changing with the proliferation of decentralized tools that “challenge traditional regulatory frameworks.” This puts decentralized platforms in a “tight spot,” crypto platform Onesafe wrote in a blog post on March 17. “This means knowing the legal frameworks governing their operations and engaging with regulatory bodies.” It also called the Durov case a “pivotal moment” for the cryptocurrency industry and called on crypto firms to advocate for more “balanced regulations” and support advocacy groups. Durov himself wrote on March 17 that Telegram has “not only met but exceeded its legal obligations.” Implications for free speech Observers and critics alike have raised concerns about Durov’s arrest — discussing what it means for free speech and whether the arrest could have been politically motivated. Chris Pavlovski, the CEO of “alt-tech” video-sharing platform Rumble, said that it was the final straw for him and his company, which had previously clashed with French officials over censorship issues. Source: Chris Pavlolvski Gregory Alburov, an investigator for the Anti-Corruption Foundation of late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, said the case “in addition to being unjust as hell (Durov obviously isn’t engaged in terrorism or weapons trafficking), is also a huge blow to freedom of speech.” Durov’s previous clashes with regulators, particularly in 2018, when he refused to comply with an order from Russian telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor, have led many to believe that the charges were politically motivated. While French President Mannuel Macron publicly stated that the case is not an attack on Durov, Dmitry Zair-Bek — a human rights lawyer and head of the human rights organization Department One — disagrees. Related: Free speech and online privacy: Pavel Durov's rise to the top “Durov is essentially being targeted for his efforts to protect users’ privacy and, of course, for his refusal to cooperate with intelligence agencies,” he said . Regardless of the motivations, the outcome of the case will have clear implications for future platforms. A conviction could intimidate platforms and executives into more intense moderation to the point of censorship, while a victory could embolden others to abandon obligations to regulators and public safety. Durov’s leave in Dubai reportedly extends to April 7. The French prosecutor’s office has not made any public statements regarding the status of the case.

41854691,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140980,1742290407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,HTX Ventures: Striking a Balance between Compliance and Innovation in a Shifting Regulatory Landscape,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/htx-ventures-striking-a-balance-between-compliance-and-innovation-in-a-shifting-regulatory-landscape/,"SINGAPORE , March 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — HTX, a leading crypto exchange, has been ranked as the “Top 3 Exchanges for EUR-Stablecoin Trading Activity” in a recent CoinDesk report titled “ MiCAR: The Institutional Playbook for Europe’s Digital Asset Market “. The report explores key trends shaping the European digital asset market with the implementation of Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) and highlights that HTX achieved a monthly average EUR-stablecoin trading volume of €48 million, with a notable volume of €33 million in November 2024 , ranking third following Binance and Coinbase. This surge in EUR-denominated trading coincides with the regulatory shifts. Regulatory clarity has become a key driver of institutional adoption and market confidence. The full rollout of MiCAR represents a major milestone for the industry, offering a unified framework that spans across 27 European Union (EU) member states. While MiCAR streamlines compliance and fosters innovation, it also brings along complex challenges that exchanges must navigate. HTX Ventures explores both the opportunities and hurdles that come with this landmark regulation. Alec Goh , Head of HTX Ventures, said, “The implementation of MiCAR is a major step in the right direction for the crypto industry, providing much-needed regulatory clarity and fostering an environment conducive to institutional adoption. As jurisdictions worldwide become more crypto-friendly, a united framework like MiCAR will accelerate innovation while ensuring robust compliance. At HTX Ventures, we see this as an opportunity to drive the development of on-chain compliance tools, support the emergence of compliant DeFi solutions, and bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets.” Opportunities: Unified Regulatory Framework Reduces Costs and Boosts Market Confidence MiCAR covers all 27 EU member states through a “single license” approach, enabling exchanges to significantly reduce compliance costs across borders. This unified regulatory framework provides a clear and stable regulatory environment for the market, increasing confidence and participation among institutional investors while positioning Europe to becoming the world’s largest compliant digital asset market. Technological Innovations Drive On-Chain Compliance Tools To meet MiCAR’s stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and reserve monitoring requirements, exchanges can actively explore compliance tool innovations, including: Using oracle networks to modularize AML rules and reserve monitoring, executing them on-chain for real-time data transparency. Adopting zk-SNARKs to build an on-chain central platform for regulatory data, enabling transaction data desensitization to balance regulatory transparency with user privacy. Leveraging account abstraction technology (ERC-4337) to integrate KYC processes into non-custodial wallets, lowering barriers for traditional financial institutions to access DeFi. New Opportunities for the Convergence of Traditional and Crypto Assets With platforms such as Coinbase launching securitized tokens, exchanges can introduce real-world asset (RWA) trading. This includes income-based stablecoins backed by US stocks or Treasuries, enabling users to leverage assets like USDT for multi-asset allocation and global liquidity matching. Challenges: High Costs and Technical Complexity of Compliance MiCAR imposes strict requirements on stablecoin issuers and Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs), including adequate reserves, regular audits, and robust anti-money laundering measures. Exchanges must invest significantly in R&D to integrate compliance tools, data desensitization techniques, and on-chain regulatory platforms without compromising market fluidity. Uncertainty in the Dynamic Policy Environment With regulatory policies evolving rapidly, exchanges must establish multi-chain testing environments and collaborate with regulatory-friendly regions (e.g., Lithuania , Malta ) for cross-border stress tests and regulatory scenario simulations. This requires continuous investment, with risks at the policy interpretation and implementation levels. Security Risks and Stringent Custody Requirements Following high-profile incidents like FTX, MiCAR has introduced rigorous digital asset custody requirements, mandating bank-level security measures to prevent hacking and asset loss. As DeFi integrates with traditional financial regulations, exchanges must address both technical vulnerabilities and evolving security risks. HTX Ventures firmly believes that under a clearer regulatory framework such as MiCAR, exchanges can achieve a win-win situation through technological innovations and global asset allocation, balancing compliance with market innovation. Moving forward, the firm will continue to leverage its insights and expertise to actively explore on-chain compliance tools, expand RWA trading, and build a dynamic testing environment, navigating regulatory complexities and ensuring that crypto innovation remains aligned with long-term institutional adoption and market sustainability. – End – About HTX Ventures HTX Ventures, the global investment division of HTX, integrates investment, incubation, and research to identify the best and brightest teams worldwide.

But they are not a widely accepted form of payment in retail. Businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have yet to experiment with crypto payments. Volatility, high transaction fees, and slow settlement times push them away. SpacePay ($SPY) solves these fundamental issues. Let’s Talk About the Core Problem Here are the three core issues that stop cryptocurrencies from entering mainstream retail. The first is volatility risk. Since most businesses operate on thin profit margins, they can’t afford to lose money on crypto volatility. If the price of the cryptocurrency drops before it can be converted to fiat, businesses will lose profits. It’s not a sound deal. Another challenge is cryptocurrency transaction fees. They typically fluctuate based on network congestion. During peak times, fees on blockchains like Ethereum skyrocket. Microtransactions are unfeasible in this case. Another challenge is integration, as most crypto payment solutions require businesses to overhaul their existing point-of-sale (POS) systems or invest in new hardware. Not all businesses are ready to pay for this additional expense. The technical complexity further adds to it. How SpacePay Solves These Issues SpacePay offers a practical payment solution that is as seamless as traditional credit card transactions. SpacePay has the ability to instantly convert crypto payments into local currency. The mechanism eliminates volatility risk for merchants. They receive the exact amount they charge. While traditional blockchain payments charge variable transaction costs, SpacePay offers a flat 0.5% fee per transaction. It is a great deal when compared to credit card processors like Visa and Mastercard, which charge merchants between 1.5% and 3.5%. For businesses that deal with high transaction volumes, these savings can amount to a lot. Most importantly, SpacePay doesn’t ask businesses to replace their existing payment infrastructure. Instead, it integrates into Android-based POS systems and allows merchants to start accepting crypto. That too, without any extra hardware investments. Being easy to use and integrate, businesses are more likely to give it a try. More Than Just Payments: The Role of $SPY Token $SPY fuels the SpacePay ecosystem. Usually, traditional payment processors keep all the transaction revenue. SpacePay is different. It redistributes value back to its users in true crypto style that places more value on the community than the team. $SPY holders gain access to loyalty rewards, governance rights, and revenue-sharing opportunities. Token holders can vote on platform updates and new feature implementations. Users who actively participate in the ecosystem are rewarded with additional $SPY tokens. Long-term holders benefit from revenue-sharing programs based on platform growth. $SPY is more than just a transactional asset, in other words. The self-sustaining ecosystem benefits both users and merchants. Why $SPY Could be the Next Altcoin to Explode? SpacePay allows merchants to accept crypto without the fear of price swings. The project’s goal is to make digital assets as popular as fiat for daily transactions. Businesses continue to operate in their preferred local currency and customers pay with crypto. Lower fees and instant settlements make SpacePay an attractive option. SPY is not a speculative crypto. It serves tangible utilities across the SpacePay ecosystem. Finally, this is not another crypto in the ideation phase. Many crypto projects promise everything under the sky using blockchain technology. In reality, they never manage to deliver a functional product. SpacePay is an exception. It already has an operational Minimum Viable Product (MVP) ready. The project is credible, unlike typical presale tokens that promise the world and disappear after launch. As a top crypto that could shape the future of digital payments, $SPY is an altcoin to not miss this season. The Clock is Ticking on the SPY presale Cryptocurrencies are just investment vehicles now. To break out of the narrative, they need to offer utilities. SpacePay ignites this transition with its cheap and efficient payment solution. Instant conversion and easy integration sets it apart. In the sea of new altcoins, $SPY stands out. The $SPY presale that is rapidly gaining momentum gives early adopters an opportunity to support the project before it lists on exchanges.

The MicroStrategy pattern, a double bottom, comprises two consecutive troughs at about the same price, said to reflect downtrend exhaustion, and a trendline (a so-called neckline) drawn through the high point between them. A move beyond the trendline confirms the breakout, or the bearish-to-bullish trend change. That's especially true when the pattern unfolds after a notable slide, as in MSTR's case, and the gap between troughs and the high is at least 10%, according to technical analysis theory. In MSTR's case, it's greater than 35%. The chart shows a double bottom in MSTR at around $230 since late February with the neckline resistance identified by the early March recovery to $320.94. A price move through that resistance would confirm the double-bottom breakout and signal a renewed bull run. Technical analysts typically add the gap between troughs and the neckline to the breakout point to derive the potential upside move, which, in this case, means a rally to $410. The share price has also broken through the downtrend line, characterizing the meltdown from the November high of $543. The evolving double bottom on the MSTR price chart looks like a mirror image of BTC's double top . That pattern from early this year that warned of a price sell-off to $75,000. BTC's double top breakdown happened on Feb. 24, with prices falling below $91,000, suggesting a bearish trend reversal. The decline gathered pace in the following days, with prices sliding to as low as $76,800 last week. Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, saw a similar breakdown early this month. Double bottoms and double tops both have low failure rates, according to CMT books, meaning breakouts and breakdowns usually lead to extended price rallies or sell-offs.

Easing inflation-related concerns may be a positive sign for the upcoming FOMC meeting, according to Fumihiro Arasawa, co-founder and CEO of xWIN Research. The lower CPI reading may also be a positive sign for Bitcoin’s trajectory, the CEO told Cointelegraph, adding: “This suggests that inflationary pressures are gradually easing, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions.” “Bitcoin’s short-term price action will depend on whether it can hold the $81,000 support level. A sustained hold could stabilize sentiment, while a breakdown may trigger further corrections,” added Arasawa.

Whether it’s Qubetics with its real-world asset tokenization, Tezos pushing the boundaries of smart contract efficiency, or Gala continuing its rise in the gaming space, there’s a lot to keep an eye on. Each of these projects offers unique features that could take the crypto world by storm in 2025, but which one stands out as the best pick for early adoption? Qubetics innovative approach to interoperability and real-world asset tokenization promises a bright future for businesses and individuals looking to enter the crypto space. Then there’s Tezos, which has recently made headlines for its upgrades and continuous developments in the smart contract ecosystem. Gala, on the other hand, is transforming the gaming industry, positioning itself as a top player in blockchain-based gaming. Now, as the hype around blockchain tech continues to grow, the question on everyone’s mind is: which of these projects offers the most potential for long-term success? In this article, we’ll break down the unique features of Qubetics, Tezos, and Gala, exploring why they may be the best crypto presale to join in March 2025, and how each of these platforms is positioning itself for explosive growth. Qubetics: The Best Crypto Presale to Join for Interoperability and Real-World Asset Tokenization When it comes to the best crypto presale to join in March 2025, Qubetics is definitely one to watch.

The presale has already raised over $15.9 million, with more than 501 million tokens sold to over 23,300+ holders. This impressive feat speaks volumes about the demand for Qubetics and its vision. But what really makes Qubetics stand out? Interoperability is a key feature that sets Qubetics apart. In simple terms, interoperability allows different blockchain networks and platforms to communicate seamlessly with one another. This is crucial for businesses and individuals who want to leverage multiple blockchain solutions without being limited to just one ecosystem. Qubetics is making this process easier than ever, enabling smoother integration and connection between various platforms.

South Korea is stepping up its game, and it’s big news for anyone interested in the future of finance. The Bank of Korea (BOK) is all set to launch its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot program, and it’s got a catchy name – ‘Hangang’. This initiative is not just another experiment; it’s a bold move towards integrating digital currency into our daily lives. Let’s dive into what this exciting development means for South Korea and the global digital finance landscape. What is the Buzz About the Hangang CBDC Pilot in South Korea? The ‘Hangang’ pilot, named after Seoul’s iconic river, is designed to test the practical application of a CBDC in everyday scenarios. Starting this April and running through June, the Bank of Korea will issue digital currency to seven selected banks. These banks will then act as intermediaries, distributing ‘deposit tokens’ to a group of 100,000 citizens. Imagine using digital currency for your grocery run at the local supermarket, your online shopping sprees, or even grabbing a quick snack at a convenience store – that’s the reality South Korea is aiming for with this Digital Currency Pilot . Here’s a quick breakdown of the key aspects of the Hangang pilot: Name: Hangang Implementing Body: Bank of Korea (BOK) Timeline: April to June Objective: Facilitate everyday transactions using CBDC Participants: 7 banks and 100,000 citizens Use Cases: Local supermarkets, online shopping malls, convenience stores Why is South Korea Venturing into a Central Bank Digital Currency? The move towards a Central Bank Digital Currency isn’t arbitrary. South Korea, a tech-savvy nation and a global economic powerhouse, is strategically exploring CBDCs for several compelling reasons. In a world rapidly embracing digital payments, a CBDC offers a government-backed digital alternative to cash, potentially enhancing payment efficiency, reducing transaction costs, and fostering financial innovation. Consider these potential benefits: Enhanced Payment Efficiency: CBDCs promise faster and more efficient transactions, especially in a digitally connected society like South Korea. Reduced Transaction Costs: By cutting out intermediaries, CBDCs could lower the costs associated with traditional payment systems. Financial Inclusion: CBDCs can provide access to digital financial services for underserved populations. Combating Illicit Activities: Digital currencies issued by central banks can offer better traceability compared to cash, aiding in the fight against money laundering and illegal activities. Future-Proofing the Financial System: As the world moves towards a more digital future, CBDCs ensure that central banks remain at the forefront of monetary systems. Navigating the Challenges of CBDC Implementation While the potential benefits of a South Korea CBDC are significant, the path to implementation isn’t without its hurdles. The Bank of Korea, along with other central banks globally, is carefully considering various challenges to ensure a smooth and secure transition. These challenges range from technological complexities to regulatory and societal implications. Some key challenges include: Challenge Description Cybersecurity Risks Ensuring the CBDC system is resilient against cyberattacks and fraud is paramount. Privacy Concerns Balancing the need for transaction transparency with individual privacy is a delicate act. Technological Infrastructure Developing a robust and scalable technological infrastructure to support a nationwide CBDC is a massive undertaking. Monetary Policy Implications Understanding and managing the potential impact of CBDCs on monetary policy and financial stability is crucial. Public Adoption and Education Widespread adoption requires public trust and understanding, necessitating effective education and awareness campaigns. What Does the Hangang Pilot Mean for the Future of Digital Currency in South Korea? The Hangang pilot is more than just a test run; it’s a significant step towards shaping the future of CBDC South Korea . The insights gained from this pilot will be invaluable in informing the BOK’s long-term strategy for digital currency. By involving real citizens and everyday transactions, the pilot will provide practical data on user behavior, system performance, and potential issues that need to be addressed before a full-scale rollout. Here’s what we can expect to learn from the pilot: User Experience: How do citizens interact with and adopt the CBDC for daily transactions? System Performance: How does the CBDC infrastructure perform under real-world transaction volumes? Security and Reliability: Can the system withstand security threats and maintain operational reliability? Policy and Regulatory Needs: What policy and regulatory frameworks are necessary to support a CBDC ecosystem? Economic Impact: What are the broader economic effects of introducing a CBDC on the South Korean economy? Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency and digital finance space, the Hangang pilot offers several key takeaways and points to watch: Pilot Results: Pay close attention to the reports and findings from the pilot program, which will likely be released after June. These will provide valuable insights into the successes and challenges encountered. Bank Participation: Monitor the role and experiences of the seven participating banks. Their feedback will be crucial in shaping the future of CBDC distribution and integration. Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on any regulatory changes or announcements from the South Korean government regarding digital currencies and CBDCs in response to the pilot. Global CBDC Trends: Compare South Korea’s approach and findings with CBDC initiatives in other countries. This will provide a broader perspective on the global movement towards digital central bank currencies. Technological Innovations: Watch for any technological innovations or solutions that emerge from this pilot, particularly in areas like security, scalability, and user interface. Conclusion: South Korea Leads the Charge into the Digital Currency Era South Korea’s ‘Hangang’ Digital Currency Pilot is a significant and exciting development in the global journey towards digital currencies. By taking a practical, real-world approach, the Bank of Korea is not just experimenting with technology but actively shaping the future of finance. This initiative is poised to provide invaluable lessons and pave the way for broader adoption of CBDCs, not just in South Korea but potentially around the world.

One of the sectors generating wide interest in the crypto space is the meme sector and one meme coin that has gone viral in recent times is $DAGZ, making it one of the best meme coins to invest in now. The emergence of Cryptocurrency and Evolution of Memes The emergence of cryptocurrency as a major player in the financial industry has changed the financial world for good, it has changed how payment is made and has made it more secure, reliable, and fast. With blockchain technology, third-party intermediaries as we have with traditional banking institutions have been eliminated, and now you don’t need a central bank to validate your payment, simply put, you are your bank. It is okay if the only popular terms you are familiar with are just blockchain, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. However, you don’t need to be an analyst to invest in memes, and there are many emerging memes in the industry that you could use to expand your portfolio. One meme currently making waves is Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), an Ethereum-based AI-powered meme coin that merges artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. What are Meme Coins like Dawgz AI? Meme coins started as an internet joke and have since gained wide reception in the crypto space. The term meme can be interchangeably used with the term shitcoin, referring to cryptocurrencies without technological innovation or utility. The first meme coin is the Dogecoin (DOGE), which was created in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. And owing to the success of DOGE, thousands of other meme coins have been created. With the ever-evolving crypto landscape and the ever-growing meme culture, demands for other memes have spiked as investors are looking for meme coins with community backing to put their money. Interestingly, new projects are emerging and $DAGZ is leading the way by merging artificial intelligence with cryptocurrency. Dawgz AI staking reward program and blockchain-powered autonomy is driving innovation in the meme space. And with its AI-driven tools and deflationary token model $DAGZ is providing the utility needed to drive an increase in the adoption of meme coins as alternatives to Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and other bluechip coins. Want to know more? Check out this video: Why Investors Are Interested in $DAGZ $DAGZ is a meme coin fuelled by the community and tailored for everyone all over the world. As a fusion of meme and advanced AI trading technology, Dawgz AI was born out of a singular vision to form a decentralized community token, which will pave the way for a sustainable and technology-driven future of meme coins. While $DAGZ is still in its early stage, it is heading in the right direction and this makes it an exciting meme that every crypto lover should have an eye on. Dawg AI has adopted a presale model to ensure that the meme coin will never be singly controlled by any institution but rather, the control of the ecosystem will be distributed within its community of investors. However, to be part of the community, you will need to participate in the presale. Community-driven: $DAGZ is a community-driven meme coin tailored to suit every crypto investor. Deflationary tokenomics: $DAGZ is a deflationary token which means that over time, a portion of its supply will be burnt to reduce the circulating supply and increase its value and pricing. Institutional investment: Although the adoption of meme coins by institutional investors was slow, however, over the past months, institutional investors have been buying into memes. Utility: Memes are renowned for lack of utility, but $DAGZ is changing the game with its deflationary token model, advanced AI trading technology, and staking reward for investors. Why $DAGZ is the Future of AI Meme Coins $DAGZ is more than just a meme, it is the merging of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Even though $DAGZ may be a new coin, the solutions it provides have already piqued the interest of many crypto investors. Core Features of Dawgs AI Upcoming TGE and CEX listing: While $DAGZ is still at the presale stage, the team have confirmed that listing arrangements are being made in the background, implying the imminent launch of the token. Staking reward: The staking option allows investors to stake their $DAGZ to earn passive income, encouraging long-term holding and stability of the token. Deflationary token model: $DAGZ token burn is aimed at reducing the circulating supply over time and increasing scarcity. Trading Bots: At the core of the Dawgz AI ecosystem are its advanced Blackbox AI trading algorithms, designed by top analysts and Wall Street veterans, to automate trading strategies and optimize investor returns in real-time. Dawgz AI Tokenomics One of the side attractions of Dawgz AI is its well-defined tokenomics. Unlike some projects with sketchy tokenomics and distribution, Dawgz AI has outlined that there will be a total supply of 8,888,888,888 as stated in its whitepaper. According to the information on the project’s website, 30% of the total supply will be available for early supporters via presale. Again, 20% of the total supply will go to marketing while 10% of its total supply will be used for the liquidity pool on DEXs. Furthermore, 20% of the supply will be used to reward stakers while 15% will be used to incentivize the community. Interestingly, only 1% of the supply will go to the Dawgz AI foundation. Conclusion Dawgz AI is revolutionizing the meme coin space with its fusion of AI-powered trading bots while maintaining the meme culture. With the goal of building a dynamic and an engaging community, this will ensure investors can enjoy memes, profit from Dawg AI Blackbox AI trading algorithms, and earn rewards within the $DAGZ ecosystem.

With no rate cut expected, the Bitcoin price may continue its current sideways trajectory. That said, is there a major rally on the horizon? Rates to stay as they are If the U.S. stock market is any kind of guide to what might come out of Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, it could be that nothing much out of the ordinary could be what is generally expected, barring Fed Chairman Powell talking the market up or down in his speech after the meeting. According to the CME Fedwatch Tool, the market is 99% certain that no rate cuts will be forthcoming. This may disappoint the Trump administration, given that the President has made it clear that he wants a weaker dollar. That said, it seems that Powell still calls the shots, and until we see a weaker economy, it appears that rates stay as they are. S&P 500 continued rally or rejection?

However, the $5,670 level is proving to be strong resistance, and the price wicked through this level before coming back to settle below at the end of the day. Breaking back above this level and turning it back into support will be vital for a continuation of the upward trend. This week’s price action, especially following the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, will be key to whether the stock market regains momentum, or whether the S&P 500 might fall to the next major support level at $5,400. Bitcoin inverse head and shoulders confirmation? Source: TradingView So where does this leave Bitcoin? As it stands, the price has remained relatively stable over the weekend and into the beginning of this week. An inverse head and shoulders pattern is still in play, and the price broke beyond the neckline and has retested. If this pattern does come to fruition, the measured move would take the price out of the descending wedge to around $94,600. Just above $95,000 is the top of the last swing high and also where major resistance can be found. Weekly time frame turns bullish for $BTC Source: TradingView On the much higher time frame of the weekly, a beginning of the next potential major rally is now certainly in evidence. A new support level looks to have been found at $80,000, and the price may have found a bottom here. The first indicator below the main chart is the Stochastic RSI. It can be seen that the indicator lines have crossed, and that the blue line is above the orange. If these lines can continue to rise, and get above the 20.00 level, this will signal big upside price momentum. Below this is the Relative Strength Index. Here it can be noted that the indicator line is bouncing from the very strong 44.00 level, which has acted as firm support and resistance throughout Bitcoin’s history. The indicators are starting to look positive, and price is potentially also just beginning to react. A strong rally may not be far away. That said, Bitcoin needs the stock market. The S&P 500 must be watched closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The sharp decline came around the highly anticipated Pi 129 million token unlock worth &175M, which is expected to flood the market with additional supply, potentially driving prices even lower. Despite its strong community and initial buzz, Pi Coin’s struggles are becoming more real, with declining trust and rising concerns about the project’s future. The recent drop reflects a broader trend of uncertainty surrounding Pi Coin. Many investors had high hopes for the project, but with no clear roadmap and few major developments, doubts have begun to surface. The sell-off signals show that investors are less interested as traders move their funds elsewhere in search of more stable opportunities. Binance Listing Rejection Adds to Concerns One of the biggest letdowns for Pi Coin holders was its failure to get listed on Binance, even after 86% of the community voted in favor. Without a major exchange backing it, Pi Coin struggles to gain momentum, making it harder for investors to trade and for the project to grow. This has raised doubts about whether Pi Network is truly moving forward or just stuck in limbo. Adding to the frustration, Pi Day came and went without any major updates from the team. Many had expected big announcements, but the silence only fueled skepticism. Early supporters, including miners who have been with the project from the start, are now openly calling out the team for not delivering on their promises. Community Frustration Grows Pi Network has been in development for six years, yet there is still no clear timeline for its Open Mainnet launch. Unlike other crypto projects that maintain transparency with their communities, Pi’s developers have remained vague about the future. This uncertainty has only added to investor frustration, with many questioning if the project will ever reach full decentralization. Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin highlighted that Pi Coin has now dropped to #13 on CoinMarketCap, with its price falling below $1.30. He pointed out that the lack of transparency and progress is driving negative sentiment. The community is demanding clear updates, including a defined launch timeline, new developments such as 100 decentralized apps, and greater transparency regarding the project’s key investors and partnerships. Another analyst CryptoCove predicted Pi Coin’s drop and took profits after shorting from $1.70 to $1.15, making gains from the 38% crash. Now, he sees shorting as risky and plans to wait for a price pump before considering another short position. Can Pi Coin Recover? Despite the recent sell-off, some analysts believe Pi Coin still has the potential to recover if it secures a Binance listing. A successful listing could drive demand and spark a price surge, with some projections suggesting a possible 3X rally. However, without meaningful updates and improved transparency from the Pi Core Team, investors remain cautious. If the team continues to delay progress, Pi Coin risks losing even more market confidence, making recovery increasingly difficult.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ALTCOIN|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-18 09:56:11

41855641,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140861,1742292020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bold Move: Trump-Linked DeFi Project World Liberty Financial Invests Millions in Altcoins MNT & AVAX,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-defi-project-altcoins-investment/,"In a surprising turn of events that has the crypto world buzzing, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project reportedly linked to the Trump family, has made a significant splash in the altcoin market. Recent on-chain data reveals a substantial investment of millions into Mantle (MNT) and Avalanche (AVAX). This bold move raises eyebrows and sparks crucial questions: What’s driving this investment? What does it mean for the future of DeFi projects ? And could this signal a broader shift in cryptocurrency investment strategies? What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and Why Does it Matter for DeFi Project Space? World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that has garnered attention due to its reported connections to the Trump family. While details about the project remain somewhat opaque, its recent activity speaks volumes. The project’s foray into DeFi is noteworthy because it potentially brings mainstream attention and perhaps even scrutiny to the decentralized finance sector. The involvement of figures with political prominence can significantly influence public perception and regulatory interest in DeFi. WLFI’s actions are being closely watched as they could indicate a growing acceptance, or at least exploration, of DeFi by more traditional financial and political circles. Here’s a quick rundown of why WLFI’s entry into DeFi is significant: Mainstream Attention: Projects linked to well-known families can attract media coverage and public interest beyond the typical crypto enthusiast community. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased visibility might lead to greater regulatory focus on DeFi projects, which could be both a challenge and an opportunity for the sector. Market Confidence: Investments from entities perceived as having traditional financial ties could boost confidence in the DeFi space, attracting further investment. Million-Dollar Crypto Investment: Mantle (MNT) and Avalanche (AVAX) Grab WLFI’s Attention According to data from Arkham Intelligence, WLFI executed a strategic cryptocurrency investment , transferring $3.62 million in USDT to an address associated with their crypto purchasing activities. Subsequently, a substantial $2 million was allocated to acquire Mantle (MNT), and another $2 million was directed towards purchasing Avalanche (AVAX). This $4 million investment into altcoins represents a significant bet on these specific blockchain ecosystems. The choice of MNT and AVAX is particularly interesting as they represent different facets of the altcoin landscape, suggesting a diversified approach to their investment strategy. Cryptocurrency Amount Invested Blockchain Focus Mantle (MNT) $2 Million Ethereum Layer-2 Scaling Avalanche (AVAX) $2 Million High-Speed, Customizable Blockchains Why Mantle (MNT) and Avalanche (AVAX)? Exploring the Altcoins Choice The decision to invest heavily in Mantle (MNT) and Avalanche (AVAX) points towards a potentially savvy understanding of the current altcoins market. Both platforms offer unique value propositions within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Mantle (MNT): Betting on Ethereum’s Layer-2 Future Mantle (MNT) is the governance and utility token of the Mantle Network, an Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution. Layer-2 solutions are designed to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and reduce transaction costs. Investing in MNT could indicate a belief in the continued growth and importance of the Ethereum ecosystem and the increasing need for scalable solutions. Mantle distinguishes itself with its modular architecture and focus on data availability. Its appeal might stem from: Ethereum Scalability: L2 solutions like Mantle are crucial for Ethereum’s long-term viability as they address network congestion and high gas fees. Modular Design: Mantle’s modular approach offers flexibility and potential for future upgrades and adaptations. Growing Ecosystem: The Mantle ecosystem is expanding, attracting developers and projects seeking faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum. Avalanche (AVAX): Speed, Customization, and Interoperability Avalanche (AVAX) is known for its high transaction speeds, low latency, and customizable blockchain capabilities. It stands out as a platform that enables the creation of application-specific blockchains and offers strong interoperability features. Investing in AVAX might reflect a recognition of the growing demand for versatile and high-performance blockchain platforms. Key attractions of Avalanche include: High Throughput: Avalanche boasts impressive transaction processing speeds, making it suitable for applications requiring fast confirmations. Subnets and Customization: The subnet feature allows developers to create tailored blockchains with specific functionalities and governance models. Interoperability: Avalanche facilitates cross-chain communication and asset transfers, connecting different blockchain networks. Implications for Blockchain News and the Broader Crypto Market This blockchain news development has several implications for the cryptocurrency market and the perception of crypto assets in general. Validation of Altcoins: A significant investment from a project with potential mainstream ties can be seen as a validation of the altcoin market and its growth potential beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Increased Institutional Interest: Such moves might signal a growing interest from entities with traditional financial backgrounds in diversifying their crypto holdings beyond the major cryptocurrencies. Market Volatility and Opportunity: Large investments can influence market dynamics, potentially leading to increased volatility but also creating opportunities for informed investors. Navigating Cryptocurrency Adoption: What Does This Mean for You? The increasing crypto adoption by projects like WLFI, regardless of their background, highlights a crucial trend: cryptocurrencies are moving further into the mainstream. For individuals interested in the crypto space, this development presents both opportunities and considerations: Diversification is Key: WLFI’s investment in altcoins like MNT and AVAX underscores the importance of diversification in a crypto portfolio. Exploring beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum can potentially yield higher returns, but also comes with increased risk. Due Diligence is Essential: Always conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency project. Understand the technology, the team, the market, and the potential risks involved. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest blockchain news and market trends. The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, and staying informed is crucial for making sound investment decisions. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Altcoin Arena World Liberty Financial’s multi-million dollar investment in Mantle and Avalanche is more than just a transaction; it’s a statement. It signifies a growing appetite for altcoins, potentially from quarters beyond the typical crypto-native sphere. Whether this move will trigger a broader trend remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly adds an intriguing layer to the ongoing narrative of cryptocurrency adoption and the evolving DeFi landscape. As the crypto market continues to mature, such strategic investments will likely become more commonplace, shaping the future of digital finance.

41855732,https://crypto.news/?p=14346189,1742292116,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/41855732.jpeg,Here’s why Pancakeswap’s CAKE surged over 20% today,https://crypto.news/heres-why-pancakeswaps-cake-surged-over-20-today/,"CAKE formed a God candle on March 18, jumping 23% to hit an intraday high of $2.63 while pushing its weekly gains close to 70%. The altcoin’s daily trading volume tripled to around $1.12 billion while its market cap neared $760 million. The rally coincided with a strong interest from derivative traders. CoinGlass data shows that open interest shot up 73% over the past day to $96 million, more than tripling from $30 million seen at the start of 2025. Pancakeswap’s ( C A KE ) gains today come amid investor hype as Pancakeswap became the most active decentralized exchange by daily trading volume for two straight days . Data from DefiLlama shows that PancakeSwap hit nearly $1.64 billion in 24-hour trading volume on Tuesday, March 18, surpassing Uniswap and Raydium, which saw $1.021 billion and $334.98 million, respectively. PancakeSwap now holds over 30% of the decentralized exchange market share for that period. PancakeSwap’s impressive performance is being driven by a few key factors. One big reason is Binance’s decision to delist Tether ( USDT ) and eight other stablecoins for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) set for March 31 due to compliance with the EU’s MiCA regulations. Because of this, many Binance users seem to have moved their USDT to PancakeSwap, leading to a surge in trading volume. The DEX processed over $352.4 million in USDT trades in 24 hours, making up about 31% of its total volume. Another boost came from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who reignited interest in memecoins after a tweet inspired the creation of BNB Chain-based MUBARAK. The token has since surged over 270% in the past week. According to PancakeSwap V3 data , after Zhao mentioned MUBARAK, it became the third most traded asset on the platform, trailing only USDT and Wrapped BNB (WBNB). You might also like: Bubblemaps’s BMT rallies over 125% ahead of Bithumb listing today Meanwhile, another key factor behind CAKE’s gains today is Binance’s recent $2 billion investment in the Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX, which has boosted confidence in Binance-linked projects like PancakeSwap, which operates on Binance-backed BNB Chain. Additionally, PancakeSwap has recently burned over 9.3 million CAKE , worth approximately $23 million. Typically, token burning permanently removes these tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply, which can help increase scarcity and potentially boost the related token’s value over time. On-chain metrics indicate strong bullish sentiment. Per Santiment data , social sentiment surrounding CAKE has flipped positive, alongside a spike in daily active addresses over the past 48 hours. Further, a number of large holders were seen accumulating CAKE, likely due to confidence in its future potential. Such accumulation trends often draw in retail investors, who join in hoping for quick profits, increasing demand for the altcoin. CAKE price analysis Technical indicators also signal a sustained bullish trend over the coming days. On the 1-day/USDT price chart, CAKE has broken above a descending resistance trendline forming since Feb. 13, marked by lower highs and lower lows. CAKE price, 50-day and 200-day EMA chart — March 18 | Source: crypto.news The 50-day exponential moving average lines are showing signs of a golden cross as the 50-day EMA looks poised to cross over the 200-day EMA soon, a development that points to more gains ahead. Meanwhile, the MACD lines are trending upward, and the Supertrend indicator has turned green, both signs of a strong uptrend. CAKE Supertrend and MACD indicator — March 18 | Source: crypto.news As such, CAKE is eyeing resistance at $2.65, a breakout above this could lead it to target the $2.95 level, its highest point in February this year. But if the uptrend loses steam, CAKE might pull back to $2.33, even though PancakeSwap remains the top DEX on BNB Chain. Meanwhile, some analysts note that for the bullish rally to continue, CAKE must hold above the $2.40-$2.70 support range. If it maintains this level, it expects CAKE to gain momentum and target the next resistance at $2.90. https://twitter.com/BOBOObtc/status/1901779330771939792 Read more: Pepe coin price forms bullish patterns as CEX outflows rise Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, believes that on-chain indicators point to a bear or sideways market for the next 6 to 12 months. He posted on X today that whales are dumping Bitcoin at lower prices as liquidity dries up. Ki said , “Every on-chain metric signals a bear market. With fresh liquidity drying up, new whales are selling Bitcoin at lower prices. This alert applies PCA to on-chain indicators like MVRV, SOPR, and NUPL to compute a 365-day moving average. This signal identifies inflection points where the trend of the 1-year moving average changes.” But some X users have pointed out that his sell signal in 2020 was incorrect. One user, Dean, told Ki, “No amount of propaganda posting is going to help you with your short. Your ass will be liquidated soon.” Another pushed back, saying: “If it were over, you wouldn’t be saying sideways price action. You would just leave it at bearish price action. The bull isn’t done. The printers will run as soon as the QT ends, and the QE begins. Bitcoin bull is looking for the right ground to run hard.” Another trader challenged the bear market claim, saying, “Okay, let’s see when global liquidity kicks in, so we go higher from May into July. For now: chop and more down, yes. But it’s not the bear market, sir. No one is completing QT and cutting Fed rates in bear markets.” US stocks are reviving now While Bitcoin fights for direction, U.S. stocks have seemingly recovered after a rough week. The S&P 500 jumped by 0.64%, the Dow gained 0.85%, and the Nasdaq added 0.31% on Monday, according to data from CNBC. It was the second straight day of gains for all three. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 rose by 0.79%, with most stocks in the green, except QinetiQ, which plunged by nearly 21% after slashing revenue forecasts. Economic projections are also changing. The OECD downgraded its global GDP growth estimate to 3.1% for the year, down from 3.3%. U.S. GDP growth for 2025 was also cut to 2.2% from 2.4%. The organization cited higher trade barriers, geopolitical risks, and uncertainty as key factors affecting growth. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales rose by 0.2% in February, missing the expected 0.6% gain, though it was an improvement over January’s 1.2% decline, which was revised down from the original 0.9% drop. But stock futures slipped a bit early Tuesday after two straight winning sessions. Dow futures lost 76 points (0.18%), S&P 500 dropped by 0.21%, and Nasdaq 100 fell by 0.31%. Traders are turning their attention to the Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The focus is on Wednesday’s interest rate decision, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell set to speak afterward. Markets expect no rate cuts for now. Fed funds futures show a 99% chance that rates stay unchanged, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. But with economic uncertainty rising, traders are waiting to see if the Fed hints at a future pivot. That’s where Bitcoin bulls see their opportunity. If quantitative easing (QE) returns, Bitcoin could rally again. “I’ve been calling for a bull market over the past two years, even when indicators were borderline. Sorry to change my view, but it now looks pretty clear that we’re entering a bear market,” said CryptoQuant’s Ki. “Realized cap-based indicators show a lack of new liquidity. Massive volume around 100K failed to push the price higher, and ETF inflows have been negative for three consecutive weeks.” He concluded that he can’t keep sharing just his hopes when the data keeps signaling bearish. “I’m not going to short BTC and still hold my spot,” Ki claimed.

In the last 24 hours, the Mubarak price has seen a growth of 41%. The total market cap of the meme coin has crossed the milestone of $200 million in just two days. Notably, an early trader of this token has successfully converted his $232 investment to a $1.1 million return. Will the meme coin continue its rally? Read on! Mubarak Meme Coin’s Massive Surge At the start of March 16, the price of Mubarak was $0.03648092. At one point today, the price touched a peak of $0.206730, marking an impressive growth of 466.68%. In the last 24 hours alone, the Mubarak meme coin market has recorded a surge of nearly 41%. Currently, the price of Mubarak stands at $0.1839 – approximately 11.03% below the peak. Importantly, in the last one hour, the market has registered a drop of 3.6%. According to reports, in just two days of the launch, the total market cap of Mubarak has crossed the milestone of $200 million. Mubarak Early Trader’s Incredible Return A blockchain analysis reveals that an early trader has successfully converted his $232 investment into a $1.1 million return. The trader originally purchased at least 10.5 million Mubarak meme coin tokens by spending just 0.4 BNB tokens, worth $232. Later, he sold a part of his Mubarak holdings in return for at least 576 BNB, valued at at least $363,500. The interesting part is that the trader still holds no fewer than 5.16 million Mubarak meme coin tokens. Binance Founder’s Investment Sparks Rally According to reports, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao recently purchased at least $600 worth of Mubarak. Interestingly, CZ has made several controversial statements, triggering speculations about his strong connections with Binance’s sensational meme coin. Apart from that, Binance has extended support to Mubarak. Yesterday, Binance officially revealed its plan to launch a MUBARAK/USDT perpetual contract. The meme coin has benefited hugely from the support it has received from the Binance team.

What hurdles need to be overcome, and what does the future hold? Price Volatility: Cryptocurrency values can be volatile. For high-value transactions like car purchases, price fluctuations between the transaction agreement and completion could be a concern. Mechanisms to mitigate this volatility, such as payment gateways that instantly convert crypto to fiat, might be necessary. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Clarity and consistency in regulations are crucial for wider adoption by businesses and consumers alike. Consumer Education and Trust: Many people are still unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies. Building trust and educating consumers about the benefits and security of using digital currencies like eCash for purchases is essential. Integration Complexity: Integrating cryptocurrency payments into existing business systems requires technical expertise and infrastructure. Making this process simpler and more accessible for businesses is key to broader adoption. Scalability and Transaction Speed: While eCash is designed for speed, ensuring scalability to handle a large volume of transactions across the automotive marketplace and other sectors is crucial for future growth. Despite these challenges, the momentum behind cryptocurrency adoption is undeniable. Partnerships like the one between CryptoAutos and eCash are paving the way for a future where digital currencies play a more integral role in our daily transactions.

Several altcoins have produced notable losses over the past 24 hours, led by PI’s price plunge. BTC Stopped at $85K The primary cryptocurrency went through a highly volatile start of the previous trading week, which is in contrast of the most recent movements. Back then, the asset plunged hard on Monday and Tuesday, dropping by $9,000 within 48 hours to a four-month low of under $77,000. However, the bulls finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow another breakdown. BTC started to recover some ground and almost immediately reclaimed the $80,000 target. It jumped to $85,000 on Wednesday following favorable US CPI numbers but lost the momentum in the following days and spent the weekend trading sideways around $84,000. After another failed attempt at $85,000, bitcoin slipped to $82,000 but managed to defend that level. This resulted in another surge toward $85,000, but to no avail. As of now, the cryptocurrency struggles below $83,000 after losing about two grand since yesterday’s peak. At the same time, CryptoQuant’s CEO warned that the bull run may have come to an abrupt end. For now, BTC’s market cap has declined below $1.650 trillion, while its dominance over the alts on CG is at 58.6%. BTCUSD.

Pi Network’s native token has plunged by another 16% in the past 24 hours and now struggles to remain above $1.1. Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ripple, Shiba Inu, and Litecoin follow suit from the larger-cap alts, with losses of up to 4% in the case of SHIB and LTC. In contrast, OKB has gained over 5% and sits well above $50. AVAX, TRX, and TON are the other larger-cap alts with notable gains.

The bold move comes after MUTM’s presale has continued to ramp up, attracting $3.9 million and 6100 participants since launch. Now in Phase 3, tokens are currently available for $0.02 each with the phase quickly approaching capacity, and a price hike to $0.025 looming. Early investors can stand to lock in 25% overnight gains and 30% after the launch of Phase 4, with forecasters predicting leg-shifting returns after launch. Mutuum Finance: Dominance during Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction as a utility-driven project amidst the landscape of decentralized finance, with features including lending, borrowing, and passive income mechanisms. In contrast to meme coins, which depend upon hype, MUTM derives its value from an ecosystem in which users deposit assets such as ETH or stablecoins and mint an interest-generating mtTokens. These tokens gain in value with time and can be transacted across DeFi platforms which combines liquity and flexibility. The phased pricing structure of the presale — which starts at $0.015 and scales upwards in increments — has created a sense of urgency, with allocations for Phase 3 of the sale rapidly running out. This is because the $0.06 exchange listing means investors buying now will be showing paper gains of 200%, but this is only the appetizer before a main-course meal in pumps and action on launch. The buy-and-distribute mechanism of MUTM has been marked as a major facilitator of sustained demand, according to market observers. Platform fees are automatically used to purchase MUTM tokens from open markets and distributed back to stakers and liquidity providers. This generates ongoing buy pressure, working against volatility and rewarding long-term participants. Coupled with a $100,000 giveaway for presale participants, these features have established investor confidence and made MUTM a rare combination of utility with growth potential. ROI Calculations That Are Driving People Into Buying Phase 3 backers paying $0.02 per token stand to gain a 200% return should MUTM list at the planned $0.06. But cumulative projections for the post-launch period are much larger ceilings. According to its tokenomics and market comparables, independent evaluators have projected this could hit $3.50, or higher, within six to 12 months following exchange debuts. It would translate to a 17,400% ROI for Phase 3 buyers, which is not too far away from the SHIB millionaire’s own predictions. Although these predictions depend on the broader state of the crypto market, MUTM’s deflationary nature and real-world utility minimize the dependence on speculative trends. Moves that Have Added to Credibility With a growing momentum, the developers of Mutuum Finance are currently completing a smart contract audit with Certik, an established name in the blockchain security industry. Although there are no results out yet, the initiative is an example of the team’s commitment towards transparency − especially considering meme-driven projects don’t always undergo due diligence like this in the first place. When finalized, the issuance of the audit through Mutuum’s social channels is anticipated to expand trust and produce a new influx of capital. SHIB millionaire’s big bet mirrors broader moves towards projects combining innovation with real use. A decline which may not be surprising considering the more volatile trends behind a Shiba Inu, its investors today are seeking assets based in functionality not seasonal fads. The presale dynamics of Mutuum Finance, as well as the potential for it to reshape decentralized credit, have made it one of the top beneficiaries of this pivot. Investors ready to pocket huge returns are scrambling to get their hands on MUTM tokens before Phase 3 ends.

41859111,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140878,1742297407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bet: Tether Significantly Boosts Stake in Bitcoin Miner Bitdeer,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-boosts-bitdeer-investment/,"In a move signaling strong confidence in the future of Bitcoin mining, Tether, the entity behind the world’s leading stablecoin USDT, has massively increased its investment in Bitdeer. This strategic maneuver, revealed in a recent SEC filing, underscores Tether’s expanding influence within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Let’s delve into the details of this significant development and what it means for both companies and the broader crypto landscape. Why is Tether Upscaling its Tether Bitdeer Investment ? Tether’s decision to ramp up its stake in Bitdeer isn’t just a routine investment; it’s a calculated step that speaks volumes about their long-term vision. Here’s a breakdown of potential reasons behind this amplified commitment: Diversification Beyond Stablecoins: Tether’s core business is issuing and managing USDT. Investing in a Bitcoin mining company like Bitdeer allows Tether to diversify its holdings and revenue streams, venturing beyond the stablecoin market. This reduces reliance on a single business model and taps into the potential growth of the Bitcoin mining sector. Capitalizing on Bitcoin’s Growth: As Bitcoin’s price fluctuates and potentially appreciates over time, so does the profitability of Bitcoin mining. By increasing its stake in Bitdeer, Tether positions itself to benefit directly from any future surges in Bitcoin value. A larger share in a successful mining operation translates to greater returns as Bitcoin adoption grows. Strategic Partnership & Synergy: This investment could be more than just financial. It might indicate a deeper strategic partnership between Tether and Bitdeer. Synergies could include utilizing Bitdeer’s mining infrastructure, collaborating on energy-efficient mining solutions, or even integrating USDT stablecoin into Bitdeer’s operational framework for payments or treasury management. Confidence in Bitdeer’s Potential: Bitdeer, as a Nasdaq-listed entity ( BTDR stock ), has demonstrated a level of operational maturity and transparency that likely appeals to a large investor like Tether. Increasing investment suggests Tether believes in Bitdeer’s management, technology, and future growth prospects within the competitive Bitcoin mining industry. Decoding the SEC Filing: What We Know About Tether’s Increased Stake in Bitdeer The information about Tether’s increased investment stems from a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings are crucial for transparency and provide verifiable details about significant changes in company ownership. Here are the key takeaways from the reported SEC filing: Entity Type Shares Held Percentage Ownership Tether Parent Company Not specified individually in report, part of collective holding Part of 21.4% collective ownership Tether International S.A. de C.V. Subsidiary Part of 31,891,689 Class A shares Part of 21.4% collective ownership Tether Investments S.A. de C.V. Subsidiary Part of 31,891,689 Class A shares Part of 21.4% collective ownership Total Collective Holding Tether & Subsidiaries 31,891,689 Class A Shares 21.4% This table clearly illustrates that Tether, through its parent company and subsidiaries, now holds a substantial 21.4% stake in Bitdeer, represented by nearly 32 million Class A ordinary shares. This positions Tether as a significant shareholder and potentially influential player in Bitdeer’s future direction. Bitdeer: A Closer Look at the Bitcoin Mining Company Tether is Investing In For those less familiar, Bitdeer is not just another crypto miner . It’s a company with a distinct profile in the digital asset mining space: Nasdaq-Listed (BTDR): Being publicly traded on Nasdaq gives Bitdeer a level of legitimacy and regulatory oversight that many private mining companies lack. This listing enhances investor confidence and allows for easier access to capital markets. Global Operations: Bitdeer operates mining facilities across various locations globally. This geographical diversification can be advantageous in terms of energy sourcing, regulatory environments, and risk mitigation. Comprehensive Mining Services: Bitdeer offers a range of services beyond just mining, including cloud hosting for miners, a mining pool, and even miner equipment sales. This diversified service portfolio can contribute to more stable revenue streams. Focus on Sustainable Mining: In an increasingly environmentally conscious world, Bitdeer has been making efforts to incorporate more sustainable energy sources into its mining operations. This is a crucial factor for long-term viability and attracting environmentally responsible investors. Tether’s investment in Bitdeer aligns with a broader trend of institutional interest and investment flowing into the Bitcoin mining sector. As the demand for Bitcoin continues to grow, the infrastructure supporting its network, including mining operations, becomes increasingly critical and valuable. Implications for the Crypto Market and Crypto Miner Shares Tether’s increased stake in Bitdeer has ripple effects that extend beyond just these two companies. Here’s how this development could impact the broader crypto market and specifically the value of crypto miner shares : Boosted Confidence in Mining Sector: A significant investment from a major player like Tether can be seen as a strong vote of confidence in the Bitcoin mining industry. This can attract further investment into the sector, potentially driving up the value of publicly traded crypto miner shares . Increased Institutional Participation: Tether’s move is another example of growing institutional participation in the crypto space. As more established financial entities invest in and engage with crypto companies, it further legitimizes the industry and accelerates mainstream adoption. Potential for USDT Integration in Mining: Looking ahead, there’s potential for deeper integration between Tether and Bitdeer. This could involve using USDT stablecoin for various transactions within Bitdeer’s ecosystem, such as payments for mining services or managing operational expenses. Impact on BTDR Stock: News of Tether’s increased stake could positively influence the price of BTDR stock . Increased investor interest and confidence in Bitdeer, stemming from Tether’s backing, could lead to upward price movement for its shares. What’s Next for Tether and Bitdeer? The increased investment marks an exciting chapter for both Tether and Bitdeer. It raises questions about the future trajectory of this partnership and the potential for further collaboration. Will Tether continue to increase its stake? Will this lead to joint ventures or new product offerings? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: Tether’s Tether Bitdeer investment is a powerful signal of its belief in the enduring value of Bitcoin and the crucial role of mining in the crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, Tether’s strategic upscaling of its investment in Bitdeer is a noteworthy development in the cryptocurrency world. It highlights the increasing convergence of stablecoin issuers and Bitcoin mining operations, driven by diversification strategies, confidence in Bitcoin’s future, and the pursuit of synergistic opportunities. Keep an eye on this space as this partnership unfolds – it’s likely to have a significant impact on the crypto landscape in the months and years to come.

The token surged 70% today, reaching $0.20 after CZ, showed interest. What’s driving the bull run? The rally gained momentum after CZ made a transaction involving MUBARAK. He swapped 1 BNB for 20,150 MUBARAK, valued at around $600. This move fueled speculation, with many believing CZ’s involvement signaled a strong future for the meme coin. Adding to the excitement, Binance Alpha, a platform known for listing potential high-growth coins, added MUBARAK, making investors even more bullish. Moreover, the community took notice of this booming coin when a trader turned $232 into $1.1 million in just two days by investing in the Mubarak meme coin.

While some expect it to climb further, possibly reaching $0.500, others warn that the rally is fueled mainly by hype. Technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), suggest the coin is in an “overbought” zone. This means prices may continue to rise, but a pullback is also likely if the hype fades. If momentum weakens, MUBARAK could fall to $0.149 or even $0.108. What’s Next for MUBARAK? For now, the coin remains in the spotlight, with traders closely watching its movement. If the enthusiasm continues, MUBARAK could break new highs. However, if investors realize it lacks real utility, a sharp drop could follow. The coming days will determine whether this rally has staying power or if it’s just another short-lived crypto craze. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Elon Musk, who was once worth over $320 billion, has seen his fortune plunge by $200 billion, setting a new world record for the largest personal wealth loss in history. Since December 17, 2024, Tesla’s market value has plummeted by more than $700 billion, wiping out billions for investors. Short sellers, who profit when stock prices drop, have taken full advantage. S3 Partners reported that traders holding short positions against Tesla have seen massive paper profits as the stock continues to sink. In just the first few days of the crash, Elon lost $100 billion, and that number has now doubled. Tesla stock collapses as sales drop and political backlash grows Tesla’s stock price took a hit after Elon became increasingly vocal in European politics, openly supporting far-right groups. His involvement in politics, combined with sweeping budget cuts in federal government spending as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has driven away customers. Car sales in Europe have dropped significantly, and the backlash is growing. Per Lekander, managing partner at the $1.5 billion hedge fund Clean Energy Transition, has been shorting Tesla for years. He believes the company’s brand is in free fall. “Tesla had a very strong brand value, and Elon has managed to totally destroy it,” he said . “He’s on the wrong side of his buyership. It’s not people with cowboy boots who buy Teslas.” Even JPMorgan, one of the biggest names on Wall Street, has lost faith. The bank lowered its Tesla stock price target from $135 to $120, stating: “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly.” As of Monday, Tesla shares were trading at $238.01. Short sellers finally see profits after years of losses For years, shorting Tesla was a nightmare. Hedge funds betting against the company lost $64.5 billion on paper since Tesla’s IPO in 2010. Many firms were forced to abandon their short positions after the stock skyrocketed 1,500% between 2019 and mid-2021. In 2020, there were 300 million shorted Tesla shares, making it one of the most shorted stocks in the U.S. at the time. Now, short sellers are finally making money. The number of shorted Tesla shares has jumped 16.3% in the past month, reaching 71.5 million shares, or 2.6% of Tesla’s total shares. The company’s recent post-election gains have also been wiped out. Investors had initially believed Tesla would benefit from Elon’s close ties to Donald Trump, but the new administration’s economic policies—including aggressive trade tariffs—have rattled the market. Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings in January 2025 disappointed investors. The company then issued a warning in a letter to a U.S. trade representative, stating that Trump’s trade war could increase vehicle production costs in the United States. This uncertainty has fueled more selling pressure. Elon Musk sets world record for biggest wealth drop ever Elon’s financial losses are historic. The Guinness World Records confirmed that his $200 billion drop in net worth is the largest personal wealth loss ever recorded. In 2021, he was worth $320 billion. By early 2023, that number had plunged to $138 billion, a $182 billion loss. Now, the losses have grown even further. Before Elon, the biggest recorded personal wealth drop belonged to Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank, who lost $58.6 billion in 2000. Elon has tripled that record. At one point, Elon also lost his title as the richest person in the world. Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH, temporarily overtook him with a net worth of $190 billion. However, Elon has since climbed back to the top. As of March 5, 2025, Forbes lists Elon’s wealth at $351.6 billion. He is followed by Mark Zuckerberg at $226.7 billion, Jeff Bezos at $223.5 billion, Larry Ellison at $199.2 billion, and Bernard Arnault at $180.6 billion. Despite this, Tesla’s volatility means that Elon’s wealth is constantly fluctuating. The company’s stock remains unpredictable, and some investors argue that Tesla has become more of a meme stock than a serious investment. Marc Cohodes, a well-known short seller, called Tesla one of the biggest “glorified memecoins” on the market. “When they went up, everyone buying thought they were smart. Now they’re falling, they’re causing huge damage.” Some hedge funds are still betting on Tesla’s future. Bridgewater Associates opened a long position on the stock in late 2024, while ClearBridge, DE Shaw, and Norges Bank increased their stakes. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Villeroy de Galhau tells the French news outlet La Tribune Dimanche that the US “risks sinning through negligence,” according to Bloomberg . “Financial crises often originate in the United States and spread to the rest of the world. By encouraging crypto-assets and non-bank finance, the American administration is sowing the seeds of future upheavals.” The ECB official, who serves as governor of France’s central bank, also argues that Europe isn’t at risk of a banking crisis because the European Union (EU) is doing a superior job of supervising crypto. The ECB has also been pushing for a digital euro to counter US President Donald Trump’s embrace of dollar-pegged private sector stablecoins. ECB board member Piero Cipollone said at a conference in January that Trump’s new executive order on crypto could drive people away from banks. “I guess the key word here (in Trump’s executive order) is worldwide. This solution, you all know, further disintermediates banks as they lose fees, they lose clients… That’s why we need a digital euro.” However, vocal opposition to the ECB’s digital euro project swelled after the institution’s payment system crashed last month. TARGET2 (T2), the ECB’s real-time gross settlement system, went down in late February, which prevented payments from being processed for several hours. German MP Markus Ferber, a member of the European People’s Party, says the outage was “a blow to the ECB’s credibility.” “People will ask legitimate questions how the ECB will be able to run a digital euro when they cannot even keep their day-to-day operations running smoothly.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

These revelations, shared by Andrew on X, suggest that the case may conclude much sooner than anticipated, with XRP potentially being classified as a commodity, leading to a substantial reduction in penalties. Such outcomes could set a precedent for the broader cryptocurrency industry. UPDATE: *two* SEC sources believe @Ripple case is very close to ending. Some expected outcomes: • “expect $XRP to get serious commodity consideration.” • “greatly reduced fine; GREATLY reduced” • “new leadership knows this case and how they handle it is a big deal;… — Andrew (@AP_Abacus) March 17, 2025 Accelerated Conclusion of the Ripple Case The protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs , which commenced in December 2020, has been a focal point in the crypto community. The lawsuit alleges that Ripple conducted unregistered securities offerings through the sale of XRP. However, recent insider information indicates that the case is nearing an expedited resolution , potentially concluding much sooner than previously expected. This development aligns with ongoing settlement discussions aimed at bringing clarity to XRP’s regulatory status. Potential Reclassification of XRP as a Commodity One of the most significant aspects of the leaked information is the SEC’s consideration of classifying XRP as a commodity rather than a security. This shift would place XRP under the regulatory purview of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) instead of the SEC. Such a reclassification would align XRP with other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are generally considered commodities. This potential change has been corroborated by reports suggesting that the SEC is contemplating this reclassification in its settlement talks with Ripple Labs. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for Penalties and Industry Precedent The anticipated reclassification is expected to lead to a significant reduction in penalties imposed on Ripple Labs. Initially, the SEC sought substantial fines for alleged securities violations. However, treating XRP as a commodity could mitigate these penalties, reflecting a more lenient stance. Moreover, this outcome is poised to set a precedent for the cryptocurrency industry, potentially influencing how other digital assets are classified and regulated in the future. The SEC’s leadership acknowledges that this case could serve as a benchmark for future regulatory approaches, underscoring its potential impact on the broader crypto market. The leaked information regarding the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs marks a pivotal moment for XRP holders and the cryptocurrency industry at large. An expedited conclusion, coupled with the potential reclassification of XRP as a commodity and reduced penalties, could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets. As these developments unfold, stakeholders across the crypto ecosystem should monitor the situation, recognizing its potential to redefine industry standards and regulatory frameworks.

This urgent discussion, slated for today between 01:00 and 03:00 UTC, as reported by The Guardian, is set to address one of the most pressing global issues of our time: the ongoing war in Ukraine. For those in the cryptocurrency world, where markets react swiftly to geopolitical tremors, this news is particularly significant. Will this phone call be a catalyst for de-escalation, or will it add another layer of uncertainty to the already volatile global landscape? Why This Putin-Trump Phone Call Matters Now The timing of this phone call is crucial. The Ukraine war has been raging for a significant period, causing immense human suffering and global economic disruption. Any high-level communication aimed at finding a resolution is noteworthy, especially when it involves figures as influential as Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Here’s why this development is capturing global attention: Geopolitical Significance: Talks between Russia and the U.S., even if informal, represent a critical channel for dialogue amidst strained international relations. Potential for De-escalation: The stated purpose of the phone call – to discuss ceasing the war in Ukraine – offers a glimmer of hope for diplomatic progress. Trump’s Role: While no longer in office, Donald Trump remains a significant figure in global politics, and his engagement could influence the dynamics of the conflict. Market Sensitivity: Financial markets, including cryptocurrency, are highly sensitive to geopolitical news. Any hint of progress or setback in Ukraine peace talks can trigger immediate market reactions. Decoding the Agenda: What Will Putin and Trump Discuss? While details of the agenda remain scarce, the core focus is undeniably the Ukraine war . It’s anticipated that the conversation will revolve around: Ceasefire Prospects: Exploring potential pathways to halt hostilities and establish a ceasefire. Negotiation Framework: Discussing the conditions and parameters for future peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Humanitarian Crisis: Addressing the urgent humanitarian needs arising from the conflict and potential solutions. Broader Geopolitical Implications: Touching upon the wider ramifications of the Ukraine war on global stability and international relations. It’s important to remember that this is just a phone call , and the outcome is highly uncertain. However, the very fact that such communication is taking place is a development worth monitoring closely. Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets: Navigating Uncertainty For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, geopolitical events are never just background noise; they are often market-moving catalysts. The Ukraine war itself has already had a profound impact on the crypto space, influencing everything from Bitcoin’s price volatility to the role of crypto in sanctions evasion and humanitarian aid. Here’s how this Putin-Trump phone call could potentially affect the crypto market: Increased Volatility: News related to the phone call and its perceived outcomes can inject further volatility into crypto markets. Positive signals might trigger rallies, while negative or inconclusive outcomes could lead to sell-offs. Safe Haven Asset Narrative: If the phone call is seen as a step towards de-escalation, it could reduce risk aversion in markets, potentially impacting the “safe haven” narrative around assets like Bitcoin. Sanctions and Regulations: The geopolitical climate influences regulatory scrutiny and sanctions policies related to cryptocurrency. Any shift in the Ukraine conflict could indirectly affect the regulatory landscape for crypto. Investor Sentiment: Overall investor sentiment in the crypto market is closely tied to global economic and political stability. Progress in resolving the Ukraine war could boost investor confidence in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Traders and investors should remain vigilant and prepared for potential market fluctuations as news from this phone call unfolds. Analyzing the Key Players: Putin and Trump’s Dynamics Understanding the personalities and approaches of both Putin and Trump is essential to gauging the potential significance of this dialogue. Both leaders are known for their strong personalities and unconventional diplomatic styles. Here’s a brief comparative look: Feature Vladimir Putin Donald Trump Leadership Style Authoritarian, strategic, emphasizes national sovereignty Populist, transactional, prioritizes “America First” Diplomatic Approach Calculated, assertive, often leverages power dynamics Unpredictable, direct, often employs personal diplomacy Stance on Ukraine Views Ukraine as within Russia’s sphere of influence, seeks to prevent NATO expansion Historically critical of Ukraine’s corruption, but has also expressed support; stance can be fluid Relationship with the Other Complex, characterized by mutual respect and strategic competition Appears to have a personal rapport with Putin, despite official tensions between their nations The dynamic between Putin and Trump is unique and adds an element of unpredictability to this diplomatic engagement. Will their personal connection facilitate a breakthrough, or will their differing agendas create further complexities? What Are the Possible Outcomes? Scenarios to Consider Predicting the outcome of the Putin and Trump phone call is speculative, but considering potential scenarios can help us prepare for different market reactions: Scenario 1: Positive Breakthrough. If the phone call yields a joint statement indicating progress towards a ceasefire or negotiations, markets could react positively. Crypto might see a relief rally, along with other risk assets. Scenario 2: Inconclusive Dialogue. If the phone call ends without any significant announcements or agreements, uncertainty will persist. Crypto markets might remain volatile, mirroring broader market indecision. Scenario 3: Escalatory Signals. In a less likely but still possible scenario, the phone call could reveal deeper disagreements or even heightened tensions. This could trigger risk-off sentiment, potentially leading to a downturn in crypto and other markets. It’s crucial to monitor news sources closely for updates following the phone call to assess which scenario is unfolding and adjust investment strategies accordingly. Actionable Insights: Staying Informed and Prepared In the rapidly evolving landscape of geopolitics and cryptocurrency, staying informed and adaptable is paramount. Here are some actionable insights to navigate the situation surrounding the Putin and Trump phone call : Monitor News Aggregators: Keep a close watch on reputable news sources for real-time updates on the phone call and its aftermath. Analyze Market Reactions: Observe how cryptocurrency markets react to news snippets and official statements related to the dialogue. Diversify Your Portfolio: In times of uncertainty, diversification across different asset classes can help mitigate risk. Manage Risk Exposure: Consider adjusting your trading positions and risk parameters based on your assessment of the geopolitical situation. Stay Updated on Expert Analysis: Follow insights from geopolitical analysts and crypto market experts to gain a deeper understanding of potential impacts. By staying proactive and informed, you can better navigate the potential market ripples caused by this significant geopolitical event. Conclusion: A World Watching and Waiting The scheduled phone call between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump regarding the Ukraine war is more than just a diplomatic exchange; it’s a moment of global anticipation. For the cryptocurrency world, acutely sensitive to geopolitical winds, this event carries significant weight. Whether it marks a turning point towards peace or simply adds another layer to the complex narrative remains to be seen. One thing is certain: the world, and especially the crypto market, will be watching and waiting with bated breath for any signals emanating from this urgent conversation.

Their operations made North Korea the fifth-biggest country in terms of Bitcoin holdings. According to the UN report, nearly half of the North Korean nuclear program’s costs are covered via stolen crypto. Lazarus Group has been mentioned in the news often lately. According to Arkham Intelligence, as of Mar. 17, 2025, Lazarus Group is holding around $1.14 billion in BTC. Recently, Lazarus Group converted stolen ETH funds into bitcoins. The latest estimation shows that following the Bybit hack and money laundering operation, The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is the holder of 13,518 BTC. It places the country after the U.S., China, UK, and Ukraine ahead of Bhutan and El Salvador in terms of BTC holdings. Read more: North Korea leapfrogs Bhutan, El Salvador in Bitcoin holdings after Bybit hack The same day, it was reported that OKX had to suspend its DEX aggregator following consultations with authorities. Reportedly, the exchange employees detected a coordinated attempt by Lazarus Group to access the DEX aggregator. On Mar. 11, Bloomberg reported that the EU authorities were investigating the OKX web3 services in relation to the Bybit hack and a money-laundering operation associated with it. On Mar. 10, 2025, The Socket Research Team revealed that Lazarus Group infiltrated the npm ecosystem with six malicious packages that use BeaverTail malware aimed to steal credentials, extract cryptocurrency data, compromise developer spaces, and perform other malicious activity. The packages mimic the names of popular trusted libraries. Five other packages were placed on GitHub. Earlier, on Feb. 21, the North Korean hackers managed to conduct the biggest heist in history, according to Elliptic , stealing $1.4 billion worth of crypto from the Bybit exchange. Lazarus Group attacks Not much is known about the Lazarus Group. However, the group’s earliest cyber crimes date back to 2009. The group is acting as an advanced persistent threat (alternatively, Lazarus Group is known as APT38). It undermines global cybersecurity while using the stolen assets to compensate for the poor economic state of North Korea mangled by sanctions. In the first years, the group was targeting major banks. In 2017, hackers demanded a BTC ransom during the massive WannaCry attack attributed to Lazarus Group. The same year, Lazarus shifted its focus to the crypto sector. The first targets were crypto exchanges in the U.S. and South Korea. In a string of 2017 operations, hackers stole crypto from mining power marketplace Nicehash and crypto exchanges Bithumb and Youbit. In 2022, Lazarus hackers stole $615 million worth of crypto from the Ronin Network. Over 17% of all crypto stolen in 2023 is attributed to Lazarus hacks. WarziX and Bybit were the latest large-scale crypto exchange hacks carried out by Lazarus Group. What places Lazarus Group in a special position is that this unit is supported by the government, which is in opposition to most countries. The institutions and individuals affected by the Lazarus Group attacks were the U.S., China, Russia, South Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait, and many other countries. The outright criminal actions of this group do not result in prosecution in the homeland of these hackers, as the government seemingly supports them. Considering the fact that the Internet in North Korea is under state control, there is no chance that the hacker group’s activity is not approved or sponsored by the government. Compared to Moscow, Pyongyang cares less about its international reputation. This fact gives its hackers carte blanche and allows them to act even more recklessly. It is reported that the hackers are trained in China and at several universities in North Korea. Some of the attacks (such as the WannaCry attack of 2017) are characterized by little financial motivation, while rather being aimed at invoking panic and chaos in foreign countries. However, later attacks on crypto platforms were associated with large amounts of money being stolen. Most probably, this money is supposed to patch the holes in the North Korean budget. The group consists of several subunits of different skills. According to the NCC Group report , the hackers work methodically, using a wide range of tools, and take their time, prioritizing staying undetected for as long as possible. Mostly, Lazarus Group leans on social engineering tactics and large-scale phishing campaigns. Cryptocurrency and the North Korean nuclear program According to the UN report, around half of North Korea’s foreign currency income is generated via attacks by government-backed hackers. These funds are allegedly used to fund ballistic missile development. One of the anonymous sources referred to in the report said that 40% of weapons of mass destruction development is funded via cybercrime money. North Korea continues to test its ballistic missiles. In 2023, it tested Hwasong18, a rocket capable of carrying several warheads and flying over 15,000 kilometres. 2022 was a record-breaking year in terms of rocket launches. The number was close to 90. The latest nuclear bomb testing took place in 2017. The country holds between 50 and 100 bombs. Last year, American journalist Annie Jacobsen released the book Nuclear War: A Scenario . The book is based on interviews with retired U.S. officers who are knowledgeable about the U.S. nuclear protocol. It describes what happens if North Korea strikes the U.S. with a nuclear bomb. Jacobsen believes that in three stages, 24 minutes each, all the nuclear powers will exchange strikes, effectively sending humanity to near-total extinction that will take several years in the harsh conditions of famine and nuclear winter. Here's my conversation with Annie Jacobsen ( @anniejacobsen ) all about nuclear war, CIA, Area 51, UFOs, and government secrecy. This was a terrifying and fascinating conversation. It's here on X in full, and is up on YouTube, Spotify, and everywhere else. Links in comment.… pic.twitter.com/57f7b2CQMI — Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) March 23, 2024 Apparently, that’s not something that Satoshi Nakamoto has dreamed of while creating Bitcoin. Unfortunately, prosecution of Lazarus Group hackers is a tough task, considered nearly impossible. Only around half a dozen individuals have been indicted throughout the years, while the total staff may include over a thousand hackers, with new members getting trained all the time. DW cites the words of an analyst from the Brave New Coin company, Aditya Das, who said: “If possible, it would be good to see the actual criminals prosecuted as opposed to the applications they use. But we know how good North Korea is at hiding its tracks and denying hacking. So for now, if prosecution is not possible, then prevention is the best option.” Most probably, in this case, prevention means limiting the privacy and anonymity of the DeFi and web3 sectors in order to have more control over the funds managed by hackers. We know that an anonymous platform, eXch, didn’t immediately react to Bybit’s request to stop hackers from cashing out, allowing them to funnel $90 million in crypto before complying. The later focus on crypto stresses that this sector is handy for Pyongyang in amassing funds. Its trained hackers are savvy enough to steal huge amounts of money through crypto. Most experts believe Lazarus Group is not going to stop anytime soon. These new challenges require new solutions and finding a better balance between privacy and crime prevention.

Anonymous millionaire drags IntelMarkets on the radar after injecting $300 million amid the major Ethereum ETF outflow, hinting at a strong rally for the viral $0.09 AI coin. Table of Contents ETH forecast turns red amid massive Ethereum ETF outflow Ethereum’s technical indicators point to bearish patterns Outflows drive $750,000 into IntelMarkets’ presale IntelMarkets could explode to $0.42, claims analyst While the Ethereum ETF had turned the tables and brought the recovering ETH price back to the spotlight, the current sentiment surrounding the altcoin has again pushed it back to where it was. Amid the price speculation in the Ethereum network, IntelMarkets (INTL) is turning heads with its next-generation AI-powered tools and skyrocketing presale performance with $11m raised. ETH forecast turns red amid massive Ethereum ETF outflow The current ETH price pattern has spent the past six trading days locked in a tight range between $1,820 and $1,960, which shows that the altcoin is struggling to gain momentum. As the ETH price consolidates, market participants weigh the impact of continued Ethereum ETF outflows. A key support level near $1,886 draws significant accumulation from investors. The outcome of this consolidation phase could determine the next ETH price move. That said, the Ethereum ETFs have now recorded net outflows for three consecutive weeks, with $189.9 million withdrawn last week alone. This brings total outflows to $645.08 million within this period, signaling weak institutional interest. Ethereum’s technical indicators point to bearish patterns Ethereum’s RSI on both the 4-hour and daily charts is currently in bearish territory, which suggests the potential for further downside in the ETH price. Additionally, the 50 and 100 EMA on the 4-hour chart have formed a resistance cloud near the $2,000 psychological level. On the support side, on-chain data shows that investor supply at $1,886 has increased to 1.9m ETH. This suggests that many investors view this level as crucial and have accumulated additional ETH, creating a strong potential support zone. If Ethereum’s consolidation is driven by the accumulation of long positions, a breakout above $2,000 could shift the broader outlook to bullish. At the same time, the massive outflow in Ethereum ETFs could give ETH a hard time. Overcoming this key resistance level could trigger fresh buying momentum, potentially leading to a more sustained rally. The project is currently in a tight position, with Ethereum ETF outflows exerting pressure while investor accumulation at $1,886 offers potential support. If the ETH price remains below $2,000, it could face further downside in the near term.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs have experienced a notable turnaround, ending their streak of outflows with significant inflows totaling $274.6 million on March 17, making it the highest daily inflow since Feb. 4. All of the five Bitcoin funds enjoyed net inflows, led by Fidelity’s FBTC at $127.3 million. ARKB came second, recording $88.5 million of new inflows, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with 42.3 million, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Fund at $14.2 million, and Bitwise’s BITB at $2.3. None of the funds recorded net outflows on the day.

This was largely driven by the macroeconomic uncertainty ensuing after Trump had introduced tariffs , which offset the positive impact of his efforts to buttress Bitcoin and other assets by including them in the strategic reserve .

The 20-day exponential moving average sits at $85,559, acting as a dynamic resistance level BTC is struggling to break above. The failure to reclaim the 20-day EMA suggests that bears remain in control. If the price manages to break and hold above the resistance at $85,500, a move toward $88,000 – $90,000 could be on the horizon. However, if it drops below the $82,000 support, further downside toward the next support level at $80,000 might be in store. Source: crypto.news However, if we zoom out, the broader trend still suggests long-term bullish potential, so the $274.6 million inflow on March 17 might be a signal of renewed institutional confidence after the prolonged outflow period. According to trader Coinvo , Bitcoin price has recently broken out of the cup and handle pattern and has formed a bullish flag pattern, signalling a potential rally toward $125,000 in the coming months. So, the bearish consolidation around the $82,000 – $83,000 level could act as a base for the next upward move, provided Bitcoin can reclaim key resistance levels.

XRP is currently retesting the 20-day EMA at the $2.34 price level. If bears prevail and XRP is unable to hold the $2.18 support level, it could revisit $1.90.

Robinhood has launched a new prediction markets hub through its futures subsidiary, allowing users to speculate on political, economic, and sports outcomes. Meanwhile, Gemini has appointed Dan Chen as its new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) as the exchange considers an initial public offering and navigates a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Robinhood Expands into Prediction Markets with Futures-Focused Hub Robinhood Derivatives, the futures arm of the crypto-friendly financial platform Robinhood, has launched a new prediction markets hub within its app. The platform will initially focus on politics, economics, and sports, with plans to expand coverage over time, according to Robinhood CEO and Co-Founder Vladimir Tenev. The move marks another significant step in Robinhood’s expansion beyond traditional financial trading, bringing a new wave of user engagement through event-based forecasting. The platform's latest endeavor is powered by Kalshi, a US-regulated prediction market operator that will facilitate Robinhood’s new contracts. Tenev took to X to emphasize the broader purpose of prediction markets, calling them a fusion of ”capitalism and the pursuit of truth.” “Market incentives and the wisdom of the crowds sift through all the information out there to determine answers to well-specified questions and outcomes to important events—sometimes even before they happen,” Tenev wrote. Robinhood Derivatives is no stranger to futures contracts, particularly in the realm of politics. Before the launch of this dedicated hub, the platform allowed users to speculate on the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election. This move positioned it alongside competitors like the decentralized prediction market Polymarket and Kalshi, which now plays a key role in Robinhood’s latest initiative. The surge in interest surrounding the 2024 election was unprecedented, highlighting the growing demand for political betting markets. On Polymarket alone, traders placed over $3 billion in bets on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris would win the presidency by Nov. 4, 2024. This overwhelming engagement suggests that event-based futures trading is becoming a significant force in financial markets. While Robinhood and Kalshi are pushing forward with the expansion of prediction markets, the industry continues to face regulatory scrutiny from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The agency has long debated the legality and potential consequences of allowing US-based exchanges to offer election-based contracts. The CFTC and Kalshi have been in legal disputes over whether contracts predicting election outcomes should be permitted. The regulatory body has argued that such contracts could undermine election integrity, a concern that has been echoed by policymakers and watchdog groups. However, in October 2024, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Kalshi, stating that the CFTC failed to demonstrate how these contracts would cause “irreparable injury” to the public. This ruling allowed Kalshi to list election-related contracts, paving the way for Robinhood’s new prediction markets. Despite this victory, the scrutiny hasn’t stopped. In February 2025, the CFTC launched an investigation into Kalshi and Crypto.com regarding their compliance with regulations for a Super Bowl derivatives market. This ongoing regulatory oversight shows the fine line that event-based futures markets must walk as they expand. Robinhood's reliance on KalshiEX LLC, a CFTC-regulated exchange, is a strategic move to ensure compliance while offering prediction markets at scale. In its official announcement, Robinhood emphasized that it has been in close contact with the CFTC and aims to continue working with the agency to ”promote innovation in the futures, derivatives, and crypto markets.” By leveraging Kalshi's federal designation as a Designated Contract Market (DCM), Robinhood is positioning itself to offer legally compliant event-based futures while mitigating regulatory risks. The partnership with Kalshi also provides a layer of credibility that could make Robinhood’s prediction markets more palatable to US regulators. What’s Next for Robinhood’s Prediction Markets? Robinhood’s decision to launch this hub represents a larger trend in financial markets where event-based trading is gaining mainstream traction. Beyond political outcomes, prediction markets can offer insights into a wide range of topics, from economic indicators to sports results and major world events. The potential for expansion is significant, particularly as more traders look for alternative ways to engage with markets beyond traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies. Given the growing appetite for event-driven speculation, Robinhood’s move into prediction markets could become a key revenue driver while reinforcing its reputation as an innovator in financial services. However, regulatory hurdles remain. As the CFTC continues to scrutinize event-based futures, Robinhood and Kalshi will need to navigate an evolving legal landscape. Whether the prediction markets hub can withstand regulatory pressure in the long run will depend on how well the platform aligns itself with existing US laws and whether future legal challenges arise. Gemini Appoints New CFO Amid Potential IPO and Crypto Policy Shift Under Trump Administration In other news, crypto exchange Gemini is welcoming a new chief financial officer as the company navigates a rapidly shifting regulatory landscape under the new Trump administration. Dan Chen, a seasoned finance executive with experience at Affirm, MetLife Investments, and Morgan Stanley, announced his appointment via X on Monday. ”Crypto is the most dynamic sector in finance, and Gemini is at the forefront of this revolution — making it simple and secure to engage on the digital asset frontier,” Chen wrote in his post. Chen’s arrival comes at a critical juncture for Gemini, which has reportedly been considering an initial public offering (IPO). The move could position Gemini as a publicly traded company, further solidifying its place in the crypto industry. ”I’m looking forward to helping Gemini scale by driving financial strategy as the company enters its next phase of growth,” Chen added, signaling his focus on financial expansion and strategic positioning. The appointment of a new CFO follows a period of regulatory turbulence for Gemini and other crypto firms in the US. Under the previous Biden administration, crypto companies often faced aggressive regulatory scrutiny, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launching multiple enforcement actions against leading industry players. However, a policy shift appears to be underway under President Donald Trump’s second administration, which many view as significantly more crypto-friendly. The Winklevoss twins—Gemini’s co-founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss—were recently invited to a White House crypto summit, where they addressed the industry’s challenges over the past years. ”We never thought that we’d be attacked the way we did in our backyard after trying to do the right thing for so many years and always trying to raise the bar with respect to regulation,” Cameron Winklevoss stated, according to a transcript released by the White House. The statement sheds light on the industry's frustration with regulatory actions taken by the SEC under former Chair Gary Gensler, who faced criticism for what many saw as an adversarial approach toward the crypto sector. Gemini's regulatory landscape has seen significant changes in recent months. In March 2024, Cameron Winklevoss announced that the SEC had closed its investigation into Gemini and would not be pursuing enforcement action. The decision marked a notable shift, as the SEC under the previous administration had been actively pursuing cases against major crypto exchanges. Additionally, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) lawsuit against Gemini was recently resolved. Gemini agreed to pay $5 million to settle allegations that the company had made misleading statements regarding its products. The reversal of enforcement actions and settlements with regulators signal that the industry may be entering a more predictable and cooperative era in its relationship with US authorities. A Potential Gemini IPO? Amid these regulatory shifts, Bloomberg has reported that Gemini is exploring the possibility of an IPO. While the company has not confirmed specific details, such a move would represent one of the most significant public listings by a crypto firm in recent years. An IPO could help Gemini raise additional capital, expand its product offerings, and increase mainstream adoption of its platform. The exchange, which has long branded itself as a regulatory-compliant alternative to competitors like Binance and Coinbase, may see this as an opportune time to go public as market conditions improve. If Gemini proceeds with an IPO, it would join a select group of publicly traded crypto firms, including Coinbase, which went public in 2021.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TRADING|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-18 12:00:00

Stocks across Asia and Europe tracked Wall Street’s gains, while investors kept an eye on interest rates, consumer spending, and the latest numbers on home construction in the United States. The S&P 500 added 0.64%, closing at 5,675.12, while the Nasdaq Composite rose by 0.31% to end at 17,808.66. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 353.44 points to 41,841.63, lifted by strong performances from Walmart and IBM, according to data from CNBC. Investors were also watching gold, which surged past $3,000 per troy ounce for the first time in history. Treasury yields dip as investors brace for Fed decision US Treasury yields moved lower ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, which began Tuesday. The 10-year yield fell slightly to 4.3%, and the 2-year yield dropped to 4.042%. The Fed is expected to keep its benchmark borrowing rate at 4.25% to 4.50%, but investors will be listening to Jerome Powell’s remarks for any hints of policy changes. “Absolutely, between now and April 2, there’ll be some uncertainty,” said Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, referring to Trump’s planned tariff decisions. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) had already revised its US growth forecast downward, citing uncertainty from shifting trade policies. February’s housing starts and building permits data will be released Tuesday, followed by existing home sales figures on Thursday. Investors will be looking for signs that higher interest rates are slowing demand. A weak housing market could fuel new fears of a recession. Asia-Pacific and European markets follow Wall Street higher Asian markets mirrored Wall Street’s rally on Tuesday. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong jumped 2.29%, driven by a 12.11% surge in Baidu after the company announced two new artificial intelligence models, and China’s CSI 300 surged by 0.27%, closing at 4,007.72, according to CNBC’s data. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.20% to 37,845.42, while the Topix index advanced 1.29% to 2,783.56. Investors were watching Japan’s central bank, which kicked off its two-day monetary policy meeting. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its 0.5% interest rate, aligning with the Fed’s stance. In South Korea, the Kospi index ended flat at 2,612.34, while the Kosdaq climbed 0.27% to 745.54. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 held steady at 7,860.40, paring earlier gains. Over in India, the Nifty 50 gained 1.20%, and the BSE Sensex was up 1.07% by midday. Gold breaks all-time high as Trump’s tariffs fuel uncertainty Gold prices hit a new all-time high, crossing $3,004 per troy ounce on Friday as investors piled into safe-haven assets. Prices have climbed 14% this year, making gold one of the best-performing assets since Trump returned to office. Trump’s shifting tariff policies have created market volatility, forcing investors to seek protection. The US-China trade war, inflation fears, and concerns about a global economic slowdown have all contributed to the rush into gold. Banks have scrambled to revise their price targets. Citibank, Goldman Sachs, Macquarie, and RBC all raised their gold price forecasts in response to the rally. Since 2000, gold prices have surged tenfold, outperforming major stock indices. At the same time, investors have been tracking the US Treasury Department, which has been flooded with record-high gold reserves. Since Trump’s re-election, over $70 billion worth of gold has been transported into New York, signaling a flight to safety. Investors and businesses have struggled to keep up with Trump’s rapidly changing tariff policies, adding to concerns about economic stability. The White House is set to unveil its latest “reciprocal” tariffs on April 2, a move that could impact global trade and supply chains. Hassett confirmed that the tariff situation will remain uncertain for the next few weeks. “Absolutely, between now and April 2, there’ll be some uncertainty,” he said in an interview on Squawk Box. However, he assured that by then, there would be “absolute clarity” on the administration’s trade stance. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Bulls are losing momentum, failing to reclaim key resistance levels and hold lower demand zones, raising concerns about a potential continuation of the correction. Related Reading: 130,000 Ethereum Moved Off Exchanges – Bullish Signal? Macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility remain key drivers of price action, with erratic policy decisions from U.S. President Donald Trump adding to the turbulence in both crypto and traditional markets. The global trade war narrative and tightening monetary conditions continue to weigh heavily on risk assets, contributing to Bitcoin’s inability to sustain a meaningful recovery. However, there is a shift in market behavior that could indicate a turning point. Key metrics from Glassnode reveal that after three months of distribution, Accumulation Trend Scores hint at early signs of BTC accumulation. Historically, a transition from distribution to accumulation has often preceded a recovery phase, suggesting that investors might be stepping back in at these lower levels. The next few weeks will be crucial, as Bitcoin’s ability to hold support and attract fresh demand will determine whether the market is preparing for a rebound or a deeper correction. Bitcoin In Correction Mode – Accumulation Trends Hint At A Possible Shift Bitcoin has officially entered correction territory after losing the $100K mark, and the bearish trend was fully confirmed when BTC failed to hold above $90K. Since reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $109K in January, Bitcoin has dropped over 29%, and it appears this trend could continue as global macroeconomic conditions remain unfavorable.

Ali Martinez shared insights on X, revealing that the tide is turning for Bitcoin. After three months of distribution, the Accumulation Trend Scores model is hinting at early signs of BTC accumulation. Historically, these phases signal that large investors are re-entering the market, positioning themselves ahead of a potential recovery. This accumulation phase is a critical turning point that will determine whether Bitcoin sees a fast recovery above key supply levels or a long consolidation period before the next major move. The next few weeks will be decisive for BTC’s short-term outlook. $80K Retest on the Horizon? Bitcoin is currently trading at $83,000, caught in a tight consolidation as it struggles to break above $85K while maintaining support at $82K. This range-bound price action has left investors uncertain, with bulls attempting to reclaim higher levels and bears pressing for further downside. If bulls want to regain control, BTC must push above $89K, a key resistance level aligned with the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA). A successful breakout above $90K could confirm a recovery trend and open the door for further gains toward $95K and beyond.

However, if Bitcoin fails to break above $90K in the coming sessions, the risk of a deeper correction increases.

With market sentiment still fragile, the next major move will likely determine the short-term trajectory of Bitcoin’s price action.

The US Dollar is experiencing notable weakness, while the Euro is flexing its muscles. This currency tug-of-war is happening against the backdrop of a highly anticipated Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting and a crucial German debt vote. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding these forex dynamics is crucial, as they can ripple through the digital asset landscape, influencing trading strategies and market sentiment. Let’s dive deep into what’s causing these movements and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Why is the Dollar Weakens Ahead of the Fed Meeting? The Dollar Weakens due to a confluence of factors, primarily centered around expectations and uncertainties surrounding the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Market participants are anticipating potential shifts in the Fed’s monetary policy stance, and this anticipation is weighing on the dollar. Here’s a breakdown: Interest Rate Hike Expectations: While inflation remains a concern, there’s growing speculation that the Fed might adopt a less aggressive approach to interest rate hikes than previously anticipated. Slower rate hikes, or even a pause, can diminish the dollar’s appeal to yield-seeking investors. Economic Data Concerns: Recent economic data releases have painted a mixed picture of the US economy. While the labor market remains relatively strong, there are signs of cooling in other sectors. This economic uncertainty is prompting investors to reassess the dollar’s strength. Global Economic Landscape: The global economic outlook is also playing a role. As other economies show resilience or improvement, the relative attractiveness of the dollar can wane. Safe-Haven Demand Fluctuations: The dollar often acts as a safe-haven asset during times of global uncertainty. However, with shifting geopolitical dynamics and varying risk appetites, the demand for the dollar as a safe haven can fluctuate, impacting its value. Essentially, the anticipation of potential dovish signals from the Fed is creating downward pressure on the dollar as traders adjust their positions ahead of the official announcement. This creates a volatile environment in the Forex Market, which can indirectly impact crypto trading pairs involving stablecoins pegged to the dollar. Euro Gains Momentum: Riding the Wave of German Debt Vote Optimism Conversely, the Euro Gains are being fueled by positive sentiment surrounding the German debt vote and broader economic factors within the Eurozone. Germany, being the economic powerhouse of the Eurozone, plays a significant role in the currency’s strength. Here’s why the euro is currently experiencing upward momentum: German Debt Vote Confidence: The positive anticipation or outcome of a German debt vote often signals fiscal stability and investor confidence in the Eurozone’s largest economy. Successful debt management in Germany can strengthen the euro’s perceived value. Eurozone Economic Resilience: Despite global economic headwinds, the Eurozone has shown pockets of resilience. Certain economic indicators within the Eurozone might be outperforming expectations, bolstering the euro. ECB Monetary Policy: The European Central Bank’s (ECB) monetary policy stance also influences the euro. If the ECB is perceived as being more hawkish or maintaining a firm stance against inflation, it can support the euro’s value against other currencies, including the dollar. Geopolitical Factors: Shifting geopolitical landscapes and investor sentiment towards the Eurozone can also contribute to the euro’s gains. Positive developments or reduced perceived risks in the region can make the euro more attractive. The combination of German economic factors and potentially favorable ECB policy creates a bullish scenario for the euro, leading to its appreciation against a weakening dollar. This strength in the euro can influence cryptocurrency markets, particularly for euro-denominated crypto pairs. Decoding the Fed Meeting: What to Expect and Why it Matters for Crypto? The Fed Meeting is the central event influencing the current forex market dynamics and its ripples extend into the cryptocurrency world. Here’s what crypto investors should watch out for and why it’s relevant: Aspect Potential Outcome & Forex Impact Crypto Market Implications Interest Rate Decision Hawkish (Rate Hike): Dollar strengthens, potentially dampening risk assets. Dovish (Pause or smaller hike): Dollar weakens, potentially boosting risk assets. Hawkish: Potential downward pressure on crypto prices, especially Bitcoin and altcoins. Dovish: Potential upward momentum for crypto prices as investors seek higher-yield assets. Forward Guidance Hawkish (Signals more hikes): Dollar strengthens, future rate hike expectations increase. Dovish (Signals potential pause or end to hikes): Dollar weakens, rate hike uncertainty increases. Hawkish: Continued caution in crypto markets, potential for sideways or downward movement. Dovish: Increased risk appetite, potential for renewed interest and investment in crypto. Economic Projections Positive Outlook: Dollar may stabilize or strengthen slightly on economic optimism. Cautious Outlook: Dollar may remain under pressure if economic concerns persist. Positive Outlook: Broader market confidence could indirectly benefit crypto. Cautious Outlook: Uncertainty could drive some investors towards safe-haven assets, potentially impacting crypto flows. Actionable Insight: Crypto traders should closely monitor the Fed’s statements and press conference following the meeting. Pay attention to not just the rate decision, but also the tone and forward guidance. A dovish stance could present buying opportunities in the crypto market, while a hawkish stance might suggest a period of consolidation or correction. German Debt Vote: A Cornerstone for Euro Stability? The German Debt Vote, while seemingly specific to Germany, carries significant weight for the entire Eurozone and, consequently, the euro’s valuation in the Forex Market. Here’s why it’s a crucial factor: Signal of Fiscal Prudence: A successful debt vote often indicates Germany’s commitment to fiscal responsibility and sound economic management. This reinforces investor confidence in the German economy and, by extension, the euro. Eurozone Stability Anchor: Germany’s fiscal health is seen as a cornerstone of Eurozone stability. Positive developments on the German debt front reassure markets about the overall health of the Eurozone economy. Impact on Investor Sentiment: The outcome of the debt vote can significantly impact investor sentiment towards the euro. A positive vote can boost sentiment, leading to increased demand for the euro. Potential for Economic Reforms: Debt votes can sometimes be linked to broader economic reforms or fiscal policies. Positive outcomes may signal a commitment to reforms that can further strengthen the German and Eurozone economies in the long run. Example: Imagine if the German debt vote faces unexpected hurdles or fails to pass. This could trigger concerns about German fiscal stability, potentially weakening the euro and causing volatility in the Forex Market. Conversely, a smooth and positive vote strengthens the euro’s position. Navigating Forex Volatility: Crypto Investor’s Playbook The current forex landscape, characterized by a weakening dollar and a strengthening euro amidst crucial economic events, presents both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. Here’s a playbook to navigate this volatility: Monitor Stablecoin Dynamics: Pay close attention to stablecoins pegged to the US dollar (like USDT, USDC) and the euro (like EURS). Fluctuations in the dollar and euro can impact the perceived value and trading dynamics of these stablecoins within the crypto ecosystem. Hedge with Euro-Denominated Crypto Pairs: If you anticipate further dollar weakness and euro strength, consider exploring crypto trading pairs denominated in euros (e.g., BTC/EUR, ETH/EUR). This can potentially act as a hedge against dollar depreciation. Diversify Portfolio: Maintain a diversified crypto portfolio that isn’t overly reliant on dollar-pegged assets. Consider including assets that may have less direct correlation with the dollar. Stay Informed on Macro Events: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic events like Fed meetings, ECB announcements, and German economic data releases. These events can trigger significant forex movements that subsequently impact crypto markets. Risk Management is Key: Forex volatility can amplify crypto market swings. Employ robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes, to protect your capital.

This high-stakes trade, executed with 40x leverage, represents the largest known BTC short on the platform, sparking intense speculation and discussion among market participants. LATEST: A Hyperliquid whale placed the largest $BTC short ever, betting $520M on #Bitcoin ’s decline with 40x leverage, 6,210 $BTC at $83,898 entry, liquidation at $85,561. pic.twitter.com/mfxtdsrh6s — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 18, 2025 The whale’s position consists of 6,210 BTC, entered for $83,898 per Bitcoin. The extreme leverage applied to this trade significantly magnifies both potential gains and losses. If Bitcoin’s price rises to $85,561—a mere 1.75% increase from the entry point—the entire position faces liquidation. This makes it a highly risky maneuver, with the trader standing to either secure a substantial profit or suffer a total wipeout. Market Reactions and Speculation The bold move has drawn widespread reactions from the crypto community. Jane Adams, a well-known trader and analyst, commented on the situation, questioning whether the whale anticipates a significant correction or if this is an attempt to manipulate the market. She noted the extreme risk involved in such a leveraged position, stating that if Bitcoin drops, the whale could secure a massive payoff, but if it rises, the losses could be catastrophic. Traders Challenge the Whale’s Position The revelation of this record-breaking short has prompted counteractions from other traders. A group, reportedly organized by a pseudonymous trader known as Cbb0fe, has actively worked to push Bitcoin’s price higher to liquidate the whale’s position. In response, BTC saw a rapid 2.5% surge, nearing the liquidation threshold. However, the whale injected additional capital to adjust the liquidation price, showcasing the ongoing battle between market forces.

It also demonstrates how coordinated efforts by traders can challenge such positions, creating ripple effects across the market. If Bitcoin’s price remains stable or trends upward, the whale’s short position could be at risk, potentially fueling further price action. The Hyperliquid whale’s $520 million short is a historic event in Bitcoin trading, reflecting both the high-risk nature of leverage and the unpredictable dynamics of the crypto market. Whether this move signals an anticipated correction or a failed attempt to manipulate price action remains to be seen. For now, the market watches closely, awaiting the next development in this high-stakes bet. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Binance Coin (BNB) and Toncoin (TON) are in the green on Tuesday and both are at breakout zones. If a positive tone comes out of Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, could $BNB and $TON lead the altcoins higher? $BNB held up better than $BTC Source: TradingView $BNB (BNB/USDT) is one cryptocurrency that has braved this current crypto downturn remarkably well. Not only has it outperformed most other altcoins, but it has even held up better than Bitcoin. The $503 horizontal level proved to be very strong support, and a quick wick down to this level was bought up again in short order. Now the price is nestled up against the descending trendline of the triangle pattern. The omens for a decisive breakout are looking quite good. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the blue (fast) indicator already above the 20.00 level. If, and when, the orange (slow) line can also get above this level, sizable upside price momentum should kick in to aid the breakout and send the price higher. $BNB breaks out against $BTC pair Source: TradingView Looking at $BNB against its $BTC pairing (BNB/BTC), it can be seen that a breakout of the more than year-long descending trendline is currently taking place. There is a long way to go for $BNB to get back to its high against $BTC, achieved at the end of 2023, but a start has been made. The Stochastic RSI here is nearing the top, and therefore a slowdown in the momentum of $BNB against $BTC could start to take place. Also, the 0.236 Fibonacci level may be a good level of resistance. All this said, if an altcoin surge does happen at some point in 2025, $BNB has the potential to take advantage. $TON breaks up out of descending wedge Source: TradingView For $TON (TON/USDT) the breakout already appears to be taking place. It just remains for the price to stay above the top trendline of the descending wedge by the close of play this week. If the breakout is indeed successful, the main resistance comes in at $4.80. There may be a confirmation of the breakout, which will bring the price lower first. If this does happen, there is very strong support from $2.65 down to $2.40. $TON begins the long haul back against $BTC Source: TradingView Against its $BTC pair (TON/BTC) the price has also broken out. A candle has opened above the descending trendline and so a possible trend reversal is beginning. $TON has been down as much as 74% against $BTC, and so a bounce from here could be likely. Possible price targets are in the chart above. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

ZachXBT Exposes the Truth!,https://coinpedia.org/news/hyperliquid-whale-a-trader-or-cyber-criminal-zachxbt-exposes-the-truth/,"The post Hyperliquid Whale a Trader Or Cyber Criminal? ZachXBT Exposes the Truth! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On-chain investigator ZachXBT, known for exposing the ByBit hacker link to the Lazarus Group, has made a shocking revelation about the widely discussed “Hyperliquid 50x leverage whale.” According to him, this trader is not just making risky trades but is actually a cybercriminal using stolen funds. Who is the Hyperliquid 50x Whale? The so-called “Hyperliquid 50x Leverage Whale” gained attention in recent weeks for making massive leveraged trades on platforms like Hyperliquid and GMX. This trader has been placing high-risk bets on assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Chainlink (LINK), leading to speculation about their identity. It’s funny watching CT speculate on the “Hyperliquid whale” when in reality it’s just a cybercriminal gambling with stolen funds. — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) March 18, 2025 Some believed the wallet was linked to the North Korean hacker group Lazarus, but on-chain investigator ZachXBT dismissed these claims. He made it clear that there is no connection between the trader and Lazarus group. Instead, ZachXBT revealed that the person behind the wallet is actually a cybercriminal who is using stolen funds to make these high-risk trades. This suggests that bad actors are not just stealing crypto but also taking advantage of leveraged trading to multiply their illegal profits. Hyperliquid Whale’s Wild Bet Meanwhile, these Hyperliquid Whale is taking high risk trade with minimum 25x to 50x leverage position. On March 16, the whale deposited 2.5 million USDC into Hyperliquid, boosting a 40x short BTC position holding 4,422.77 BTC at an entry price of $84,043 and a liquidation point of $85,596. This caught the attention of trader CBB, who called on others to push the whale into liquidation . The plan nearly worked as Bitcoin’s price hit $84,583.84, coming dangerously close to wiping out the whale’s position. Beyond Bitcoin, the whale has also made high-stakes bets on Ethereum (ETH). On March 13, they opened a $45.17 million ETH short using leverage of 17.6x and 18.06x, followed by another 25x ETH short worth $35.86 million. Then, on March 14, the trader switched strategies, going long on LINK with a $31 million position at 10x leverage, while also accumulating $12 million in spot LINK. Whale Closes Positions with $9.46M Profit According to Lookonchain, a prominent blockchain analytical platform the whale has now closed all positions, securing a total profit of $9.46 million in just 8 days. While this trader has made millions, the whale’s actions have also caused instability in the market. At one point, the trader’s activities led to Hyperliquid’s liquidity pool losing $4 million during a massive liquidation event. Meanwhile, the crypto community is now debating what action should be taken against such accounts. Should exchanges block them? Should authorities intervene?

This term in trading markets is defined as a price range where movements are characterized by uncertainty, significant risk, and dynamic tension due to external events and conflicting market sentiment. With the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting set to take place on March 18-19, markets could see volatile price swings toward key BTC price levels over the next few days. The critical announcement on the interest rate will be made on March 19 at 2 pm ET. 99% chance interest rates won’t change According to CME’s FedWatch tool , there is a 99% chance that the current interest rates will remain between 4.25% and 4.50%, leaving just a 1% probability of a 0.25% rate cut.

Related: Bitcoin price fails to go parabolic as the US Dollar Index (DXY) falls — Why? Therefore, the market is focused on Jerome Powell, the US Fed chair’s speech during the FOMC speech. With respect to the recent data, Powell’s stance is likely to be hawkish. The assessment is based on the following points: Consumer Price Index (CPI) remains at 2.8%, which is still above the Fed’s 2% primary target and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index stood at 2.5%-2.6%. While CPI came in lower than expected last week, it does not encourage immediate rate cuts. Unemployment data remains low at 4.1%, with an annual GDP growth of 2.3% in Q4 2024, indicating the economy does not need immediate stimulus. Meanwhile, Polymarket now says there’s a 100% chance that the US Federal Reserve will conclude quantitative tightening (QT) by April 30, which would boost the odds of a rate cut as early as this summer.

SEC delay could crush XRP,https://finbold.com/legal-expert-warns-ripple-v-sec-delay-could-crush-xrp/,"XRP has managed to carve out a dominant position in a high-demand niche for itself. In spite of that success, the longstanding lawsuit between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a stone around the cryptocurrency’s neck. While the victory of Donald Trump, largely seen as the pro-crypto candidate of the 2024 election, was initially taken as a bullish catalyst. The SEC has, indeed, dropped several cases since Gary Gensler’s exit. Most notably, under the tenure of acting chair Mark Uyeda, the SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase. However, the regulatory body’s legal battle with Ripple has yet to be concluded . Despite widespread optimism and numerous rumors, the latest official developments in the case are months old. Whereas most market commentators seem certain the matter will soon be done with, renowned pro-crypto lawyer Bill Morgan seems to disagree, per a March 18 X post . Morgan expressed concern that continuing uncertainty about the case could eventually exert an increasingly negative effect on XRP prices. “As the weeks and months pass, I increasingly wonder whether despite all the rumours of a settlement, the continuing uncertainty about the end or continuation of SEC v Ripple appeal will eventually increasingly exert a negative pressure on XRP price.” As the weeks and months pass, I increasingly wonder whether despite all the rumours of a settlement, the continuing uncertainty about the end or continuation of SEC v Ripple appeal will eventually increasingly exert a negative pressure on XRP price. — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) March 18, 2025 It’s hard to argue that a delay in the case’s resolution would have negative consequences for XRP . Rather than giving an outright appraisal of whether or not such a development is likely, let’s take a look at the big picture, and our readers can draw conclusions for themselves. XRP adoption and price action analysis First, let’s deal with price action. The price of XRP has increased by 5.71% over the past week, bringing year-to-date (YTD) returns up to 9.44%. This is a continuation of an existing trend where the token outperforms the cryptocurrency market at large in general and leading assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) in particular, which is down 10.27% on a YTD basis. XRP price 1-week and year-to-date (YTD) charts. Source: Finbold Therefore, on the whole, it’s hard to make a case that sentiment has turned bearish. Institutional investors certainly seem to be positioning themselves as if the conclusion to the legal battle is coming to a close. Large asset managers, such as Franklin Templeton, have recently filed documentation for XRP exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), signaling a strong degree of optimism on the side of Wall Street. Retail adoption is also on the uptake, as the number of XRP addresses has reached a record high of 7 million . Taking a more short-term view, investors and traders should also consider supply and demand dynamics. Ripple has moved roughly $465 million worth of March’s sell reserve — and while that would normally put downward pressure on prices, thus far, XRP whales have proven willing to absorb the additional supply. Meanwhile, technical analysts have outlined a case for a surge to price levels as high as $15 . For the time being, the price of XRP has moved away from the crucial $2 support level , indicating that the bulls are currently dominating the narrative. Rumors point to a speedy conclusion to the Ripple v. SEC case So, what about the actual case? While it should be taken with a grain of salt, the latest significant ‘scoop’ regarding the Ripple v. SEC case came from prominent Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett. In a March 12 X post , she claimed that two “well-placed sources” conveyed that the delay that has been seen thus far is actually the result of Ripple’s own legal team negotiating for more favorable terms regarding an earlier district court ruling made in August. 🚨SCOOP: Two well-placed sources tell me that the @SECGov vs. @Ripple case is in the process of wrapping up and could be over soon. My understanding is that the delay in reaching an agreement is due to Ripple's legal team negotiating more favorable terms regarding the August… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 12, 2025 So, why would Ripple make such a move? It’s quite simple — that August ruling also included a permanent injunction that prevents the sale of XRP to institutional investors. Such an order presents a major roadblock for XRP’s further growth — so it makes sense that Ripple would push for its removal. Featured image via Shutterstock The post Legal expert warns Ripple v.

According to McGlone, this potential destabilization could echo past downturns such as the Great Depression in 1929 and the Dot-com bubble of 1999, he said in an X post on March 17. His analysis was based on Dogecoin’s market cap trajectory alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold , hinting at vulnerabilities in these assets. The expert drew a parallel between Dogecoin’s past rise and the speculative bubbles that preceded major market downturns. McGlone argued that even if Dogecoin’s market cap were to lose three zeros, effectively slashing it by 99.9%, it would remain “silly expensive,” possibly highlighting its lack of utility. “Silliness of 1929, 1999? Dogecoin, the joke coin, could lop off three zeroes from market cap and still be silly expensive. The chart may show what it might mean for Bitcoin/gold,” he said. Dogecoin market cap trajectory. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Dogecoin’s evolution It’s worth noting that Dogecoin has evolved over the years, emerging as a key player in the cryptocurrency space. The community has moved to increase its utility, with the asset receiving different use cases, such as payments. Notably, input from influential individuals such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk has been central to DOGE’s rise. Generally, McGlone’s concern is Dogecoin’s potential to influence Bitcoin and gold, which are viewed as safe havens or stores of value. McGlone’s warning taps into broader anxieties about the crypto market’s susceptibility to crashes, especially given the changing regulatory environment and uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Moreover, the strategist’s reference to the 1929 stock market crash and the dot-com bubble suggests the impact of unchecked speculation leading to collapses. This raises questions about whether Dogecoin’s valuation could be the tipping point for a new financial crisis. Contrasting crypto and gold performance Indeed, his warning comes as cryptocurrencies and gold markets depict contrasting performances. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $82,812, showing consolidation over the past week, with the asset up a modest 1.4%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is also facing bearish sentiment, aligning with the general market trend. At the time of reporting, DOGE was valued at $0.16, up over 3% in the past seven days.

The precious metal is valued at $3,023, rallying almost 4% in the past week. Gold one-day price chart. Source: TradingView The yellow metal’s surge has been driven by emerging geopolitical uncertainties, with investors seeking it as a hedge against risk amid renewed conflicts in the Middle East and concerns over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Interestingly, as reported by Finbold, McGlone had warned that rising gold prices could trigger a possible Bitcoin price crash, with $10,000 as the next potential target. To this end, with gold up 15% in 2025 while Bitcoin has dropped by the same amount, the expert sees this inverse trend as a shift in demand from risk assets to safe havens.

41860365,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140975,1742300041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Crypto Dominance: South Korea Examines Upbit’s Market Grip,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-upbit-dominance-concerns/,"Is South Korea’s cryptocurrency market heading towards a monopoly? Recent reports suggest the nation’s financial watchdogs are taking a closer look at Upbit, the dominant crypto exchange, and its commanding share of the market. For crypto enthusiasts and investors in South Korea and beyond, this development could signal significant shifts in the regulatory landscape and the competitive dynamics of the digital asset space. Let’s delve into the unfolding situation and understand what it means for the future of crypto in South Korea. Why is South Korea Crypto Exchange Dominance Under Scrutiny? The core issue revolves around market concentration. Imagine one player controlling nearly 70% of any market – that’s the situation with Upbit in South Korea’s crypto exchange arena, according to a Decenter report. This level of exchange market dominance raises several red flags for regulators concerned about fair competition and consumer protection. Here’s a breakdown of the key concerns: Limited Competition: When one exchange holds such a significant Upbit market share , it can stifle innovation and reduce choices for users. Smaller exchanges may struggle to compete, potentially leading to less competitive trading fees, fewer diverse crypto offerings, and slower adoption of new technologies. Potential for Market Manipulation: While there’s no suggestion of wrongdoing by Upbit, excessive market power in the hands of a single entity can theoretically increase the risk of market manipulation. Regulators are keen to ensure a level playing field and prevent any single exchange from unduly influencing market prices. Systemic Risk: If a dominant exchange faces operational issues or security breaches, the impact on the entire South Korea crypto market could be amplified. A more diversified market is generally considered more resilient to shocks. Fair Pricing and Fees: With reduced competition, there’s less pressure on the dominant exchange to offer the most competitive fees and pricing. This could potentially disadvantage users in the long run. What Actions are South Korean Authorities Considering for Crypto Regulation South Korea? The report indicates that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) are jointly exploring solutions. This inter-agency collaboration underscores the seriousness with which the South Korean government is treating this issue. While specific measures are still under discussion, here are some potential avenues they might explore regarding crypto regulation South Korea : Increased Scrutiny and Oversight: Expect heightened regulatory attention on Upbit’s operations, compliance measures, and market practices. This could involve more frequent audits and stricter reporting requirements. Promoting Fair Competition: The KFTC, focused on fair trade, might explore measures to level the playing field for smaller exchanges. This could involve initiatives to reduce barriers to entry or ensure fairer access to banking services and other essential infrastructure. Market Structure Reforms: More drastic measures could involve structural reforms to the exchange market itself. While less likely in the immediate future, regulators might consider policies that encourage greater decentralization or limit the market share of any single exchange in the long term. Consumer Protection Enhancements: Regardless of market share concerns, regulators are always focused on protecting consumers. We can anticipate continued efforts to enhance investor education, improve exchange security standards, and strengthen mechanisms for dispute resolution. The Impact of Upbit Market Share on the Broader Crypto Ecosystem Upbit’s significant Upbit market share isn’t just a domestic South Korean issue; it has implications for the broader global crypto ecosystem. South Korea is a major crypto market, and developments there often resonate internationally. Here’s why Upbit’s dominance matters on a larger scale: Aspect Impact of High Upbit Market Share Global Crypto Liquidity South Korea is a significant source of crypto trading volume. Concentration in one exchange could potentially impact global liquidity and price discovery, especially for Korean Won trading pairs. International Exchange Competition The regulatory approach in South Korea could influence how other jurisdictions view and regulate exchange market dominance. It might set a precedent for other countries grappling with similar issues. Innovation in Crypto Services A less competitive market in South Korea could potentially slow down the pace of innovation in crypto services and product offerings within the country. Investor Sentiment Regulatory uncertainty and market structure changes can impact investor sentiment. Clear and well-communicated regulatory frameworks are crucial for maintaining confidence in the South Korea crypto market . What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors in South Korea? For crypto investors in South Korea, the ongoing discussions are worth monitoring closely. While the exact outcomes are uncertain, here are some potential takeaways and actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in crypto regulation South Korea . Follow reputable news sources and official announcements from the FSC and KFTC. Diversify Your Exchange Usage: Consider using multiple crypto exchanges to reduce reliance on a single platform. This can mitigate risks associated with any potential regulatory changes or operational issues at one exchange. Understand Regulatory Changes: Be prepared for potential changes in regulations that could impact how crypto exchanges operate and how you interact with them. Long-Term Perspective: Regulatory scrutiny is a sign of the maturing crypto market. While it might create short-term uncertainty, robust and fair regulation can contribute to the long-term health and sustainability of the crypto ecosystem. Navigating the Future of South Korea’s Crypto Exchange Landscape The move by South Korean authorities to address South Korea crypto exchange dominance signals a proactive approach to ensuring a healthy and competitive crypto market. While the discussions are in their early stages, the involvement of both the FSC and KFTC indicates a comprehensive review of the situation. The outcome of these deliberations will likely shape the future of the crypto exchange landscape in South Korea and could serve as a model for other jurisdictions grappling with similar market concentration issues. For participants in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, staying informed and adaptable is key as this regulatory narrative unfolds.

The known addresses of Buterin minted more DAI, while also selling several meme tokens. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, started trading actively again, shedding meme token holdings. One of Buterin’s known wallets minted DAI and liquidated the holdings of several meme tokens. Buterin minted 315,382 DAI in a single transaction, a way to tap the liquidity of some of his holdings. DAI remains a DEX-traded token that usually remains within the Ethereum ecosystem, as most centralized exchanges have discontinued support for its trading. DAI is used within DeFi, as an alternative to liquidating ETH or other holdings. The recent transactions came from a relatively small wallet of Buterin’s, using the vitalik.eth address. After the latest transactions, Buterin retained only 772.6 ETH as a final balance. The wallet has supported multiple altcoin and token projects, but Buterin still refuses to bull-post Ethereum, despite the price slide. Buterin makes a windfrall on Dohrnii The latest balances in Buterin’s wallet show he made his biggest recent windfall from the Dohrnii (DHN) project. After months of inactivity, DHN started expanding in early 2025 and went vertical in the past few days. Dohrnii (DHN) was controlled by the team, with one wallet engaged in high-velocity trading and possibly inflating the price artificially. | Source: Bubblemaps DHN peaked at over $46, as Buterin sold while the token was still trading above $40. The main wallet liquidated 5,000 DHN for 65.19 ETH. Buterin used the Rabby exchange for the swap, as DHN has extremely limited listing venues. The token is considered a potential scam, or a liquidity-draining project, but the relatively large liquidation from Buterin’s wallet went through. While the proceeds were small, some praised Buterin’s decision not to be used to advertise new and risky projects. The Dohrnii Labs project aims to offer an educational platform for personal and crypto finance. The project also reached out to Buterin for an OTC deal to avoid further dumping on the market. Hey @VitalikButerin , we’d love to buy out your $DHN in an OTC deal to minimize market fluctuations from future sales. https://t.co/5Rc9jGbU8a — Dohrnii Labs (@Dohrnii_io) March 18, 2025 Buterin’s sale coincides with rising skepticism about the DHN token. The project achieved a near-impossible feat, a vertical climb and rapid appreciation during a bearish market. DHN is illiquid , lacking transparent data on exchanges, and may be artificially inflated. Currently, the Dohrnii Labs team still controls 85% of the token’s supply. One of the hot wallets, containing another 9.99% of the supply, is also engaged in high-velocity trading. The insider holdings and high volumes could create a false security that DHN is a legitimate asset. DHN was suspected of creating a liquidity farm , with insider trading and spoof volumes. For now, the project remains insecure and this may be one of the reasons Buterin divested some of the holdings. Buterin retains 5,000 DHN valued a little over $200K after completing his selling. The action did not crash the price to zero but may have contributed to halting DHN’s rally. Previously, Buterin had received the tokens for free. The transactions for 10,000 DHN were completed 47 days ago, but Buterin still chose the day of the most active pump to divest the tokens. DHN reached a market cap above $17B, though its trading remained limited to $500K, suggesting not all holders would be able to cash out. The token also had extremely slim liquidity pools. It is common practice for new projects to send tokens to Buterin’s public wallet as a tool for exposure. However, Buterin has always warned that he will sell and use the funds for donations. Buterin sheds meme token holdings Buterin also liquidated both new and old tokens, to bring the total proceeds to 71.69 ETH. He even liquidated remnant SHIB holdings for 0.98 ETH. The other tokens included FML, VB and AWESOME. Previously, Buterin has refused support or posting on behalf of meme projects. After the sales, Buterin holds KyberNetwork (KNC) valued at $250K, as well as multiple dust amounts of tokens. Following the recent sales, the price of ETH hardly reacted. The asset traded at $1,907.56, still pressured by an overall bearish sentiment. Ethereum is also not as widely used for new launches and memes, raising questions about the network’s future and Buterin’s role in the project’s appeal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The memecoin has been trading below this level since March 8. While top memecoins are struggling to regain their momentum, savvy investors are turning their attention to high-utility assets like IntelMarkets (INTL) and Cardano. IntelMarkets, an innovative crypto project, powered by AI, is making headlines with its cutting-edge trading technology and impressive growth potential. Its price has risen by 900% to its current value of $0.091. Those who join the ongoing cryptocurrency ICO could see 360% ROI after launch. Cardano (ADA) Forms Bullish Inverted Head and Shoulders Pattern Crypto Diplomat, an analyst, points out that the Cardano price has created a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern. He noted the Cardano price is on the verge of breaking out and investors should be on the lookout. Closing above $0.76 on the 4-hour chart could push the Cardano price up by about 10%. This will take the ADA price to the $0.85 zone. However, the analyst cautioned that the 200 EMA resistance ($0.83) might present a bit of a hurdle. So, investors should watch for a breakout above $0.83 before a rally might begin. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Cardano price is trading within a narrow range. It has been consolidating between a weekly low of $0.66 and a weekly high of $0.75. The Cardano price has to break out of this range to begin an uptrend. In the case of a breakout, the Cardano price must battle the resistance around the $0.791732 level. Dogecoin (DOGE) Could Surge To $0.2, Says Analyst A top crypto enthusiast known as Trader Tardigrade has forecasted the Dogecoin price might pump to $0.2 soon. He noted the Dogecoin price is trading in an ascending triangle and has been forming higher lows in the past 4 hours. If the Dogecoin price stays above the upper trendline, Trader Tardigrade notes that the $0.2 target could happen. Another analyst called Crypto General says the Dogecoin price is gaining momentum which could mean that a breakout is coming. The analyst says the Dogecoin price might pump to $0.9 soon. Amid these bullish Dogecoin price predictions, the memecoin is under bearish pressure. CoinMarketCap data indicates the Dogecoin price has dropped by 38.0% on the monthly level. The Dogecoin price has been trading below the $0.18 resistance in the past seven days. To reclaim the $0.2 level, the DOGE price must surpass this resistance. IntelMarkets (INTL) Attracts Investors With AI and Massive ROI As the Dogecoin price dips, IntelMarkets (INTL) is really picking up steam as it moves forward with its crypto ICO, offering INTL tokens at just $0.091, with an exciting projected increase of 400% once it launches.

Successful applicants will receive 0% fees for the first two months and a special two-year founding miner agreement. In addition to the launch announcement, DMND also confirmed the successful closing of its venture capital financing in Q4 2024, led by Trammell Venture Partners (TVP). “The Bitcoin mining industry has a key problem which I’ve pinpointed over my 10-year career: mining pool centralization,” said Alejandro de la Torre , DMND co-founder and CEO. “This is why it is paramount that we make Stratum V2 a reality. SV2 will help decentralize Bitcoin mining by allowing miners to build their own blocks. With the release of DMND pool—the world’s first Stratum V2 pool—we help combat this problem – a historic moment in Bitcoin.” Stratum V2 represents a major evolution in Bitcoin mining, offering enhanced decentralization, privacy, and security by enabling miners to construct their own block templates. Unlike traditional mining pools, where pool operators dictate transaction selection, Stratum V2 shifts control back to miners. DMND’s pool implements end-to-end encryption to prevent hashrate hijacking, ensuring greater security for mining operations. Additionally, its SLICE payment system introduces auditable transactions and no hidden fees, guaranteeing maximum miner payouts in a fair and transparent manner. The mining industry has long struggled with opaque fee structures and centralized block construction. DMND’s implementation of Stratum V2 and the SLICE payment system aims to address these issues, ensuring fairer payouts and greater control for miners while reinforcing Bitcoin’s decentralization. “The mining pool industry is one where murky fee payouts and relative centralization have become the norm,” said Christopher Calicott, TVP’s managing director and founding partner. “By empowering mining operators to securely and privately design their own block templates while facilitating radical transparency and fairness of payments to mining pool participants, DMND will bring a new era to the mining industry. Mining operators of any size—from small home miners to publicly traded giants—will all work to enhance Bitcoin’s decentralization.” Mining operators interested in contributing to the first-ever Stratum V2 block can apply via DMND’s official website . Applications for launch participants will close on March 28, 2025, at midnight PST. For more information on DMND and the Stratum V2 mining pool, visit their website .

According to analytical insights from Glassnode, the Ethereum Cost Basis Distribution metrics have displayed an upsurge in supply at $1,886, an increase from 1.6 million Ether to 1.9 million Ether. According to Glassnode, this development points to a potential short-term price floor. Investors reinforce support at the $1,886 price level, with continuous accumulation at lower levels. The data above notably aligns with the custom capitulation metric for ETH, which is achieved through integrating CBD and Realized loss data. The figures are derived from the application of weighted sell volumes and account for non-linear economic pain. Since March 11, #Bitcoin 's Accumulation Trend Score has risen above 0.1, indicating some buying during the recent downtrend. While distribution remains dominant, this shift suggests early signs of accumulation. pic.twitter.com/efdIINrNbV — glassnode (@glassnode) March 17, 2025 Long-term price predictions remain bullish despite Ether remaining in a downtrend Ethereum (ETH) remains in troubled waters as the ETH/BTC ratio dips to 0.022, a level last seen in May 2020. A 30% monthly decline has been recorded as the asset fails to remain within the $2,1000 critical support area. As the global market cap decreases, leading assets like Ether have struggled to stay afloat. In the last seven days, ETH lost over 5% of its weekly gains. At report time, Ether trades for $1,914, with daily losses increasing by 0.26%. Despite Ether recording a 60% decline from its $4,891 all-time high, analytical institutions maintain a bullish outlook.

As the SOL token exhibits bearish signals amidst a massive whale sell-off, experts hope for a bullish reversal in March 2025. At the same time, INTL is gaining investors' interest by raising over $11.4 million in its presale and guaranteeing 400% gains from a presale price of $0.09 to $0.42 upon listing. As the AI-backed altcoin continues to gain traction, experts believe INTL is set to dominate the altcoin market in 2025. Continue reading to find out more. IntelMarkets: Driving Innovation Through AI-Powered Features As the SOL token exhibits bearish signals, IntelMarkets emerges as a promising investment, poised to deliver massive gains. INTL is an AI-backed project set to revolutionize conventional trading. While the traditional trading system is geared toward whales and large institutional investors, INTL caters to the needs of novice and seasonal traders. New traders often struggle to make decent profits due to a lack of market knowledge and experience. However, INTL aims to change that through its Copy Trading Feature. Through this feature, inexperienced traders could make massive gains simply by following and copying the trades of INTL’s in-house trading team. Additionally, INTL’s Intelli-M tool further simplifies trading for novice investors.

In line with this vision, investors will get access to INTL’s 1000x leverage function.

So, in response, INTL is set to release Route X21, a cutting-edge quantum-proof security solution, to counter cyber attacks by quantum computers. Route X21 would safeguard user assets against malware and cyber attacks by quantum computers, ensuring top-notch security. The Solana Price Dips: Will March 2025 Bring a Rebound? Although the SOL token has always remained one of the top performers in the crypto market, the altcoin is facing substantial resistance right now. At the time of writing, the Solana price is fluctuating around the $127 mark, depreciating by over 1% from last week’s high. Source: CoinMarketCap Experts attribute the recent Solana price to surging selling pressure due to a massive whale sell-off on March 11. Additionally, the SOL token is also battling negative market sentiment due to the SEC’s delay on Solana (SOL) ETF approval. However, despite the bearish Solana price, experts remain hopeful for a bullish reversal by the end of March 2025. According to a recent report, FalconX and StoneX have successfully executed the first-ever Solana (SOL) futures block trade on the CME group. This news is expected to cause a bullish uptick in the SOL token’s price. Furthermore, according to Changelly, the Solana price is expected to touch the $146 mark by the end of March 2025. As the Solana price dwindles, experts look for alternative high-yield projects like INTL to multiply their gains. IntelMarkets’ Presale Almost Sold-Out: Last Chance to Grab INTL at $0.09 Contrary to the recent Solana price, IntelMarkets is showing remarkable presale performance. Besides offering attractive features, INTL is offering exclusive incentives to early investors. The altcoin has already progressed to stage 10 of its public presale, having raised over $11.4 million. Currently, INTL tokens are available for only $0.09 each but this price will surge to $0.42 once it is listed officially. Early investors stand to benefit from exclusive perks like trading fee discounts and special bonuses. Furthermore, large-scale INTL holders can avail of additional benefits by enrolling in INTL’s Quantum Levels program. By at least buying one million tokens, users will get access to passive income generation opportunities and a 200% bonus on tokens. Final Thoughts As the SOL token battles uncertainty, experts hope for a bullish movement in March 2025. Meanwhile, investors have shifted their focus towards profitable investment options like IntelMarkets for guaranteed 400% returns. The AI-backed altcoin is showing stunning presale performance and rapidly gaining traction in the altcoin market. With its presale nearing completion, experts warn this could be the last chance to grab INTL tokens at a bargain before they explode in value.

A new presale, IntelMarkets (INTL), brings disruptive innovations that might alter how investors interact with the market. With over $11 million raised in presale, experts are now focused on IntelMarkets, which presents itself as an AI-based cryptocurrency platform that strives to reshape trading. Its team of OpenAI and MIT engineers and strong presale positions INTL as a top 2025 investment opportunity. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI Crypto That Could Deliver 20x Gains IntelMarkets (INTL) demonstrates strong indications of emerging as the next 20x gainer. INTL stands apart from traditional cryptocurrencies because it utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) within a trading platform to increase profitability for users. The platform departs from regular exchange practices because it employs AI models to process extensive datasets before executing profitable trades efficiently. IntelMarkets’ technological improvement provides traders with enhanced market control in crypto’s volatility. Allowing users to trade with 1,000x leverage, savvy traders maximize their chances to profit from the bear market. IntelMarkets has seen tremendous market success because the project raised more than $11.4 million during the presale period. With INTL tokens priced at $0.09, early investors are set for 351% gains with an announced listing price of $0.42. Market analysts believe INTL will revolutionize the AI industry because large numbers of investors have shown strong confidence in the project. XRP Price History: Can It Still Deliver 20x Gains? As one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, Ripple (XRP) serves as a primary platform that provides quick and low-cost international transactions. The currency achieved its highest value at $3.84 when XRP’s price reached its peak point in the 2018 market surge. XRP’s price failed to get back to previous levels because of intense SEC legal campaigns against the asset as well as the regulatory oversight it received. Ripple maintains its market price at $2.34 while a daily transaction volume exceeds $3.73 billion. XRP’s price has seen a 14% increase over the last week, a strong sign of a potential rally for Ripple. Analysts claim that Ripple’s high market cap prevents XRP’s price from achieving a 20x return. If Ripple were to 20x, its market cap would reach $2.8 Trillion-the current valuation of the entire crypto market. XRP’s price could be primed for gains, however, 20x gains are off the table for Ripple. Conclusion: IntelMarkets (INTL) is the Clear Winner for High-Growth Investors Current market conditions allow investors to achieve 20x gains even in a bear market with INTL’s 1,000x leverage. The value of Ripple persists in the market yet its capability for substantial acceleration is restricted because of its market size. The AI-powered IntelMarkets platform combined with its disruptive financial market strategy offers investors a modern scalable investment opportunity. IntelMarkets presale now represents an exceptional opportunity for individuals who wish to lead the upcoming market trend. INTL tokens present an opportunity to generate life-changing financial rewards since it maintains strong investor interest and innovative functionality while maintaining a fairly small market capitalization.

What Will Be the Impact on Bitcoin? Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/michael-saylors-strategy-stock-prices-created-a-double-bottom-formation-what-will-be-the-impact-on-bitcoin-here-are-the-details/,"The strategy (STR) may be on the verge of a bullish breakout as the price chart is forming a double bottom formation, which is a classic downtrend exhaustion and potential rally signal. Strategy's Double Bottom Formation Could Signal Potential Bull Run A double bottom formation occurs when an asset forms two consecutive bottoms at similar price levels and then breaks above a significant resistance level (the “neckline”). In Strategy’s case, the stock has bounced around $230 twice since late February, with the neckline resistance hitting $320.94 in early March. Technical analysts note that the gap between the lows and the neckline is above 35%, reinforcing the strength of the formation. If STR successfully breaks above $320.94, the expected upside target according to traditional charting techniques is $410. Moreover, STR broke out above the downtrend line that has been in place since the November high at $543, further supporting the bullish case. The strategy’s double bottom formation is in sharp contrast to the double top formation seen in Bitcoin (BTC) earlier this year, which was a signal that warned of a recent crypto sell-off. BTC’s double-top crash occurred on February 24, when prices fell below $91,000, confirming a downtrend reversal. The decline accelerated, with Bitcoin falling to $76,800 last week. The Nasdaq index, which is dominated by tech stocks, experienced a similar crash earlier this month. According to Chartered Market Technician (CMT) studies, double bottom and double top formations have low failure rates, meaning successful breakouts or crashes tend to trigger sustained price trends. As the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder, Strategy’s stock is often seen as a proxy for BTC price movements. The company currently holds 499,096 BTC, worth around $41.5 billion at current market prices. If MSTR does break out of the double bottom, it could signal renewed bullish momentum not just for the stock but also for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. *This is not investment advice.

The promotional ad, which racked up over 1.2 million views, was removed after a nearly nine-hour run. Despite taking down the contentious ad, Solana continues to face intense scrutiny and criticism from its community. Several users have reposted the video on X, labelling it offensive, divisive, and cringe. Solana Faces Criticism for Gender Identity Portrayal, Removes Ad On March 17, the official X account of the Solana Foundation shared a commercial video that portrayed the United States as a man in therapy. The man was shown struggling to concentrate on crypto, space travel, and other technological pursuits due to the distraction of societal debates on pronouns and gender identity. The promotional ad that reached more than 1.2 million views quickly created a negative reaction within the crypto community for its gender identity portrayal. Tyler Bench, CRO of on-chain governance platform Tally.xyz, expressed strong disgust towards the Solana ad. He deemed that ad as “the single most toxic piece of content” that he has ever seen. Further, Bench compared the ad to Coinbase’s ads, but with a disturbing twist: “created by an incel who hasn’t left the basement in years.” Why Did the Ad Face Community Backlash? Notably, Solana’s now-deleted ad presented a man who represented America. The man, who was undergoing a therapy, expressed concerns of his inability to focus on technological aspects including crypto. In response to the man’s worries, the therapist asked him to come up with a “new gender,” sparking controversy. Significantly, the psychologist’s statement sparked criticism for its perceived political bias and polarizing tone. It conveyed a hint of irony that subtly mocks contemporary discussions on gender identity. In response to the ad titled “America is Back—Time to Accelerate,” Anneri van der Merwe, product lead at Base, shared an X post, stating, Offensive, cringe, and pandering. Base is for everyone. Solana co-opted the ‘is for everyone’ phrase last week too. This ad shows there’s still a long way to go in truly embracing that ethos. Solana Continues to Face Criticism Despite Ad Removal Though Solana removed the advertisement, the community continues to criticize the team for their tone-deaf post. Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, wondered how the ad cleared multiple review stages without raising any red flags. Following the ad’s removal, Cochran accused that Solana withdrew the post only to mitigate reputational damage, rather than acknowledging the mistake. Moreover, Blocknative COO Sean O’ Connor strongly condemned the video, addressing it extremely insensitive. He posited that the ad’s timing was particularly inappropriate given the current challenges faced by trans citizens in obtaining legal documentation and recognition. This controversy comes following the substantial growth of Solana-based Mubarak meme coin . The token hit a market cap of $200 million within two days of its launch. VP Matt Sorg Defends Solana In response to the increased backlash, Solana Foundation’s Vice President of Technology Matt Sorg defended the blockchain platform. He revealed today that only a small group within the ecosystem was directly involved in creating the ad. Further, he championed artistic freedom and human expression, adding that they should not be bound by rigid norms. He stated, The beauty of humanity is not being constrained to natural randomness or binary robotic output. We are creative, we can beat entropy. Exploring ourselves and our possibilities is not anti-innovation. It is noteworthy that the incident comes on the heels of increased optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s inclusion of Solana to the US crypto reserve .

Pi’s circulating supply reportedly stands at 6.88 billion PI tokens. The crypto, launched on February 20, is 62% down from its all-time high of $2.99 and has been trading in the red for more than 20 days now. Since the start of March, Pi has not traded above $2 and has shed over 34% of its value in a fortnight. PI/USDT trading chart. Source: TradingView Although the project still has several followers on social media, investors are seemingly offloading their holdings, which could have increased downward pressure on the token’s value. Transparency is still in question, but profit-taking continues Naysayers of the Pi Network on X believe the project has some red flags that could be contributing to the sell-off. There are rumors on the social platform that say the top three holders collectively own 2.69% of the total supply, with the top 10 holders controlling the same percentage, which some community members believe is a little “alarming.” Pi coin holders are gunning for a Binance listing , which has yet to happen even after 86% of the exchange’s users voted for the coin to be listed in a poll that started on February 18 and ended ten days later. According to analysts going by the username Alpha Crypto Signal on X, the token displayed signs of weakness over the weekend and predictably broke below a horizontal support level, which triggered a sharp sell-off. #PI Update: Check it yourself, guys! I mentioned earlier that $PI was showing signs of weakness. As expected, $PI broke below the horizontal support level and dumped sharply. Congratulations if you followed the $PI analysis! Cheers! https://t.co/52SlhtAjLp pic.twitter.com/N1IfZBzV1p — Alpha Crypto Signal (@alphacryptosign) March 18, 2025 The price has tanked across multiple timeframes since the beginning of this business week. On the 15-minute chart, PI is down 5.45%, trading just above the moving averages of 1.3343 and 1.3401. The 4-hour chart also shows a more profound bearish trend, with the token trading well below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average at 1.5688. Miner sell-off after grace period ends According to some market analysts, Pi’s grace period expiration on March 14 triggered a minor sell-off. Prior to the deadline, Pi Network’s developers had urged users to complete the required steps to prevent losing a significant portion of their mined PI tokens. After the grace period ended, mining rewards no longer accumulated under the previous terms, and miners appear to have started liquidating their holdings, adding more supply to the market. The developers’ warning may have also created some fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) within the community, contributing to selling pressures and price decline. According to TradingView contributor MyCryptoParadise, Pi’s technical analysis suggests that its bearish momentum could continue in the near term. The token has formed a head-and-shoulders pattern along the resistance trendline of a descending channel, a setup that typically signals further downside. PI/USDT technical analysis. Source: MyCryptoParadise This pattern was confirmed when PI coin broke below the neckline and closed a candle beneath it on March 14. Such a move often precedes significant price declines, increasing the likelihood of additional losses if buyers fail to step in at key support levels. Traders are now waiting to see if PI will retest the neckline. If the price remains below the $1.5 mark, it could indicate a continuation of the downward trend. Yet, a break above the resistance zone around $1.7, coupled with strong trading volume, could invalidate the bearish setup and lead to a potential rebound.

Pi coin has crashed by over 50% from its all-time high. This article explores whether the value of Pi can rebound and hit the IOU level of $100. Power of 3 Pattern Points to a Pi Network Price Rebound A popular crypto analyst with over 327k followers on X has come up with a bullish Pi Network price prediction even as its price continues to crash. He cited a popular view known as the Power of Three (Po3) to justify this view. This pattern consists of three key phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. The accumulation phase is identified by a narrow trading range, which the Pi coin price went through a few days ago. It has now moved into the manipulation phase, where it has several misleading price movements. After this, he expects the value of Pi to go parabolic, and retest its all-time high of $3. More gains will be confirmed if the price rises above its all-time high as this will trigger FOMO among investors. Pi Network Power of 3 Can Pi Coin Price Hit $100? Pi Network price was trading at $1.1185, meaning that it needs to surge by 9,099% to get to the IOU level of $100, where it peaked in November last year. The Pi Network IOU was an asset created by HTX and other brokers after the mainnet launch took so long to happen. It had no relationship with the original Pi project. A 9,000% surge is possible in the crypto market as other tokens like Bitcoin, Cardano, and BNB have done in the past few years. Several things need to happen for the Pi Network price to hit the key resistance at $100. First, the crypto market needs to be in a strong bull market, with Bitcoin soaring to record highs. Such a move would lead to more demand for most altcoins, including Pi. Second, the Federal Reserve needs to be more dovish by cutting interest rates and ending the QT program . Such a move would lead to inflows in the crypto market. Further, several prominent exchanges like Coinbase and Upbit need to list it. Coinbase would give it access to American clients, while Upbit would expose it to South Korean customers. Other potential catalysts would be a Pi Network ETF launch, addition in strategic crypto reserves, its ecosystem growth, and an introduction to burning. Pi burning will help to offset the ongoing dilution through token unlocks Pi Network Short-Term Prediction The hour chart shows that the Pi Network price continued to drop this week as the Binance listing remained elusive. It crashed below the key support level at $1.2372, its lowest swing on March 9 of this year. This was a notable level since it was the neckline of a head and shoulders pattern that was forming. A H&S is one of the most bearish patterns in the market. Pi Network price has remained below the 25-period moving average, while the Awesome Oscillator is in the red. Therefore, the Pi coin price will likely continue falling as bears push it to the psychological point at $1. A move above the resistance at $1.5 will invalidate the bullish Pi Network price forecast, and point to more gains to $2. Pi Network Price Chart Summary Pi Network price faces an uphill task, rising from about $1 to the IoU level of $100 and above. Doing this will require strong fundamentals, including exchange listings and ETF approvals, and technicals.

However, the price of the altcoin has not changed, leaving many investors and analysts perplexed. While some contend that the usage of Ripple’s private ledger conceals XRP’s actual value, others attribute this to issues with liquidity and market sentiment. Related Reading: Solana Marks 5-Year Journey – 400 Billion Transactions And Counting Private Ledger May Be Limiting Price Growth According to DigitalG, a former fund manager in London, Ripple’s usage of a private ledger for institutional transactions may be the reason why the price of XRP has been stagnant. DigitalG asserts that banks might be acquiring XRP in substantial volumes on a concealed ledger instead of the public XRP Ledger (XRPL), keeping these transactions out of the public market. This separation could explain why increased adoption hasn’t translated into higher prices. Why doesn’t XRP rise in price if banks around the world are buying huge volumes, I hear people say. It’s because there are two ledgers. Some Financial regulators could suggest it’s dishonest to conceal the true price of an asset! I suspect the 2 ledgers will converge on July 14 pic.twitter.com/a9mt0n1zdD — DigitalG (@DigitalG15) March 16, 2025 DigitalG believes that later this year a merger between the private ledger and XRPL could take place, which could jack up the value of XRP. Ripple’s main goals in private record are defined by large-scale transactions between institutions and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This configuration makes it more difficult for banks to see how XRP could be used in different situations even if it simplifies things and boosts security for them. Some argue that lack of openness might lead to problems with regulation. Market Sentiment And Liquidity Challenges Other observers say XRP’s price oscillations are caused by the general dynamics of the market. Black Swan Capitalist co-founder Vandell Aljarrah says there isn’t enough demand for liquidity to cause a supply disturbance even if institutions are utilizing XRP for transactions. He notes that from July 2024, when it was in a correction phase, the price of XRP has been continuously ranging between $0.52 and $0.56. Banks’ Adoption Of Blockchain Technology Continues To Grow Meanwhile, it has been a big step forward for Ripple to form relationships with financial institutions. Some of the 30 largest banks in the world are apparently planning to use Ripple’s settlement technology by teaming up with Bitstamp, according to reports. Along with the creation of RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), which both require XRP, it has become easier to send money across borders more quickly and cheaply. Related Reading: XRP $15 Breakout? Not A Far-Fetched Idea—Analysis Price Trajectory Unclear The future of XRP’s pricing is also unclear at this time. The three key levels that analysts have identified as needing close attention are $0.60, $0.63, and $0.66. If the price manages to break above these levels, it could surge to $0.86 or perhaps higher. If it falls below $0.50, on the other hand, a short-term rebound might be less likely.

Dogecoin: From Internet Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. It features the Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially created as a joke, it quickly gained popularity due to its lighthearted approach and active community. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This increase was influenced by social media, especially endorsements from Elon Musk, and a growing interest in the cryptocurrency market. Dogecoin’s technology is based on Litecoin, offering fast transaction times and low fees. Its abundant supply and strong community support make it accessible. Whether Dogecoin is attractive in the current market cycle depends on market trends and investor interest. Its value can be volatile, influenced by social media and public figures. Some see it as a reflection of the influence of community and social media on financial markets. Conclusion While DOGE and other coins show potential, XYZVerse ($XYZ) combines sports and memes, aiming for significant growth during the current bull run.

The recent hack on Bybit that led to the theft of $1.5 billion worth of digital assets is a wake-up call for the entire crypto industry. This attack exploited vulnerabilities in multi-signature authorization and UI spoofing tactics, deceiving users into believing they were transacting with the correct address when, in reality, the interface had been manipulated. You might also like: Crypto wallet security needs a rethink | Opinion Even experienced crypto professionals can overlook such discrepancies without rigorous scrutiny. In the fast-paced environment of digital asset exchanges, these threats can easily go undetected. So, what’s the immediate solution? Security isn’t just a feature; it’s the foundation of everything we do. To reinforce our defenses, we must implement the following measures without delay: 1. MPC middleware audit As soon as the Multi-Party Computation receives an on-chain transaction request, it must validate the transaction against the Dynamic Ledger (Exchange Database) to ensure balances match. This is an immediate, automated step that exchanges can introduce to improve their ability to accurately confirm the identity of individuals transacting. As well as ensuring that withdrawals receive the necessary reviews and auditing, integrating these initial steps that can pinpoint potential threats at an early stage is vital in mitigating the threat of high-value hacks. 2. Dynamic ledger verification Dynamic ledger systems log every transaction state and perform background audits post-execution for absolute accuracy. Before approving any MPC-requested withdrawal, the system must cross-check the ledger to confirm its legitimacy. These systems keep a trusted record of each transaction, so they can be relied upon to deliver dependable results for any withdrawals that require further investigation. 3. Post-approval auditing Every approved transaction must be reviewed to detect potential UI spoofing attempts. This adds an extra layer of security and can prevent platforms from becoming the victims of sophisticated hacks, just like we saw with the Bybit incident. Audits should then be run periodically based on the volume of approved transactions. Implementing this process allows exchanges to constantly interrogate the systems they have in place and review whether the appropriate measures have been established for reviewing transactions. 4. Threshold and round-robin approval Implementing a threshold-based MPC approval system eliminates single points of failure. Exchanges leave themselves vulnerable if they rely solely on one system to prevent breaches, and the ability to spread this responsibility across different branches of the organization will drastically improve resilience moving forward. Additionally, round-robin approvals by treasury teams reduce insider threats and enhance accountability. Involving multiple stakeholders in delivering secure transactions will ultimately reduce mistakes, whether accidental or deliberate and raise the standards to which every team member must adhere. 5. Automated transaction auditing Risk-based scoring should be applied to every deposit and withdrawal request before approval, with high-value transactions undergoing manual verification to ensure proper reporting and accountability. Real-time monitoring systems should analyze deposits and withdrawals, with automated cross-checks for unusual spikes. If required, large transactions must be manually verified with a comprehensive report. Each withdrawal should undergo a transaction audit score assessment before being processed. 6. Continuous cybersecurity training Regular cybersecurity training for treasury teams is crucial, as security is only as strong as the people enforcing it. Investing resources into ensuring employees have the necessary training to perform their roles to the highest level possible is a worthwhile investment for crypto platforms and will bolster security in the long term. Exchanges should also conduct simulated security drills two to three times a month to assess response effectiveness. This allows firms to outline any potential weaknesses in processes or employee knowledge that can be immediately addressed, equipping the team with hands-on experience in handling potential cyber threats in the future. 7. Comprehensive insurance coverage All hot and cold wallets must be insured to enhance operational security and risk mitigation. This protects the exchange itself and reassures investors that their assets have an added layer of financial security. The Bybit hack is a clear indication of the level of sophistication that bad actors have reached in their attempts to orchestrate digital thefts. Therefore, offering insurance coverage is the right move for exchanges as the threat with which they’re faced is constantly increasing and evolving. Prioritizing security, a key consideration Security is a shared responsibility, and collaboration is key to making this space safer for everyone. Strengthening security frameworks, investing in cutting-edge technology, and staying ahead of potential threats should be a priority for organizations across the entire crypto ecosystem.

41863426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141063,1742304954,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Forex Alert: Citi Issues Bearish EUR/GBP Forecast – Should You Short?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/citi-bearish-eurgbp-forecast/,"In the fast-paced world of financial markets, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and seasoned traders alike, understanding the movements in traditional markets like Forex can offer valuable insights and even potential trading opportunities. Today, we’re diving into a significant Forex development: Citi, a global financial powerhouse, has signaled attractive levels to consider shorting EUR/GBP. What does this mean, and how could it impact your trading strategies? Let’s explore this critical Forex Trading Signal and unpack the implications. Decoding Citi’s Bearish EUR/GBP Forecast Citi’s recent analysis points towards a potentially weakening Euro against the British Pound. But what’s driving this EUR/GBP Forecast ? Several factors are likely at play, creating a confluence of conditions that favor a downward trajectory for the EUR/GBP pair. Here’s a breakdown: Economic Divergence: The Eurozone and the UK economies are navigating different paths. The Eurozone faces persistent challenges including slower growth and higher inflation in some member states, while the UK, despite its own hurdles, may be perceived as having a more robust economic outlook in certain sectors. Central Bank Policies: The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) are employing distinct monetary policies. Differences in interest rate strategies and quantitative easing approaches can significantly influence currency valuations. If the BoE appears more hawkish than the ECB, it could strengthen the Pound against the Euro. Geopolitical Factors: Global events and geopolitical uncertainties can disproportionately affect currencies. Any shifts in risk sentiment, trade relations, or regional stability can create volatility and directional biases in the Forex market. Technical Analysis: Beyond fundamental factors, technical analysis of EUR/GBP charts might also be indicating a bearish trend. Chart patterns, moving averages, and other technical indicators could be aligning to suggest further downside potential. Citi’s analysts are renowned for their in-depth market research and strategic insights. Their call to consider shorting EUR/GBP isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a well-considered Citi Forex Strategy based on a comprehensive assessment of these intertwined factors. Why Shorting EUR/GBP Might Be an Attractive Strategy Now? For those unfamiliar, ‘shorting’ a currency pair means betting that the base currency (in this case, EUR) will depreciate against the quote currency (GBP). Citi’s view suggests that the current levels present an opportune moment to initiate Short EUR/GBP Trade positions. But why is this considered ‘attractive’? Potential for Downside Movement: Citi’s analysis implies a belief that the EUR/GBP pair is poised for a significant downward move. Entering a short position now could capitalize on this anticipated depreciation. Risk-Reward Ratio: ‘Attractive levels’ often suggest a favorable risk-reward profile. This means the potential profit from a successful short trade could outweigh the potential losses if the trade moves against you (assuming appropriate stop-loss measures are in place). Market Sentiment: Citi’s call itself can influence market sentiment. When a major institution like Citi signals a directional bias, it can attract other traders and investors to follow suit, potentially reinforcing the predicted trend. However, it’s crucial to remember that Forex trading, like cryptocurrency trading, is inherently risky. No forecast is guaranteed, and market conditions can change rapidly. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before making any trading decisions. Navigating the Broader Currency Market Outlook Understanding the Currency Market Outlook is essential for anyone involved in Forex or even cryptocurrency trading. The Forex market is the largest and most liquid financial market globally, and its movements can ripple across other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Here are some key aspects to consider when assessing the broader currency market outlook: Factor Description Impact on Currency Markets Global Economic Growth The overall health and growth trajectory of the global economy. Stronger global growth often supports risk-on sentiment, potentially benefiting commodity currencies and impacting major pairs. Inflation and Interest Rates Inflation levels and central bank interest rate policies. Higher interest rates can attract foreign investment, strengthening a currency. Inflation expectations influence central bank decisions and currency valuations. Geopolitical Stability The level of political and geopolitical risk and stability worldwide. Increased geopolitical tensions can lead to safe-haven flows into currencies like the US dollar and Swiss franc. Trade Flows and Balances International trade dynamics and current account balances. Countries with strong export sectors and trade surpluses may see their currencies appreciate. By monitoring these factors and staying informed about expert analyses like Citi’s EUR/GBP forecast, traders can develop a more nuanced understanding of the Currency Market Outlook and make more informed decisions. Actionable Insights and Considerations for Traders So, what are the actionable takeaways from Citi’s bearish EUR/GBP view? Whether you’re a Forex veteran or primarily focused on cryptocurrencies, here are some points to consider: Due Diligence is Key: While Citi’s analysis is noteworthy, treat it as one data point among many. Conduct your own research, analyze charts, and consider multiple perspectives before making any trading decisions. Risk Management: If you decide to explore a short EUR/GBP position, implement robust risk management strategies. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and only risk capital you can afford to lose. Correlation Awareness: Understand how Forex movements can correlate with cryptocurrency markets. A stronger US dollar, for example, can sometimes exert downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Stay Updated: The Forex market is dynamic. Stay informed about economic data releases, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments that could impact EUR/GBP and the broader currency landscape. Diversification: Diversification is crucial. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s a single currency pair or asset class. Spread your investments across different markets to mitigate risk. Conclusion: Navigating Forex Opportunities with Informed Strategies Citi’s bearish outlook on EUR/GBP presents a potentially significant Forex Trading Signal that warrants attention from traders and market observers. By understanding the drivers behind this EUR/GBP Forecast and considering the broader Currency Market Outlook , you can enhance your market awareness and potentially identify strategic trading opportunities.

41863662,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=695068,1742305104,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41863662.jpeg,US stock market is pricing in a recession based on these early signs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-stock-market-is-pricing-in-a-recession/,"The US stock market is flashing warning signs. The S&P 500 has dropped by 2% since the Federal Reserve started cutting rates in September 2024, and that’s not normal. Typically, the S&P 500 climbs by 1% in the six months after a rate cut. But when the economy is in a recession, history shows the index falls by 6% in half a year and 10% within a year. The biggest drop recorded during past downturns has been 15% within eight months, according to data from CNBC. If the Fed successfully dodges a recession, the market usually bounces back. In cases where a recession is avoided, the S&P 500 rises 10% in six months and 15% over a year. But the way things are moving, investors aren’t betting on that outcome. The Fed is cutting rates, but markets aren’t reacting the way they should if the economy were healthy. Executives are abandoning the ‘soft landing’ narrative Company leaders have stopped talking about a soft landing—the idea that the economy can slow without crashing. During the last quarter of 2024, that phrase came up in 61 earnings calls. Since the start of 2025, it has been mentioned only seven times. That’s a sharp drop. Businesses aren’t optimistic anymore. A survey conducted on March 4-5 by Chief Executive magazine asked 220 CEOs about their outlook for the next year. The results were the worst since November 2012. The National Federation of Independent Business reported that small-business optimism dropped in February, while policy uncertainty spiked to its second-highest level in records going back to 1985. Corporations aren’t openly criticizing Donald Trump’s policies, but their focus is shifting. Mentions of tariffs in earnings calls have skyrocketed. So far this quarter, executives in the S&P 1500 have brought up tariffs 683 times. A year ago, in the same period, it was only 49 times. Many businesses say they’re stuck in limbo. A chemical manufacturer told the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, “Tariff threats and uncertainty are extremely disruptive.” Executives don’t know which goods will be taxed next or how high the new rates will be. That makes planning difficult. Investment slows, hiring freezes, and expansion takes a backseat. Consumers are cutting spending across all income levels The warning signs don’t stop at corporations. Consumers are changing their habits. A report from the University of Michigan shows that consumer sentiment has dropped to its lowest point since November 2022. The decline is happening across every demographic—age, income, education, and political affiliation. Spending habits are shifting. People are buying fewer non-essential items when stopping for gas. Walmart shoppers are choosing smaller pack sizes at the end of the month because their money isn’t stretching far enough. Liquor sales are seeing changes too—there’s an increase in purchases of 50ml “nip” bottles and half-sized 375ml bottles, while full-sized bottles are selling less. Jack Daniel’s CEO Lawson Whiting explained the trend simply: “It’s a consumer that is pinched.” Luxury spending is dropping. American Eagle Outfitters CEO Jay Schottenstein said customers are cautious because they don’t know what’s coming. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian reported that last-minute flight bookings have declined. Companies are cutting travel expenses, and price-sensitive travelers are delaying trips. There’s also a shift in immigrant communities. Small businesses in Hispanic neighborhoods are seeing fewer customers. Colgate-Palmolive’s head of investor relations, John Faucher, confirmed this in a recent earnings call: “There obviously is an impact on Hispanic demand. We’ve seen lower traffic from Hispanic consumers.” Workers are losing confidence in job security Employment numbers still look strong, but layoffs are creeping up. The unemployment rate stood at 4.1% in February, with 151,000 new jobs added. But beneath the surface, things are shifting. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported 172,017 job cuts in February, the highest since July 2020. That number is nearly three times higher than in 2024. While government layoffs played a role, private-sector job cuts more than doubled. Workers are nervous. A report from Glassdoor found that only 44.4% of employees expect their employer to be in a better position in six months—the lowest optimism level since 2016. A New York Fed survey in January showed that 34% of workers thought unemployment would rise. By February, that number had jumped to 39.4%, the highest since September 2023. Unemployment claims are still low, but the cracks are forming. Claims filed in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland are up 49% compared to a year ago. These numbers don’t include federal workers, meaning they likely come from businesses that depend on government spending—businesses now feeling the effects of Trump’s budget cuts. The White House is holding its position Despite the signs, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is downplaying fears. When asked if he could guarantee the US won’t enter a recession, he responded, “I can’t guarantee anything.” Economists see trouble ahead. Trump’s tariffs remain a major risk, and businesses are waiting to see the impact before making big moves. There’s also concern about how companies will adjust once the new tariff policies are fully in place. Bessent insists that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong. “There’s no reason we need to have a recession,” he said . He pointed to credit card data and banking activity as signs of stability. The Trump administration is focused on spending cuts, tax reductions, and deregulation as their strategy to keep the economy moving. Bessent described it as a necessary adjustment: “There may be a pause as we transition from relying on government spending, but we’re going to get this spending under control. We’re going to bring manufacturing back home, and we’re going to make the country more affordable for working Americans.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Further consolidation within this range is expected until a decisive breakout occurs, determining the next major price movement. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Over the past few months, XRP has remained inside an expanding wedge pattern, with the $1.9 support level acting as a strong defense for buyers. This critical price zone aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, making it a significant area of interest. Meanwhile, the asset faces major resistance at the 100-day moving average of $2.5, a level likely filled with supply. As a result, Ripple continues to trade in a narrow range near the wedge’s lower boundary, suggesting that consolidation will persist in the short term. However, if the price maintains support at this level, an eventual breakout to the upside could spark a fresh rally. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, XRP has been forming a bullish flag pattern, recently finding support at its lower boundary around $1.9. Given this structure, slight bullish retracements toward the pattern’s upper boundary are likely in the short term. This price action suggests ongoing liquidity hunts and market cooling, potentially allowing smart money to accumulate positions. If a rebound occurs at this crucial level, a retest of the $2.8 resistance level could follow, signaling a potential continuation of the broader bullish trend.

Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at global asset management firm Bernstein, initiated coverage of Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN) stock with an outperform rating and a price target of over $310. The analyst expects improving mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, driven by US President Donald Trump’s administration, which intends to make crypto policy a national priority and make the US a global hub for blockchain innovation, according to a Bernstein research note seen by Tipranks . If Coinbase shares manage to rise to $310, it would mean an over 64% rally from the current $188 mark, Google Finance data shows. COIN/USD, all-time chart. Source: Google Finance The bullish price prediction comes over a week after Trump hosted the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, shortly before he signed an executive order that outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases, Cointelegraph reported.

The choppy price moves have led to massive institutional outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs this week. However, as Bitcoin sees steady outflows, investors are actively accumulating 3 altcoins, which may precede a massive price rally for these coins. Top 3 Altcoins Investors Are Buying as Bitcoin Price Struggles Crypto investors are turning towards altcoins to scoop profits as Bitcoin price struggles to reclaim its previous highs. CryptoQuant CEO has stated that the Bitcoin bull market is over and warned that the asset might experience 6 to 12 months of a bearish trend. Popular analyst Julio Moreno also observed that US-based ETFs have recorded the fifth consecutive week of negative flows. This indicates a lack of interest from institutions. However, as traders steer clear of Bitcoin, 3 altcoins have seen a rapid surge in exchange outflows, suggesting accumulating as investors anticipate gains. These altcoins include Ethena (ENA), Mantra (OM) and Maker (MKR). Exchange Outflows Ethena (ENA) One of the altcoins that traders are rapidly accumulating is Ethena, which has fallen by 21% in one month. However, ENA exchange outflows have increased by more than 66%, suggesting a lack of intent to sell. The main reason why traders may be accumulating ENA is because of a recent partnership between Ethena Labs and Securitize. The two institutions have launched the Converge layer-1 blockchain to merge traditional finance and decentralized finance. Investors anticipate the launch to stir a bullish Ethena price prediction . ENA has also formed a rounding bottom pattern, and if it reverses to the neckline of $1.32, it could stir a 560% rally to $8.80. ENA/USDT: 1-Week Chart Mantra (OM) Crypto traders are also accumulating Mantra (OM) after exchange outflows soared by 53% in the last 24 hours. Mantra is among the few altcoins that have not succumbed to bearish trends in the broader crypto market. At press time, OM trades at $7.04 after a 12% gain in one week. The RSI on the token’s daily chart has risen to 55, and the volume histogram bars show that buying pressure has increased. After flipping the 61.8% Fibonacci level, Mantra price is eyeing another rally to the 123.6% Fib level of $10.53. OM/USDT: 1-day Chart Maker (MKR) Maker price today trades at $1,222 with a marginal 1.2% rise. Exchange outflows for MKR tokens have surged by 51% in 24 hours, as traders move their altcoins from exchanges to hold for the long term. Maker has been drawing attention since its rebrand to Sky as it expands its presence in the DeFi industry. The RSI on Maker’s daily chart has also made a bullish crossover after moving above the signal line. If it crosses above 50, it will confirm a shift in momentum, leading to a bullish Maker price prediction . MKR/USDT: 1-day Chart Final Thoughts on the Top Altcoins to Buy Bitcoin price is experiencing choppy price moves amid surging outflows and fearful market sentiment. However as investors turn their attention away from BTC, 3 altcoins have much potential to rally as exchange outflows from exchanges increase significantly.

The whale’s huge agenda to short Bitcoin price left traders guessing and investors panicking. Now, on-chain investigator ZachXBT has suggested that a cybercriminal is possibly playing with stolen funds behind the scenes. This massive short bet came in when Bitcoin was already struggling to stay above water. BTC price has been hovering around the $81K – $84K zone after recovering from a dump to $78K. The cumulative crypto market also hasn’t seen much action over the past week as investors’ sentiment remained in the “Fear” territory. Did a cybercriminal just walk away with millions? As per the data shared by SpotOnChain , the Hyperliquid whale also being called the “50x leverage whale” has closed all of its Bitcoin short positions. However, it earned more than $4 million in profits in just 3 days from these bets. A group led by pseudonymous trader Cbb0fe in an X post stated that the shorted whale has closed the bets with around $9 million in profits. It added that their team might have lost the war, but they had fun after a very long time. To this, ZachXBT replied and revealed that the “Hyperliquid whale” is just a cybercriminal gambling with stolen funds. It’s funny watching CT speculate on the “Hyperliquid whale” when in reality it’s just a cybercriminal gambling with stolen funds. — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) March 18, 2025 In the end, the on-chain investigator ruled out any connection between the address and the North Korean hacker unit, Lazarus Group. A user asked the investigator to name and shame if it’s a criminal grifter. ZachXBT mentioned it’s not enjoyable anymore to post investigations on the social media platform. Hyperliquid whale’s stakes shake the market The whale deposited 17.82 million USDC to Hyperliquid as a margin over the past 3 days. This was mainly done to short Bitcoin and that too with a 40x leverage. The liquidation price was set at $85,561 which was just 1.75% away from its entry price. The Hyperliquid whale took another gamble by reducing its BTC buy orders to just 4 orders of a total of around 557.67 Bitcoin (worth $35 million). These orders were set at a buying price of $63,757. Traders immediately smelled blood and a group led by pseudonymous trader Cbb0fe rallied on X to push BTC higher and trigger the liquidation. Bitcoin even jumped 2.5% within minutes. But the whale wasn’t done yet and the traders group added funds to raise their liquidation price to avoid a wipeout. As of now, the whale has closed all of its perpetual positions, withdrawing 21.88 million USDC back to its wallet. After making the exit, the whale spent over 6 million USDC to buy 3,202 Ethereum and 3.28 million USDC to accumulate 1,040. Bitcoin price is still testing the waters after the mega slide. BTC is trading at an average price of $82, 638 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is marginally up to stand at $25 billion. Hyperliquid is no stranger to high-stakes bets. Just last week, a trader lost $4M on a $285 million ETH position, leading the exchange to cut leverage limits. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

A successful reclaim of this level could pave the way for a rally toward the $90K region. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart BTC has rebounded from the ascending wedge’s lower boundary, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $78K. However, it now faces a significant resistance zone near the 200-day moving average ($85K), a level historically associated with strong supply and selling pressure. A breakout above this key resistance could trigger a short-squeeze, potentially propelling Bitcoin toward the $90K mark. However, the presence of strong sellers at this level suggests that further consolidation is the more likely short-term outcome. If Bitcoin faces rejection, a retest of the ascending wedge’s lower boundary ($78K) could be imminent. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, BTC has approached the upper boundary of a descending wedge at $85K. This pattern often signals waning bearish momentum and a potential bullish reversal. A successful breakout above $85K could lead to a rally toward $90K. However, given current market conditions and a lack of strong buying demand, Bitcoin is more likely to continue consolidating within the wedge in the short term before making a decisive move. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin’s price remains stuck in a range, leaving investors questioning what is preventing the market from continuing its upward trend. A closer look at futures market metrics provides a potential explanation. One key indicator, the Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio, measures whether buyers or sellers are executing positions more aggressively in the futures market. Aggressive orders refer to those placed at the market price, indicating a higher urgency to buy or sell. Recently, the 50-day moving average of this metric has been trending downward after months of steady increases. This shift suggests that sellers have regained control over the futures market, applying significant pressure and likely causing Bitcoin’s recent lack of bullish momentum. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could struggle to break out of its current consolidation phase. However, if buyers regain dominance, a reversal in this metric could signal renewed bullish momentum and a potential breakout to higher levels.

The last time this on-chain metric flashed this exact buy signal was in 2020, which led to a massive uptrend to new highs. Will history rhyme? Ethereum Price Buy Signal Forecasts Massive Uptrend for ETH As of Tuesday, March 18, 2025, Ethereum price trades around $1,900, down 47% from its yearly open. This bearish performance could come to an end soon as CryptoQuant data shows a buy signal for ETH. The Realized Ethereum price by accumulating addresses indicator has slipped below the realized price, indicating that the holders are in loss. The last time this indicator flashed a buy signal was in March 2020, which was followed by a 5,560% rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $4,868 in roughly the next two years. Realized Ethereum Price by Accumulating Addresses Ethereum Fundamentals Support A Massive Bull Rally for ETH Price Although the Ethereum price performance for the past two years has been poor, time will tell if history will repeat or rhyme. Regardless, the ongoing crypto market consolidation is likely marking an end to the meme coin-based rally. The next phase of the bull run will most likely be driven by utility rather than vanity or hype. If this is the case, then Ethereum is positioned as the best cryptocurrency, especially with the spot ETF already approved. Moreover, institutions are also going to flock to the Real-World Asset (RWA) or tokenization sector. Since RWA or tokenization sector is concentrated on Ethereum , it will likely enjoy a monopoly and the capital inflow is likely going to propel ETH’s value to new highs, potentially surpassing $5,000. Despite the short-term uncertainity, the long-term outlook Ethereum price prediction is bullish. Key Levels to Watch As noted in the previous CoinGape article, the key Ethereum price levels include $2,100. $2,200, $2,602 and $2,768. If ETH price manages to produce a daily candlestick close above $3,000, it will signal the persistence of buying pressure and likely catalyze an extension of the uptrend to $4,000 and the current ATH at $4,868. In a highly bullish case, Ethereum could also attempt a retest of the $5,000 psychological level.

Minima is working with Siemens Cre8Ventures division, an initiative to accelerate industrial transformation by collaborating with startups in the fields of AI, digital twins, cybersecurity, and more, the companies said in a press release on Tuesday. A gradual evolution of computing capabilities towards the edges of networks has seen a greater need for security and data integrity to be embedded within these edge devices at scale, which is where IoT-level blockchains are useful It’s an interesting shift since blockchain technology might have originally been thought of as the antithesis of large enterprises, in terms of being decentralized and removing all sorts of intermediaries, said Minima CEO Hugo Feiler. “But as power goes to the edge on these devices, then even large enterprise clients need to make sure that there's resilience through that,” Feiler said in an interview. “And so the ability for these large enterprise companies to run a decentralized system is mission critical for them as well. So, decentralization is not just cutting them out as middlemen, it’s also enabling them to get further out into the world to deliver the service.” Minima announced late last year it was working with semiconductor giant ARM to develop a microchip with a decentralized ledger embedded in it. The partnership with Siemens, which followed on from Minima’s Arm deal, will further the sovereignty goals of the EU Chips Act , introduced in 2022 to reduce reliance on foreign chip manufacturers, Minima said. “Minima enables IoT equipment to run a full node, so they can independently participate in a blockchain network without relying on external servers or centralised intermediaries, eliminating all central points of failure and ensuring fully decentralised security, data integrity, and trustless verification.

33767162,[object Object],1742306422,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,$161 Billion In Bitcoin Short-Term Investor Capital Vanishes – Will This Weaken The Market?,https://bitcoinist.com/161-billion-in-bitcoin-short-term-investor-capital-vanishes-will-this-weaken-the-market/,"Bitcoin has faced intense selling pressure and uncertainty, with its price aggressively declining over the past few weeks. The ongoing trade war tensions and macroeconomic instability continue to weigh on financial markets, pushing both crypto and U.S. stocks lower. Despite strong fundamentals, including increased adoption and utility, Bitcoin has yet to reclaim key levels, leaving investors concerned about the potential for further downside. Adding to the negative sentiment, CryptoQuant’s Analysis of Investor Behavior reveals that the realized capitalization of short-term investors (0D-1M) has decreased from $443 billion to $282 billion. This indicates that a significant amount of capital has exited the market, reinforcing the idea that many short-term traders are cashing out amid the downturn. With bearish sentiment dominating , Bitcoin now faces a critical test—whether it can hold key support levels and reverse the trend, or if it will continue sliding further into deeper correction territory. Bitcoin Stuck In Consolidation Below $85K Bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase below the $85K level, with bulls struggling against intense selling pressure. Despite multiple attempts to reclaim higher levels, BTC has failed to show any clear signs of a recovery rally, keeping bearish sentiment intact. Analysts are increasingly calling for a potential bear market, as on-chain data suggests that Bitcoin demand is fading, while investors shift away from risk assets. Meanwhile, gold prices continue rising, and equities struggle, reinforcing a cautious outlook across financial markets. Top analyst Axel Adler shared key insights on X , highlighting that the realized capitalization of short-term investors (0D-1M) has dropped from $443 billion to $282 billion. This equates to $161 billion in capital effectively “disappearing” from the market, indicating that short-term investors are exiting their positions. Adler warns that this could weaken the market in the short term, although it is not a definitive signal of a prolonged bear cycle. While Bitcoin remains trapped in this uncertain range, traders are watching for a decisive breakout to determine whether BTC will regain strength or continue its downward trajectory. The coming weeks will be critical for defining the next phase of this market cycle. Bitcoin Stuck in a Tight Range, Awaiting Direction Bitcoin is currently trading between $85K and $82K, failing to establish a clear direction for the coming days. The price remains stagnant below the 200-day moving average (MA) around $84,200, which signals weak momentum and increases the risk of further downside. If selling pressure continues, BTC could soon drop below the $80K mark, extending its correction. Despite the bearish outlook, bulls still have a chance to regain control. A strong push above the $85K-$86K range would be the first step toward a recovery rally, with the next key resistance level at $90K. If BTC can reclaim $90K, it could build momentum for a larger breakout and shift market sentiment toward a more bullish outlook. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound, with both bulls and bears waiting for a decisive move. If bulls fail to hold support above $82K, a deeper correction below $80K could follow, reinforcing the bearish trend.

The one big question is, “Will BTC explode if Trump removes income tax for Americans earning less than $150K?” Trump’s tax reform plan calls for the end of income tax for Americans earning less than $150,000. This would increase disposable income for 93% of Americans, benefiting both consumers and businesses. Moreover, Trump wants to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanent, which includes keeping the top income tax rate capped at 37% while tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits are not taxed. Although such measures could boost spending and investment, they come at a heavy price—an estimated revenue loss of $4.9 trillion over the coming decade, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. To compensate for this shortfall, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs: a 20% universal rate and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. The protectionist measures are projected to raise $3.3 trillion in revenue. Still, the Peterson Institute for International Economics has warned that they are likely to dampen GDP growth and further stoke inflation. “I think what it does is generate revenue and drive growth,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News on March 12 , “and then turns around and gives you the ability to free up capital to buy other assets, including potentially Bitcoin.” However, the risk assets, especially crypto, got rattled by the economic uncertainty brought by tariffs. Trump’s policy announcements shake up the crypto market Sharp swings in the price of Bitcoin have followed Trump’s policy announcements. After the first tariff threat on February 1, BTC fell 12.38%, dipping from $105,000 to $92,000. An 8.7% bounce with braces on the Mexican tariffs on February 3 returned Bitcoin to $100,000. Another drop came on March 3, when new tariffs were ratified, and BTC lost 8.79% to $86,500. Bitcoin fell 14.45% further to reach $78,225, as tariffs were fully implemented on March 5. A 5% drop from $89,200 to $84,600 occurred on March 7, the day the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was signed. By March 17, Bitcoin had dropped 13.68% from $109,000 to $85,000 as tariff pressure continued. Simultaneously, according to Bloomberg, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw never-before-seen outflows of $5.5 billion in a five-week sprint, reflecting growing investor anxiety around the trade war risks. The director of derivatives at Amberdata, Greg Magadini, said that Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market are closely correlated to macro conditions, adding that he does not see the near-term decoupling of Bitcoin from risk assets. Bitcoin reserves are driving significant transformations in the crypto market In a historic move, Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on March 6, repurposing 200,000 BTC worth $17 billion from seized assets. While this bolstered Bitcoin’s legitimacy at the federal level, short-term market reactions have been mixed. The possibility of inflation induced by tariffs could make Bitcoin an appealing hedge, which also causes volatility in the near term. Analysts at ABC News suggest that while Bitcoin could benefit as a long-term store of value, immediate investor sentiment remains cautious. Beyond Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum and Solana, which belong to the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, can gain popularity if economic turbulence persists. But, as the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research pointed out this week, the bigger risk of a protracted trade war could sour investors on financial markets in general. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France and a key European Central Bank (ECB) member has warned that the U.S.’s growing embrace of cryptocurrencies could threaten global financial stability. Speaking in an interview with French weekly La Tribune Dimanche, Villeroy de Galhau criticized the Trump administration’s policies, claiming they are “sowing the seeds of future upheavals.” He noted that crises often begin in the U.S. and spread worldwide, warning that the U.S. is jeopardizing financial stability by encouraging non-bank finance and crypto assets. The ultimate impact of Trump’s tax cuts and tariffs will depend on how they shape economic activity. BTC could benefit from increased investment if tax cuts stimulate enough growth to offset inflationary pressures. However, if prolonged trade tensions deepen economic uncertainty, risk assets—including Bitcoin—could face heightened volatility.",OP-ED|BTC|ECB|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-18 14:00:31

Ripple (XRP) has been witnessing a recent bullish reversal, rebounding from strong support and targeting higher levels. At the same time, a project named Remittix (RTX) has generated hype for possibly hitting $5 by 2025 due to its record-breaking presale success and real-world payment solution. We begin with XRP’s changing uptrend before analyzing why Remittix’s PayFi model can provide the next huge profit in digital assets. XRP: Charting a Path to Bullish Momentum XRP has been making higher highs and higher lows over the last several months, crawling from $1.89 to the vicinity of $2.40. The nearest resistance is between $2.475 and $2.50, and support between $2.30 and $2.35 . A decisive break above $2.40 may push XRP to try and overcome $2.50 or even $2.60, but an inability to sustain $2.35 exposes it to falling back towards $2.30. Checking the 4-hour chart, XRP strongly bounced off around $1.90, indicating that buyers aggressively enter at lower levels. If it breaks $2.50 to $2.60 with volume, it can bounce back to $2.80 or even up to $3.00. In the daily chart, XRP previously topped close to $3.40 before it corrected. If it holds $2.40 to $2.50 as support, it would establish a higher low, restarting bullish momentum. XRP/USDT Daily Chart The technical oscillators are giving conflicting signals: the RSI is trading at 50, and the MACD has crossed marginally to the upside. This kind of picture suggests a risk of a consolidation phase prior to a clear move. In the case bulls dominate and break above $2.60, XRP will retest $3.00 resistance. A slide below $2.20, however, will indicate further drop. For the time being, XRP’s path suggests cautious optimism—investors are waiting for a breakout above resistance to confirm the next leg of the uptrend. Remittix: On Track for $5 by 2025 As XRP sails through familiar waters, Remittix (RTX) is set to disrupt the $190 trillion cross-border payments sector. Its presale has already sold more than 520 million tokens and generated close to $14 million, handing early investors 1000%-plus gains. Valued at just $0.0734, Remittix has taken a front-seat position among DeFi coins in an otherwise volatile market. What drives Remittix is its PayFi infrastructure. Consumers can seamlessly off-ramp over 40 cryptos to fiat, transferring money to foreign banks in no time or with unforeseen charges. Unlike traditional wire transfers, which can take days, Remittix uses local payment networks to effect near-instant settlements. Vendors are supported by the Remittix pay API, through which they can receive various crypto payments but settle them all in fiat. Take the case of a Filipino freelance software programmer who is contracting for a European business. In the old model, the programmer might wait days for wire transfers, missing out on currency exchange markups. With Remittix, they are paid in stablecoins or major cryptos, which are converted to local fiat in a few hours’ time. The funds appear instantly in a Philippine bank account, bypassing the typical multi-day wait. This arrangement is a win-win for both the developer and the employer. The freelancer skirts slow, costly wire fees, and the employer can more conveniently pay in crypto without needing to deal with cumbersome wallet conversions. Such real-world pragmatics demonstrate Remittix’s genuine utility, separating it from hype-driven or incremental chain-based tokens. Security remains paramount. Every action is logged on a public ledger to deter manipulation or fraud. This transparent approach, coupled with locked liquidity and plans to renounce contract ownership post-presale, works to alleviate concerns of investors wary of flash-in-the-pan hype. Analysts are calling for 200% monthly pumps if momentum holds, propelling RTX over the $1 mark sooner than skeptics might expect. Others estimate by 2025 a price of as much as $5 or more based on real-world demand for low-cost, speed remittances. Where XRP and Remittix Could Head by 2025 XRP’s near-term direction depends on breaking the $2.50 to $2.60 area with heavy buying volume. It can rally above $3.00 if bullish momentum coincides with overall market euphoria. However, a drop below $2.20 might dampen its rally. Considering the coin’s history of explosive rallies, any clear break can send prices quickly—dropping towards former highs around $3.40. Remittix, however, targets genuine concerns such as delayed remittance times and excessive fees. That real utility has powered presale explosive growth, which puts into perspective the possibility of massive future gains. A $5 price in 2025 may be more than speculation if uptake persists, particularly with Remittix targeting a trillion-dollar market. Naturally, crypto markets are volatile. XRP’s resurgence or Remittix’s ascendance could falter should investor attitudes change or should regulatory obstacles prove problematic. Nevertheless, with XRP demonstrating a fresh bullish personality and Remittix providing a demonstrated real-world application, these tokens represent some of the more interesting prospects on the horizon for the next few years. For investors shopping for enduring value amidst oceanic hype, melding established momentum (XRP) and groundbreaking disruption (Remittix) could be a wise strategy.

Is It the Calm Before the Storm? Here Are the Latest Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-volatility-drops-to-lowest-level-is-it-the-calm-before-the-storm-here-are-the-latest-data/,"Bitcoin (BTC) could experience a sharp price swing as volatility remains near monthly lows and could soon rebound, according to a report by blockchain options platform Derive. Derive Warns: Bitcoin Volatility Poised for a Comeback BTC has been consolidating between $80,000 and $85,000 since March 12, following a sharp decline from its all-time high of $100,000. The decline was attributed to President Donald Trump's new tariffs and the lack of further purchases for the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Despite the current period of low volatility, Derive founder Nick Forster suggests that this could be a temporary lull before a significant price move. “BTC’s weekly at-the-money (ATM) volatility fell to 49%, nearing a monthly low of 45%. Meanwhile, realized volatility fell from 91% to 54%.” What Could Trigger the Next Move? Forster emphasized that volatility does not predict price direction, meaning BTC could see major swings up or down. Factors that could lead to a resurgence of this volatility include: Geopolitical uncertainties such as developments in Ukraine Regulatory changes under the Trump administration The Federal Reserve's policy decision to be announced on Wednesday With the Fed expected to keep interest rates on hold, traders are currently pricing in two to three rate cuts this year. A more dovish stance than expected could provide fuel for Bitcoin bulls, while continued equity market declines could push prices lower. Derive's Market Impact Derive, an AI-powered on-chain options platform, has seen significant activity with approximately $100 million in total value locked (TVL) and $15 billion in cumulative trading volume. Given the deep market insights, traders are closely watching whether the projected volatility resurgence will propel BTC to new highs or trigger another sell-off. *This is not investment advice.

41864578,https://crypto.news/?p=14346283,1742306965,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/41864578.jpeg,Trump-era policy shift sparks crypto firms’ push for banking licenses: report,https://crypto.news/trump-era-policy-shift-sparks-crypto-firms-push-for-banking-licenses-report/,"Crypto firms and fintech companies are reportedly applying for bank charters under the Trump administration, paving the way for greater financial legitimacy. According to a recent Reuters report , crypto firms are looking to apply for bank charters to expand their businesses and potentially reduce borrowing costs. At least half a dozen industry executives have confirmed that crypto firms “see an opportunity” under the Trump administration to gain credibility among customers by applying for a banking licenses. A bank charter is a legal license issued by a government that allows a firm to operate and offer banking services. It defines the bank’s structure, permitted activities, and the regulations it must follow to protect customers and maintain financial stability. “We have seen a lot more interest. We are working on several applications now,” said law firm partner at Troutman Pepper Locke, Alexandra Steinberg Barage. Barage said the firm’s clients are “cautiously optimistic” under the new administration but are waiting for more clarity as the Trump administration begins appointing financial agency heads. During the Biden administration, securing bank charters was difficult, as regulators were slow or reluctant to approve them, especially for crypto firms. The previous administration maintained a more negative stance toward crypto compared to the current administration.

However, they are waiting to see how many firms will follow through with their applications. Although a bank charter subjects institutions to stricter regulatory oversight, it also comes with significant advantages. Carleton Goss, a partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth who is working on three applications, said a bank charter could help firms reduce borrowing costs by drawing on deposits. It would also enhance a company’s legitimacy and create new business and market opportunities. “It makes sense for them to get ahead of the curve, and in turn, get more credibility and capital at a lower cost by applying for a charter,” said Goss. Last February, Wall Street banks reportedly showed interest in initial public offering opportunities through crypto firms. The spark of interest came after major crypto exchanges like Gemini and Bullish expressed interest in going public. Kraken and stablecoin issuer Circle have also explored public listings.

Markets were mixed, with some cryptocurrencies registering marginal increases while others registered marginal declines. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around the $83,000 mark as it struggles to build momentum. The flagship cryptocurrency bounced to reach $84,644 early in the day before declining to its current level. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETG) registered a marginal increase to surpass $1,900. ETH has struggled in recent sessions as it attempts to reclaim $2,000. Ripple (XRP) registered a notable increase of almost 2%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 3% and trading at $124. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up just over 2%, while Chainlink (LINK) is up nearly 3%, trading at $14.03. Other cryptocurrencies like Toncoin (TON), Stellar (XLM) , Litecoin (LTC) , Polkadiot (DOT), and Hedera (HBAR) registered notable declines. SEC Could Axe Biden-Era Crypto Custody Rule The United States Securities and Exchange Commission plans to change or remove a rule proposed under the Biden administration that would tighten crypto custody standards for investment advisors. According to SEC acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the rule, proposed in February 2023, had seen commenters express significant concern over its broad scope. Uyeda stated, “Given such concern, there may be significant challenges to proceeding with the original proposal. As such, I have asked the SEC staff to work closely with the crypto task force to consider appropriate alternatives, including its withdrawal.” The rule was created under the leadership of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. It aimed to expand custody rules for investment advisors to any assets held for a client, including crypto and increased the requirements to protect them. This meant investment advisors would have to custody their clients’ assets with a qualified custodian. However, the rule also stated investment advisors could not rely on crypto platforms due to the way they operate. The proposal was criticized by Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Pierce, along with industry advocates who called the rule unlawful and dangerous. Uyeda had said at the time, “How could an adviser seeking to comply with this rule possibly invest client funds in crypto assets after reading this release?” However, Uyeda supported the proposal despite disagreeing with several provisions. Solana Deletes Controversial Ad Following Backlash Solana has removed its “America is Back - Time To Accelerate” ad after criticism from the crypto community on X, with many calling it offensive, cringe, and divisive. The now-deleted ad was posted on Monday and garnered over $1.4 million views by the end of the day. It featured several patriotic themes and political messaging, particularly against gender diversity. Solana has not made an official comment about the ad so far. While the video has been deleted, it has been reposted by several users. Tyler Bench, CRO of on-chain governance platform Tally.xyz, called the video “the most toxic piece of content."" “This might be the single most toxic piece of content I have ever consumed. It's like the Coinbase ads if they were created by an incel who hasn't left the basement in years.” The highly controversial ad reflects the growing tensions within the crypto ecosystem about political messaging. Critics stated that the ad contradicted the crypto industry’s foundational values of neutrality and inclusivity. Anneri van der Merwe, product leader at Base, heavily criticized the advertisement, stating that it completely missed the mark. “Offensive, cringe, and pandering. Base is for everyone. Solana co-opted the 'is for everyone' phrase last week too. This ad shows there's still a long way to go in truly embracing that ethos.” Other prominent industry figures also expressed disappointment, with Adam Cochran partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, questioning the judgment behind its creation. “The 'mind virus' that's infected the nation is whatever weird circlejerk is going on in Silicon Valley where people are convinced they were oppressed and that this is cool or edgy.” Standard Chartered Slashes ETH Price Target By 60% Standard Chartered has changed its 2025 year-end target for Ethereum (ETH) from $10,000 to $4,000, citing several structural challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem. Standard Chartered analysts attribute the adjustment to the impact of Layer2 solutions like Coinbase’s Base, which has reduced Etheruem’s market capitalization by an estimated $50 billion. Layer2 networks were created to enhance Ethereum’s scalability by reducing congestion and lowering transaction fees. However, Standard Chartered suggests that Layer2 solutions may be diverting revenue away from Ethereum. Standard Chartered also forecast a decline in the ETH/BTC ratio, predicting it will reach 0.015 by the end of 2027, suggesting ETH will underperform relative to Bitcoin (BTC) over the next few years. Despite these concerns, Ethereum still leads in key areas like stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized finance. The bank also acknowledged that ETH could rise from its current levels if BTC experiences significant gains. However, it cautioned ETH’s underperformance will continue in the near term. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a notable increase on Monday, rising nearly 2% as markets rebounded. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $84,768 before declining. Despite Monday’s price increase, BTC remains trapped in a tight range, trading between $81,000 and $82,000 and finding it difficult to push higher. However, while the market may be cautious, historical trends and patterns hint at a possible breakout. According to Rekt Capital, BTC’s current price action and trends mirror June 2021, when, after a steep decline, the flagship cryptocurrency was stuck between the 20 and 50-week EMAs. The price eventually broke out of this range and surged to an all-time high in November. BTC is following a similar trajectory, suggesting history could repeat itself. “Back in June 2021, the price was consolidating between the 21-week EMA (green) and 50-week EMA (blue) after a crash Right now, Bitcoin is consolidating between the same EMAs after a crash (By the way, $BTC indeed broke out from its triangle by late July 2021 to reach new All-Time Highs in November 2021).” Rekt Capital also stated that BTC’s selling pressure has been decreasing, with recent selloffs coming with lower volumes than usual, suggesting sellers are losing momentum. According to CryptoQuant, BTC is undergoing a deleveraging phase, with excess leverage being removed. In the past, such deleveraging phases have created buying opportunities. BTC registered a sharp drop last Friday, dropping 3.53% to settle at $86,781. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal drop on Saturday. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC fell over 6%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and $80,000, reaching a low of $79,987. It made a marginal recovery from this level to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $80,736. Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as BTC surged to an intraday high of $84,075. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped nearly 3% to settle at $78,620. The price plunged to an intraday low of $76,642 as selling pressure intensified. It recovered from this level to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,943 after an increase of 5.50%.

BTC continued to push higher on Saturday, registering a marginal increase and settling at $84,398. However, buyers lost momentum on Sunday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and settling at $82,611. BTC’s see-saw price action continued on Monday, rising almost 2% to $84,017. The current session sees BTC down nearly 1% and trading at $83,330. The MACD indicates growing bullish sentiment, suggesting buyers are gaining the upper hand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim the $2,000 price level after inching past $1,900. ETH is trading just above the $1,900 mark, a crucial technical and psychological level that could dictate ETH’s short-term trajectory. ETH’s recent decline saw its price plunge to a low of $1,759, suggesting the market is dominated by selling pressure. Such spikes in selling volume suggest investors are selling off their holdings in anticipation of further declines, posing a significant roadblock in ETH’s recovery attempts. ETH started the previous weekend on a positive note, rising almost 3% and settling at $2,204. However, sentiment changed on Sunday as the price fell over 8% to $2,020. Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as the price reached an intraday high of $2,159.

ETH started the current week positively, rising just over 2% and settling at $1,927. The current session sees ETH down 1%, as sellers look to push the price below $1,900. ETH must reclaim $2,000 and overcome the resistance at $2,100 and $2,200 to confirm a sustained uptrend. However, moving averages maintain a bearish inclination, suggesting a cautious market. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is down almost 3% in the past 24 hours as it struggles to build momentum and push towards $150. The Ethereum-killer is struggling to cross the 20-day SM, acting as a dynamic resistance level. SOL has been bearish since Thursday (March 6) when it registered a drop of over 2%.

However, the current session sees SOL back in the red, down over 2% and trading at $125. Sellers will look to retain control and drive the price below $120.

Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) registered a substantial decline as it entered the previous weekend, dropping almost 7%, slipping below the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $15.94.

41864628,https://coinpedia.org/?p=433539,1742307078,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Whales Migrate Towards Coldware As Technical Data Suggest Worse Days to Come,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/whales-migrate-towards-coldware-technical-data-suggest-worse-days-to-come/,"The post Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Whales Migrate Towards Coldware As Technical Data Suggest Worse Days to Come appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano (ADA) has long been seen as one of the most promising blockchain projects in the cryptocurrency space. However, recent technical data and market trends suggest that the project may face challenging times ahead. As Cardano’s price stagnates, whales are beginning to migrate towards newer, more innovative projects like Coldware (COLD) , which are seen as having higher potential for growth. Whales Flee to Coldware (COLD) As Cardano faces resistance, many whales and institutional investors are starting to migrate toward Coldware (COLD), a rising blockchain project that offers scalability, low transaction fees, and real-world applications. Coldware’s focus on IoT integration and decentralized finance (DeFi) has attracted significant interest from both retail and institutional investors. Coldware (COLD) is gaining traction due to its unique approach to blockchain technology. Unlike Cardano, which has been slow to gain mainstream adoption for its smart contracts, Coldware is already positioning itself as a player in the Web3 ecosystem with mobile devices like the Larna 2400® and a fully integrated decentralized finance platform. This makes Coldware a more attractive option for whales looking for the next big breakout opportunity. Cardano’s Slow Growth vs. Coldware’s Innovation Cardano’s slow growth and stagnation have made it less appealing to some investors, particularly those looking for quicker returns in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space. While Cardano’s ecosystem continues to grow and develop, its lack of immediate use cases and slow adoption of smart contracts have put a cap on its potential for explosive growth in the short term. On the other hand, Coldware (COLD) is pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology with its focus on real-world applications and mobile integration. The Larna 2400® smartphone, which integrates Coldware’s blockchain technology, provides a bridge between traditional mobile devices and the decentralized world, making it easier for users to interact with blockchain-based services. This innovative approach has caught the attention of investors and whales alike, making Coldware a more attractive investment opportunity. Cardano’s Struggles with Price Resistance Despite its strong fundamentals and research-driven approach, Cardano (ADA) has struggled to maintain upward momentum. After reaching a high of $1.40 in early 2025, ADA’s price has fallen back to around $0.74, signaling resistance and a lack of sustained buying pressure. Analysts are beginning to question whether Cardano can continue its upward trajectory in the face of mounting competition and slow adoption. Technical indicators suggest that Cardano may face more downward pressure in the short term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and moving averages show bearish signals, suggesting that ADA could see further price declines if it fails to break through key resistance levels. While Cardano’s long-term potential remains intact, short-term traders may be looking for more immediate opportunities elsewhere. Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) Could Outshine Cardano in 2025 While Cardano (ADA) remains a solid project with strong long-term potential, its current struggles with price resistance and slow growth make it less appealing for investors looking for quicker gains. Coldware (COLD) , on the other hand, offers a more innovative and scalable solution with real-world use cases and a growing ecosystem. As whales continue to migrate towards Coldware, it is becoming increasingly clear that Coldware (COLD) may outperform Cardano (ADA) in the near future, making it a top contender for 2025.
