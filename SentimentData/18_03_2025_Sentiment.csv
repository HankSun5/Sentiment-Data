It’s the smallest Bitcoin purchase in Strategy history, both in terms of BTC total and US dollar value. Strategy Snaps Up Additional 130 BTC According to a March 17 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy purchased 130 Bitcoin for approximately $10.7 million at an average price of $82,981 per coin between March 10 and March 16. Strategy has acquired 130 BTC for ~$10.7M at ~$82,981 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 6.9% YTD 2025. As of 3/16/2025, we hodl 499,226 $BTC acquired for ~$33.1 billion at ~$66,360 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK https://t.co/8xRmR8vlIt — Michael Saylor (@saylor) March 17, 2025 The recent purchase represented Strategy’s smallest Bitcoin acquisition since the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm started accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020 under the leadership of Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. Since that time, the business intelligence firm has remodeled itself into a Bitcoin development company and pioneered the crypto treasury reserve asset model that other publicly traded companies have emulated. Strategy’s Massive $41 Billion Bitcoin Gamble While the latest buy is Strategy’s smallest, the company had its largest acquisition of 2025 on Feb. 24, scooping up 20,365 BTC for $1.9 billion, as ZyCrypto reported . Strategy announced earlier this month that it may soon sell $21 billion of its STRK preferred stock to acquire more Bitcoin. The announcement dovetailed the company’s plans in October to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed income sales in the next three years for additional buying power. Strategy now holds a whopping 499,226 BTC, valued at over $41 billion — making it the largest corporate treasury reserve holder of the apex crypto. For perspective, the company owns nearly 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total supply. However, that mark is considerably below Saylor’s recent suggestion that the United States should acquire 25% of the supply, adding that the massive Bitcoin reserve could generate between $16 trillion and $18 trillion in wealth for the U.S., thus helping eliminate the entire national debt. Regardless of whether or not the US purchases Bitcoin, Saylor stressed that he has no plans of halting BTC purchases, previously suggesting he would be “ buying the top forever ”.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION|STRK,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-17 22:14:37

Sadly, mostly older adults in the country are falling for the tricks. Authorities have alerted the public to be very careful, as these scammers use advanced technology to steal millions from unsuspecting individuals. Older Malaysian Investors Are the Biggest Targets Older investors, also known as older citizens in Malaysia, are now prime targets in crypto scams. Scammers deceive these older citizens, as many do not understand crypto investments well. They promise quick and easy profits, convincing victims to buy expensive coins that do not exist. Once the money is sent, it disappears. In a recent case, a 74-year-old man lost tens of millions of ringgit after buying fake cryptocurrency. Authorities warned that many of these crypto assets are fake and advised traders to research before investing in any digital assets. Scammers also create fake websites and investment platforms that look real, making it hard for victims to notice any fraudulent act until it is too late. Officials urged investors to verify the legitimacy of any project before making financial decisions. Crypto Scams Featuring AI Tools and Fake Calls Crypto scams is not the only financial crime rising in Malaysia. Phone scams are also a big problem. Scammers pretend to be bank workers, police officers, or government officials. They trick people into sending them money. Many scams start with a fake courier call. The scammer connects the victim to a fake police officer, bank official, or audit expert in the same call. Officials warned that real government agencies do not operate this way. Fraudsters also use advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep-fake tools, to make their schemes more believable . Experts worry these tricks will only become more sophisticated over time. Nevertheless, Malaysian authorities are taking steps ahead in fighting cybercrime and protecting digital services. Last year, they arrested thousands of suspected individuals linked to scam syndicates, marking a major effort in the fight against financial fraud. They also use AI and blockchain to detect and flag suspicious activity on digital platforms before traders and investors lose money. The Rise of Illegal Bitcoin Mining in Malaysia Malaysia is facing more cases of illegal Bitcoin mining. Reportedly, some miners steal electricity to power their mining machines, causing big losses for the country’s power grid. Officials have found many mining farms using stolen electricity. These illegal operations strain the country’s energy supply and create concerns about cybersecurity risks.

The world of AI just took a surprising turn, and it’s got some serious implications for digital content and, by extension, the world of NFTs and digital ownership we’re so passionate about. Google’s brand-new AI model , Gemini 2.0 Flash, just unlocked a skill that’s turning heads and raising eyebrows in equal measure: effortless watermark removal from images. Is this a game-changer for content creation, or a Pandora’s Box for copyright infringement ? Let’s dive into this fascinating, and potentially disruptive, development. The Gemini AI Watermark Removal Revolution: What’s Happening? Social media is buzzing with reports of users leveraging Google’s latest AI model to perform what was once a tedious and often imperfect task: removing watermarks from images. Imagine taking a stock photo, riddled with a Getty Images watermark, and with a few simple prompts, poof! Watermark gone, seemingly like magic. This isn’t just about tidying up photos; it’s a potential seismic shift in how we perceive digital ownership and copyright in the age of AI. Here’s the lowdown: Gemini 2.0 Flash Unleashed: Google recently broadened access to its Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model , boasting native image generation and editing capabilities. This is powerful tech in anyone’s book. The Watermark Wizard: Users quickly discovered Gemini’s uncanny ability to not just remove watermarks, but also intelligently fill in the gaps left behind, making the edits nearly seamless. Social Media Buzz: Platforms like X and Reddit are flooded with examples showcasing Gemini’s watermark-banishing prowess. The ease and effectiveness are genuinely impressive. New skill unlocked: Gemini 2 Flash model is really awesome at removing watermarks in images! pic.twitter.com/6QIk0FlfCv — Deedy (@deedydas) March 15, 2025 Gemini 2.0 Flash, available in Google’s AI studio, is amazing at editing images with simple text prompts. It also can remove watermarks from images (and puts its own subtle watermark in instead ) pic.twitter.com/ZnHTQJsT1Z — Tanay Jaipuria (@tanayj) March 16, 2025 Is This the End of Watermarks? Exploring the Implications of AI-Powered Image Editing While the tech is undeniably cool, the implications of AI’s newfound ability for image editing , specifically watermark removal , are far-reaching and complex. Let’s consider some key points: Copyright Concerns Soar: The most immediate concern is, of course, copyright infringement . Removing watermarks is essentially stripping away the visual declaration of ownership. Imagine the impact on stock photo agencies and artists who rely on watermarks to protect their work and revenue. Ethical Gray Areas: While some AI models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o actively refuse to remove watermarks citing ethical and legal reasons, Gemini 2.0 Flash seemingly has no such qualms. This raises questions about the ethical guidelines and responsibilities of AI developers. Not Foolproof, Yet: It’s crucial to note that Gemini isn’t perfect. It struggles with semi-transparent watermarks or those covering large image areas. However, the technology is still in its early stages and rapidly evolving. Google’s Stance: Google has acknowledged the issue, stating that using Gemini for copyright infringement violates their terms of service. They label the feature as “experimental” and “not for production use,” and claim to be monitoring feedback. However, the ease of access and lack of built-in restrictions are still worrying. The Legal Landscape: Watermark Removal and Copyright Infringement Legally speaking, removing a watermark without the copyright holder’s permission is generally considered illegal under US copyright law, except in very specific circumstances. Think about it – watermarks are a form of digital signature, and tampering with them can have serious legal ramifications. For the crypto and NFT space, where digital provenance and ownership are paramount, this development adds another layer of complexity. Consider this table to understand the contrasting approaches: AI Model Watermark Removal Capability Ethical/Legal Stance Gemini 2.0 Flash Yes, highly effective Potentially problematic, terms of service violation for copyright infringement Claude 3.7 Sonnet No Explicitly refuses, deems it unethical and potentially illegal GPT-4o No Explicitly refuses, aligns with ethical and legal considerations Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Era of AI Image Editing So, what does this mean for you? Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Be Aware, Not Alarmed: While the watermark removal capability is powerful, it’s still experimental. Don’t panic, but stay informed. Respect Copyright: Just because the technology exists doesn’t make copyright infringement okay. Always respect creators’ rights and seek proper permissions for image use. For Creators: Consider robust watermarking strategies, but also explore blockchain-based solutions for digital ownership verification, which are increasingly relevant in the NFT and crypto space. For Developers: The responsibility is on AI developers to implement ethical guardrails and usage restrictions to prevent misuse of powerful image editing tools like Gemini. Conclusion: A Powerful Tool with a Shadow of Doubt Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model ‘s ability to perform seamless watermark removal is undeniably impressive. It showcases the rapid advancements in AI and image editing . However, this “amazing” capability comes with a significant shadow of doubt regarding copyright infringement and ethical usage. As the technology evolves, it’s crucial for developers, users, and legal frameworks to adapt to ensure responsible innovation and protect the rights of content creators in this brave new world of AI-powered tools.

Canary is a frequent crypto ETF applicant. This would reportedly be the first SUI ETF in the United States. The Canary SUI ETF would be structured as a trust. Canary stated that it intended to stake some of its SUI through providers that will enable the trust to establish validator nodes. Staking leads to possible taxation in connection with staking rewards. Investors can get SUI in different ways SUI is the native token of the Sui network, a layer-1 blockchain that was developed by Mysten Labs. According to the S-1, its transaction speed and scalability make it suitable for gaming and high-frequency trading. Canary telegraphed its intentions to create the ETF when it registered a Canary SUI ETF statutory trust in Delaware on March 6. Before an ETF can be launched, the exchange that will host it has to file form 19b-4 with the SEC. That form requests changes in the rules for the exchange that would allow the new ETF to be listed. Canary did not specify an exchange in its S-1. Although this is the first suggestion of a SUI ETF in the United States, exchange-traded product issuer Valour has a SUI product on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market denominated in Swedish kronor. In addition, Switzerland-based 21Shares offers a SUI staking ETP. VanEck offers a SUI exchange-traded note (ETN). An ETN also tracks an asset but, unlike an ETF, the issuer does not own any of the assets. Sui and Franklin Templeton announced a “strategic partnership” in November, although it was not clear what the goals of that partnership were. Grayscale has a SUI exchange-traded note (ETN) The ETN tracks the price of SUI but is a closed fund, whereas an ETF is open-ended. On March 6, World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance protocol linked to the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, announced that it would include SUI in its strategic reserves and it explore product development opportunities with Sui. Canary Capital has big altcoin ambitions The SUI ETF is not the only first Nashville-based Canary has stocked up. In December, it was the first to apply for an LTC (Litecoin) ETF. Canary Capital has filed with the SEC for several crypto ETFs, including Hedera , Solana , and XRP . Canary also runs a digital asset fund that invests in digital assets and crypto equity funds whose prices have fallen below their net asset value. Altcoin ETFs may become more common. For example, Grayscale has applied for Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs, while 21Shares is also looking into Solana, XRP, and Polkadot ETFs. Hashdex applied to the SEC to expand its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF to include Solana, XRP, Cardano, Chainlink, Avalanche, Litecoin and Uniswap in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The new program, ""Onchain Labs,"" is designed to provide go-to-market support to ""experimental and volatile"" projects, according to a blog post from Offchain Labs, Arbitrum's main developer. “Through Onchain Labs, we’re dedicating resources to support developers looking to rapidly expand the application layer by ideating with them from the ground floor to bring the best user experiences to Arbitrum,” the blog post said. “As we do with many Arbitrum teams, we’ll provide product and [go-to-market] support to these early-stage projects, collaborating closely to help their applications thrive on Arbitrum.” Arbitrum Foundation is a non-profit that stewards Arbitrum ecosystem governance. Offchain Labs, which created the blockchain in 2021, focuses on developer tooling and core network infrastructure. Offchain Labs is pitching its new initiative as a way to spur greater activity and interest in the wider Arbitrum ecosystem. According to the blog post from the company, the first Onchain Labs projects will soon emerge from stealth. Offchain Labs said the only projects supported by its new program will be those that explicitly ""commit to fair and equitable launches"" — presumably meaning they avoid token launches and other mechanics that preference insiders. Offchain Labs stated in its blog post that the selection criteria are meant to avoid ""extractive ecosystems"" and ""zero-sum games."" Tandem, Offchain Labs' venture capital arm, ""may or may not purchase associated tokens in public markets,"" the company added. Arbitrum is a layer-2 optimistic rollup network on Ethereum. Like other rollups, the chain is designed to process transactions faster and more cheaply than the main Ethereum blockchain. Several new blockchains are built on Arbitrum's technical framework, forming a network of interconnected blockchains called Arbitrum 'Orbit.' Arbitrum is currently the largest layer-2 network on Ethereum, with roughly $12.2 billion on its primary 'Arbitrum One' chain, according to L2beat .

According to the application , the firm applied for the trademark on February 25. The accompanying statement explaining the term suggests that it will apply to downloaded software, financial services, peer-to-peer network computer services, and cloud software that can be used for the custody, storage, and transmission of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. One of the statement reads: “Financial services, namely, custodial services in the nature of maintaining storage and possession of cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency for financial management purposes.” These statements, which describe the potential application of the term, have led to speculation about what Ripple might be planning in the coming months. Most times, a trademark application such as this suggests that a company is finalizing its plans to unveil a product. In 2024, Ripple for trademarks for Ripple Payments, RLUSD, and Ripple USD, a few months before launching the RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, the news of the application has attracted different reactions from the XRP community. Noah Christopher on X believes that Ripple is expanding into custody and payments to boost its adoption, while Faril speculates that the US might rely on Ripple to custody its crypto reserves. However, some users have noted that a Ripple Custody app already exists in the App Store. It is simply an authenticator app for institutional customers signing transactions using Metaco to custody their assets. Ripple bought the digital asset custody firm Metaco in 2023. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has already received and acknowledged the trademark application but has not assigned it to an examiner. The approval process for a trademark in the US only takes a few months unless it is contested. XRP remains in the green despite a turbulent year While there is no clarity yet on whether Ripple is planning a custody product or has already launched one, its XRP token remains in the only top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap with some gains year-to-date. Per CoinMarketCap data, the token is up more than 1% YTD after losing more than 10% of its value in the past 90 days. Although this might seem inconsequential, it represents a much better performance than Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Cardano ADA, DOGE, and Tron TRX, all of which have been down between 14% and 46% since January 2025. XRP’s positive performance is due to various factors, including the expectation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon drop the lawsuit against Ripple over the token’s status. With the regulator dropping crypto-related actions against Coinbase, Uniswap, and Robinhood, many believe that Ripple is next. XPR ETF for 2025 is at 75% Yes (Source: Polymarket) The market expectations are clearly evident in the Polymarket contract on whether the SEC will approve an XRP exchange-traded fund in 2025.

Here’s what this reset could mean for BTC, based on past trends. Bitcoin Open Interest Has Gone Through A Crash Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC Open Interest has seen a retest recently. The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of futures positions related to Bitcoin that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Peak In? This Data Suggests Otherwise, Analytics Firm Says When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up more positions on the market. Generally, the total leverage present in the sector goes up when this happens, so this kind of trend can lead to more volatility for the asset. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the futures users are closing up positions or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. As leverage decreases following such a trend, the market can act in a more stable manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest, as well as its 90-day percentage change, over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest shot up to a new all-time high (ATH) of $33.6 billion back in January. Interestingly, this peak in the indicator coincided with the ATH in the price itself. As mentioned before, a rise in the Open Interest can lead to volatility for the cryptocurrency. The reason behind this lies in the fact that a mass liquidation event, popularly known as a squeeze, can become more probable to occur when the market is overleveraged. In such an event, a sharp swing in the price triggers a large amount of simultaneous liquidations, which end up acting as fuel for the move itself, thus elongating its length. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations. The volatility emerging out of an increase in the Open Interest can, in theory, take Bitcoin in either direction. During the earlier bull rally, the Open Interest increase was accompanied by bullish momentum. From the chart, it’s visible, however, that the indicator reached a turning point around the time of the aforementioned peak. As bearish momentum took over Bitcoin following the ATH, it was now the turn of the bulls to get liquidated. The massive long squeezes that the price legs down induced helped to further the price decline, explaining its sharpness. Related Reading: Dogecoin Can Still Go Parabolic If This Support Holds, Analyst Says Today, the Open Interest is down to just $23.1 billion, with the indicator’s 90-day change sitting at a notable low of -14%. In the chart, the quant has highlighted the previous deleveraging events where the metric plummeted in a similar manner. “Looking at historical trends, each past deleveraging like this has provided good opportunities for the short to medium term,” notes the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether this cooldown in the futures market will be enough for Bitcoin to see a rebound or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $83,500, up 1% in the last 24 hours.

Is a Fall or a Rebound More Likely?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-in-bitcoin-in-the-coming-days-is-a-fall-or-a-rebound-more-likely/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price action suggests that institutional investors have yet to make a strong comeback, leaving the market in a consolidation phase. According to a report from Bitfinex, Bitcoin fell significantly from its all-time high of $109,590 on Jan. 20 to a low of $77,041 last week. This 29.7% drop marks the second deepest correction in the current bull market. Historically, bull markets tend to experience corrections of around 30% before resuming their rise, according to Bitfinex. However, this cycle has been characterized by shallower pullbacks, largely due to institutional adoption and demand from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite this, short-term holders are currently facing net unrealized losses, adding to the sell-side pressure. Investors who bought Bitcoin in the past 7 to 30 days are particularly vulnerable to capitulation, which further exacerbates market weakness, analysts say. Related News: Outlook Changes in Altcoin Dominance Analysis Firm Draws Particular Attention to These 10 Altcoins A major concern highlighted in the report is the slowdown in fresh capital inflows. When new money enters the market lessens and cost basis trends shift, this is typically a sign of weakening demand. This is becoming more apparent as Bitcoin struggles to maintain key support levels. Without significant new buying activity, BTC could remain in a prolonged period of consolidation or face further declines as weaker holders exit their positions. Market analysts suggest that the return of long-term holders and institutional demand will be critical in determining Bitcoin’s next move. If deep-pocketed investors begin to absorb supply at these low levels, it could signal the start of an accumulation phase, potentially stabilizing prices and shifting market sentiment back into bullish territory. *This is not investment advice.

In terms of Bitcoin holdings, North Korea is the fifth largest country in the world. / Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The Scale of North Korean Cybercrime North Korea’s vast wealth in cryptocurrencies stems from years of cyberattacks and crypto heists, including the 2024 DMM Bitcoin exploit in Japan and the 2022 Ronin Network breach , where Lazarus stole $308 million and over $600 million, respectively. The Lazarus Group refers to a large subset of state-sponsored cyber activities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), operating as an integral wing of North Korea’s central foreign intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). Chainalysis’ Crypto Crime 2025 Report shows North Korean hackers stole $660.5 million in 2023 and $1.34 billion in 2024, marking a 102.88% year-over-year increase. One of the most recent examples of North Korea’s expanding cyber operations is the Bybit hack. Bybit Attack: North Korea’s Massive Crypto Theft The dramatic increase in North Korea’s Bitcoin holdings is directly linked to the February 2025 attack on the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. The Lazarus Group organized the theft of over 400,000 Ether from Bybit’s secure multi-signature cold wallet. Following the theft, Lazarus employed sophisticated techniques to launder the stolen Ether and convert it into Bitcoin. The group exploited decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like THORChain, which faced criticism for lacking strong anti-crime protections. This allowed Lazarus to obscure the origins of the stolen funds and facilitate their conversion into Bitcoin. This attack has consequences beyond Bybit’s financial losses. According to the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) , proceeds from cyberattacks, along with other illicit wealth generated by North Korean-funded syndicates, fund North Korea’s nuclear missile program and pose a major threat to international security.

Hashdex’s move could open the door for major investors to explore altcoins, reshaping crypto investment priorities. Litecoin’s inclusion challenges the Bitcoin-Ethereum dominance, pushing investors to reconsider diversification strategies Crypto asset management firm Hashdex submitted an amendment proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last Friday to add Litecoin (LTC) to its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. If approved, Litecoin will join the ETF’s other proposed digital assets, broadening its exposure to the traditional financial market and institutional investors within a regulated environment. Litecoin Gains ETF Exposure as Hashdex Seeks Broader Crypto Holdings The March 14 filing , filed under file number 333-280990, outlined Hashdex’s plans to expand its Crypto Index ETF portfolio beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The revised index is expected to include additional cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI), with each operating on its respective blockchain network. Particularly, the addition of Litecoin would further diversify the fund’s holdings and attract investors interested in a wider array of cryptocurrencies. BTW, @hashdex 's CEO @SamirKerbage is going to be at the Litecoin Summit in Vegas the end of May. Just sayin'. https://t.co/SkVxJC7X2a https://t.co/dEUqIkRanV — Litecoin (@litecoin) March 17, 2025 An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of assets—such as stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies—traded on stock exchanges. It allows investors to buy and sell shares throughout the day, offering diversification by spreading risk across multiple assets. Hashdex’s proposal to add Litecoin isn’t random. Litecoin has been around for over a decade, often seen as Bitcoin’s lighter, faster counterpart. Its features, such as its popularity, strong liquidity, and lower transaction fees, make it an interesting addition to an ETF. If this gets the green light, it would be another step towards integrating crypto with traditional finance, which would give both big institutions and everyday investors more options to diversify their portfolios. Brazil ETF Approval Highlights Hashdex Expansion Strategy Recently, Hashdex secured approval from Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the world’s first XRP spot ETF on the B3 stock exchange. This approval allows Brazilian investors to gain exposure to XRP through a regulated investment vehicle. Hashdex continues to provide more crypto investment options while signaling increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets. The Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund was officially established on February 18, 2025, and Genial Investimentos was appointed its administrator.

Since Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs received approval in 2024, fund issuers have accelerated efforts to broaden their offerings. SEC Decision on Litecoin Could Boost Hashdex Crypto Index ETF Expansion Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimate a 90% likelihood of Litecoin ETF approval before the end of 2025. Their prediction places Litecoin ahead of Solana (70%), Dogecoin (75%), and XRP (65%). Our official alt coin ETF approval odds are out. Litecoin leads w 90% chance, then Doge, followed by Solana and XRP. We are only doing for 33 Act $IBIT -esque filings.

Demand for crypto ETFs has surged, with spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs attracting $40.7 billion and $3.18 billion in net inflows since their launches. While a Litecoin ETF may not see the same demand, Seyffart notes that even modest inflows could make it viable for fund issuers. The SEC’s final decision on Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs is expected between October 2 and 18, a timeline closely watched by investors and fund issuers looking to expand the reach of crypto index ETFs. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does Litecoin’s classification as a commodity impact its chances of ETF approval? Since Litecoin is considered a commodity rather than a security, it avoids the tougher regulations and doubts that securities may face in the same situation. This makes it easier to get approval since it sidesteps the SEC’s stricter oversight on securities branded cryptocurrencies. What are the risks of a Litecoin ETF? Among the risks known primarily to ETFs is their reliance on third parties to store assets safely. These parties are often centralized and leave space for potential price manipulation due to crypto’s volatility and liquidity issues. Could a Litecoin ETF lead to more altcoin ETFs? Yes, if Litecoin’s ETF gets approved, it could pave the way for others like Solana and XRP. A green light from regulators would show they’re open to approving beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, which would mean they are now open to altcoins, too.

CZ was responding to a post on X (formerly Twitter) by crypto influencer EmperorBTC, who analyzes the psychological landscape of market participants. “The bar for success in crypto is very low,” EmperorBTC said, arguing that most investors are ill-equipped to deal with the volatile nature of the crypto market. According to EmperorBTC, 80% of crypto investors are simply “tourists,” entering the market excitedly and leaving when sentiment changes. Another 10% are making buying and selling decisions based on misleading influencers, while another 5% believe they are falsely projecting wealth. That leaves only the 5% who truly understand crypto, he claimed. Related News: Binance Finally Brought The Expected Feature: Added to the Home Page, Here are the Impacted Altcoins CZ weighed in on these statistics, suggesting that even among the 5% of so-called “insiders,” most have failed to outperform Bitcoin. “Even if there were a 5% who were true experts in crypto, most of them still wouldn’t be able to outperform Bitcoin,” he said. He also noted that within this group, only 4% actively trade or allocate capital to blockchain projects, but they still lag behind Bitcoin’s long-term performance. CZ said that simply holding Bitcoin outperforms 99% of crypto market participants and even outperforms most traditional asset classes with minimal effort. Despite Bitcoin’s dominance, CZ admitted that rising into the top 1% of crypto investors requires extraordinary effort, deep market knowledge, and constant work. *This is not investment advice.

Per the news agency EFE (via Infobae ), police officers said they had “dismantled” a “criminal organization” that promoted “fake cryptocurrency investments.” Spanish Police Make Arrests in Malaga, Madrid, Murcia Officers said they have arrested eight people, but fear that “more than 3,600 people” have lost money to the crypto scam . National Police Corp vehicles in Spain. (Source: Supertoni123 [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The National Police Corps (CNP)’s Economic and Financial Crime Unit said the network’s mastermind was a “computer programmer” whom they arrested in Malaga. The CNP also made arrests in the cities of Murcia, and Madrid, detaining people of “various nationalities and backgrounds.” The detainees include “marketing and web design experts,” officers said. Police say the group developed a “seemingly legitimate platform that offered clients a choice of Bitcoin investment plans.” They then allegedly promoted these products on various websites and social media platforms. Victims, police said, “did not need to know anything about crypto,” as the alleged scam operators “made it easy for people to convert hundreds, even thousands of euros into Bitcoin.” The alleged scammers were also able to dupe some “victims” into surrendering control of their electronic devices to “carry out crypto transfers themselves, in addition to stealing their personal and banking data.” Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Operation Began in 2022 – Police The CNP first learned of the operation in 2022, when a “victim” filed a report in Murcia. As police investigated, they unearthed a complicated network of investments whereby older investors were paid using newer investors’ funds. When people tried to withdraw their funds from the platform, the operators would reportedly concoct “obstacles” to delay or obfuscate the process. One officer told EFE that some “victims” signed “contracts” with the operators, who “promised to pay dividends of 40% after one month,” and “up to 300% after a year.” The police force eventually found a “trail” of fraud that “included thousands of victims in as many as 36 countries.” Spain’s economy is getting a boost thanks to the country’s attractiveness for remote workers, according to central bank chief Jose Luis Escriva https://t.co/ke3IYbcEbh — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 17, 2025 ‘Worthless Coin’ The CNP thinks that “at least 3,646 victims” lost their money to the scammers, 2,718 of whom are Spanish residents. The fraudsters appear to have amassed vast Bitcoin holdings, with crypto wallets containing some BTC 400. Officers say the masterminds also “created a new, worthless token” to investors. The victims were mainly individuals who “had never invested in cryptocurrencies” before, the CNP said. Some corporations also fell victim to the scam, officers added. Officers also froze 73 bank accounts and impounded cars, motorcycles, computer equipment, and hundreds of euros in cash.

Analysts suggest this pattern has been confirmed, as the altcoin has broken above its neckline resistance. This development indicates strong buying pressure, which could push the Ripple token price toward the $30 mark. Bullish Double Bottom Pattern Suggests XRP Price Could Reach $30 According to analyst Steph Is Crypto, XRP price has completed a double-bottom formation by breaking above the neckline resistance. This breakout is considered a strong bullish signal, indicating a potential rally. Historically, once this type of pattern is confirmed, prices tend to rise, with projections based on the pattern’s height extended from the breakout point. The long-term chart of XRP price shows an extended accumulation phase, similar to previous bull cycles. The breakout above the neckline suggests strong buying momentum, potentially triggering an altcoin rally. Top analysts anticipate that if momentum sustains, XRP price could move towards its projected $30 target. Source: X More so, XRP price breakout aligns with increasing trading volume, reinforcing the bullish outlook. A sustained increase in volume after a breakout often indicates institutional participation and growing investor confidence. Additionally, analysts highlight the absence of strong resistance between current levels and the projected target, making a sharp upward movement feasible. Ripple Price Must Hold $2 Support Level Additionally, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out that XRP price is also forming a head-and-shoulders pattern on its weekly chart. This pattern typically signals a trend reversal, with the $2 support level being crucial for maintaining an upward trajectory. Martinez highlighted that if XRP price fails to hold above $2, it could face a decline to $1.25. Traders are closely monitoring this level, as a breakdown below it could lead to further downside pressure. However, if the support holds, XRP could continue its bullish trend and push towards the projected $30 target. Source: X Altcoin Rally and Broader Market Trends The broader cryptocurrency market trend is another factor influencing XRP price. Bitcoin’s performance and macroeconomic factors, such as the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions, could impact investor sentiment. A positive market environment could support an altcoin rally, benefiting XRP’s upward momentum. According to CryptoQuant’s recent analysis, the rising demand for stablecoins is fueling an altcoin season . Experts believe this shift signals a strong rally for altcoins in the coming weeks. The recent market correction has seen XRP price trading between $1.79 and $3.36. A rebound began in early March, with XRP closing the past week in green. At press time, Ripple token price was $2.34, reflecting a 1.95% increase in the last 24 hours. Historical price trends suggest that XRP has undergone extended periods of accumulation before major bull cycles. This pattern appears to be repeating, with XRP price breaking above key resistance zones. Adding to the bullish sentiments, Ripple filed a trademark for downloadable software to custody crypto assets. This move could push the altcoin toward the $5 mark in the coming months and probably cross the $30 price target.

In a new interview on Senator Ted Cruz’s Verdict podcast, Musk says the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has now discovered about 14 “magic money” computers. Musk tells Cruz that these computers are responsible for sending trillions of dollars in payments. “I call a magic money computer any computer that can make money out of thin air. It just issues payments… They just send money out of nothing.” Musk says about 5-10% of the payments executed by these computers are not reported. “You may think that the government computers all talk to each other. They synchronize. They add up what funds are going somewhere and it’s coherent, and that the numbers that you’re presented as a Senator are actually the real numbers. One would think. They’re not.” Musk says DOGE has discovered these computers at the Treasury Department, State Department, Health and Human Services Department and the Defense Department. According to Musk, the government’s systems make it tough to reconcile payments and tackle waste and fraud. “If you want to know what what the situation is with the accounting and you’re trying to reconcile accounting and get rid of waste and fraud, you must be able to analyze the computer databases. Otherwise you can’t figure it out. Because what you’re doing is asking a human – who will then ask another human – and finally usually ask some contractor – who will ask another contractor – to do a query on the computer. So it’s many layers deep. The only way to reconcile the databases and get rid of waste and fraud is to to actually look at the computers and see what’s going on. When I sort of cryptically refer to reprogramming The Matrix, you have to understand what’s going at the computers. You have to reconcile the computer databases in order to identify the waste and fraud.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a new thread, the pseudonymous crypto analyst Pentoshi tells his 861,300 followers on the social media platform X that we are close to seeing the end of quantitative tightening (QT), which are policies that reduce the Fed’s balance sheet and lowers the supply of money in circulation. The trader cites data from the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, which shows that 100% of users believe that the Fed will end QT by May of this year. The cessation of QT is typically seen as bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins as the move signals the end of tight monetary conditions. However, Pentoshi warns investors to be “cautiously optimistic” as both the S&P 500 and top crypto assets have seen growth over the last few years that appears unsustainable. “I think we are getting close to [the] end of QT with Polymarket now pricing in odds as a sure thing whereas before they were much lower odds. As previously stated, it does seem Trump would end up forcing it. I don’t think QT automatically means it’s easy mode. I think that mode is clearly gone overall in the way people think about it (2017/2021). While prices are much lower, I think it’s best to be cautiously optimistic. Many things are down significantly and there hopefully will be some decent mean reversion. Markets in general have rallied hard. And assets were likely a bit overvalued before. SPX going 25% back to back years was going to have low growth or negative this year as it wasn’t a sustainable pace. BTC went from $16,000 to $108,000, SOL [from] $8 to $300. Cautiously optimistic. [Be] patient for any time capitulation, as often, following big trends, we eventually get longer sideways periods and less volatility as the market finds balance.” While Pentoshi is flipping tactically bullish on stocks and crypto, he warns investors that any rally will likely be short-lived. “I think any up currently will be a lower high. People underestimate the time aspect.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $83,248.

The general market sentiment is one of a cautious nature, and hopes of a quick return above $90,000 are starting to fade. However, a new technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a significant rally, as price action shows the cryptocurrency is currently conforming to the cup-and-handle pattern. Cup And Handle Support Could Cause A Major Bitcoin Rally Recent Bitcoin price movements have drawn attention back to a key technical structure of the handle support of a cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting that a bullish setup may be quietly taking shape. This interesting Bitcoin price activity was relayed in a technical analysis by a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suppression Below $100,000 Worries Investors, JPMorgan Analysts Reveal Real Problem The cup-and-handle pattern in question has been forming over multiple years, with the rounded bottom phase stretching from 2021 to mid-2024. This prolonged accumulation period saw Bitcoin gradually recover from the bearish market cycle before breaking above its neckline resistance. The breakout started the handle formation in the latter half of 2024, a consolidation phase that set the stage for BTC’s next leg up. By November 2024, Bitcoin completed this handle phase and went on an impressive rally that ultimately resulted in a new all-time high of $108,786 in January 2025. However, the recent 24% correction from this all-time high has seen the Bitcoin price returning to the neckine resistance of the cup-and-handle formation. The logical next step is for this neckline resistance to serve as support for the price correction and we could see Bitcoin rebound from here. In terms of a price prediction, Elliott wave analysis and projections put the price target above $130,000, particularly at $139,000. Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests A Surge Toward $130,000 According to the Elliot Waves technical framework, Bitcoin is currently in a larger fifth impulse wave formation. However, this fifth wave, which is generally bullish, has been punctuated by corrective ABC sub-waves, leading Bitcoin to retest the support of the cup-and-handle formation. Now that the support has been met, Bitcoin is in a position to bounce and continue the formation of its fifth impulse wave. This is expected to bring it to the price target above $130,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Crashed To 6-Month Low, Here’s What Followed The Last Time The alignment of the cup-and-handle formation with Elliott wave projections strengthens the case for a major breakout in the coming months. However, Bitcoin’s fundamentals reflect uncertainty in the short term. There is currently a lack of bullish momentum needed to rechallenge the $90,000 mark, which would be the first step needed to reach $130,000.

President Donald Trump nominated Atkins to lead the SEC on Dec. 4, but his marriage into a billionaire family has reportedly caused headaches with financial disclosures — delaying his potential start date. While it isn’t clear whether the White House has produced those papers to the Senate, Senate Banking, House and Urban Affairs Chair Tim Scott is reportedly eyeing a March 27 hearing to review Atkins’ standing, Semafor’s Eleanor Mueller said in a March 17 X post. “No clarity yet on whether the committee has Atkins’ paperwork in hand, but either way, this is the most momentum we’ve seen so far.” Atkins would, however, need to be voted in by the Senate at a later date. Mueller also said the Senate banking committee is also planning to hold a bipartisan meeting on Atkins’ nomination on March 21. Source: Eleanor Mueller It follows an earlier March 3 Semafor report , where Mueller said financial disclosures had held Atkins back from scheduling a Senate hearing to review his standing. His wife’s family is tied to TAMKO Building Products LLC — a manufacturer of residential roofing shingles that reportedly turned over $1.2 billion in revenue in 2023, Forbes said on Dec. 14, 2024. “It’s a lot to go through,” one former Senate Banking Committee staffer reportedly told Mueller on March 3. “But he got named so early on, so I think that’s why people are starting to be like, ‘What the hell’s taking so long?’” Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008 and worked as a corporate lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP in New York before that. He is expected to regulate the crypto arena with a more collaborative approach than former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. It’s been almost four months since Atkins was chosen by Trump to lead the SEC on Dec. 4, and over two months since Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. A late start for an SEC chair wouldn’t be too unusual, however. The two most recent SEC chairs, Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton, started on April 17, 2021, and May 4, 2017 — months after presidential transitions occurred in those years. Related: SEC’s enforcement case against Ripple may be wrapping up Meanwhile, Mark Uyeda has been serving as the SEC’s acting chair since Gensler left on Jan. 20. Since then, the Uyeda-led SEC has established a Crypto Task Force led by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and canceled a controversial rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets. The SEC has dropped several investigations and lawsuits that the Gensler-led commission filed against the likes of Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap and OpenSea over the last month. The SEC is also looking to abandon a rule requiring crypto firms to register as exchanges and may even axe the Biden administration’s proposed crypto custody rules, Uyeda said on March 17.

Standard Chartered’s decision to ditch its Ethereum to $10K prediction is the latest in a series of negatives for the asset. Ethereum Price Continues In Descending Channel Recent price movements for Ethereum (ETH) are unpromising with analysts predicting a steeper drop for the asset. At the moment, Ethereum’s price hovers around $1,930 continuing its unenthusiastic ranging pattern. The MACD indicator confirms widespread buying weakness for the second-largest cryptocurrency with bears reigning supreme. Moving averages are pointing to a neutral trend for Ethereum price, sparking theories over a possible consolidation for the asset. “The price continues to move in a descending channel, indicating a possible continuation of consolidation,” said the pseudonymous LVelarde. At the moment, the Ethereum price is consolidating below the 5-day and 200-day moving averages (MA) with traders scanning the horizon for a potential breakout or rejection. Since ETH fell below $2,000 , a slew of dour sentiment has trailed the asset, casting doubt over its long-term future. “In the short term, technical indicators point to a possible retest of support around $1,800-$1,850, and a break below could reinforce the bearish movement,” said LVelarde. Standard Chartered Slashes Its ETH Prediction Ethereum’s community was roiled by Standard Chartered’s reduction of its ETH prediction for 2025 from $10,000 to $4,000. According to a note, Standard Chartered analysts are predicting ETH will continue underperforming ahead of its 10th anniversary. Analysts termed Ethereum’s decline as a “mid-life crisis” with layer 2 Base taking off $50 billion from ETH’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, the incoming Converge blockchain will snag a portion of Ethereum’s market cap as experts call for a radical change. “Only a proactive change of commercial direction from the Ethereum Foundation – such as taxing layer 2 – could achieve that now, in our view,” read the note. Ethereum ETFs have faltered with the inbound 21Shares liquidations of Bitcoin and Ethereum Futures ETFs. Experts say that Pectra activation on the mainnet can trigger a fresh rally for Ethereum price to a $5,000 valuation.

According to the latest analysis by crypto research firm MakroVision, ETH has not seen a strong buying reaction so far. The key question now is whether Ethereum has formed a bottom or if the decline will continue. Analysis shows that Ethereum has dropped below multiple support zones and is revisiting deeper liquidity areas. Despite the brief stabilization, no sustained buying momentum has been seen, leaving the risk of further declines high. Analysts list the key critical price zones for ETH as follows: $2,132: First major hurdle. Ethereum must reclaim this level to start a potential recovery. $2,400: A critical area with descending trend lines. Breaking above this level could signal a trend reversal. $1,730: This level has held so far, but another test could weaken the support. $1,544: The lowest liquidity zone, likely the next target if Ethereum breaks below $1,730.

33767162,[object Object],1742257805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio Reaches Highest Since September: What It Means,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-stress-ratio-highest-september/,"On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin “Supply Stress Ratio” has climbed to 0.23 recently, a sign that may not be positive for the BTC market. Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio Indicates Market Currently Under Stress In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the the latest trend in the Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio. The “Supply Stress Ratio” here refers to an indicator that measures, in the analytics firm’s words, “the relative magnitude of supply in loss.” The BTC Blockchain data is public, meaning anyone can look at the transaction history that the users have participated in. This allows for a way to track things like investor cost basis and profit-loss status. The cost basis of the holders, also known as the Realized Price , can be obtained by assuming that the previous transaction of any token of the cryptocurrency represents the last time that it changed hands. That is, the price at its time was its acquisition value. Comparison of this cost basis against the current spot price can tell us whether the coin is currently being held at a profit or loss. The Supply Stress Ratio makes use precisely of this data to calculate its value. When the indicator’s value is zero, it means no part of the BTC supply is being held at a loss. In other words, the market isn’t under any ‘stress’. This condition occurs only when the asset’s price is exploring new all-time highs (ATHs). The rest of the time, the metric stays above this mark, indicating some portion of the investors are underwater. The higher the indicator’s value, the more the supply is in loss, and so, the higher the market stress. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode, that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio has witnessed a jump recently as the asset’s bearish price action has occurred. The indicator is now sitting at a value of 0.23, which is the highest since September. “Historically, values above 0.2 have marked periods of heightened market stress,” notes the analytics firm. In the chart, the data of two other metrics is also displayed. Colored in red is the Realized Price of the Supply in Loss , meaning that it’s the average value at which the loss holders purchased their coins. Similarly, the blue line represents the Realized Price of the Supply in Profit . The stress that the loss investors are under right now is also visible from these metrics, as the spot price of the asset is currently trading notably under the red curve. So far, Bitcoin has shown stabilization around its lows, but it only remains to be seen whether the decline is over or if there is more to come. Naturally, a further drawdown would mean an increase in the Supply Stress Ratio. “If the value continues to rise, it could signal increasing market pressure, potentially reinforcing a broader shift in sentiment,” explains Glassnode. BTC Price Bitcoin has taken to sideways movement recently as its price is still floating around the $83,000 mark, printing flat returns for the week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin profitability|Bitcoin Supply In Loss|Bitcoin Supply Stress Ratio|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-18 00:30:05

From Dogecoin’s legendary rise to Pepe’s unexpected pump, these tokens thrive on community, culture, and virality. But in a crowded market, finding the best new meme coins for massive return potential isn’t easy. Some offer staking rewards, others ride pop culture waves, and a few even integrate AI. So, which ones have what it takes to explode in the following years? BTFD Coin’s presale is nearing its final stages, having already raised over $6.32 million with more than 71 billion coins sold. As Stage 14 wraps up, the chance to grab BTFD at $0.00016 is fading fast. With projections pointing to a potential moonshot of $0.006, early buyers could be looking at a staggering 3,650% ROI. And with its 10% referral rewards program , it’s not just about buying—it’s about earning, too. 1. BTFD Coin – The Meme Coin That Rewards Its Holders Built around the philosophy of “Buying The Dip,” this Ethereum-based project has captivated the crypto community with its bullish spirit, high APY staking, and referral rewards program. The BTFD Coin Rewards Program is a game-changer. Investors who refer others earn 10% of their referral’s raise amount in BTFD tokens if they make it to the top 20 leaderboard at the end of the month. Meanwhile, those using a referral code get a 10% bonus on their purchase if they invest at least $50. For investors eyeing long-term gains, the numbers are enticing. A $1,000 investment at the presale price of $0.00016 could net over 6.25 million BTFD coins. If BTFD hits $0.0006 upon launch, that investment balloons to $3,750. And if it surges to $0.006 as some predict? That same $1,000 could transform into a staggering $37,500. Why this meme coin made it to this list: BTFD rewards its holders with a referral system that incentivizes growth while offering a pathway to massive returns. Plus, its thriving community (11,400+ strong) and staking potential make it a solid bet. 2. Gigachad – The Alpha of the Meme Coin Space Gigachad is a meme coin that celebrates internet masculinity and the ultimate “Sigma” mindset. With a strong NFT integration, Gigachad offers holders access to exclusive content, community perks, and governance votes within its ecosystem. This coin thrives on meme culture, backed by a die-hard following that’s spreading its dominance across social media. Why this meme coin made it to this list: Its viral appeal, NFT utility, and ultra-engaged community make Gigachad one to watch. 3. Floki Inu – The Viking-Inspired Meme Coin with Impressive Utility Floki Inu has evolved beyond meme status, building an ecosystem with a metaverse game, DeFi tools, and even an education platform. The project is named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, giving it an initial boost, but its roadmap shows long-term ambitions that set it apart. Why this meme coin made it to this list: With real-world utility and an expanding ecosystem, Floki Inu has staying power beyond the hype among the best new meme coins for massive return potential. 4. Bone ShibaSwap – The Governance Powerhouse Bone ShibaSwap serves as the governance token of the ShibaSwap DEX, allowing users to vote on proposals that shape the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It’s a vital part of Shiba’s DeFi ambitions and is a must-watch for investors bullish on the Shiba Inu brand. Why this meme coin made it to this list: As a governance token with real decision-making power, Bone plays a crucial role in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 5. Just a Chill Guy – 2024’s Most Viral Meme This meme coin embodies a stress-free approach to crypto investing, with a community focused on positivity and rewards. Just a Chill Guy offers passive income through staking and fun engagement in its meme-driven ecosystem. Why this meme coin made it to this list: It turns crypto into a relaxing experience, blending humor with solid tokenomics. 6. Peanut the Squirrel – The Acorn Collector of Crypto After Peanut’s emotional story went viral, the community rallied by creating this meme coin as tribute, and it’s still relevant to this day. Dedicating part of the profits to wildlife preservation initiatives, this meme coin is far more than its viral appeal. Why this meme coin made it to this list: It’s a meme coin with heart and soul, giving it a unique, charitable edge over other best meme coins for massive return potential. 7. SLERF – The Dark Horse with Explosive Potential Backed by an anonymous team, SLERF has cultivated a passionate following eager to see where the project leads. However, it depends on its virality and the market hype, positioning itself as a high-risk bet with potentially insane rewards if it gains traction once again.

The rally coincided with another positive day for U.S. stocks, providing a favorable backdrop for cryptocurrencies. Despite the bullish price action, some analysts remain cautious. Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Group, warned that the monthly chart of the S&P 500 is pointing to a potential correction in U.S. equities, which could negatively impact cryptocurrencies. “Given the state of global trade tensions and concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy, there is concern that stocks could fall further at a time when it is increasingly unclear how much more accommodation the Fed can provide,” Kruger said. Related News: Binance Finally Brought The Expected Feature: Added to the Home Page, Here are the Impacted Altcoins Kruger also noted that if there is a broader correction in the market, Bitcoin could return to its March 2024 highs of around $73,000-$74,000. Investors are closely watching this week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates at current levels. However, analysts are watching for potential changes to the central bank's quantitative tightening (QT) program that could impact market liquidity. David Duong, director of research at Coinbase Institutional, suggested that the Fed could pause or end the QT program as bank reserve levels approach the 10-11% of GDP threshold deemed necessary for financial stability. Duong attributed the recent crypto sell-off to macroeconomic concerns and worsening liquidity conditions. However, he believes that these conditions could improve in the coming quarters and provide some support for asset prices. “Cryptocurrency prices could find bottoms in the next few weeks before hitting new highs later this year,” Duong said. *This is not investment advice.

Valued at $0.02, the token looks forward to making a 25% jump up to $0.025 when phase four arrives, with analysts speculating a 200% investment win at its $0.06 exchange debut. On a larger timeframe, estimates suggest it could reach $3.20—a 15,900% increase—on the back of its decentralized lending customer usage and buy-pressure mechanics. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Hedera (HBAR) tease bullish patterns, neither holds a semblance of substance, relying on speculative trends that pale in comparison to MUTM’s sound DeFi fundamentals. Here’s how these assets compare for wealth creation in 2025. Hedera (HBAR): A Volatile Dance With Resistance Hedera (HBAR) Shows Cautious Optimism As Its Price Rises To $0.219 Resistance A 5% bounce from last week’s 20% collapse suggests buyer interest, but momentum is still tenuous. The Average Directional Index (ADX) sits at 27.4, indicating a flagging bearish trend, and increasing buying pressure pushes the +DI indicator higher. Traders eye a potential 40% run to $0.287 on the break of resistance, though failure to make a move could see a dive below $0.17. The Ichimoku Cloud tells a mixed story: HBAR is grimly moving around and above the over the Tenkan-Sen line, though remains stuck below the Kijun-Sen baseline. Short term EMAs suggests potential reversal, but doubt remains over the market. For HBAR, success in 2025 depends on the destruction of immediate technical obstructions — an uphill battle not guaranteed to succeed. Shiba Inu Takes its Gambles on Memes Shiba Inu (SHIB) hangs around with ambitious price targets on hand but is dependent on social hype and technical patterns. Downtrend channel bull trap, resistance $0.000013 While analysts trumpet a 12x jump if SHIB takes out this zone, the 200-day EMA remains a defiant barrier. Exchange reserves tumbling to 94.2 trillion tokens—a four-year low—signal less sell pressure, and social mentions have exploded up by 4,110. Pumpers include Luis Delgado, who wants a $0.01 target price (up 76,923%). Doing so, however, requires the slashing of SHIB’s market-dominating supply and the fostering of mainstream adoption — a dual task even optimists deem Herculean. SHIB could be made to $0.000081 (450% gains) by 2025 — but its road ahead is littered with “ifs” that dent wealth-generation certainty. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outshines speculative competitors with a lending protocol that offers genuine yield. Phase three at $0.02 gives early access to a token designed to absorb demand spikes. A price rise to $0.025 in phase four yields immediate 25% returns, and the listing price of $0.06 offers 200% profit. After launch, algorithmic buybacks—paid for by platform revenue—will create eternal buy-side pressure, pushing MUTM to conservative $3.20 predictions. This is similar to a 15,900% ROI, a small return compared to HBAR and SHIB. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the process of a CertiK audit for its smart contracts. Once completed, the results will be shared on official social platforms. More reinforcing the project’s commitment to security and transparency. Also boosting investor trust as the presale gains traction. mtTokens help make the project’s proposition more appealing: assets deposited such as ETH or DAI earn interest as chyme mtETH or mtDAI, combining liquidity with passive income. Overcollateralized loans and P2P lending also help mitigate risk in the system to lure more conservative capital. Phase three is already 5,800 holders strong, with the speed of fill-rate further emphasizing a need to act. Wait too long and you could miss the lowest price tier before exchange listings trigger parabolic runs. Final Status: Utility Beats Speculation Where Hedera and Shiba Inu offer volatile opportunities, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is an easily accessible path to structured, demand-led growth. As HBAR licks wounds from relentless resistance and SHIB wanders meme-fueled pathways, MUTM’s $3.6 million presale take and 5800-holder base reflect its grounded, real-world utility. Phase three progress means the 25% prelaunch gain window closes with every passing day — a prompt to investor action ahead of 2025 wealth creation. Avoid phase four capital schemes.

Chris Chung, founder of Solana swap platform Titan, said that this is a major milestone for Solana and paves the way for the eventual approval of SOL ETFs. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital assets research, also acknowledged the development on X on Monday , calling it a major step toward the approval of a Solana ETF. Solana futures make their U.S. debut on CME with strong trading activity In February, CME announced plans to list two types of SOL futures contracts: standard contracts representing 500 SOL and smaller “micro” contracts covering 25 SOL each. These are the first regulated Solana futures available in the U.S. market, following Coinbase’s launch of SOL futures in February. The contracts are cash-settled rather than physically delivered. According to preliminary data from CME’s website , SOL futures saw a notional volume of nearly 40,000 SOL on the first day of trading—equivalent to approximately $5 million at current prices. Early trading data suggests a potentially bearish outlook among traders. CME’s April SOL futures were priced at $127 per token, $2 lower than the contracts expiring in March. The exchange does not publish finalized daily trading volumes until the next business day. The first-ever SOL futures trade on CME was executed on March 16 by trading firms FalconX and StoneX. “Solana has come a long way in the last five years,” said Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based swap platform Titan. CME Group’s Giovanni Vicioso stated last month that the introduction of Solana futures aligns with growing client demand for a wider range of regulated products to manage cryptocurrency price risk. He emphasized that as Solana gains traction among developers and investors, these futures contracts will serve as an efficient tool for investment and hedging strategies. Solana ETF approval gains momentum amid market shifts According to Chris Chung, the establishment of a regulated market for SOL futures signals Solana’s maturation as an asset. He noted that this development could allow regulators to approve additional financial products with similar risk profiles. Chung also highlighted the shifting regulatory stance toward cryptocurrency in the U.S. this year. He pointed out that while many dismissed the idea of a Solana ETF last year, it is now seen as an inevitability. He expects a wave of altcoin ETFs to gain approval in both North America and Canada, further cementing Solana’s position in mainstream finance. On March 13, Chris Chung said that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve VanEck and Canary Capital’s proposed spot Solana ETFs as early as May. Futures contracts, which are standardized agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date, are widely used for both hedging and speculation by retail and institutional investors. They also play a critical role in supporting spot cryptocurrency ETFs by offering a regulated benchmark for tracking asset performance. The CME already offers futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), both of which received SEC approval for spot ETFs last year. Bitcoin’s ETF success paves the way for Solana’s approval The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and spot Ethereum ETFs in July. A crypto task force led by Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce was launched last month and has been working on distinguishing which crypto assets are securities, among other priorities. At least 13 Solana ETF proposals are pending SEC approval. Former President Donald Trump appointed crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, but since Atkins has yet to undergo confirmation hearings, these proposals remain in regulatory limbo. ETF Store President Nate Geraci recently predicted that BlackRock will eventually file for both Solana and XRP ETFs, suggesting that a Solana filing could happen soon. Last month, Bloomberg ETF analysts estimated a 70% chance of Solana ETF approval by the end of the year. As of now, Solana’s native token is trading at approximately $126.56, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The discussion touched on federal government spending, magic money computers, nonprofit funding, and Musk’s perspectives on artificial intelligence. Cruz started off by stating that Musk had made big waves since the beginning of the new administration. The senator described Musk as someone who has had “an impact” that few others could match in so short a time. Musk, whose actions have gained significant public attention, acknowledged that recent weeks have been high-profile. He said, “Holy crap… never a dull moment.” Cruz asked Musk to compare his initial challenges when he took over D.O.G.E. He said, “Which was worse—the mess you found at Twitter or the mess you found in the federal government?” Musk said that competing with the federal government was much tougher. He added, “It is worse than I expected. But on the plus side, that means there’s more opportunity for improvement.” Shortly afterward, Musk described the government’s waste-to-fraud ratio as “80% waste, 20% fraud,” then mentioned a need to look on the bright side: “If it was a well-run ship, it would be very difficult to improve.” In the latter part of the interview, the conversation focused on identifying such improvements in federal expenditures. Magic-money computers in government agencies Musk clarified that the waste is not difficult to spot. Describing the issue, he said, “Most of what we do is not Sherlock-Holmes-level detective work. It’s very obvious, basic stuff.” He revealed that each federal department showed similar patterns. He said, “In every government department—I say every because we’ve not yet found a single exception—there are far too many software licenses and media subscriptions, more than there are humans in the department.” Cruz gave a hypothetical example, mentioning an agency with 15,000 employees and 30,000 licenses. Musk confirmed this was not unusual. He also cited departments paying for media subscriptions that no one in the department was using. At another point, Musk touched upon credit card usage, explaining that “we found there are twice as many credit cards as there are humans… and these are $10,000-limit cards.” When Ferguson asked if this might be “the biggest money-laundering scheme in the history of the world” or mere incompetence, Musk offered a blended response. He said that the ratio of waste to fraud is 80 to 20 but with certain grey areas. He gave an example of payments leaving the Treasury with no record or explanation, sometimes because a contract had never been shut off. Musk said, “Someone forgot to shut off that contract, so the company kept getting money. Now, is that waste or fraud? Both.” Elon Musk talks about the waste to fraud ratio in the government. Source: Verdict with Ted Cruz Cruz then brought up a $1.9 billion payment to what Musk called a “fake NGO” connected to political figures. Musk labeled it “utter insanity,” adding, “That’s just corrupt. I think that’s paying off cronies.” In his view, certain nonprofit organizations were receiving large sums without providing tangible services. Musk singled out an arrangement he believed was “basically paying $2 billion for maybe 100 appliances… that’s a very expensive toaster.” As part of the problem, Musk noted the lax oversight after funds are transferred: “The government can give money to a so-called nonprofit with very few controls, and there’s no auditing.” He explained that such nonprofits then use those funds for personal gains like “jets and homes,” all at the taxpayer’s expense. Cruz then moved the discussion to “magic money computers.” He said that he had never heard the term. Musk clarified it by saying that magic money is “any computer which can just make money out of thin air.” He said that there are likely 14 magic money computers in government agencies. Most of these are at the Treasury Department, but also at HHS, State, and the Department of Defense. According to him, these systems tend to send money out of nothing. Musk argued that to fix these spending irregularities, direct access to the computer systems is critical, because they drive every transaction: “You have to look at the actual electronic money flows.” Cruz concurred, recalling Musk’s earlier statement before the election: “All I want is the login for every computer.” Musk explained that it was essential because computers run the government. He added, “That’s what you need to look at to reconcile the databases and get rid of waste and fraud.” Cruz noted that few in Congress consider an alternative route, preferring to request reports instead. By contrast, Musk said that is insufficient. He stated, “If you’re just asking a human, who asks another human, who asks another human, who finally asks a contractor to do a query, you’ll never see the whole picture.” D.O.G.E expects to cut a trillion dollars of waste by FY 2026 Ferguson asked about the scale of the cuts or improvements Musk expected. Musk said that he’s confident that D.O.G.E will cut a trillion dollars of waste and fraud by fiscal year 2026. He noted that this assumes nothing impedes the process and that they can operate with full transparency. Cruz then raised Musk’s sudden transition from a “hero to the left” five years ago to a high-profile target. He observed that Musk was once widely celebrated for his involvement in electric cars and space travel. Musk replied, “Yes, I appear to be number two,” explaining that he has seen “Trump Derangement Syndrome and Elon Derangement Syndrome.” Cruz added that he believed many on the left hated Musk “after Donald Trump, more than any person on Earth.” Donald Trump with Elon Musk at the White House. Source: US White House Addressing why he attracts so much hate, Musk attributed it to his efforts in government cost-cutting: “They hate me because DOGE is being effective, and the fraud we’re seeing is overwhelmingly on the left.” He then gave his remarks on Social Security and Medicare payments, along with unemployment and disability. According to Musk, these payments often go to illegal immigrants. He added that these amount to over a hundred billion dollars, or perhaps 200 billion dollars. He alleged, “By using entitlement fraud, the Democrats have been able to attract and retain vast numbers of illegal immigrants.” Cruz asserted that those illegals may eventually be legalized, further securing certain states. Musk claimed that, in his view, these policies point to “a permanent deep-blue socialist state.” The U.S. may lose the AI race if it fails to maintain control of AI chip fabrication Their conversation later shifted to artificial intelligence and potential global competition. Cruz asked, “In 10 years, how is life going to be different because of AI?” Musk replied that within a decade, “AI will probably be able to do anything better than a human can, cognitively,” and that it would be “smarter than the smartest human.” He also predicted a large number of robots: “Probably billions of humanoid robots.” Elon Musk talks about the future of AI. Source: Verdict with Ted Cruz Cruz brought up concerns about “Killer Robots annihilating humanity,” referencing concepts akin to Skynet. Musk estimated, “Maybe 10% or 20% likely, on a 5-to-10-year timeframe.” He reminded listeners that “the glass is 80 or 90% full,” meaning he sees an 80% or 90% chance AI leads to greater prosperity. Cruz also asked which country might win the AI race. Musk answered that, for a few years, “America is likely to win,” but the deciding factor is “who controls the AI chip fabrication.” He said nearly all advanced AI chip factories—or “fabs”—are in Taiwan and warned that if China were to “invade Taiwan in the near term, the world would be cut off from advanced AI chips.” He believed this matter was “essential for national security.” Cruz closed by asking Musk about his legacy after he’s gone. Musk replied, “If SpaceX got humans to Mars, that’s what they would remember me for, even a hundred or a thousand years from now.” When asked if he planned to go to space himself, Musk stated, “I’d like to go to Mars at some point… People have asked if I want to die on Mars. I say yes, just not on impact.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Hyperliquid, a blockchain network specializing in trading, allows traders to publicly observe what type of positions a whale is holding, and since these positions are leveraged, the market can assess the liquidation levels unless an additional margin is added, Markus Thielen said in a March 17 report . Source: 10x Research “This transparency opens the door for coordinated efforts, where groups of traders could intentionally target these stop levels to trigger liquidations,” he said. It’s a common belief in the crypto market that whales with substantial holdings can influence the market through their trading tactics, such as stop-loss hunting , to deliberately trigger other traders’ stop-loss orders and liquidate their positions. Thielen says the recent actions from traders show this balance of power could be shifting. “In effect, stop-hunting is being ‘democratized,’ with ad-hoc groups now playing a role once reserved mainly for market-making desks, or treasury teams, at exchanges before tighter regulatory scrutiny,” Thielen added. Thielen told Cointelegraph that it’s still “unclear if this type of activity will become widespread onchain, but as always, transparency can cut both ways.” Why are traders trying to liquidate whales? This isn’t the first time smaller traders have attempted to take down larger entities through coordinated trading tactics. Thielen says crypto traders trying to liquidate whales have echoes of the GameStop short squeeze , which saw small traders flip the table on Wall Street short-sellers by buying GameStop’s stock, sending it to all-time highs of over $81 to liquid their positions. “This reminds me of the dynamics we saw during the GameStop saga in 2020/2021, where aggressive short squeezes drove rapid price spikes,” he said. Related: Bybit CEO on ‘brutal’ $4M Hyperliquid loss: Lower leverage as positions grow “When stop levels get triggered, prices often accelerate in that direction, providing liquidity for others to cover. We’ve seen similar tactics from market makers and exchanges in the crypto space over the years.” Hunt is still on for 40x leveraged Bitcoin short-seller On March 16, a crypto whale known for placing large, highly leveraged positions on Hyperliquid opened a 40x leveraged short position at $84,043 for over 4,442 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth over $368 million on March 16, facing liquidation if Bitcoin’s price surpassed $85,592. The move didn’t go unnoticed, and pseudonymous trader CBB sent out the call on X to gather a team of traders with enough funds to liquidate the whale’s position. Source: CBB Thielen said in the 10x report that on March 16, Bitcoin surged by 2.5% within minutes, partly because of a coordinated effort to liquidate a whale’s short position on Bitcoin perpetual via Hyperliquid. The whale has since increased their position to $524 million, and at one point, the whale hunters nearly got their wish when the price of Bitcoin hit $84,583.84, according to CoinGecko. Source: CRG However, some speculate the exposed short position could be intentional. Hedge fund trader Josh Man said in a March 17 post to X that the whale might be purposefully trying to get liquidated. “So this there is a fairly rare and not widely used technique of self-liquidation and this FEELS a little like that,” he said. “In such events, the seller is actually creating a bomb designed to go off and create a rally from the liquidation of his own short. One would expect that he has a large offsetting long versus short.” Source: Josh Man Magazine: Crypto fans are obsessed with longevity and biohacking: Here’s why",,EN,0,0,ZRX|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-18 01:29:01

Egrag Crypto, on the other hand, offers a more conservative estimate, saying that XRP can reach double digits this cycle. #XRP 100$ Realistic Target For This Bullrun 🚀 pic.twitter.com/lh403ilBjJ — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) March 15, 2025 Analyst Sets $100 As ‘Realistic’ Target In a recent Twitter/X post, XRP Captain (@UniverseTwenty) shared that $100 is Ripple’s realistic target this cycle. The post has now received dozens of replies, but it leaves more questions than answers. For example, the crypto analyst failed to identify the timeframe for this surge or the factors or events that can trigger this surge. XRP Captain’s latest tweet comes just as Egrag Crypto (@egragcrypto) added his thoughts on the coin’s direction.

Not A Far-Fetched Idea—Analysis Will XRP Break Past $300? Ripple has a few bullish supporters right now, with crypto commentator Dark Defender adding his thoughts on the asset’s latest performance. According to Dark Defender, XRP can surge to $333 if it duplicates its impressive performance during the 2017 bull run. Dark Defender’s arguments and predictions for XRP received plenty of criticism. Some argue that XRP will not achieve this market price due to its market cap. Based on the current circulating tokens, XRP’s market cap will hit $1.6 trillion if its price just hits $280. Dark Defender shot down this argument and added that a crypto market cap doesn’t matter and is “just an illusion.” Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",Altcoin|altcoins|cryptocurrency|Ripple|xrp|XRPUSD,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-18 01:30:20

In prepared remarks to an investment industry conference in San Diego on March 17, Uyeda said the rule proposed in February 2023 had seen commenters express “significant concern” over its “broad scope.” “Given such concern, there may be significant challenges to proceeding with the original proposal. As such, I have asked the SEC staff to work closely with the crypto task force to consider appropriate alternatives, including its withdrawal,” Uyeda said. The rule was floated under the Biden administration during Gary Gensler’s tenure leading the regulator. It aimed to expand custody rules for investment advisers to any and all assets held for a client, including crypto, and upped the requirements to protect them. Source: SEC This meant that investment advisers would have to custody their clients’ crypto with a qualified custodian. Gensler said at the time that investment advisers “cannot rely on” crypto platforms as qualified custodians due to how they operate. The proposal caused friction with Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce, along with industry advocacy bodies who claimed the rule was unlawful and dangerous. “How could an adviser seeking to comply with this rule possibly invest client funds in crypto assets after reading this release?” Uyeda remarked at the time. He did, however, support the proposal despite disagreeing “with a number of provisions.” Peirce, who was the sole commissioner of the five to vote against the rule, said at the time that the proposed rule “would expand the reach of the custody requirements to crypto assets while likely shrinking the ranks of qualified crypto custodians.” Related: Congress repealed the IRS broker rule, but can it regulate DeFi? Uyeda’s latest remarks come days after he said on March 10 that he had asked SEC staff “for options on abandoning” part of a proposal pushing for some crypto firms to register with the regulator as exchanges. The Trump-era SEC has also killed a rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets, called SAB 121. In December, President Donald Trump picked former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to take over from Uyeda to chair the agency. This is now a step closer, with a Senate hearing reportedly slated for March 27.

That’s because those blockchains are run by an algorithm called Proof of Work – it takes work only high-performing computers can do to get rewards worth the cost of doing that work. There’s also Proof-of-Stake blockchains, like Ethereum and Solana, which require participants to put cryptocurrencies at stake, instead of owning expensive hardware. Staking aims to lower the barriers of entry for those who want to participate in blockchain networks, as it requires mostly putting up cash, and in a lesser degree, minimal hardware requirements, compared to the highly specialized equipment required for Proof-of-Work. In theory, greater participation should make blockchains more decentralized and secure.

In a recent post on X, the analyst discussed key targets based on historical cycles and percentage-based calculations. He wrote, “I’ve been closely analyzing the strength of Wave 1 across various crypto charts, and after reviewing multiple projects, I’ve noticed a compelling pattern in #XRP that could signal a potential cycle top.” He further explained that by applying percentage formulas, he determined two primary targets: Stick 2 and Stick 3. #XRP – 3rd Stick Post ($33 – $70) I’ve been closely analyzing the strength of Wave 1 across various crypto charts, and after reviewing multiple projects, I’ve noticed a compelling pattern in #XRP that could signal a potential cycle top.

He broke down his analysis into several stages, including examining past cycles, focusing on the current cycle, and extrapolating percentage-based formulas. He also mentioned factoring in 50% and 80% discounts before finalizing his targets. While his analysis suggests significant upside potential for XRP, broader market conditions may influence the asset’s trajectory. The crypto market experienced volatility, as traders debated whether technical patterns or external financial pressures dictated current price movements. Market Conditions and Diverging Opinions Not everyone in the XRP community shares Egrag Crypto’s bullish sentiment. An X user, GoLD MiNDeR!, offered a contrasting view, arguing that XRP’s price movements are driven by market makers and large financial entities rather than technical factors. “Market Makers and Wall Street Whale traders are desperate to raise cash in case the stock market destabilizes further… they are dumping the market on low volume on Sundays and scooping up liquidity,” he commented. He expressed frustration with the current trading environment, saying he exited his XRP position at $2.38 after holding through fluctuations down to $1.90. According to him, the repeated pattern of price drops and rebounds is being orchestrated to trap traders. He advised that instead of being part of this cycle, investors should sell and wait for lower prices before re-entering. Uncertainty Surrounding XRP’s Price Action Egrag Crypto’s analysis points to a potential rally, but skepticism remains regarding whether XRP will reach such high targets . His forecast suggests that historical patterns support a move to $33–$70 , yet market sentiment remains divided. With differing opinions on whether technical analysis or broader financial conditions dictate XRP’s price, investors must carefully assess both perspectives before making decisions.

Ripple seeks to offer downloadable software for the custody, transmission, and storage of various currencies, including cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency. The trademark also covers financial services related to the safekeeping of these assets for financial management purposes. Ripple’s application includes offerings in multiple categories, including: Downloadable software for custody and transmission of various digital currencies. Custodial services , maintaining the storage and possession of digital and fiat currencies for financial management. Peer-to-peer network services , enabling the electronic transmission of financial data over networks for custody and storage. Software as a Service (SaaS) , providing temporary online software for cryptocurrency custody, transmission, and storage. Ripple’s recent trademark filing for “Ripple Custody” has sparked speculation about whether the company will launch a crypto wallet. The filing shows that Ripple is focused on offering secure storage and management for digital assets. While it doesn’t directly mention a wallet, this move suggests Ripple may expand its services to include wallet features in the future, helping users and businesses manage their cryptocurrencies more securely. The application is currently in its early stages, with a status of “New Application” and no examiner yet assigned. While the filing process can take several months, Ripple’s move into custody services could further bolster its position within the crypto ecosystem, expanding its reach beyond cross-border payments to secure asset management solutions. The global cryptocurrency custody market is expected to surge to $100 billion within the next decade, driven by growing institutional adoption and increasing regulatory clarity. As the demand for secure asset storage solutions rises, Ripple’s strategic moves to expand in this space position the company well to meet the needs of institutional clients, who require secure custody services for their digital assets.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|ALTCOIN|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-18 01:56:47

The now-deleted spot imagines ""America"" in therapy. A human embodiment of the nation desperately wants to think big – about tech, crypto, space travel. But he can't: his therapist wants him to ""focus on pronouns"" and on ""coming up with new genders."" ""America, numbers are non-binary,"" the therapist insists after chiding his ""rational thinking syndrome."" America eventually snaps and yells out, ""I want to invent technologies, not genders. That the Solana Foundation – a Swiss nonprofit whose mission is to evangelize the Solana blockchain – would call upon right-wing talking points to promote its first U.S. conference sparked immediate controversy. Some influential voices within Solanaland called it pandering ; others, offensive . It's also a reversal for an organization that previously called diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) part of its ""core values"" and insisted attendees of its flagship event show respect to others regardless of gender. Just weeks before President Donald Trump retook the White House in part on an anti-trans campaign, the foundation held a conference in Singapore. The event's code of conduct prohibited ""deliberate verbal or physical intimidation"" based on ""gender,"" ""gender identity and expression,"" or other traits often lumped in with DEI. It threatened infractors with ejection and a ban from attending future events. ""The Solana Foundation is committed to the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect,"" the Code of conduct read . It's not clear whether the Solana Foundation's ad strategy also portends a shift in its ""core values."" CoinDesk could not immediately locate the code of conduct for the upcoming event. A representative for the Solana Foundation did not return a request for comment. Regardless, the ad threatened to thrust crypto deeper into partisan politics than many in the industry are comfortable with. The crypto industry's embrace of President Trump had previously been an exercise of single-issue alignment: Trump promised to embrace crypto, and the industry's high-rollers hugged him back. The arrangement has left room for proponents to work alongside Democrats too, and many have.

Render and Cosmos Join the Race!,https://timestabloid.com/qubetics-hits-501m-tics-sold-what-makes-it-one-of-the-best/,"What if the next big thing in blockchain isn’t just about speculation but about solving real-world inefficiencies? While many blockchain projects promise innovation, only a few are actively redefining the way businesses, developers, and institutions operate. Among the emerging powerhouses, Qubetics, Render, and Cosmos stand at the forefront, each bringing a unique approach to decentralized computing, development tools, and interoperability. Qubetics , in particular, is reshaping blockchain programming with its powerful QubeQode IDE—an intuitive environment designed to simplify and accelerate smart contract development. Meanwhile, Render continues to transform GPU rendering, and Cosmos strengthens cross-chain communication. Together, these projects offer some of the best cryptos with low fees, pushing the industry toward efficiency and mass adoption. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Smart Contract Development Qubetics is an innovation powerhouse dedicated to solving real-world development inefficiencies. At its core lies QubeQode IDE, a groundbreaking integrated development environment tailored for smart contracts. This tool simplifies blockchain development, making it accessible to businesses and individuals by reducing complexities in writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Imagine a digital finance firm needing seamless smart contract deployment without hiring an expensive development team. With QubeQode, businesses can utilize pre-built templates, integrate decentralized applications with ease, and automate financial processes—all while significantly lowering transaction costs. The result? Greater adoption of blockchain technology across industries. The Qubetics crypto presale has been met with overwhelming demand. Currently in its 26th stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.1181, with over 501 million tokens sold, 23.300 token holders, and a staggering $15.2 million raised. With expectations of 746% ROI at $1 and even higher at future milestones, it’s clear why early buyers are securing their stake in Qubetics before the price surges further to one of the best cryptos with low fees. Render (RNDR): Decentralizing GPU Power Render is tackling one of the most expensive bottlenecks in modern computing—GPU rendering. The network allows users to access decentralized GPU power for high-quality rendering at a fraction of the cost. This is particularly valuable for industries like gaming, AI, and visual effects, where rendering expenses can be prohibitively high. Currently, Render’s token price has seen a 2.68% decline, sitting at approximately Rs 277 as of March 17, 2025. Despite this, market projections suggest a bullish outlook, with potential price surges to $6.838 or even $15, depending on adoption rates and demand for decentralized GPU processing. Render’s technology is already being utilized in AI model training, movie special effects, and 3D content creation, proving its value beyond speculation.

41838738,https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-devs-launch-incubator-style-program-onchain-labs,1742264807,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Arbitrum devs launch incubator-style program ‘Onchain Labs’,https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-devs-launch-incubator-style-program-onchain-labs?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Offchain Labs, the developers of Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum, have announced a partnership with the Arbitrum Foundation to launch a new incubator-style program called Onchain Labs. According to a March 17 post by Offchain Labs, the new incubator is aimed at rapidly adding to Arbitrum’s existing decentralized application (DApp) offerings with a particular focus on supporting “innovative and experimental” projects . Offchain Labs said this support will primarily come in the form of product and go-to-market advice and won’t provide engineering or other operational resources. It also added that while it’s possible — there’s no guarantee that its venture capital arm, Tandem, will purchase any of these project tokens in public markets. Source: Offchain Labs Offchain Labs said the continued development of Arbitrum over the past few years has seen it grow to become one of the “most performant ecosystems in the space.” But now, with the launch of Onchain Labs, the focus will shift to building out the network’s application landscape. “Through Onchain Labs, we’re dedicating resources to support developers looking to rapidly expand the application layer by ideating with them from the ground floor to bring the best user experiences to Arbitrum,” the company said. “With Offchain Labs’ support, we’re confident we’ll see industry-leading applications that are uniquely possible on Arbitrum.” However, it’s not just about building more applications. The firm has also said it will only support projects that launch fairly. Offchain Labs claimed the industry’s recent trend toward extractive zero-sum launches “stands in stark contrast to the core ethos of crypto,” adding that “as an industry, we can — and must — do better.” It will seek to counter this trend by only working with teams that commit to equitable launches, which it said was “essential for fostering community alignment. There’s no reason why all participants in an ecosystem can’t succeed together.” The rise of layer 2s is creating problems for Ethereum Arbitrum was one of the earliest layer 2s (L2s) on Ethereum, but there’s been an explosion in new L2 networks since Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade last year. According to L2Beat, there are now over 70 layer 2s and many more on the way. This has created some issues for Ethereum, according to some industry professionals. The first is the fracturing of the Ethereum ecosystem, as different DApps run on different layer 2s, which may or may not be interoperable. “We currently have too many, the more L2s we build, the less interoperability we will have, creating other problems around infrastructure,” Vitali Dervoed, the co-founder and CEO of perpetual exchange Composability Labs, told Cointelegraph in August. Related: DigiFT launches Invesco private credit token on Arbitrum “Developers might have good intentions when building the next super-fast, low-gas-fee, easy-to-use blockchain, but in the long run, it’s counterproductive as it creates a more fragmented ecosystem,” he added. Another issue is that lower-cost layer 2s like Base and Arbitrum are eating into Ethereum’s revenue and impacting the layer 1’s market cap. It comes on the same day Standard Chartered downgraded its 2025 price target for Ethereum by a whopping 60%, from US$10,000 to just US$4,000, with the bank’s head of digital asset research, Geoff Kendrick, saying, “We expect ETH to continue its structural decline.” Kendrick cited the impact of low-cost layer 2s like Base and Arbitrum as one of the key drivers of this decline. “Layer 2 blockchains were meant to improve ETH scalability, but we estimate that Base (a key layer 2) has removed USD 50bn from ETH’s market cap.” Magazine: ETH may bottom at $1.6K, SEC delays multiple crypto ETFs, and more: Hodler’s Digest, March 9 – 15",,EN,0,0,ARB|ETH|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-18 02:26:47

A key reason for this sluggish price action is the ongoing sell-off in Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have seen outflows exceeding $945 million in recent weeks. This marks the fifth consecutive week of institutional selling, adding pressure on BTC. Investor sentiment remains weak, as reflected in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which currently stands at 22 (Fear). The uncertainty stems from multiple factors, including fears of U.S. recession risks, Trump’s trade policies, and regulatory uncertainty in the crypto sector. Last week's market update: Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a net outflow of -$921.4 million (compared to -$739.2 million the previous week) Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a net outflow of -$189.9 million (compared to -$93.9 million the previous week) Stay informed on the latest… pic.twitter.com/miw1sR8UBM — Solix Trading (@Solix_Trade) March 16, 2025 Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin briefly rebounded by 4.33%, driven by optimism around Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act, which suggests that the U.S. government should accumulate BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Key Market Insights: Bitcoin struggles below $84K as ETF outflows hit $945M. Market sentiment remains fearful, keeping investors cautious. BTC rebounds 4.33% on U.S. government Bitcoin reserve speculation. Fed’s Rate Decision & Geopolitical Tensions Could Drive BTC’s Next Move Bitcoin’s next major price move could be determined by the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on March 19. Investors are closely watching U.S. Retail Sales data and the FOMC meeting, as any signals of a dovish stance could boost Bitcoin. A rate cut would increase liquidity, potentially fueling BTC’s next rally. However, if the Fed maintains a strict stance, it could trigger a fresh wave of selling pressure, especially amid Nasdaq’s continued weakness. Historically, Bitcoin follows Nasdaq’s trend. When the Nasdaq falls, BTC tends to drop at a higher magnitude (often 2x). Tech stocks and Bitcoin are both considered high-risk assets, meaning institutional investors often treat them similarly. Key Points to Watch in This Week’s FOMC Meeting 1⃣ Interest Rate Decision – The Fed’s rate decision is set for Wednesday, March 19 (U.S. time). – Investors are 99% certain the Fed will hold rates steady. – If rates remain unchanged, attention will shift to the Dot Plot. pic.twitter.com/mugStnsVR8 — Cobak (@CobakOfficial) March 17, 2025 Geopolitical tensions are also in focus. Trump’s tariff policies and potential trade restrictions could further impact market sentiment. Any escalation in U.S. economic policies may influence the Fed’s next move, directly affecting Bitcoin’s trajectory. What to Watch: FOMC meeting outcome – A dovish stance could drive BTC higher. Nasdaq correlation – Stock market weakness could lead to BTC declines. Geopolitical risks – Trade wars and global uncertainty may fuel volatility. Bitcoin’s Correlation With Nasdaq Poses Downside Risks Bitcoin’s price remains closely tied to U.S. stock market performance, particularly the Nasdaq index, which has dropped 12% in recent weeks. Historically, BTC tends to decline twice as much as Nasdaq, implying a potential 24% BTC drop to $65,000 if the tech index extends its slide. Bitcoin Price Crash to $20K Possible If Nasdaq Enters Bear Market, Says Peter Schiff https://t.co/nNekFxrNeg — Capernaum (@CapernaumMedia) March 17, 2025 If Nasdaq declines further by 20%, Bitcoin could fall to $55,000, while a full-blown bear market in stocks—potentially a 40% Nasdaq crash—could send BTC tumbling toward $20,000, according to economist Peter Schiff. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone warns that BTC could even drop to $10,000 if gold continues to outperform. Meanwhile, gold prices have surged 13% since December 2023, strengthening its position as a safe-haven asset. Schiff predicts that if Nasdaq crashes by 40%, gold could climb above $3,800 per ounce, drawing more institutional investors away from Bitcoin. Key Takeaways: Nasdaq’s 12% decline hints at potential BTC drop to $65K. Economists warn of Bitcoin falling to $20K–$10K in a bear market. Gold’s 13% rally challenges BTC’s store-of-value appeal. Bitcoin Consolidates Near $83K – Breakout or Breakdown Ahead? Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading near $83,200, consolidating within a symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart. The 50-period EMA at $83,490 is acting as immediate resistance, while the trendline support near $82,050 is keeping prices stable. A breakout from this formation is imminent, with key resistance at $85,038—a break above this could push BTC toward $87,400 and $90,295. On the downside, $82,050 remains a crucial support level. If BTC breaks below this level, the next key supports are $79,050 and $76,600. Bitcoin remains indecisive ahead of the FOMC meeting on March 19, with traders watching for a breakout. A volume-backed move above $85,000 could confirm bullish momentum, while failure to hold support may lead to a sharper correction. BTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is making waves as a community-driven token that automatically rewards holders with real Bitcoin when BTC hits key price milestones. Unlike traditional meme tokens, BTCBULL is built for long-term investors, offering real incentives through airdropped BTC rewards and staking opportunities.

Don’t Worry—Arctic Pablo Coin Is Rising as the Next Top Crypto Coin,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-out-on-binance-coin-dont-worry-arctic-pablo-coin-is-rising-as-the-next-top-crypto-coin/,"Cryptocurrency has changed the financial market forever, and the early days of many top crypto coins are a reminder of how investors who took a leap of faith have reaped massive rewards. One of the most notable stories is that of Binance Coin (BNB), which began as a modest project but skyrocketed to become one of the largest and most successful cryptocurrencies in the market. But what about those who missed the chance to get in early on BNB? Fortunately, there’s another opportunity on the horizon: Arctic Pablo Coin . For those who regret missing out on BNB’s initial coin offering (ICO), Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale success could be a game-changer. The Early Days of Binance Coin: A Missed Opportunity? When Binance Coin (BNB) was first launched in 2017, it was priced at just $0.10 per token during its ICO. At the time, few could have predicted that this relatively small coin would go on to become one of the top crypto coins in the world. Fast forward to today, and Binance Coin has experienced astronomical growth, with its value reaching over $300 at its peak in recent years. For investors who bought BNB during the early ICO, their investments would have yielded staggering returns. Binance Coin’s rise serves as a testament to the potential for early-stage investments in promising blockchain projects. However, for those who missed the ICO, the regret of not jumping in early can be hard to shake. But there’s good news. Arctic Pablo Coin presents an almost identical opportunity, offering a chance to get in early and enjoy significant growth potential, just like the early days of Binance Coin. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Thing in Cryptocurrency? Just like Binance Coin (BNB) transformed the crypto landscape, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the next powerhouse in the market. With its ongoing presale success, this top crypto coin has garnered significant attention from investors looking to capitalize on early-stage opportunities. Unlike traditional presales that follow a fixed roadmap, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is uniquely divided by locations, with the coin metaphorically “traveling” to new regions. Currently, the meme coin presale is in Nippy Nook, but as the presale moves across different locations, the price per token is expected to rise. At the moment, Arctic Pablo Coin is priced at a modest $0.000079, offering a compelling entry point for new investors. This is a far cry from its anticipated launch price of $0.008, which represents a potential ROI of over 10,027.85% for early investors who participate in the 15th stage of the presale. The top crypto coin has already raised over $1.92 million, and the momentum continues to build as the presale progresses. Why Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale is a Must-Watch Opportunity The presale of Arctic Pablo Coin is not just another crypto project—it’s an opportunity for savvy investors to take advantage of a rare and lucrative moment. The early price point is incredibly attractive, and the project’s unique approach to its presale is a key part of its appeal. By “traveling” across locations, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a sense of excitement and urgency that traditional presales simply can’t match. Early investors in Arctic Pablo Coin could see massive returns once the coin hits its full potential. For those who missed out on the Binance Coin (BNB) ICO, this could be a second chance to get in on the ground floor of a cryptocurrency poised to take the market by storm. What Makes Arctic Pablo Coin Stand Out? Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a copycat project; it’s innovating in ways that make it stand out among other top crypto coins. For one, the token burn mechanism ensures that the total supply decreases over time, helping to drive up the value of each individual coin. The project’s high APY (annual percentage yield) and staking rewards offer additional incentives for investors who want to lock in their holdings and watch them grow. By combining cutting-edge technology with a strong community focus, Arctic Pablo Coin is building the foundation for long-term success. As the presale continues to gain traction, it’s becoming clear that this is one top crypto coin to watch in the coming months. Final Words: A Second Chance at Early Investment Success For those who missed out on Binance Coin’s initial ICO and are still wondering “What if?”—now is the time to act. Arctic Pablo Coin presents an incredible opportunity for those looking to capitalize on an early-stage investment with massive potential. The presale has already raised over $1.92 million, and the token is still available at a low entry point. As the presale progresses and the price increases, those who invest now could see substantial returns once the coin launches. With its unique presale structure, strong tokenomics, and a clear roadmap for success, Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly emerging as one of the top crypto coins in the market. Don’t miss out on this opportunity—it could be your chance to make up for that missed Binance Coin ICO. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What is Arctic Pablo Coin? Arctic Pablo Coin is a new cryptocurrency project currently in presale. It offers a unique investment opportunity with a token burn mechanism and high APY rewards. How can I participate in the Arctic Pablo Coin presale? You can join the presale by visiting the official Arctic Pablo Coin website and purchasing tokens at the current price of $0.000079. The presale is divided by locations and is expected to increase in price as it “travels.” What is the potential return on investment for Arctic Pablo Coin? Investors who buy during the 15th stage of the presale could experience over 10,027.85% ROI when the coin reaches its launch price of $0.008. How does Arctic Pablo Coin differ from other cryptocurrencies? Arctic Pablo Coin stands out by offering a unique presale structure that is location-based, a deflationary token burn mechanism, and high staking rewards. Can Arctic Pablo Coin reach the same success as Binance Coin (BNB)? While there’s no certainty in cryptocurrency, Arctic Pablo Coin has all the right elements—strong community support, innovative features, and massive growth potential—to become a top crypto coin similar to Binance Coin.

The Russian media outlet Business Gazeta reported that the Central Bank has “approached the leadership of Tatarstan” with “a proposal to pilot” some of the CBDC’s “mechanisms.” Digital Ruble Smart Contract: Tatarstan Testing Ground The republic’s Ministry of Finance says it has responded by creating a working group that will help launch the digital ruble in Tatarstan. Tatarstan on a map of Russia. (Source: TUBS [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The ministry said that it would use the Central Bank’s “test platform” to “carry out experimental conditional spending of targeted funds for selected purposes.” The announcement comes less than a month after the bank “indefinitely delayed” the CBDC’s national rollout , originally slated for August this year. This led many to speculate that the coin launch plans could be scrapped altogether, under pressure form the domestic banking sector . However, the bank has remained cagey on its CBDC launch plans since its most recent announcement. And the news from Tatarstan appears to suggest that the digital ruble is far from dead and buried. The ministry said it would work with the bank to pilot “conditional CBDC subsidies” from the national budget. These will be “transformed into smart contracts.” The “digital ruble test platform will independently track transactions within the established rules,” the ministry said. The Kremlin confirms that Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to speak to President Donald Trump on Tuesday amid the US push for a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine https://t.co/tHvUACdqrC — Bloomberg (@business) March 17, 2025 Working Group Launches The parties expect to wrap up their testing by the end of the third quarter of 2025, the ministry added. The ministry said it had already created its working group, which will be chaired by the Tatarstan Finance Minister Marat Fayzrakhmanov. It also confirmed that Tartarstan’s Minister of Digital Development Airat Khairullin would join the group. The long-serving Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina last month claimed that a “new rollout date” for the CBDC “will be announced later.” Nabiullina said the Central Bank wanted more time to work out “details” in the “pilot,” which began in August 2023. She also added that she would hold “consultation sessions” with banks to establish “the economic model most attractive to their clients.” Nabiullina claims that the pilot is going “well.” Thus far, the pilot includes 15 banks, 1,7000 citizens, and about 30 companies.

Ivanov) Moscow Also Testing Digital RUB Away from the key digital ruble smart contract development, the Moscow Metro has also announced plans to expand its own digital RUB pilot operations. A Moscow Metro station. (Source: Vyacheslav Argenberg [CC BY 4.0]) The metro system was the first transport network in the nation to begin working with the digital RUB back in 2023 . However, the media outlet RG.ru reported earlier this month that Moscow’s Deputy Mayor of for Transport and Industry Maxim Liksutov said the metro is “working on joint tests with the Central Bank and [the megabank] VTB.” Like the 2023 tests, the new pilot focuses on the Troika card, Moscow’s reusable contactless smart card. Liksutov said: “Focus group participants successfully purchased several Troika cards. They also topped up the balance of their cards using their digital ruble wallets’ universal QR code features.” The developments appear to closely mirror previous Chinese digital yuan pilots, which have also focused on delivering government subsidies to contractors and letting citizens make contactless CBDC payments on transport networks. However, Moscow has previously insisted one of the main functions of the CBDC could be to help Russian firms make cross-border payments with other digital fiat-using nations.

Pointing to both fundamental and technical indicators, Kevin contends that current Federal Reserve policies will define the exact moment altcoins begin to decisively outperform Bitcoin (BTC). Dogecoin Season Depends On The Fed In one of his updates, Kevin explained the crux of his position: “Everything is continuing to go exactly as planned. We never hopped on the #ALTSEASON bandwagon that the gurus have been pushing for 6-12 months that got people wrecked. I have continued to let my altcoins guidance be backed up by facts and fundamentals Based on all my evidence gathered I do still believe that between March-June we will see Powell come out and say that bank reserves have hit levels to where they feel it is necessary to end the run off of the balance sheet which in turn will end QT.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Alert! This Pattern Could Trigger A ‘Parabolic’ Surge He further emphasized that this potential pause—and eventual reversal—of quantitative tightening (QT) should initiate a new cycle of rate cuts and broader financial easing. According to Kevin, that combined macro shift would signal the beginning of a sustained altcoin rally: “This will then start a new cycle of easing along with further rate cuts and the combination should mark the beginning of Altcoins out performance and BTC Dominance durably heading lower. That is my call based of Macro Fundamental and Technical analysis being combined into one form of Analysis.” Digging deeper into market structure, Kevin forecasts a drop in Bitcoin dominance, a metric that measures BTC’s market capitalization relative to the entire crypto sector: “All the data I have been analyzing is telling me between March – June QT will end. Then altcoins durable out performance will begin and BTC Dominance will durably fall below 54.51%.” He notes that inflation would need to “skyrocket” for the Federal Reserve to continue QT, a scenario he views as unlikely based on his research. Related Reading: Dogecoin Forms Explosive Cup And Handle Pattern With $4 Target Pointing to similarities between current market conditions and 2019, Kevin also explores a somewhat unconventional approach—performing technical analysis (TA) on the Fed’s balance sheet itself: “If we take a look at Total Assets held by the US federal Reserve […] we can see that similar to 2019 we are getting close to re-testing the 2W 200 ema and 2W RSI and LMACD are in the same spot they were before the Fed ended QT.” He anticipates that balance sheet levels could mirror 2019 conditions within the next 126 days—leading up to around the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting, give or take a couple of weeks. Should the Fed’s total assets hit that threshold, he believes it will confirm the timing he has been advocating. While Kevin references the broader altcoin market, Dogecoin, in particular, features in his strategic outlook. Last week, he underscored the importance of overall market fundamentals and chart positioning when it comes to purchasing DOGE: “If #BTC holds up and Macro Economic Data and Monetary policy adjust then you just got your last opportunity to buy Dogecoin relatively cheap. A lot of factors at play and lots of work to do. But the risk reward at this level is superb given the circumstances.” At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.17.

Remittix never fails to steal the show every time. Read on to learn more. Tron’s Price Decline Raises Concerns With a 6.62% decline in the previous week, Tron (TRX) has witnessed a clear price drop; its worth now comes to $0.2164. Though still in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, its performance has caused investors some questions. Although the network keeps showing high user activity, the price action points to increasing doubt about its future course. Although TRX’s blockchain use is still significant, market observers point out that more general market trends and investor attitude have helped to cause the drop. Several traders are now seeking fresh investment prospects, especially in projects with great development potential and real-world use cases—a change that has driven several TRX whales to investigate Remittix. Experts Speculate That Shiba Inu Price is Overvalued Although Shiba Inu’s lowest price since its fall is $0.0000115, the daily chart shows that the $0.000012 level has provided support on a few sporadic times during significant falls. Should SHIB’s downward tendency persist, this would be the primary tool for ongoing observation. The Fear and Greed Index shows that investors are in panic mode, therefore drastically lowering the market mood. The bybit hack sale-off scared off market participants. Right now, macroeconomic conditions are terrible for meme currencies given Trump’s aggressive trade rhetoric and the Fed’s refusal to raise rates. Shiba Inu now needs to rise above the $0.000013 barrier if it is to reverse its fall. Remittix Is Poised To Lead The PayFi Sector Remittix’s goal is to overcome long-standing issues in international finance by means of its creative solution for conventional remittance systems. Imagine being able to easily turn crypto into spendable money without KYC complications and costs free of sting.

While short-term price movements may occur, the overall trend suggests that a major upward movement is not expected at this time. Despite this, short-term bullish action may still arise, though the broader trend remains subdued. Short-Term Bullish Price Action In the last few days, XRP has experienced positive price movement. On the 8-hour chart, the price recently broke above a short-term resistance zone between $2.25 and $2.30. After breaking through, XRP successfully retested this level, turning it into support. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, this technical pattern is a positive sign, as turning resistance into support typically signals bullish price action. In the short term, this indicates a favorable outlook for XRP, with the next major resistance levels expected between $2.65 and $2.80. However, there is also resistance around $2.50 that will need to be overcome before reaching these higher levels. Sideways Range and Lack of Momentum Despite these recent bullish signs, XRP’s price has been stuck in a sideways range for the past month, moving within a narrow band. This lack of momentum in either direction is evident, and while short-term gains may occur, the overall market trend suggests caution due to the ongoing bearish divergence on the 3-day chart. Expecting More Sideways Movement Given the current technical situation and the continuing bearish divergence, XRP is likely to remain in a sideways trend in the near future. Bullish momentum is unlikely unless the broader bearish divergence is addressed. Traders should monitor the short-term bullish patterns, but the overall market direction is expected to stay sideways.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-18 03:07:04

CoinGlass data shows that on Feb. 20, Bitcoin's ( BTC ) open interest (OI) — a metric tracking the total number of unsettled Bitcoin derivative contracts such as options and futures — stood at $61.42 billion before dropping 19% to $49.71 billion by March 4. Bitcoin’s open interest is sitting at $49.02 billion at the time of publication. Source: CoinGlass It came amid volatile price swings due to uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s imposed tariffs and the future of US interest rates. “Following the recent panic triggered by political instability linked to Trump’s decisions, we witnessed a massive liquidation of leveraged positions on Bitcoin,” DarkFost said. Bitcoin’s price fell below two crucial price levels during the two-week period, bringing it closer to the levels seen in the days after Trump’s election win in November. Feb. 25 saw Bitcoin’s price retrace below $90,000, and just two days later, on Feb. 27, Bitcoin dropped below $80,000 for the first time since November. It’s now trading at $83,400, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 14.58% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitget chief analyst Ryan Lee recently told Cointelegraph that with Bitcoin hovering in the low $80,000s, its price and OI could see more volatility if the March 19 Federal Open Market Committee meeting delivers any surprises. “The market largely expects the Fed to hold rates steady, but any unexpected hawkish signals could put pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets,” he added.

Historically, when Bitcoin has tested these levels during bullish phases, it has managed to break through, hold its ground, and continue upward. However, current market conditions suggest caution, as the cryptocurrency is encountering key resistance and may experience a slowdown. The 50% Level: A Crucial Indicator Bitcoin’s price is currently at $83,000, approximately $10,000 away from the crucial 50% level at $93,000. This level is important because Bitcoin has historically shown strong reactions to it, both during upward and downward movements. The 50% level is particularly important for the current cycle, as it is derived from the price range between the August low and January’s all-time high. In recent weeks, Bitcoin has experienced sharp price movements, with major swings around the $79,000 level. Despite these fluctuations, the price has managed to hold above this level, suggesting the market is watching for further signs of either a breakout or a breakdown. Market Sentiment: A Potential Sell-off While Bitcoin’s short-term outlook may appear bullish due to recent price bounces, there are concerns that if Bitcoin fails to surpass the $93,000 level, it could experience a significant sell-off. This failure would resemble past failed rallies, where market sentiment turned bearish quickly, leading to sharp declines. Investors should be aware that these levels carry risk, and patience will be key in assessing the next move. CryptoQuant CEO Warns of Bear Market On-chain indicators are also pointing to a possible shift in Bitcoin’s market cycle. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has suggested that Bitcoin’s bull cycle may be over, predicting 6 to 12 months of bearish or sideways price action. #Bitcoin bull cycle is over, expecting 6–12 months of bearish or sideways price action. pic.twitter.com/f80bnNhjy4 — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) March 17, 2025 According to him, on-chain metrics such as MVRV, SOPR, and NUPL are signaling a bear market. He added that fresh liquidity is drying up and that new whales are selling Bitcoin at lower prices, which could dampen any bullish momentum. What’s Next for Bitcoin? As Bitcoin approaches these crucial levels, it remains to be seen whether it can break through resistance or if it will face another downturn.

The more than two-and-a-half-minute ad for the Solana Accelerate conference posted on March 17 with the caption “America is back. Time to Accelerate” depicted a man as “America” in a therapy session who said he was having thoughts “about innovation” such as crypto. The therapist responds he should do “something more productive, like coming up with a new gender” and later says the man should “focus on pronouns.” As the conversation meanders on, the man snaps and launches into a monologue amid swelling patriotic music, saying he wants to “build onchain and reclaim my place as the beacon of innovation” and wants “to invent technologies, not genders” in an apparent dig at progressive values. Before its deletion, the ad was viewed over 1.2 million times and racked up over 1,300 comments and 1,400 reposts, a majority of which derided it for its handling of gender identity and for making light of a highly divisive political issue. “They rolled it back because it hurt their business, not because they thought it was wrong,” Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran wrote to X on March 18. Took them 9 hours to delete it. Also all the major players in the Solana ecosystem suddenly delete their tweets promoting/supporting the ad and RT’d and liked takes about it being bad. They approved this, supported it and celebrated it. They rolled it back because it hurt… pic.twitter.com/kPMERDpTcn — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) March 18, 2025 Solana has not stated why it deleted the ad. The Solana Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sean O’Connor, operating chief at Web3 infrastructure firm Blocknative, wrote on X, “This is so fucking tone deaf.” “At a time when trans people are getting denied passports and being erased by the government... this is the ad you put out?” he added. On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump revoked Joe Biden’s executive orders aimed at preventing discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation. He also signed an order recognizing only two sexes — male and female — and scrapped the option for Americans to choose “X” as a gender on passports. DoubleZero operating chief David McIntyre called Solana’s ad “horrendous” and questioned why Solana didn’t “keep the message positive instead of dunking on people and making light of serious cultural issues.” Nicolas Pennie, the co-founder of the Solana development platform Helius, said on X that “virtue signaling will always be cringe regardless of political ideology.” Others who initially backed the ad have also pulled their support amid the backlash. Related: Crypto firms spent $134M on 2024 US elections, raising influence concerns Multicoin Capital co-founder Tushar Jain wrote on X that he deleted his initial post praising the ad “after some reflection.” He previously called the ad “bold and risky” and said having former Vice President Kamala Harris play the role of therapist was the “only thing that could have made it better.” In his retraction statement, Jain said it would have been more effective to “focus on deeper culture war issues like the failings of the oppressor-oppressed world view, not surface culture war issues like pronouns,” and the ad could have sent a message “without alienating a portion of the audience.” X Hall of Flame: Solana ‘will be a trillion-dollar asset’ — Mert Mumtaz",,EN,0,0,SOL|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-18 03:38:32

Is a reversal coming?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/michael-saylor-strategy-outperforms-bitcoin/,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy is moving faster than Bitcoin itself. The company, formerly called MicroStrategy, has built its entire identity around Bitcoin ownership, stacking up 499,096 BTC on its balance sheet—almost 2.4% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. But while Bitcoin struggles to hold momentum, Strategy’s stock is soaring, leaving investors questioning whether this is a real shift or just a temporary bubble. Strategy doubles down on Bitcoin while the market hesitates Bitcoin has been the play for financial independence. With 21 million coins hard-coded as the max supply, it has been called digital gold, a hedge against inflation, and the future of money. It is decentralized, borderless, and immune to government interference. Institutions have been piling in for years—Tesla, BlackRock, and even countries like El Salvador have put Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Adoption is still growing, and the network’s hash rate in 2025 is at all-time highs, making it nearly impossible to attack. Transactions are up, proving Bitcoin is being used, not just held. But prices tell a different story. Bitcoin has struggled despite all the bullish fundamentals. And that has put companies tied to it—especially Strategy—under pressure. The firm is not just buying Bitcoin, it is using debt to buy more, making its stock a high-stakes leveraged play on Bitcoin’s future. This move has worked so far. In 2024, Strategy was the second-best performing stock in the Russell 1000, delivering a 358.5% total return—three times Bitcoin’s own gains. Investors have been willing to pay extra for exposure to Bitcoin through Michael Saylor’s financial engineering. As of March 14, 2024, Strategy’s 499,096 BTC was worth $42 billion, but the company’s market cap was sitting at $77.4 billion. Add in its debt, and the enterprise value was $84.6 billion. The stock was trading at double the value of the Bitcoin it holds. Michael, who has been pushing the Bitcoin Standard for years, made no apologies for the company’s aggressive strategy. “We see Bitcoin as the best asset in the world, and we are structuring our company around that belief,” he said . Leverage fuels growth, but the risks are stacking up Strategy isn’t just betting on Bitcoin—it’s borrowing billions to buy more. That leverage has amplified the gains, but it also means the stock can crash twice as hard if Bitcoin drops. Since the start of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has declined. But instead of following suit, Strategy has climbed 2.7% year-to-date. The stock isn’t just trading on Bitcoin’s value anymore—it has become a premium speculation play. The danger? The premium could vanish overnight. If Bitcoin drops further, Strategy’s debt-heavy balance sheet could become a liability. A trader looking to hedge against a potential drop might consider a June $250/$200 put spread, betting that Strategy’s stock price will fall. By buying one $250 put at $30 per contract and selling two $200 puts at $15 per contract each, the trader would make money if the stock lands between $150 and $250 by June. But if Strategy collapses below $200, the trader is forced to buy shares at that price. With Strategy’s book value at roughly $150 per share, that could still be an expensive bet. Wall Street braces for more volatility Bitcoin is not the only asset facing pressure. The entire market is feeling the weight of uncertainty. Deutsche Bank’s chief strategist, Binky Chadha, has warned that the sell-off in U.S. equities isn’t over. “We see the sell-off in U.S. equities as having further to go,” Binky wrote. “With trade policy uncertainty likely to continue to weigh, at least until April 2, we expect positioning to continue to unwind.” Binky believes that if the S&P 500 drops another 6.9%, it will put even more pressure on Bitcoin and Strategy. The benchmark index, which closed at 5,638.94 on Friday, is already 8% off its all-time high. And it’s not just about trade policy. Executives at major corporations are cutting spending and lowering earnings forecasts. The one thing that could stop the bleeding? Donald Trump. Wall Street has long believed in a “Trump put”—the idea that Trump will adjust policies to stabilize markets if things get too bad. But Binky is not so sure. “Compared to the level of consumer confidence, the current approval rating is high, implying plenty of room for downside with negative growth or inflation developments likely to speed the catch down,” Binky said . “We expect the net approval rating has to turn more significantly negative, at least -5%, before the administration starts to consider responding.” For now, Trump’s policies have not been enough to stop the market’s decline. But Binky still holds a bullish year-end target of 7,000 for the S&P 500, suggesting that once the uncertainty clears, stocks—including Bitcoin and Strategy—could stage a major rebound.

The acting head of the U.S. SEC, Mark Uyeda, announced on Monday that the agency might change or even scrap stricter rules proposed by the previous administration. Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda delivered keynote remarks at ICI’s Investment Management Conference today. https://t.co/W6sYt92mGb pic.twitter.com/zBdKIJNHNF — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) March 17, 2025 Acting Chair Cites Concerns Over A Rule Uyeda said that there were major concerns about a rule from February 2023 that would require investment advisers to store crypto with qualified custodians. At the 2025 Investment Management Conference in San Diego, Uyeda noted the challenges in moving forward with the rule and asked SEC staff to work with the crypto task force to find better alternatives. These rules would have forced investment advisors holding cryptocurrencies and other assets to meet stricter standards. Uyeda also revealed that the SEC is looking into altering a rule that requires mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to report their holdings monthly instead of quarterly. Uyeda’s Focus On Rule Making Uyeda outlined plans for a significant shift away from the approach taken by the Biden administration in overseeing Wall Street. Uyeda mainly discussed the SEC’s rulemaking process, including the possibility of withdrawing, re-proposing rules, or delaying compliance deadlines. Uyeda emphasized that the SEC “needs to prioritize effective and cost-efficient regulations that respect the limits of our statutory authority,” as per a copy of his prepared remarks. The custody rule, proposed during the Biden administration under Gary Gensler, would require advisers to store client assets, including crypto, with qualified custodians for added protection. This raised concerns about limiting banks willing to work with the crypto sector. Opposition Against Crypto Custody Rule Republicans, crypto firms, and financial companies opposed the rule, saying it could hurt their businesses. The proposal led to disagreements between Uyeda, Commissioner Hester Peirce, and industry groups, who called it unlawful and harmful. Uyeda questioned how advisers could invest in crypto under the rule, but still supported it despite some concerns. Peirce, the only commissioner to oppose the rule, said it would limit the number of qualified crypto custodians. Uyeda’s decision to reconsider this rule is the second time this month he has asked the SEC staff to revisit proposed changes, signaling a shift in the SEC’s approach under the Trump administration. Paul Atkins, nominated by Trump to replace Uyeda as SEC Chair, is awaiting Senate confirmation.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been trapped between highs of $84,000 and $82,000 with buyers finding it difficult to push higher. Although the market is still cautious, historical patterns and data point to the possibility of a breakout. According to analyst Rekt Capital’s Mar. 18 post on X, Bitcoin’s current price action and its movement in June 2021 are similar. Following a steep decline, Bitcoin was trapped between the 21-week and 50-week EMAs. It eventually broke out in late July and hit an all-time high in November. Currently, Bitcoin is once again in the same range, raising speculation that history could repeat itself. #BTC Back in June 2021, price was consolidating between the 21-week EMA (green) and 50-week EMA (blue) after a crash Right now, Bitcoin is consolidating between the same EMAs after a crash (By the way, $BTC indeed broke out from its triangle by late July 2021 to reach new All… pic.twitter.com/Ok4Grzvit8 — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 17, 2025 Rekt Capital further observed that Bitcoin’s selling pressure has also been decreasing. Recent sell-offs have come with lower-than-usual volume, showing that sellers are losing momentum. This has opened the door for buyers, making last week a buyer-dominated period. Strong uptrends have resulted from similar shifts in previous cycles. You might also like: Bitcoin recovery faces two potential risks, two opportunities According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin is currently undergoing a deleveraging phase, which involves the market’s excess leverage being removed. In the past, these phases have created short- to medium-term buying opportunities and paved the way for recoveries . Previous market cycles demonstrate that Bitcoin often sees strong price rebounds after leverage resets. The BTC market is undergoing deleveraging “This chart highlights such reset phases by identifying moments when the 90-day open interest change turns negative. Historically, each past deleveraging like this has provided good short-to medium-term opportunities.” – @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/8VRH2oVaTD — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 17, 2025 The rise in the 3-6 month UTXO age bands, which indicate how long Bitcoin has been held, is another important indicator. CryptoQuant’s Mar. 15 analysis revealed that number of coins in this category is rising, much like what happened during the mid-2024 correction. This suggests more investors are holding their Bitcoin instead of selling, reducing the available supply. In previous cycles, this type of accumulation has played a big role in forming market bottoms and driving new rallies. Despite these positive signs, outflows from US-based Bitcoin ETFs have continued for the fifth consecutive week, which is the longest run on record. In April 2024, four weeks of outflows set the previous record. Although this suggests short-term uncertainty, Bitcoin may be poised for a significant move if selling pressure falls and accumulation increases. A breakout could occur soon if previous patterns continue.

Chen announced his new role on Monday in a post on X, calling crypto the most dynamic sector in finance. “Gemini is at the forefront of this revolution — making it simple and secure to engage on the digital asset frontier,” he wrote. Before joining Gemini, Chen spent over two years at fintech Affirm, where he served as VP of capital markets and bank partnerships, helping secure over $20b in funding access. His experience in financial strategy and capital markets suggests Gemini may be positioning itself for a major growth phase—potentially through public listing. I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve joined @Gemini as its Chief Financial Officer. I will be working alongside @cameron and @tyler and the incredible team at Gemini to unlock the next era of personal, financial, and creative freedom. Crypto is the most dynamic sector in finance… — Dan Chen (@danchen13) March 17, 2025 Gemini Revives IPO Talks as Market Conditions Improve The CFO appointment comes amid reports that Gemini has reopened discussions about an IPO, with Bloomberg reporting last month that the company is in early talks with potential advisors . Gemini initially considered going public in 2021, but the plan never materialized. However, with crypto markets rebounding and regulatory pressures shifting, the timing may now be more favorable for a public listing. Winklevoss Brothers Back Trump, Blast Biden’s Crypto Policies Beyond its business moves, Gemini’s founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, have become increasingly vocal in crypto-related politics. Last year, both twins donated $1m each to Donald Trump’s election campaign, with Cameron publicly endorsing Trump’s pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business stance. Meanwhile, Tyler Winklevoss sharply criticized the Biden administration, accusing it of waging a “war against crypto” through legal and regulatory crackdowns. He claimed that multiple government agencies have been weaponized to harass and litigate against legitimate crypto companies. Taking their stance a step further, Gemini recently announced that it will no longer hire graduates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) unless the university removes former SEC Chair Gary Gensler from his faculty position. Gensler, known for his aggressive regulatory actions against crypto firms, previously led the SEC’s lawsuit against Gemini over its now-defunct Earn program. However, last month, the agency dropped its case without any charges —a move that some see as a shift in regulatory attitudes. Gemini Users Targeted in Latest Phishing Scam While Gemini focuses on growth, it is also dealing with security threats. Over the weekend, Gemini users were hit with a phishing scam , receiving emails that falsely claimed to be from the exchange. The messages urged users to move their crypto holdings to self-hosted wallets, citing a nonexistent court ruling as justification.

Whales of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are looking for substitutes, notably a rising PayFi star now trading around $0.07. As the market remains in disarray, traditional meme coins SHIB and DOGE are showing mixed signals, forcing traders to diversify. The recent rush to the Remittix (RTX) presale highlights one reality unequivocally: large-scale crypto holders are choosing tokens that hold true real-world applications. Has RTX positioned itself on the path to a giant price explosion that could catch up to meme coin giants? Shiba Inu Whales Abandon Ship as Confidence Plummets Shiba Inu is having a hard time with the dramatic reduction of whales. Recent on-chain statistics recorded that inflows from the whales dropped 85% within a week. Traditionally, large holders played a substantial role in the performance of SHIB’s market. This sharp decline is showing diminished confidence among big players with doubts over the prospects of SHIB’s recovery. Over the past 30 days, the activities of whales fell by 32%, extending to a record 80% decline over the past 90 days. With decreasing institutional and large retail support, the speculative allure of Shiba Inu is rapidly losing its steam. Those looking to bet on more rewarding and secure growth opportunities are now gravitating towards alternatives like Remittix. Source: Tradingview Dogecoin Eyes a Potential Parabolic Move Amid Market Optimism Dogecoin is back in the limelight among the traders. A crypto expert pointed out that the current price actions of DOGE were similar to its bull run during 2017 when it experienced wild price spikes. These trends suggest that DOGE could hit $1.1 at the start of June if the repetition of the past cycles happens. Technicals like the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) also support this possibility since, in the past, DOGE has bounced hard off this support. A recent Doji candle—a very popular bullish reversal pattern—adds further validity to estimates. Dogecoin is able to initiate another colossal rally if the buyers come in strongly at current levels. However, the volatility of meme coins has led to hedging of bets on the part of the whales with tokens that have practical use cases like Remittix. Source: Tradingview Whales Shift Towards Remittix (RTX) as Next Big Crypto Move With meme coin confidence waning, whales have increasingly turned their attention to Remittix . Trading at just $0.0734, RTX has raised over $13 million in presale funding, selling more than 520 million tokens. This impressive performance shows investor confidence, driven by Remittix’s real-world utility and solid growth potential. Unlike SHIB and DOGE, Remittix offers genuine, practical solutions through its PayFi platform. Users can swiftly convert crypto directly into local currency, simplifying international transactions and lowering fees. This model provides reliable value rather than speculative hype. Consider a small import business in Latin America regularly purchasing supplies from Asia. Traditionally, the business deals with fluctuating exchange rates, costly international fees, and long delays. By adopting Remittix, this business can quickly convert crypto payments directly to local currency, reducing costs and improving cash flow. This type of practical use has caught the attention of whales previously loyal to SHIB and DOGE. As more investors see the benefits of real-world crypto solutions, Remittix’s price could significantly outperform meme tokens, setting the stage for explosive growth in the near term. RTX: The Token Poised for Massive Returns The shift from speculative meme coins to utility-driven projects like Remittix is gaining momentum. While SHIB struggles with declining whale interest and DOGE relies on uncertain market cycles, Remittix offers clear value that solves everyday financial challenges. Given its solid foundation and the ongoing surge of interest from large crypto holders, Remittix could rapidly surpass meme coins in market performance. Analysts forecasting a potential 15,540% surge aren’t merely guessing; they’re seeing a project built on stable fundamentals and growing user demand. For investors, Remittix represents a compelling opportunity—backed by real-world usage, strategic innovation, and rising market confidence. Ready to join the next big crypto movement?

On-chain indicators and technical charts have both shown strength that could help the meme coin achieve new heights from here onwards. Dogecoin Price Rally to $1 Begins? Prominent crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has highlighted a significant development in Dogecoin’s weekly chart. The latest candle closed as a doji, a pattern often interpreted as a signal of potential trend reversals. Source: Trader Tardigrade As shown in the above image, the trend reversal can lead to a Dogecoin price recovery all the way to $1 and beyond. Drawing comparisons to historical patterns, Trader Tardigrade noted that a similar doji formation preceded the last major surge in DOGE price. The current chart formations in DOGE have led to growing trader optimism. As long the meme coin holds the support at $0.16, the chances of the uptrend remain intact. As of press time, the Dogecoin price is trading 3.05% up at $0.1675 with daily trading volumes jumping 13% to more than $1.06 billion. Also, as per the Coinglass data, the options trading volume has surged 31% to more than $96 billion. Some market analysts have also been predicting a parabolic DOGE rally to more than $20. DOGE Address Activity Sees Huge Spike Amid the strong correction in the meme coin sector over the past two months, the Dogecoin price has also been subject to 37% value erosion on the monthly chart. However, at the current support levels, DOGE is seeing a huge spike in address activity. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment highlights a promising trend: the number of wallets holding at least 1 million DOGE has been on the rise, even as prices declined. Source: Santiment Additionally, Dogecoin’s active addresses have surged, reaching their highest levels in four months. This uptick in activity suggests a renewed interest among holders and traders, signaling potential resilience for the meme coin in a challenging market environment. Note that DOGE will need a boost from the overall crypto market in order to support the uptrend. Also, any positive development around Dogecoin ETF could serve as an additional catalyst for further momentum.

Solana’s SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Crypto Race Solana is a popular blockchain platform that is solving various pain points of crypto. Ethereum and Cardano are quite popular for dapps. Solana is different because it has a unique architecture for faster and cheaper transactions. It also supports different programming languages which adds flexibility for developers. Investors can stake Solana to earn rewards as well. Solana has gained significant attention in the market at the moment. Part of this is due to meme coin activity. Other than that, Solana has the potential to support services without requiring second-layer solutions. It is, hence, quite attractive for developers and investors. If we compare it to other coins, Solana is a strong competitor due to its strong focus on speed and scalability. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Boosting Solana’s Community BONK is a new memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a cute Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by shifting power away from big venture capital holders to everyday users. After getting listed on Coinbase, BONK’s price surged over 100%, drawing attention from crypto enthusiasts. As a “community coin,” it airdropped half of its total supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi projects, spreading the tokens widely among users. Despite its playful image, BONK is making serious moves in the crypto world. It’s integrated into the Solana ecosystem, working with decentralized applications and even launching its own exchange called BonkSwap. This involvement shows potential for growth as part of Solana’s fast-growing network. However, like other memecoins, BONK faces challenges such as a huge total supply and price ups and downs. In the current market, BONK stands out as an interesting player, but it’s important to compare it with other cryptocurrencies and watch market trends before making any decisions.

With major economic data being released and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting set for Wednesday, March 19th, it’s a week you won’t want to miss. FOMC Interest Rate Decision: What to Expect The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision is scheduled for Wednesday. As of now, analysts do not expect any changes to the current rate of 4.25% to 4.5%. However, the real focus will be on the press conference held by Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. During this time, Powell will address the media, and the Q&A session will provide valuable insights into the future outlook for the economy. Interest Rate Cuts May Not Be Immediate While no rate cuts are expected in the upcoming meeting, analysts are predicting the first rate cut of 2025 may occur in June. The Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates at this meeting, but many are hoping for some optimistic statements from Powell, which could send bullish signals to the markets. Quantitative Tightening and Market Impact Another key aspect to watch is the potential halt of quantitative tightening (QT). The Fed has indicated that it might stop the runoff of its balance sheet by mid-2025. While this is not a guarantee, any indication of a shift in monetary policy would be bullish for the markets, as it could signal more liquidity entering the economy. Markets Eyeing March 19th Decision Bitcoin’s price currently hovers around $83,000, with some support seen at the $78,000 level. The broader altcoin market remains volatile, with liquidity yet to show a significant uptick. Speculation is rising that the next altcoin rally will begin soon. And as explained by Chiefy, just like in 2021, the market is expected to surge after a period of shakeouts.

The sales took place in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. The first round, launched on October 15, 2024, raised $300 million, while the second round brought in $250 million according to a press release . Over 85,000 participants completed the Know Your Customer (KYC) process to be eligible for the token sales. Trump and Partners To Receive 75% Of Net Income Though Trump isn’t directly involved in World Liberty, he and his partners will get 75% of the project’s net revenue, including from WLFI token sales. After $30 million for expenses, Trump and his partners will earn $390 million for promoting the project and letting it use his name and image. The first token sale started in mid-October and was open to both U.S. and international investors. While the details of the DeFi project are still secret, it’s been buying millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies like Ether and Tron. Justin Sun, the creator of Tron, is also an investor. “This milestone proves that those who truly understand crypto and finance recognize what we’re building, and that WLFI is on track to supercharge DeFi as it transforms global finance in the coming years,” remarked Zach Witkoff, WLFI’s co-founder. He also shared that the token sales are just the beginning and they are gearing up to launch a wave of disruptive technology that will redefine the boundaries of what’s possible with digital assets. Notably, in the past six months, WLFI has formed strategic partnerships with top blockchain protocols and institutions like Ondo Finance, Ethena, Chainlink, Sui, and Aave. These collaborations are setting WLFI up to quickly build and launch its upcoming platform, designed to make finance more accessible to millions. WLFI Builds Strong Digital Asset Reserve WLFI’s “Macro Strategy” has built a strong digital asset reserve, including BTC, ETH, TRX, LINK, SUI, and ONDO tokens. This reserve helps support leading crypto projects, adds stability to WLFI’s treasury, and allows for future investment in new opportunities. The strategy will also help fund innovative projects, boost ecosystem growth, and create new possibilities in the fast-growing DeFi space.

Last week alone, the financial vehicles tracking both assets saw outflows exceeding $1.2 billion across several countries, including the United States, Switzerland, and Canada. Withdrawals from other digital asset products brought the outflows to $1.7 billion, and in the past five weeks, total outflows from this negative streak have exceeded $6.4 billion. $980M Leave U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs A Monday report from the digital asset investment company CoinShares disclosed that crypto investment products have marked their 17th straight day of outflows, with Bitcoin leading the trend. The firm said this is the longest negative streak it has seen since its records began in 2015. Due to this decline in prices and consistent outflows, the total assets under management for digital asset investment products have declined by $48 billion. The United States spot Bitcoin ETF market alone accounted for over $980 million in outflows from ETFs issued by several asset managers like BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Ark Invest/21Shares, and WisdomTree. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the largest outflows, amounting to $383 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC followed suit with $316 million in withdrawals. IBIT recorded just one day of inflow out of five trading days throughout the week. FBTC saw the same but recorded only three days of outflows and one day of no flows. From March 10 to 14, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market saw only one inflow day, per CoinGlass data . Occasional inflows recorded by IBIT, FBTC, Ark Invest’s ARKB, VanEck’s HODL, and Bitwise’s BITB were not enough to offset the massive outflows seen on about two trading days. The funds went on for two days without recording any inflows at all. Ethereum Funds Bleed For the U.S. spot Ethereum ETF market, the funds have been on an outflow streak since March 5. However, they lost $189 million last week. Once again, BlackRock’s ETHA led the losses with outflows surpassing $63 million, while Fidelity’s FETH followed behind with withdrawals exceeding $61 million. The spot ETFs recorded only two days of inflows – their only positive flows since March 5 – but the deposits were still not enough to offset the withdrawals. In fact, the inflows were less than $1.5 million on each occasion. Meanwhile, these outflows come as bitcoin and ether struggle to return to the $90,000 and $2,000 ranges, respectively.

An early trader of the meme coin has managed to earn a 4860x return just within two days of launch, converting his $232 investment to a $1.1 million return. Mubarak Meme Coin Trader Mints Huge Profit Blockchain analytics platform LookonChain recently pointed out that a trader has achieved extraordinary profits from the newly launched BNB Chain-based meme coin, the Mubarak token. A savvy trader managed to turn an initial investment of just 0.4 BNB ($232) into over $1.1 million, achieving a staggering 4,860x return. The trader purchased 10.5 million $MUBARAK tokens for $232 and later sold part of the holdings for 576 BNB, worth approximately $363,500. Currently, the trader retains 5.16 million tokens, valued at $764,000, spread across three wallets. Source: LookonChain What’s Behind This New Meme Coin Frenzy The Mubarak meme coin has gained significant traction in the last two days following an investment by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao . This announcement was enough to garnet significant trader attention leading to a sharp rally in a very short time period. Furthermore, the listing of this meme coin on the Binance Alpha platform has led to a huge trading activity around it. Pseudonymous crypto analyst Thanos has expressed strong optimism about the token, describing it as a “no-brainer” investment at its current price levels. According to Thanos, the recent Binance Futures listing triggered a market shakeout, eliminating overleveraged long positions. With this correction behind, the analyst believes the token can continue its upward trajectory. BNB Price Rally to Continue? The launch of the MUBARAK meme coin on the BNB Chain has led to a huge surge in network activity thereby pushing the BNB price higher to the breakout resistance of $630. As a result of this, the decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes on the BNB chain have also skyrocketed. In a recent milestone, the daily trading volumes on the BNB chain also surpassed that of the popular Solana network. Over the last few months, the meme coin market has been shifting from Solana to Binance, as the latter sees a strong surge in address activity.

Ju pointed to on-chain metrics that indicate a shifting trend. “Every on-chain metric signals a bear market,” he said, explaining that liquidity is drying up, and new whales are offloading Bitcoin at lower prices. He added that on-chain indicators such as Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), and Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL)—which analyze market valuation, investor profitability and overall sentiment—are showing key inflection points based on a 365-day moving average trend.

After briefly topping $100,000 in late 2024, Bitcoin is now in a classic post-rally consolidation phase, testing key support levels between $82,000 and $85,000. While institutional buying and speculation around a potential U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve have provided some optimism, resistance between $85,000 and $90,000 could make further gains difficult. A breakout won’t come easy, and traders are closely watching whether Bitcoin’s recent momentum has long-term staying power. BTC Faces a Critical Test as Bearish Indicators Gain Strength According to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, macro conditions remain a major wildcard. Any unexpected shifts in Federal Reserve (FOMC) policy could shake up the market. If sentiment turns bearish, Bitcoin could dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000. Meanwhile, crypto cynic and market commentator Peter Schiff has issued his own warning , suggesting that Bitcoin could face even steeper losses if broader markets tumble. “The NASDAQ is down 12%,” Schiff noted on X. “If this correction turns out to be a bear market, and the correlation where a 12% decline in the NASDAQ equates to a 24% decline in Bitcoin holds, when the NASDAQ is down 20%, Bitcoin will be about $65K.” With technical indicators turning bearish, Bitcoin faces a crucial test in the coming months. If macro conditions remain stable, the market could stabilize near current support levels. However, if institutional sentiment weakens or the NASDAQ extends its decline, Bitcoin’s correction could deepen, putting $65,000–$75,000 on the radar.

The market is flooded with meme coins, and while some fizzle out, others explode in ways no one saw coming. Investors who caught early waves on past meme coins know that timing is everything. And in 2025, the best cryptos to hold long term are shaping up to be the ones with strong momentum, thriving communities, and massive potential for gains. Leading the charge is BTFD Coin (BTFD), a breakout project that’s already raised over $6.33 million in its presale, with more than 71 billion tokens sold and a growing Bulls Squad of 11,400 holders. Analysts are watching closely as BTFD sets itself up for a 3,650% ROI post-launch, making it one of the best cryptos to hold long term . But it’s not alone—Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other meme coins are also making noise in the market. Let’s break down why these four cryptos are worth holding. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Presale That’s Breaking Records When it comes to the best cryptos to hold long term, BTFD Coin is turning heads with its explosive presale growth. Investors have already poured over $6.33 million into the project, pushing its total token sales beyond 71 billion BTFD. And with a listing price of $0.0006, early buyers are eyeing a massive 3,650% ROI potential if the token reaches its projected moon price of $0.006. But what makes BTFD Coin stand out? Aside from the hype, it’s the combination of strong community backing, exciting features, and an aggressive presale strategy. The Bulls Squad continues to grow, fueling the momentum as the project nears its next presale stage. With the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already live, BTFD is proving it has real engagement beyond speculation. If you’re wondering how much you could make, let’s put it in perspective. A $15,000 investment at the current $0.00016 presale price would secure you 93.75 million BTFD tokens. If BTFD hits $0.0006, that turns into $56,250—and if it reaches its moon price of $0.006, you’re looking at a jaw-dropping $562,500. That’s why early investors aren’t sleeping on this meme coin presale . Buying BTFD is easy. Just set up a digital wallet like MetaMask, load it with BNB or ETH, connect to the official buy page , and grab your BTFD before the next stage bumps the price. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme project—it’s a movement. Its presale numbers prove that demand is skyrocketing, and with a 100% bonus for new buyers, the time to jump in is now. Shiba Inu: The OG Meme Coin That Keeps Growing Few meme coins have achieved legendary status like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Launched in 2020 as the self-proclaimed “Dogecoin killer,” SHIB quickly built a passionate global community. Now, years later, it’s still one of the best cryptos to hold long term, thanks to its real-world adoption and ecosystem expansion. From being accepted as a payment method by major retailers to launching Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain, SHIB is continuously evolving. The development team is actively building out DeFi utilities, NFT integration, and even a Shiba Inu metaverse. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognized meme coins in the industry. Its massive liquidity and long-term roadmap make it a strong contender for those looking to hold through market cycles. Pepe Coin: A Pure Meme Play with Deflationary Hype Meme coins thrive on internet culture, and Pepe Coin (PEPE) taps directly into that energy. Inspired by the legendary Pepe the Frog meme, PEPE launched with a clear goal—to embrace meme culture without overcomplicating things. Unlike many meme tokens, PEPE has a no-tax policy and a deflationary model, meaning the supply decreases over time, potentially increasing value. Since its launch, PEPE has gained traction thanks to its simple yet effective branding. With a strong community of holders and no signs of slowing down, it’s making waves as one of the best cryptos to hold long term for those looking for pure meme-driven excitement. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Pepe Coin is riding the meme hype with a simple, no-frills approach. Its deflationary tokenomics make it an interesting option for long-term believers in meme coin culture. Bonk: The Solana-Based Dog Coin That Shook the Market Dog coins have dominated the meme space, and Bonk (BONK) is the first major dog-themed token built on Solana. Launched on December 25, 2022, BONK went viral due to its massive airdrop campaign, where 50% of its total supply was distributed to Solana users. This move instantly made it a Solana favorite, and the token surged in value in early 2023. Since then, BONK has maintained its place as one of the best cryptos to hold long term, benefiting from Solana’s fast transactions and low fees. Its meme status is solidified, and with growing liquidity and ongoing community support, it continues to attract both traders and long-term believers. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Bonk revitalized interest in meme coins on Solana. Its grassroots approach and strong airdrop strategy cemented its place in the ecosystem. Final Thoughts Based on market trends and community strength, the best cryptos to hold long term are those that combine strong fundamentals with massive hype. BTFD Coin is leading that charge, with its record-breaking presale and $6.33 million already raised, setting the stage for potential 3,650% ROI gains. Meanwhile, coins like SHIB, PEPE, and BONK continue to hold strong, proving their staying power in the ever-evolving crypto space. But time is running out. BTFD Coin’s presale stages won’t last forever, and the current $0.00016 price is a fleeting opportunity. Once it lists at $0.0006, the early-bird window will be closed. Don’t miss out— join the BTFD Coin presale now before prices increase again. FAQs What are the best cryptos to hold long term in 2025? The best cryptos to hold long term include projects with strong community backing and solid roadmaps, such as BTFD Coin, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK.

Burwick Law filed the suit on behalf of its clients against Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol and Meteora on March 17 for launching the Libra (LIBRA) token in a “deceptive, manipulative and fundamentally unfair” manner. The token was then promoted by Argentine President Javier Milei on X as an economic initiative to stimulate private-sector funding in the country. The law firm slammed the two crypto infrastructure and launchpad firms behind LIBRA — KIP and Meteora — claiming that they used a “predatory” one-sided liquidity pool to artificially inflate the memecoin’s price, allowing insiders to profit while “everyday buyers bore the losses.” Within hours, the insiders “rapidly siphoned approximately $107 million from the liquidity pools,” causing a 94% crash in LIBRA’s market value, Burwick Law said in a March 17 filing shared on X. Source: Burwick Law President Milei was mentioned in the lawsuit but wasn’t named a defendant. Burwick accused the defendants of leveraging Milei’s influence to aggressively promote the token, deliberately creating a false sense of legitimacy and misleading investors about its economic potential. Approximately 85% of LIBRA’s tokens were withheld at launch and the “predatory infrastructure techniques” allegedly used by the defendants weren’t disclosed to investors, Burwick said. “These tactics, combined with omissions about the true liquidity structures, deprived investors of material information.” Burwick is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, the disgorgement of “unjustly obtained” profits and injunctive relief to prevent further fraudulent token offerings. Related: Law firm demands Pump.fun remove over 200 memecoins using its IP Data from blockchain research firm Nansen found that of the 15,430 largest Libra wallets it examined, over 86% of those sold at a loss, combining for $251 million in losses. Only 2,101 profitable wallets were able to take home a combined $180 million in profit, Nansen noted in a Feb. 19 report. The venture capital firm behind the LIBRA token, Kelsier Ventures, and its CEO, Hayden Davis, were apparently two of the biggest winners from the token launch. They claim to have netted around $100 million. Davis, who is now facing a potential Interpol red notice following an Argentine lawyer’s request, said on Feb. 17 that he didn’t directly own the tokens and wouldn’t sell them. Meanwhile, Milei has distanced himself from the memecoin, arguing he didn’t “promote” the LIBRA token — as fraud lawsuits filed against him have alleged — and instead merely “spread the word” about it. Argentina’s opposition party called for Milei’s impeachment but has had limited success thus far.

The company has recently filed a trademark for ”Ripple Custody,” signaling its intent to enter the growing crypto custody market, a move that could broaden its services beyond payments. At the same time, speculation is mounting that Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be nearing its conclusion, with potential implications for XRP’s regulatory classification and the broader crypto industry. Ripple Labs Expands Into Crypto Custody With New Trademark Filing Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP token, is making strategic moves to solidify its presence in the cryptocurrency custody space. A recently filed trademark application for “Ripple Custody” suggests that the fintech firm is gearing up to offer crypto storage solutions for both individuals and institutions. The trademark filing, submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), details four primary use cases for the new brand. One of the most significant descriptions states that the mark applies to “financial services, namely, custodial services in the nature of maintaining storage and possession of cryptocurrency for financial management purposes.” This move signals Ripple’s intent to enter the growing crypto custody market, which has become increasingly competitive amid rising institutional interest in digital assets. Cryptocurrency custodians provide secure storage solutions for digital assets, reducing risks associated with private key loss, cyber threats, and unauthorized access. These services are particularly valuable to institutional investors, who require robust security measures and regulatory compliance. The crypto custody industry has witnessed a surge in demand, especially after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. With ETFs attracting billions of dollars in inflows, the need for institutional-grade custody solutions has become more critical than ever. Several major financial institutions, including Coinbase, Citi, and BNY Mellon, have established themselves as key players in this sector. Ripple’s entry into the space could challenge these incumbents, particularly if it leverages its blockchain technology and existing network of financial partners. Given its history of providing enterprise solutions in cross-border payments, Ripple’s move into custody services could be a natural expansion of its offerings. The trademark filing follows Ripple’s launch of a custody service in October 2024, marking its initial foray beyond its traditional focus on payment settlements. At the time, the company positioned the service as a means to diversify its revenue streams and expand its role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Despite its latest trademark application, Ripple has remained tight-lipped about its specific plans for Ripple Custody. Beyond custodial services, the trademark filing also references “downloadable software for custody of cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency; downloadable software for transmission and storage of cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency.” This suggests that Ripple could be exploring the launch of a crypto wallet. A proprietary wallet would allow Ripple to offer secure storage and transaction capabilities for XRP and potentially other digital assets. This move could serve as another revenue stream for the company, with transaction fees contributing to its financial model. If Ripple were to introduce a wallet solution, it would enter a competitive market already dominated by hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor, as well as software wallets such as Trust Wallet and Exodus. Given the company’s history, a Ripple-branded wallet could be deeply integrated with the XRP Ledger, offering seamless interaction for users holding XRP and other supported assets. It could also cater to institutional clients looking for enterprise-grade solutions. Ripple’s expansion into custody services comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. The company has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC since December 2020 over whether XRP should be classified as a security. While Ripple has achieved partial victories in court, the case remains ongoing, influencing the company’s strategic decisions. By entering the custody space, Ripple may be positioning itself as a more traditional financial services provider, aligning with regulatory expectations and institutional standards. Crypto custody is a highly regulated business, with custodians required to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. If Ripple secures the necessary approvals, it could enhance its credibility among financial institutions and regulators. What This Means for XRP and Ripple’s Future Ripple’s move into custody services and potentially wallets could be a significant boost for the XRP ecosystem. By providing secure storage and transaction infrastructure, Ripple could enhance the utility and adoption of XRP beyond just cross-border payments. Additionally, these developments could drive greater institutional engagement with Ripple’s offerings. If financial firms and investment funds begin using Ripple Custody, it could open the door for broader XRP adoption in institutional portfolios. While Ripple has not officially confirmed the launch of any new products under the Ripple Custody brand, the trademark filing is a strong indication that the company is preparing to expand its footprint in the digital asset space. With institutional demand for secure crypto solutions growing, Ripple’s potential entry into custody services and wallets could mark a major milestone for both the company and the broader crypto industry. Ripple vs. SEC: Is the Legal Battle Finally Coming to an End? For nearly four years, Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a high-stakes legal battle with the SEC, a case that has been closely watched as a defining moment for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. But according to new claims making waves in the crypto space, the lawsuit could be reaching its final chapter—sooner than many expected. The latest buzz comes from Andrew “AP_Abacus” Parish , a well-known figure in the crypto space, who claims that two SEC insiders have confirmed that the case is ”very close to being over.” While this information remains unverified and unofficial, it has sent ripples of speculation through the crypto community. If true, the implications of a conclusion to this lawsuit could be far-reaching. The case, which began in December 2020, has been a crucial test of how the SEC intends to regulate cryptocurrencies, particularly those issued by private companies. Initially, the SEC accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through its sale of XRP , a claim Ripple has vehemently denied. Now, new discussions are emerging about what XRP’s legal status might be once the dust settles. Perhaps the most surprising rumor surrounding the case’s potential resolution is the idea that XRP could be reclassified as a commodity rather than a security. If true, this would move its oversight from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a shift that could change the way XRP is traded, regulated, and perceived by the broader financial world. For years, Ripple has fought against the SEC’s classification of XRP as a security, arguing that it functions more like a currency or commodity than a stock. The idea that XRP could emerge from this legal battle with commodity status is a development few had anticipated. If this happens, it would not only be a victory for Ripple but also set a precedent for other cryptocurrency projects facing similar regulatory scrutiny. One of the biggest concerns for Ripple throughout this legal saga has been the potential financial consequences. Originally, the SEC sought a staggering $2 billion fine from Ripple, a figure that threatened to cripple the company’s operations. However, that number was significantly reduced to $125 million in 2024—a major win for Ripple at the time. Now, sources suggest that the final penalty could be ”greatly reduced” even further. If this turns out to be true, Ripple may walk away from this battle with far fewer damages than initially feared. More importantly, it would indicate that the SEC itself is re-evaluating its position on Ripple, XRP, and possibly its broader approach to crypto regulation. Shifting Sentiment Within the SEC A major factor that could be influencing this potential outcome is the changing leadership and priorities at the SEC. Under Gary Gensler, the agency has aggressively pursued legal actions against crypto companies, often without clear regulatory guidelines. However, increasing pressure from lawmakers, legal defeats in court, and growing institutional acceptance of crypto have forced the SEC to rethink its stance. Ripple’s case is more than just a legal battle—it has become a symbol of how the US government handles cryptocurrency regulation. If the SEC is indeed close to settling, it may reflect a strategic decision to avoid setting a precedent that could backfire on the agency in future cases. The speculation about an impending resolution has caught the attention of major crypto figures, including John Deaton, the attorney representing XRP holders in the case. His response? A simple eye emoji—a cryptic but telling signal that something significant may indeed be happening behind the scenes. Other prominent voices in the crypto space have also chimed in, highlighting the potential impact of XRP securing a favorable outcome. If the SEC backs down, it could open the door for greater regulatory clarity for other cryptocurrencies, many of which have been waiting in limbo due to the uncertainty surrounding the Ripple case.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-18 05:30:00

Companies seldom meet their previously announced ambitions after intense launch excitement dies out. Remittix operates as a project that drew sufficient funding through its presale amounting to nearly $14 million which distributed 520 million tokens at $0.0734 each. Experts who analyze the chances of a 42x return dispute that this prediction represents conventional crypto market madness. Different Kind of Altcoin The Remittix platform focuses on providing a solution for universal financial needs because it connects digital assets to everyday monetary transactions. The solution emphasizes fast crypto-to-fiat transactions to eliminate the typical complications which slow down cross-border transfers and standard payments. The system operates without exceptional technology while providing basic interfaces that users can easily grasp. The simplified design of this product solution attracts users who dislike complex blockchain technology. The user-friendly model has likely become the main reason why Remittix achieved success during its presale campaign. Remittix has established itself by targeting various user groups including financial experts working at shops or doing freelance jobs or traveling the world while seeking straightforward currency conversion capabilities. The successful completion of this token could measure genuine service demand in place of brief-market frenzy. Practical Goals Backed by Nearly $14 Million The company successfully generated almost $14 million through its presale stage operations. Remittix’s investors clearly see past marketing hype to understand the complete vision of the company’s strategy. Financial resources gathered early allow the team to construct powerful infrastructure combined with regulatory licenses and develop regional compliance solutions. Its preparedness allows it to bypass the legal issues which destroyed many alternative cryptocurrencies. Powerful funding driven from investors provides established remittance companies and payment gateways with substantial interest. Rapid deals securing access to existing businesses can make real-world usage for Remittix increase swiftly. The sustainable power of prices in cryptocurrency depends more on use than speculation. The 42x potential could become achievable through both swift adoption of the project and its capability to navigate mainstream processes faster than established complex platforms. Potential Path to a 42x Leap How might Remittix climb to 42 times its current presale price? Several major elements will decide the outcome according to observer predictions. The token requires execution of major collaborations either through remittance services or international e-commerce platforms. Additionally the platform needs to demonstrate steady transaction activity which establishes the effectiveness of its solution for actual end users. It should pass through every compliance or regulatory requirement with ease to protect trust among both its expanding user base and outside businesses. A rapid price increase of Remittix will likely occur after its first major exchange platform listing if the project’s business factors remain favorable. The market demand could surpass available supplies because major players are inclined to include Remittix within their transaction process. The planned developments seem to condense timeframes so that the kind of swift price increase which expert analysts predict can become possible while overall crypto sentiment remains optimistic. Digital assets have frequently shown promises of massive profitability throughout history. Supporters claim Remittix stands apart by establishing immediate solutions for an existing industry-wide problem. Customers must endure lengthy transfer times along with excessive fees while moving money across borders or exchanging digital currency into local wallets. The improved payment processing at Remittix could potentially win two populations: domestic shoppers and international cross-border senders. Final Reflection According to Remittix’s systematic approach both investors and users can see beyond the hype that the platform will achieve its projected 42x returns. At its core Remittix provides user-friendly crypto conversion solutions supported by almost $14 million of presale funding. Success within the crypto world depends on delivering functional solutions that normal users encounter as valuable. The likelihood of Remittix succeeding appears better as it demonstrates practical daily usage while quickly establishing key partnerships in the market.

According to Maxime Pizzolitto, WhiteRock’s CEO, WhiteRock is combining the best of traditional finance (regulations, safety, and trust) and the crypto world (efficiency, high yields, and innovation). “Imagine a world where a pension fund holding billions in government bonds can deploy those assets in a lending pool generating yields of 20% or higher, yields that were only accessible to crypto narratives.” _ Maxime Pizzolitto. In this article, we will explore WhiteRock’s key offerings and upcoming developments and ultimately determine whether it is a legitimate product or a scam. What is WhiteRock? WhiteRock is a real-world asset (RWA) protocol designed to tokenize economic rights to traditional financial assets like stocks, bonds, property, options, and derivatives. The platform has quickly gained adoption and now boasts over $150 million of assets locked in their smart contracts and over $100 million in trading volume processed. WhiteRock’s key offerings USDX stablecoin for passive income with no lockups WhiteRock cuts the bureaucracy of investing in US treasury bills through its USDX stablecoin , which combines the stability of the US dollar and the returns of US Treasury bills. The value of each USDX token is pegged to the value of the US dollar. To achieve yield, WhiteRock invests the funds backing USDX in US Treasury bills, which then generate steady interest, creating a reliable source of passive income. The interest is distributed to all USDX holders using a rebase system where the number of tokens in your wallet increases automatically with no extra steps or lock-up periods. Tokenized stocks WhiteRock makes investing in stocks easy for anyone to invest and own fractions of stocks regardless of their geographical background or capital through tokenized stocks. Tokenized stocks are digital copies of company stocks coded into the blockchain. By leveraging the blockchain, the stocks remain tamper-proof and transparent while mirroring both the value and price movements of company stocks. Registration and my initial impressions The WhiteRock application is a simple yet feature-rich platform with a black-and-white theme and a signup process that cuts out crypto jargon. The application is user-friendly, and I was able to create an account in minutes. Email and phone are supported sign-up methods. Other options include social media sign-up methods like Telegram, X (formerly Twitter), Discord, and LinkedIn. WhiteRock application sign-in methods On signing in, I was assigned an Ethereum crypto address for making USDT deposits. Once deposited, they were automatically converted to USDX at a 1:1 ratio. ‘Assigned USDT deposit address’ The deposits are credited once the transactions are confirmed on the blockchain. While the sign-up process is a breeze, you must pay a one-off ‘Meta-transaction’ fee, 3.87 USDX at press time. While it may sound inconvenient, the fee allows you to settle transaction fees on the platform in USDX. WhiteRock application interface $WHITE token $WHITE is the native currency that will be used throughout the WhiteRock ecosystem. Notably, $WHITE has maintained an impressive price run since its inception, outperforming most major cryptocurrencies this year, including $BTC and $ETH. $WHITE token performance The bull run contributed to WHITE’s market cap, which is now at $404 million and rising. In addition to the WhiteRock platform, you can purchase WHITE tokens on MEXC and BingX cryptocurrency exchanges. Future outlook for WhiteRock The blockchain space is evolving constantly, with emerging trends every season amidst growing adoption and acceptance across many jurisdictions. This year, we saw the approval of cryptocurrency ETFs and a pro-crypto administration win the US elections. This means that it is paramount that every crypto project adapts to the changing trends and developments. WhiteRock is set to roll out new developments and features in 2025 in its bid to unlock a tokenized future in this fast-evolving space. Decentralized exchange WhiteRock is in the process of launching a fast and cost-effective decentralized crypto exchange that will use an order book system. An order book system comprises a list of buy and sell orders that execute at the best prices or market orders, similar to centralized exchanges. WhiteRock DEX WhiteRock will use the DEX to provide users with a seamless and secure trading experience that satisfies global financial regulations. XRP Ledger integration – for more institutional adoption WhiteRock is working on completing their XRP ledger integration following a successful testnet that reportedly outperformed “expectations in both adoption and volume.” XRP Ledger is a fast and cost-effective blockchain system that is increasingly being integrated into various institutional frameworks, particularly in finance. Use cases have included the creation of Central Bank Digital Currencies and a settlement layer for remittances and international payments. The integration has received considerable traction from the investing public. WhiteRock reported a combined $1.8M in AUM from submitted applications in the mainnet whitelist. Funds representing a combined $1.8B AUM have submitted applications to our whitelist. Demand for our XRPL integration has surpassed all projections.

WhiteRock is a fast-growing RWA ecosystem attracting interest from both institutional and individual investors. In an AMA on X , Pizzolitto, WhiteRock’s CEO, came out and explained WhiteRock’s vision and cleared all rumors of WhiteRock being a scam. The company’s contract is also audited and approved by PeckShield, a top-tier blockchain security firm.

Over the past week, ADA has been trading within a tight range between $0.69 and $0.75. However, the prevailing market uncertainty has left investors and traders uncertain about building positions, as they await clearer market direction in the coming days. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA is currently at the lower boundary of its consolidation zone and is poised for upside momentum, provided it holds above the $0.69 level in the coming days. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if ADA remains above this lower boundary, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 9% to reach the $0.75 level. However, if the asset falls below the $0.68 level, it could decline further to $0.65.

However, during the same period, its trading volume declined by 12%, indicating traders’ and investors’ fears, as they have reduced their participation compared to the previous day.

All signals are currently bearish, says Ju Ju said that all Bitcoin ( BTC ) onchain metrics indicate a bear market. “With fresh liquidity drying up, new whales are selling Bitcoin at lower prices,” Ju said. It comes only days after Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin funding rates, which reflect the cost of holding long or short positions in crypto futures , are hovering close to 0%, indicating increasing indecisiveness among traders. Ju’s claim is in stark contrast to his March 4 post, where he said the Bitcoin bull cycle will remain slow but “is still intact,” pointing to neutral readings on key indicators. “Fundamentals remain strong, with more mining rigs coming online,” Ju said in a March 4 X post. Other analysts aren’t as bearish. Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that “there is no reason to panic.” Hundal explained that while investors are “spooked” by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, “all the numbers show a global economy that is pointing in the right direction.” “Money will move to on-risk assets when the market is ready to take on risk.” At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $83,030, down 14.79% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 14.89% over the past month.

We are about to see Bitcoin rally again,” crypto analyst Seth said in a recent X post. Likewise, CoinRoutes CEO Dave Weisberger said that if the historical trend persists, Bitcoin could reach all-time highs by late April. “Expect Bitcoin to hit a new ATH within a month if its BETA correlation to money supply holds,” Weisberger said in a March 17 X post.

Hoskinson’s remarks come after years of intense regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry, with government agencies like the SEC launching numerous lawsuits and investigations against major cryptocurrency firms. Hoskinson criticized the SEC’s aggressive stance, stating that the regulator had branded the entire industry as criminal, suing companies from the largest firms to the smallest projects, costing the sector hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees and wiping out billions in market cap. He also pointed out the hypocrisy of federal employees who, according to him, take no accountability for the damage caused by their actions and yet play the victim when faced with the consequences.

He went on to call out what he described as “unelected, career federal employees” who have inflicted significant harm on the crypto sector, saying that those in charge of such actions lacked moral character. Hoskinson’s remarks were particularly pointed toward SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, whose leadership has been central to the Commission’s enforcement actions. Hoskinson’s comments come after reports suggesting that some SEC staff members are facing backlash, with law firms refusing to interview them due to their work with crypto. William McLucas, a former SEC official, criticized these attacks, saying it’s unfair to target staff members who are just doing their jobs. “We will never forget or forgive as an industry because we know what would have happened if the other side won.

41846408,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140918,1742277044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: Asia FX Under Pressure as Dollar Dominates Amid Fed & BOJ Rate Hike Anticipation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-fed-boj/,"Navigating the turbulent waters of cryptocurrency and Forex markets requires staying ahead of global financial shifts. Right now, all eyes are on Asia FX as it experiences downward pressure against a resurgent US dollar. This movement comes as traders brace themselves for potentially impactful interest rate decisions from two of the world’s most influential central banks: the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ). What does this mean for the broader financial landscape, and how should you interpret these market signals? Why is Asia FX Feeling the Heat? Several factors are contributing to the current weakness in Asia FX . The primary driver is the strengthening US dollar. When the dollar gains strength, it typically exerts downward pressure on other currencies, particularly those in emerging markets like many within Asia. This phenomenon is amplified by: Anticipation of Fed Rate Hike: The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain a hawkish stance on monetary policy, which could involve further interest rate hikes to combat inflation. Higher US interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors, increasing demand for the dollar and thus its value. BOJ Policy Uncertainty: While the Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy for a long time, there are growing expectations that they might consider adjusting their stance. Any hint of a shift in BOJ policy can create volatility in currency markets, and currently, the uncertainty seems to be favoring dollar strength over Asia FX . Global Economic Concerns: Broader global economic uncertainties, including concerns about slowing growth in major economies and geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to seek the safety of the US dollar. This ‘flight to safety’ further boosts Dollar Strength at the expense of other currencies, including those in Asia. Decoding Dollar Strength: What’s Driving the Greenback? The recent surge in Dollar Strength isn’t happening in isolation. It’s a confluence of factors painting a bullish picture for the US currency: Safe Haven Appeal: In times of global economic uncertainty, the US dollar is often perceived as a safe haven asset. Investors flock to the dollar when they become risk-averse, increasing demand and driving up its value. Interest Rate Differentials: As the Fed is expected to continue raising interest rates while other central banks might be less aggressive or even pausing, the interest rate differential favors the dollar. Higher interest rates in the US attract foreign investment, boosting Dollar Strength . US Economic Data: Relatively robust US economic data, particularly in areas like employment, provides further support for the dollar. Strong economic indicators reinforce the expectation of continued Fed tightening and overall positive sentiment around the US economy. Impact of Fed Rate Hike Expectations on Currency Markets The anticipation of a Fed Rate Hike is a major catalyst for current market movements. Here’s how it impacts currency markets, and specifically Asia FX : Impact Area Effect on Asia FX Effect on US Dollar Capital Flows Outflows from Asia FX as investors seek higher returns in dollar assets. Inflows into US dollar assets, increasing demand. Exchange Rates Depreciation of Asia FX currencies against the dollar. Appreciation of the US dollar against Asia FX. Borrowing Costs Increased borrowing costs for Asian economies with dollar-denominated debt. Potentially reduced borrowing costs in dollar terms, relatively. Inflation Imported inflation for Asian economies as goods priced in dollars become more expensive. Potential dampening of inflation in the US over time due to tighter monetary policy. BOJ Policy in Focus: Will They Shift Away from Ultra-Loose Stance? The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) upcoming policy decision adds another layer of complexity to the Forex landscape. For years, the BOJ has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, characterized by negative interest rates and massive asset purchases. However, rising inflation and global central bank tightening are putting pressure on the BOJ to consider a shift. Any indication that the BOJ might be contemplating a change in policy could have significant implications for Currency Markets and, in particular, pairings involving the Japanese Yen and Asia FX . Here are potential scenarios and their impact: Scenario 1: BOJ hints at policy normalization: If the BOJ signals a potential shift towards tightening, even subtly, the Japanese Yen could strengthen. This might offer some relief to Asia FX if the dollar’s rally pauses, but it could also create new dynamics in cross-currency pairs involving the Yen. Scenario 2: BOJ maintains ultra-loose policy: If the BOJ sticks to its current ultra-loose policy, it could further reinforce Dollar Strength . The contrast between a hawkish Fed and a dovish BOJ would likely widen interest rate differentials, making the dollar even more attractive. In this case, Asia FX could face further downward pressure. Scenario 3: BOJ surprise policy tweak: A surprise policy tweak from the BOJ, such as adjusting yield curve control or hinting at future rate hikes, could trigger significant volatility in Currency Markets . This could lead to a sharp strengthening of the Yen and potentially a broader reassessment of Dollar Strength . Actionable Insights for Navigating Currency Market Volatility In this environment of heightened uncertainty and potential volatility in Currency Markets , what actionable steps can traders and investors consider? Stay Informed: Closely monitor news and analysis related to the Fed and BOJ policy decisions. Pay attention to economic data releases and central bank communications, as these can provide clues about future policy direction. Diversify Currency Exposure: Avoid over-concentration in any single currency. Diversifying your currency holdings can help mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in specific currency pairs, including those within Asia FX . Manage Risk Prudently: Employ robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and using appropriate position sizing. Volatile Currency Markets can lead to rapid and unexpected price swings, making risk management crucial. Consider Hedging Strategies: For businesses and investors with significant exposure to Asia FX or dollar-denominated assets, consider using hedging strategies to protect against adverse currency movements. Currency forwards, options, and other derivatives can be used for hedging purposes. Seek Expert Advice: If you are unsure about how to navigate these complex market dynamics, consider seeking advice from financial professionals who specialize in Forex and currency markets. Conclusion: Navigating the Forex Crossroads The current landscape of Asia FX and the broader Forex market is shaped by the looming decisions of the Fed and BOJ. Dollar Strength is prevailing for now, fueled by expectations of continued Fed tightening and uncertainty surrounding BOJ policy. Staying informed, adapting to evolving market conditions, and employing prudent risk management are key to navigating this period of potential volatility. The coming days and weeks promise to be critical for understanding the near-term direction of Currency Markets and the fate of Asia FX in the face of global monetary policy shifts.

The approval, which was announced on Mar. 18, brings the company one step closer to providing regulated digital payment token services in Singapore. An in-principle approval indicates that Cumberland has met the first set of regulatory requirements for a payment services license. However, it still needs to meet several other conditions to obtain a full license. MAS retains the right to revoke approval if necessary. We are pleased to announce that Cumberland SG Pte. Ltd. has received in-principle approval for the Major Payment Institution (MPI) License from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). We look forward to expanding our presence in this important region, bringing our disciplined… pic.twitter.com/G14XvB4VVg — Cumberland (@CumberlandSays) March 18, 2025 After obtaining a full license, Cumberland will be able to offer institutional clients in Singapore a wider range of compliant digital asset services. According to the firm, the approval strengthens its presence in Singapore, which it considers a major financial hub for digital assets. Cumberland caters to institutional clients worldwide by offering market-making and liquidity services for a range of cryptocurrencies. The company is a division of DRW, a major player in both the traditional and digital asset markets, with its headquarters located in Chicago.

Coinbase, BitGo, and Anchorage are among the 29 companies that have secured digital payment token licenses from the MAS. In recent months, Gemini and OKX have also received approvals, reinforcing Singapore’s position as a rising hub for top regulated cryptocurrency firms. The announcement comes on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s move to dismiss its case against Cumberland on Mar. 4. The case was part of a larger regulatory crackdown in which the SEC accused the company of dealing in unregistered securities. Under the new, crypto-friendly SEC leadership , several investigations have also been dropped, including those against Consensys and Kraken. With progress in both Singapore and the U.S., Cumberland is making strides toward regulatory clarity as it expands its institutional digital asset services in key markets.

In a March 17 Form S-1 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the crypto investment firm requested to list the Canary SUI ETF, which didn’t include information on what exchange it would trade on or the proposed ticker symbol. The ETF would directly hold Sui ( SUI ), the native token of the layer-1 blockchain used for fees and staking, which is the 23rd largest cryptocurrency with a market value of around $7.36 billion, per CoinGekco. Sui is trading up 1.3% over the last day to $2.31 and has gained 7.3% over the week. It has, however, fallen 56.5% from its Jan. 5 all-time peak of $5.35. Sui’s price over the last 24 hours hit a high of $2.38 but has since slightly fallen. Source: CoinGekco Canary had registered a trust in Delaware on March 6 for the fund, and it must also file a Form 19b-4 with the SEC before the agency can consider whether to list it for trading. Canary’s Sui filing is its sixth crypto ETF bid with the SEC. In the past few months, it filed for ETFs tracking Solana ( SOL ), Litecoin ( LTC ), XRP ( XRP ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Axelar ( AXL ). The filing comes after Sui said on March 6 that it partnered with World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by US President Donald Trump. Part of the partnership saw World Liberty include the Sui token in its so-called “Macro Strategy” token reserve and explore further product opportunities together.

The SEC has delayed making decisions on multiple crypto ETF filings, but Commissioner Hester Peirce said last month that the agency would wait until the Senate confirms Trump’s pick to chair the SEC, Paul Atkins , before deciding on an agenda for crypto. A Senate confirmation hearing for Atkins is reportedly slated for March 27, having been delayed due to issues with financial disclosures.

The analyst highlighted similarities between the current ETH price action and that of 2020, following the COVID market crash. Ethereum On The Cusp Of Trend Reversal? Ethereum’s subdued price action may soon come to an end, as multiple analysts point toward a potential trend reversal for the second-largest cryptocurrency by reported market cap. Analyst Mister Crypto shared the following chart, outlining the similar chart patterns. In the chart, the analyst illustrates how ETH is currently forming a price pattern similar to what was observed during the COVID pandemic in 2020. At that time, ETH experienced a sharp trend reversal to the upside following the infamous March 2020 crash. Related Reading: Ethereum Gained 160% The Last Time This On-Chain Indicator Flashed – Will ETH Soar Again? Similarly, ETH may be preparing to resume bullish momentum after the recent Bybit exchange hack. For the uninitiated, the Bybit crypto exchange hack resulted in ETH worth $1.5 billion being stolen. Mister Crypto’s thoughts were echoed by fellow crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader. In a separate X post, the analyst stated that ETH is likely repeating its historical cycle, which typically sees capitulation before a massive run-up. In addition to the COVID crash, the analyst highlighted the Luna crash of 2022 as another instance when bearish sentiment surrounding ETH was at its peak. However, the digital asset quickly overcame the pessimism, going on to experience a massive 270% rally. Multiple Indicators Point Toward ETH Rally Beyond the bullish historical patterns, multiple indicators suggest a potential rally for ETH. In an X post, crypto analyst TraderPA remarked that Ethereum is currently oversold at its present price and that the weekly Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) is signaling a potential rebound. To explain, the weekly Stochastic RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the relative position of an asset’s current price within its recent price range over a week. When the fast line (blue) crosses above the slow line (orange) in the oversold zone, it signals potential upward momentum, indicating a buying opportunity. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly RSI Drops To Lowest Level Since May 2022 – More Selling Pressure Ahead? Furthermore, crypto analyst Decode highlighted the importance of Elliott Wave Theory in predicting ETH’s price momentum. The analyst explained: Sentiment on Ethereum is bearish beyond anything I have ever seen, so whilst lower targets are still available, it’s possible we’ve done enough at the 1.236 extension of C vs A to complete this wave 4. The eventual reversal will be the most hated rally ever seen in crypto. That said, rising ETH exchange reserves could delay any quick price recovery. At press time, ETH trades at $1,911, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

Altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) followed suit, sinking into the red. With the Market Fear & Greed Index stuck at 25 (Fear), it’s clear that uncertainty is ruling the game right now! However, amid the downtrend, investors have high hopes for ETFs as they expect good investment in the near term helping the market rebound. Meanwhile, Hashdex, a well-known asset manager, has filed an amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to expand its cryptocurrency index exchange-traded fund (ETF). The updated proposal aims to include seven altcoins—Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI)—alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This is the biggest amendment so far and gives hope to the shaking altcoin market. A Push for Diversified Crypto Exposure Launched in February 2024, the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF currently tracks only Bitcoin and Ethereum . The latest filing signals a shift toward a broader investment strategy, aligning with the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), which includes multiple digital assets rather than just the top two by market capitalization. This move is significant because previous filings hinted at expanding the ETF’s asset mix but never named specific altcoins until now. Hashdex has not given a timeline for the change, as it still needs approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Rising Interest in Multi-Asset Crypto ETFs Regulatory shifts may speed up ETF approvals. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President recently directed federal regulators to take a more relaxed approach to digital assets. This could make it easier for Hashdex to secure approval for its expanded ETF. Industry experts see multi-asset ETFs as the next big step in making crypto more accessible to mainstream investors. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store sees this as a potential game-changer, as it would allow firms to introduce multiple share classes within a single ETF, improving efficiency and expanding investment options. Other major players, like Grayscale , are also working on expanding their ETF offerings. Grayscale has proposed converting its Digital Large Cap Fund—comprising BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP—into an ETF, which could bring another multi-asset investment vehicle to the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Canary Capital Files for SUI ETF, SUI token Jump by 8% , Regulatory Uncertainty Remains The SEC has been flooded with crypto ETF proposals this year, including those featuring staking mechanisms and in-kind redemptions.

The law firm alleged that Kelsier, KIP, Meteora, and related parties set up an unfair token launch of LIBRA. The law firm believes that the accused parties allegedly misled purchasers and harmed retail investors through their unfair LIBRA launch. The firm noted that this pattern was similar to many of the other tokens launched by the Defendants. The lawsuit noted that the Defendants gained at the cost of participants through misleading marketing tactics and a failure to disclose material facts that would have raised concerns about the project’s viability. Burwick Law files complaint against Kelsier, KIP, and Meteora Tonight, our firm filed a class action complaint in the Supreme Court of New York on behalf of our client. We allege that Kelsier, KIP, Meteora, and related parties orchestrated an unfair token launch ($LIBRA), allegedly misleading purchasers and harming retail investors. pic.twitter.com/H7dD2LaARK — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) March 18, 2025 Burwick Law firm filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of New York on behalf of its client. The firm acknowledged that the plaintiff’s information was based on their counsel’s investigation, which included reviewing and analysing press releases, news articles, websites, state corporate filings, and other publicly available information regarding the LIBRA token. The law firm alleged that Kelsier Ventures, Meteora, and KIP Protocol orchestrated a deceptive, manipulative, and fundamentally unfair launch of the LIBRA token. The firm believes that the Defendants promoted the digital asset as a meaningful economic initiative designed to boost economic growth in Argentina by funding small businesses and startups. LIBRA’s official website read in part “ In honor of Javier Milei’s libertarian ideas, we are launching $LIBRA Token, designed to strengthen the Argentine economy from the ground up by supporting entrepreneurship and innovation.” The token’s promotional efforts leveraged the endorsement of Argentina’s President, Javier Milei, which created the appearance of legitimacy and significant investment value for the token. The law firm noted that purchasers didn’t know the Defendants had implemented an unfair and manipulative token distribution strategy utilizing liquidity pools on the Meteora decentralized exchange platform. Defendants leverage a single-sided liquidity model Burwick Law firm alleged that the Defendants employed a single-sided liquidity model unlike typical decentralized finance structures, which rely on genuine two-sided liquidity. Two-sided liquidity often pairs tokens like LIBRA with stable assets such as USDC or SOL. The law firm highlighted that the single-sided liquidity model inflated the price of LIBRA and created an illusion of market stability and value where none truly existed. The complaint also indicated that the Defendants artificially controlled the token’s price and manipulated market dynamics by structuring the liquidity pools exclusively with LIBRA tokens. The firm acknowledged that the defendants strategically withheld roughly 85% of the token’s total supply at launch, which directly maintained exclusive control over the token’s valuation and liquidity. Burwick Law also alleged that the Defendants were able to discretely extract stable assets such as USDC and SOL from retail purchasers once trading commenced. The lawsuit noted that the Defendant’s insiders rapidly siphoned around $107 million from the liquidity pools within hours, which caused an immediate 94% collapse in the token’s market valuation. The law firm also accused the Defendants of failure to disclose critical material facts to purchasers about the LIBRA token. Defendants didn’t inform potential purchasers about the true liquidity structures, insider control of token supply, and deliberate mechanisms allowing insiders to monetise token holdings secretly. Burwick Law firm alleged that the Defendants instead created a misleading narrative that promoted LIBRA as a legitimate product intended to support economic growth in Argentina. The lawsuit highlighted that Meteora was involved in both the technology and market management aspects of the token’s launch. It directly enabled and supported the insider trading mechanism that caused significant harm to the retail investor class. The law firm said the Plaintiff and the Class suffered financial losses due to the Defendants’ deceptive and fraudulent conduct. Burwick Law firm noted that the plaintiff was seeking compensatory and punitive damages and disgorgement of the Defendants’ unjustly obtained profits. The plaintiff was also seeking injunctive relief to prevent further fraudulent token offerings and the appointment of a receiver to protect the public and secure remaining investor assets.

In a significant development, New York-based litigation powerhouse Burwick Law has officially filed a class action lawsuit. This legal action, lodged in the New York Supreme Court, targets key entities allegedly associated with the LIBRA memecoin. Is this a crucial turning point for memecoin projects and investor protection? Let’s dive into the details of this unfolding situation. What Sparked the LIBRA Memecoin Lawsuit? According to a report by Cointelegraph, which broke the news on X (formerly Twitter), Burwick Law’s complaint centers around the launch and subsequent handling of the LIBRA token. The lawsuit names several defendants, including Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol, and Meteora. The core allegation is that these entities orchestrated a token launch that was fundamentally unfair and misleading to purchasers, ultimately causing financial harm to retail investors . Here’s a breakdown of the key accusations: Unfair Token Launch: The lawsuit claims the token launch was structured in a way that disadvantaged ordinary investors, potentially favoring insiders or specific groups. Misleading Purchasers: Accusations of deceptive practices and misrepresentations made to investors to entice them to purchase LIBRA tokens. Harm to Retail Investors: The core of the complaint is the financial losses suffered by individual, non-institutional investors as a result of the alleged misconduct. The legal action underscores the growing scrutiny and potential liabilities surrounding memecoin projects, particularly concerning their launch mechanisms and investor communications. Who are the Key Players in this Class Action Lawsuit? Understanding the parties involved is crucial to grasping the lawsuit’s scope. Let’s examine the defendants named in the class action lawsuit : Burwick Law: The plaintiff firm, specializing in complex litigation and representing the class of affected investors. Their involvement signals a serious legal challenge. Kelsier Ventures: Described as a defendant, suggesting they played a role in the LIBRA project’s development or launch. Their exact involvement will be a point of investigation. KIP Protocol: Another named defendant, KIP Protocol’s connection to the LIBRA memecoin project and the alleged misconduct is yet to be fully detailed in public reports. Meteora: Completing the list of defendants, Meteora’s role and responsibilities concerning the token launch and investor relations are under scrutiny as part of this legal process. It’s important to note that these are allegations at this stage, and the defendants will have the opportunity to respond and defend themselves in court. The lawsuit is just the beginning of a potentially lengthy legal battle. Why is Investor Protection a Central Theme in Cryptocurrency? This cryptocurrency lawsuit highlights a persistent and critical issue within the digital asset space: investor protection. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, especially memecoins, combined with often opaque project structures, creates a risky environment for investors, particularly those new to the market. Here’s why investor protection is paramount: Aspect Importance for Investor Protection Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Investors need clear information and fair practices to make informed decisions and manage risk. Information Asymmetry Project teams often possess significantly more information than retail investors. Fair disclosure and transparency are vital to level the playing field. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. This uncertainty can be exploited, making legal recourse like class action lawsuits crucial for accountability. Memecoin Risks Memecoins, often driven by hype and social media sentiment, carry even higher risks. Robust investor protection mechanisms are essential to prevent scams and unfair practices. The LIBRA memecoin lawsuit serves as a stark reminder of the need for greater accountability and safeguards within the crypto industry to protect retail investors from potentially harmful projects and practices. What are the Potential Implications of the LIBRA Memecoin Lawsuit? The outcome of this lawsuit could set significant precedents for the memecoin market and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Several potential implications are worth considering: Increased Scrutiny of Token Launches: The case could lead to heightened regulatory and legal scrutiny of how new cryptocurrency tokens are launched, especially memecoins. Precedent for Class Action Lawsuits: A successful outcome for the plaintiffs could empower other investors to pursue class action lawsuits against projects they believe have acted unfairly or deceptively. Impact on Memecoin Market Sentiment: The lawsuit and its media coverage could dampen enthusiasm for memecoins, at least temporarily, as investors become more cautious. Focus on Disclosure and Transparency: Projects might be compelled to adopt more transparent and comprehensive disclosure practices to mitigate legal risks and build investor trust. Regulatory Attention: The case could further fuel the ongoing debate about cryptocurrency regulation and potentially accelerate the development of clearer rules and guidelines. The legal proceedings will be closely watched by the crypto community, legal experts, and regulators alike, as they could shape the future landscape of digital asset investments. Staying Informed About the LIBRA Memecoin Lawsuit and Cryptocurrency Developments The Burwick Law LIBRA memecoin lawsuit is a developing story, and it’s crucial to stay informed about updates and legal proceedings. Here are some actionable insights for staying on top of this and other cryptocurrency news: Follow Reputable Crypto News Sources: Rely on established news outlets like Cointelegraph, and other reputable sources for accurate and timely updates. Monitor Legal News Outlets: Keep an eye on legal news websites and publications for analysis of the lawsuit and its potential legal ramifications. Engage in Crypto Communities Cautiously: While online crypto communities can offer insights, always verify information and be wary of biased opinions. Seek Professional Financial Advice: If you’re considering investing in cryptocurrencies, especially memecoins, consult with a qualified financial advisor to understand the risks involved. The LIBRA memecoin lawsuit is a stark reminder of the inherent risks and complexities within the cryptocurrency market. Staying informed and exercising caution are paramount for navigating this evolving landscape. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Memecoin Market? The class action lawsuit against the LIBRA memecoin project is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a potential watershed moment for the memecoin market and the broader cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the critical need for investor protection, transparent token launches, and responsible project management. As the legal proceedings unfold, the crypto world will be watching closely to see what precedents are set and what lessons are learned. This case serves as a powerful reminder that in the exciting but often volatile world of cryptocurrency, due diligence, informed decision-making, and a healthy dose of skepticism are essential for all participants.

Microsoft’s Incident Response Team said in a March 17 blog post that it first discovered the malware StilachiRAT last November and found it can steal information such as credentials stored in the browser, digital wallet information and data stored in the clipboard. After deployment, the bad actors can use StilachiRAT to siphon crypto wallet data by scanning for the configuration information for 20 crypto wallet extensions, including Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, MetaMask and OKX Wallet. The malware StilachiRAT can target crypto held in 20 different wallet extensions. Source: Microsoft “Analysis of the StilachiRAT’s WWStartupCtrl64.dll module that contains the RAT capabilities revealed the use of various methods to steal information from the target system,” Microsoft said. Among its other capabilities, the malware can extract credentials saved in the Google Chrome local state file and monitor clipboard activity for sensitive information like passwords and crypto keys . It can also use detection evasion and anti-forensics features, like the ability to clear event logs and check for signs it’s running in a sandbox to block analysis attempts, according to Microsoft. At the moment, the tech giant says it can’t pinpoint who is behind the malware but hopes that publicly sharing information will lower the number of people who might be snared. Related: New MassJacker malware targets piracy users, steals crypto “Based on Microsoft’s current visibility, the malware does not exhibit widespread distribution at this time,” Microsoft said. “However, due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor, analyze, and report on the evolving threat landscape.” Microsoft suggests to avoid falling prey to malware; users should have antivirus software, cloud-based anti-phishing and anti-malware components on their devices. Losses to crypto scams, exploits and hacks totaled nearly $1.53 billion in February , with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack accounting for the lion’s share of losses, according to blockchain security firm CertiK.

41847001,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140867,1742278228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive: Gemini Fortifies Leadership with Morgan Stanley CFO Amidst Crypto IPO Speculation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gemini-hires-morgan-stanley-cfo/,"In a move signaling ambitious growth and potential public market aspirations, cryptocurrency exchange giant Gemini has onboarded Dan Chen, a seasoned financial executive from Morgan Stanley, as its new Chief Financial Officer (CFO). This strategic appointment arrives amidst swirling rumors of a potential Initial Public Offering (IPO) for Gemini, adding fuel to the fire of anticipation within the crypto community. Is this the definitive step towards Gemini going public? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. Why Gemini’s CFO Hire is a Game Changer for Crypto IPO Aspirations The appointment of Dan Chen is not just another corporate shuffle; it’s a calculated maneuver that speaks volumes about Gemini’s future trajectory. Chen brings a wealth of experience from traditional finance powerhouses like Morgan Stanley and MetLife Investments. His background is deeply rooted in managing complex financial operations and navigating the intricacies of established financial markets. Here’s why this is significant for Gemini and the broader crypto landscape: Traditional Finance Expertise: Chen’s pedigree from Morgan Stanley injects a dose of traditional financial rigor into Gemini’s leadership. This is crucial as crypto firms increasingly seek legitimacy and acceptance from mainstream investors. IPO Readiness: Hiring a CFO with IPO experience, especially from a firm like Morgan Stanley known for its IPO prowess, strongly suggests Gemini is serious about going public. Chen’s expertise will be invaluable in preparing Gemini for the scrutiny and compliance demands of an IPO. Investor Confidence: A CFO from a reputable institution like Morgan Stanley can significantly boost investor confidence. It signals to both institutional and retail investors that Gemini is maturing and adopting best practices in financial management. Strategic Financial Planning: Beyond IPOs, a seasoned CFO is essential for strategic financial planning, managing growth, and ensuring long-term financial health. Chen’s role will be pivotal in steering Gemini through the volatile crypto market and positioning it for sustained success. Decoding the Crypto IPO Buzz: Is Gemini Next? Bloomberg’s report on Gemini considering an crypto IPO has ignited intense speculation. While Gemini has not officially confirmed these plans, the timing of Chen’s appointment is hard to ignore. An IPO would mark a significant milestone for Gemini and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Let’s consider what an IPO could mean for Gemini: Potential Benefits of a Gemini IPO Potential Challenges of a Gemini IPO Capital Infusion: An IPO could raise substantial capital for Gemini to fuel expansion, innovation, and acquisitions. Enhanced Credibility: Public listing would enhance Gemini’s credibility and transparency, attracting a broader range of investors. Liquidity for Early Investors: An IPO provides liquidity for early investors and employees holding equity. Brand Recognition: Going public can significantly boost brand recognition and market presence. Regulatory Scrutiny: Public companies face intense regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements. Market Volatility: Crypto market volatility can impact stock price and investor confidence post-IPO. Short-Term Pressure: Public companies are subject to quarterly earnings pressure, potentially hindering long-term strategic decisions. Compliance Costs: Maintaining public company compliance is expensive and resource-intensive. Morgan Stanley Executive to Crypto CFO: A Growing Trend? Dan Chen’s move from Morgan Stanley executive to Gemini CFO is part of a broader trend of traditional finance professionals migrating to the cryptocurrency sector. This influx of talent underscores the increasing maturity and institutionalization of the crypto market. Why are we seeing this shift? Crypto’s Growth Potential: Traditional finance professionals recognize the immense growth potential of the cryptocurrency industry and are seeking opportunities in this burgeoning space. Innovation and Disruption: The crypto sector is at the forefront of financial innovation and disruption, attracting individuals who want to be part of cutting-edge developments. Higher Compensation and Equity: Crypto companies often offer competitive compensation packages, including equity, which can be highly lucrative, especially in rapidly growing firms. Desire for Change: Some professionals are seeking a change from the traditional, often rigid structures of established financial institutions and are drawn to the more dynamic and entrepreneurial environment of crypto companies. What Does This Mean for the Cryptocurrency Exchange Landscape? Gemini’s strategic hire of a seasoned cryptocurrency exchange CFO and potential IPO aspirations could have ripple effects across the industry. It could: Set a Precedent: Gemini potentially going public could pave the way for other major crypto exchanges to follow suit, further legitimizing the industry. Increase Competition: A publicly traded Gemini could become an even more formidable competitor, intensifying competition among crypto exchanges. Attract Institutional Investment: Publicly listed crypto exchanges could attract more significant institutional investment, driving further market growth. Drive Regulatory Clarity: The process of going public may necessitate and encourage greater regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For crypto enthusiasts and investors, here are some actionable insights to consider: Monitor Gemini’s IPO Developments: Keep a close eye on any official announcements from Gemini regarding their IPO plans. This could be a significant event for the crypto market. Analyze Gemini’s Financial Performance: As Gemini moves towards potential public listing, pay attention to their financial reports and performance metrics. Observe Industry Trends: Track the broader trend of traditional finance executives moving to crypto and the potential for more crypto IPOs. Consider Investment Opportunities: If Gemini goes public, evaluate it as a potential investment opportunity, considering both the risks and rewards of the crypto market. Conclusion: Gemini’s Bold Move Sets the Stage for a Thrilling Chapter Gemini’s appointment of Dan Chen as CFO is a powerful signal of its ambitions and maturity. Coupled with the whispers of a potential IPO, it paints a picture of a company poised for significant growth and mainstream integration. This move not only strengthens Gemini’s leadership but also underscores the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency industry, where traditional finance expertise and digital asset innovation are increasingly converging.

41847216,https://crypto.news/?p=14346101,1742278529,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/41847216.jpeg,Crypto.com faces backlash after last-minute vote approves minting 70 billion CRO,https://crypto.news/crypto-com-faces-backlash-after-last-minute-vote-approves-minting-70-billion-cro/,"Crypto exchange Crypto.com has come under fire after a last-minute voting surge secured approval for its controversial proposal to mint 70 billion CRO tokens. According to a report from Unchained, the proposal had struggled to reach the required 33.4% quorum for most of the voting period. However, in the final hours, a sudden influx of 3.35 billion Cronos ( CRO ) votes pushed it past the threshold, securing a 61.18% approval. The proposal in question was aimed at creating a Cronos Strategic Reserve by effectively reversing a 2021 token burn that was meant to remove the same number of tokens from circulation permanently Crypto.com argued that reinstating these tokens would support the long-term growth of the Cronos ecosystem and help fund initiatives like AI-driven applications and a potential CRO-based exchange-traded fund. The newly minted CRO will be placed in an escrow wallet and released over a five-year vesting schedule. The reserve will reportedly follow strict controls, including adjustments to CRO’s emission parameters to prevent inflation from affecting validator rewards. Critics have argued that reviving previously burned tokens undermines trust and raises concerns about Cronos’ decentralization. (See below.) https://twitter.com/Wyll_BBK/status/1896452917722296775 Another community member slammed the decision, calling it proof that Cronos operates as a centralized entity. They argued that only Crypto.com’s core team would back such a move. You might also like: Crypto.com joins CF Benchmarks, enhancing Bitcoin and Ethereum indices Most independent validators opposed the plan, but Crypto.com’s own validators, including Starship, Falcon Heavy, Electron, Antares, and Minotaur IV, ultimately tipped the scales in its favor. According to Unchained, until Mar. 10, only two of the company’s validators, Starship and Falcon Heavy, had backed the proposal. By the time voting closed, they were joined by three more Crypto.com-run validators—Electron, Antares, and Minotaur IV. While a few independent validators, including Cosmostation and Polkachu.com, also voted in support, their influence was minimal compared to Crypto.com’s internal votes. One large CRO holder told Unchained they were concerned that Crypto.com’s last-minute votes set a precedent where projects with enough validator control could push decisions through despite opposition. With the proposal now approved, the Cronos blockchain is set to undergo an upgrade that will officially mint the 70 billion tokens. However, frustration among CRO holders remains high, with some calling the decision a betrayal of the original burn commitment. Further, on the same day voting ended, Crypto.com introduced a proposal to burn 50 million CRO, which is just 0.07% of the newly minted supply.
