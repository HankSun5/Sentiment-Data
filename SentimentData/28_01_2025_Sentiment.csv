Wall Street analysts hint that such a surprising scene is about to unfold again with a currently underrated AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) . They believe this AI coin will outpace Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin this year, leaving many shocked while bringing mouth-watering gains to wise investors. Cheap WallitIQ (WLTQ) Could Beat Shiba Inu (SHIB) And Dogecoin Wall Street analysts recognize that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin are long-standing players in the crypto world. Shiba Inu (SHIB) became one in 2021, when it rose volcanically by about 40,000,000%, driven by community support and broader market sentiment for meme coins. That year, it hit an all-time high of $0.00008616. Despite many predictions that followed, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has traded way below that point ever since, currently around $0.000020. Similarly, Dogecoin gained massive popularity in 2021 when it hit an all-time high of $0.73. This was followed by a sharp correction, dropping below $0.3 by the end of the year. Ever since, Dogecoin has faced highs and lows, with predictions indicating a possible surge in 2025. Wall Street analysts expect a bullish crypto extra in 2025 and foretell that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin could see fair rises. However, they predict that whatever these two major players bring will fall behind what a new AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), will deliver. This AI coin is highly innovative and has many untapped opportunities. With its powerful features, Wall Street analysts say it is well-positioned to dominate the $600 billion crypto wallet and AI market. They expect the AI coin to generate at least $5 million in monthly revenue. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Irresistible AI Features Attracts Investors Worldwide Wall Street analysts have good reason to back WallitIQ (WLTQ) over Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin. In explaining their stance, they mention that this new AI coin is rapidly attracting investors with edge-cutting AI-crypto features. Many of these features are already live on the crypto wallet management app, which the platform launched recently. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) app features a fully interactive candlestick chart , allowing users to analyze price trends for various crypto tickers over different timeframes. It’s also fully connected to the CoinGecko API , allowing users to view real-time prices for each currency. Additionally, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) interface is highly intuitive, with a responsive and visually attractive design. Soon, users will be able to do more by personalizing their price alerts and wallet updates. This innovative AI coin platform also improves crypto management by allowing users to run simulated ETH and USDT wallet management. It also supports running virtual ETH and USDT transfers to foreign addresses. That’s not all. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is well future-proof, as it includes placeholders for upcoming features on its settings page. It, therefore, demonstrates its scalability for improved features in the future. The platform has shown its reliability by completing a smart contract audit with SolidProof , a trusted agency in the crypto world. In response, Wall Street analysts and other big investors are rapidly boarding its train, assured of big gains. In its previous presale, the native altcoin raised over $6 million and sold about 350 million tokens. Such rapid adoption is bound to skyrocket its price in no time. Therefore, the ongoing presale, where the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is selling for $0.0420 only, will soon be over. Conclusion Wall Street analysts have picked WallitIQ (WLTQ) as the best choice for good reason. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin have long held their place as community favorites, this AI coin is shaping up to be the breakout star of 2025. For any investor who wants to make life-changing gains this year, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is the best entry point. The chance to join is still available for $0.0420 only. Before it jumps 50% to the next price and you miss out on such a sweet deal, join the promising AI coin’s presale now.

RCO Finance (RCOF) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and Hedera (HBAR) are three coins under $1 that could skyrocket by 2025. With the right moves, these coins might turn small investments into life-changing returns. Could these be the hidden gems that make investors rich? 1. RCO Finance RCO Finance is making a big impact in the DeFi space by combining AI technology with blockchain. This innovative approach makes RCO Finance a top choice for investors seeking profits and cutting-edge financial solutions. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy, RCO Finance is definitely worth considering. At the heart of RCO Finance is its intelligent robo-advisor, an AI trading tool that provides users with customized investment strategies. This tool helps users make informed decisions, even if they have little financial knowledge. The robo-advisor analyzes real-time data from credible sources, providing accurate advice that enables traders to make data-backed decisions quickly. RCO Finance’s tokenomics are designed to sustain the project and prevent liquidity issues. A significant portion of tokens is allocated for public sale, ensuring equal access to all and promoting community development. This approach helps build trust among investors and promotes a healthy trading environment. The RCO Finance platform offers users access to multiple trading assets, including traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This allows users to diversify portfolios and balance their risks and returns. With its diverse asset offerings, RCO Finance is an attractive option for investors seeking to minimize risk. To protect users, RCO Finance has partnered with SolidProof to conduct regular audits of its smart contracts. This partnership demonstrates the platform’s commitment to ensuring the safety of investors’ assets and promoting a trustworthy trading environment, which can positively impact the best altcoins. And the best part? You can access all these features on its recently launched beta platform . 2. DOGE Dogecoin’s market cap has surged 14% to $58 billion after a new government website featuring the Dogecoin logo appeared. The website was registered by a US government employee, confirming its connection to the government. This development has sparked interest in Dogecoin and most of the best altcoins. In price terms, DOGE rose and is now selling at $0.397, sparking renewed discussions about its potential to hit the $1 mark. The recent launch of a new government website has significantly boosted Dogecoin among the best altcoins. Analysts and traders are optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, citing technical patterns and market trends that could drive a rally taking Dogecoin to $1 or more, potentially generating over 50,000% ROI for investors. 3. HBAR A major development for Hedera Hashgraph is the filing of an HBAR exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If approved, this ETF would allow investors to buy HBAR directly. Additionally, Hedera is allocating 4.86 billion HBAR, worth around $408 million, to develop its ecosystem and improve governance. The project is also partnering with Nvidia and Chainlink to integrate artificial intelligence and advanced data oracles into its network. The price of HBAR declined in the last seven days. With a decline of 14.67%, HBAR currently stands at $0.3272. The best altcoins’ analysts think HBAR is forming a bullish pattern, which could send its price soaring to $2.30. If this happens, HBAR could increase by up to 50,000% or more, making it an auspicious investment opportunity. RCOF Makes Headlines Ahead of the Best Altcoins with $11 Million Token Presale RCOF is gaining attention as a standout altcoin, having raised over $11 million in its ongoing token presale. With its current price at $0.1, analysts predict a remarkable surge of over 500% during the remaining presale phases. This presents a prime investment opportunity for those looking to buy into a promising altcoin. If predictions go as planned, the RCOF coin could even soar and reach a listing price of $0.60 by the end of the presale. Also, some experts forecast a massive price rise of around 43,000% by the end of the year. Of course, this makes RCOF an exciting investment prospect, mainly due to its potential for long-term growth. RCOF token holders can also look forward to quarterly dividends and rewards based on their holdings. This added benefit makes RCOF an attractive choice for investors seeking growth and regular returns, making it one of the best crypto investments to consider.

Analyst Reveals When Price Will Crash To $50,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-crash-to-50000/,"The Bitcoin price has long been celebrated for its explosive growth during bull market periods. However, its cyclic nature, which consists of both a bull and a bear market, often leaves many market watchers unprepared for inevitable crashes. If history is any guide, a crypto analyst predicts that Bitcoin will skyrocket to a new price peak in 2025 and hit the end of the road after crashing to $50,000 in 2026. Despite the anticipated bull run in 2025, historical data suggests that Bitcoin could soon experience a significant market correction. TradingView analyst Xanrox said in a recent report that BTC’s price will crash to $50,000 in 2026. Analyst Calls For BTC Price Crash To $50,000 The analyst explained that statistically, Bitcoin’s price tends to crash by 77% to 86% every four years. Moreover, his predicted price decline to $50,000 aligns with past bull cycle patterns, where Bitcoin sheds substantial value after every bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims For $150,000-$170,000 With Wave Formation, Here Are The Details Presenting a chart, the analyst highlighted the estimated durations of the Bitcoin bull and bear market. He disclosed that the bull market often lasts between 742 and 1,065 days, while the bear market typically lasts 344 to 413 days. Although previous cycles saw Bitcoin correcting to severe levels, Xanrox suggests that this upcoming crash will be much weaker due to the market’s maturing structure and the involvement of institutions. He predicts that Bitcoin will plummet by 65%, leaving many investors at a loss when they sell at low prices. Nevertheless, the TradingView analyst asserts that the downturn could present a potential buying opportunity for investors who understand the cyclical nature of the Bitcoin market. Xanrox confirmed that the market is in the final stage of the 4-year bull cycle, which should end between February and November 2025. The analyst forecasts Bitcoin’s next market top at $125,000 in 2025, after which the price crash to $50,000 is expected by 2026. Consequently, he advises investors and traders to consider selling their holdings as the price approaches the peak and to ignore “moon boys” who propose unrealistic targets of $500,000 or $1 million for BTC. He also asserts that a surge to these ambitious targets was near impossible, as it would require an enormous market capitalization for Bitcoin. How The Bitcoin Halving Influences Market Prices According to Xanrox’s chart analysis, Bitcoin price trends have consistently followed a 4-year halving cycle, which is a historical event for the crypto market. During each halving period, the block reward for miners is cut in half, reducing the number of new BTC entering the circulation. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Retest Substantially Below $100,000 If This Level Fails The TradingView analyst disclosed that investors well versed in Bitcoin halving patterns and prepared for the projected cyclic crash would be well positioned to capitalize on his projected crash to $50,000. These investors would see a Bitcoin decline as an “incredible investment opportunity, maximizing profits on funding fees as they short Bitcoin at the top. Unsurprisingly, Xanrox’s projected drop to $50,000 aligns with the typical bear market period that follows a BTC price peak. Historically, each 4-year halving cycle has included both a bull run and a bear market, with the latter signaling that the cycle is ending.

As blockchain technology continues to disrupt industries and push adoption rates higher, several cryptocurrencies stand out as top contenders for massive growth. But which coin will truly dominate the market and deliver the highest returns ahead of the next big rally? Web3Bay (3BAY): The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce space by introducing a decentralized marketplace built on blockchain technology. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay rely on centralized control, often charging high fees and monopolizing user data. Web3Bay eliminates these issues by creating a platform where buyers and sellers transact directly, with complete transparency and reduced costs. Web3Bay’s presale has already raised nearly $1 million, signaling strong investor confidence. At a presale price of $0.004562, the native token, 3BAY, offers early investors an incredible opportunity. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early adopters could see a 4,193% ROI . If Web3Bay achieves its long-term goal of disrupting the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry, the token could climb even higher, potentially hitting $0.50 or more in the years ahead. Web3Bay leverages blockchain’s transparency and security to empower users. Its smart contract-based architecture ensures secure, automated transactions, while decentralized storage solutions like IPFS protect user data. Additionally, Web3Bay operates under a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), allowing token holders to shape the platform’s future through governance votes. Bitcoin (BTC): The Undisputed Leader Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, remains the most recognized and trusted cryptocurrency in the market. Its status as a store of value and hedge against inflation has only strengthened as institutional adoption increases. With limited supply and growing demand, Bitcoin is a reliable choice for both new and seasoned investors. Bitcoin’s price has seen consistent growth during past bull runs, and many analysts predict that it could reach $182,000 or more during the next rally. This growth would be driven by factors such as the 2024 halving event, which will reduce mining rewards and create a supply shock, as well as increasing institutional interest from companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and others. Ethereum (ETH): The Foundation of Web3 Ethereum powers the majority of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces, making it the backbone of the Web3 ecosystem. Its recent transition to Ethereum 2.0 has improved scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction speeds, positioning it for long-term growth. Currently priced around $3000, Ethereum is expected to climb to $10,000 or more during the 2025 bull run, representing a 270% ROI . This growth will be fueled by the increasing number of developers building on Ethereum, as well as the continued adoption of Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. Solana (SOL): The Speed King Solana has gained widespread recognition for its high-speed and low-cost transactions, making it a favorite for developers building decentralized applications and NFTs. Its ability to process over 65,000 transactions per second sets it apart from competitors like Ethereum. Solana’s current price of $258 could soar to $1,000 or higher in the next bull run, offering a 287% ROI . Its growing ecosystem, which includes partnerships with major companies like Google Cloud, ensures continued adoption and expansion. Cardano (ADA): The Eco-Friendly Blockchain Cardano is a research-driven blockchain that prioritizes sustainability, scalability, and security. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is not only energy-efficient but also highly scalable, making it an eco-friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Currently priced under $1, Cardano offers an affordable entry point for investors. With predictions of ADA reaching $5 or more, it could deliver a 400% ROI during the 2025 bull run. Final Thoughts The 2025 bull run promises to be one of the most exciting periods in cryptocurrency history, with projects like Web3Bay, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano leading the charge. Each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique value propositions and growth potential, making them strong candidates for investment. Web3Bay stands out for its innovative approach to e-commerce and massive ROI potential, while Bitcoin provides stability and long-term value. Ethereum’s dominance in decentralized applications, Solana’s high-speed infrastructure, and Cardano’s eco-friendly solutions round out a diverse portfolio for the upcoming rally.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , CoinShares says that institutional crypto investment vehicles raked in nearly $2 billion last week alone. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US$1.9bn last week bringing year-to-date (YTD) inflows to US$4.8bn — likely as a result of recent presidential executive orders that proposed the initiation of a strategic reserve asset in Bitcoin. Despite the relatively flat price action last week, trading volumes were high at US$25bn for the week, comprising 37% of all trading volumes on trusted crypto exchanges.” Source: CoinShares The United States regionally led international inflows, raking in $1.7 billion of the $1.9 billion in inflows. Canada, Switzerland and Germany provided $31 million, $35 million, and $23 million, respectively. Bitcoin ( BTC ), per usual, snatched up the lion’s share of inflows. “Bitcoin saw inflows totaling US$1.6bn, bringing YTD inflows to US$4.4bn, accounting for 92% of all inflows in the digital asset sector. Following Bitcoin’s pre-inauguration new all-time highs last week, it was no surprise to see short-Bitcoin ETFs regain traction, with inflows of US$5.1 million.” Ethereum ( ETH ) led altcoins with $205 million in inflows, bringing YTD ETH inflows to $177 million. With the exception of Cardano ( ADA ), no crypto institutional investment products suffered outflows last week.

Bessent, a billionaire former hedge fund manager, didn't give the crypto sector much to chew on during his nomination hearing earlier this month, but he's a known digital assets enthusiast. His boss, Trump, has already assigned him a spot on the team assigned to marshal the federal government toward a friendly system of oversight. The Senate voted 68-29 to approve Bessent's nomination Monday evening, and he'll officially join Trump's cabinet when he's sworn in to permanently replace predecessor Janet Yellen. At the center of Trump's agenda is the extension of tax cuts, so that top priority may shove crypto down the list, though the president did include it among his opening salvo of executive orders. Senator Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican who chairs the Senate Financial Committee, called Bessent ""one of the sharpest minds in the global finance industry"" before the Monday confirmation, saying ""his background and training are tailor-made for this role."" Trump's crypto order will have Bessent's Treasury taking a role on a governmental working group — backed by ""individual expertise from leaders in digital assets and digital markets"" — to hash out the strategy for U.S. crypto policy. His department is among those who'll owe the White House a report in less than two months on how to modify existing regulations or establish new ones at the Treasury, and the wider group must ""recommend regulatory and legislative proposals"" within six months. He'll also be responsible for erasing his predecessor's crypto work that had been directed by former President Joe Biden. The order also bans work on a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), which had never progressed beyond the tire-kicking stage in the U.S., despite enthusiastic adoption and testing by other jurisdictions, including China. As a nominee, the ex-chief of Key Square Group told senators in his confirmation hearing that he saw ""no reason"" to pursue the idea of a domestic CBDC, further endearing himself to crypto insiders who have been nervous the government might pursue a digital dollar. But he wasn't questioned about crypto policies. Still, Bessent is no stranger to digital assets. He'd tucked hundreds of thousands of dollars of his personal wealth into a bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), as noted in his lengthy financial disclosures. Those assets were liquidated when he received Trump's nomination. At the Treasury, Bessent is also in command of its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that had pursued crypto services with enforcement actions and rulemaking , especially involving so-called mixing services that seek to grant users anonymity by blending their transactions to make it difficult to track them. The Treasury's financial-crimes arm had focused on digital assets as a popular means of transaction in human trafficking and child exploitation . Bessent's department additionally manages U.S. financial sanctions , which have historically given the federal government reach into overseas activity, such as when it targeted mixer Tornado Cash with sanctions that were recently overturned in federal court .

AAVE has been buzzing with increased whale activity and institutional backing, while Litecoin’s impressive 25% rally following Grayscale’s spot ETF filing has made it a standout performer. Both coins are showing immense potential for short-term gains with their strong market momentum and solid fundamentals. But Qubetics ($TICS) is a game-changer in its own right. This innovative Web3 aggregator is redefining blockchain technology by solving interoperability issues and uniting major blockchains into a single ecosystem. With over $11.1 million raised in its ongoing presale and jaw-dropping ROI predictions, Qubetics is proving why it’s one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. Qubetics Tackles Blockchain Interoperability Interoperability has been a roadblock in the crypto space, with blockchains operating in isolation and hindering seamless transactions. Qubetics changes the game as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, integrating major networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into a unified ecosystem. This makes cross-chain asset transfers and data sharing smoother than ever. Picture a logistics company relying on multiple blockchains for payments and supply chain tracking. Without interoperability, they’re stuck juggling complex processes. Enter Qubetics, simplifying everything by connecting these chains seamlessly, saving time and resources. From developers building multi-chain dApps to everyday users transferring assets, Qubetics bridges the gap for all, cementing its status as one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term . Qubetics Presale Surges Past $11.1 Million Qubetics’ presale continues to dominate, currently in its 19th stage. With over $11.1 million raised, more than 16,700 token holders, and 448 million $TICS tokens sold, it’s clear this project has the attention of serious investors. Each presale stage lasts seven days, with prices increasing by 10% every Sunday at midnight. At its current price of $0.0606, $TICS offers incredible ROI potential. Analysts predict a price of $0.25 at the end of the presale, translating to a 312.17% ROI. Post-presale, the numbers get even more enticing: $1 ($TICS) delivers a 1548.70% ROI, while a price of $10 after its Q2 2025 mainnet launch equals a staggering 16,387.05% ROI. For example, investing $1,250 now would net you 20,608.82 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $10, that same investment turns into $206,088. With analysts projecting even higher returns, there’s no better time to join the Qubetics presale. AAVE Gains Momentum With Whale and Institutional Backing AAVE has become a centerpiece in the DeFi market, thanks to a surge in whale activity and strong institutional support. Recently, a whale deposited 17,002 AAVE worth $5.9 million onto Binance, sparking speculation about future price movements. This follows an earlier $13.5 million profit (+330%) from the same whale’s trades, underscoring their bullish sentiment. Adding to this momentum is the Ethereum Foundation’s $165 million allocation to AAVE through a 50,000 ETH fund. This substantial capital boost strengthens AAVE’s liquidity and reinforces its integration within Ethereum’s ecosystem, signaling long-term confidence in the platform. The multi-signature wallet setup accompanying the funds ensures security and transparency, attracting more institutional investors. AAVE is also exploring innovative strategies for growth. One proposal involves integrating Bitcoin mining revenues into its treasury, diversifying income streams, and increasing scalability. Another plan focuses on incorporating the GHO stablecoin into Bitcoin transactions, potentially positioning AAVE as a key player in both DeFi and Bitcoin-based finance. Combined with a bullish symmetrical triangle technical setup, AAVE is well-positioned for a breakout once it clears the $372 resistance level. Litecoin Rides a 25% Rally With Spot ETF Hype Litecoin (LTC) has seen a 25% price surge following Grayscale’s filing for a spot Litecoin ETF. This news has attracted significant demand from institutional investors, validating the efforts of long-term holders (LTHs) who have consistently supported LTC through market fluctuations. The MVRV Long/Short Difference indicator remains highly positive, showing that LTHs are in profit and providing stability to the Litecoin market. This group of investors plays a crucial role in reducing price volatility by holding onto their assets instead of selling during fluctuations. Their consistent backing has enabled Litecoin to sustain its bullish momentum even in challenging market conditions. Supporting this bullish outlook is the IOMAP metric, which reveals that over 2 million LTC, valued at $256 million, were purchased in the $128 to $135 range. If Litecoin flips $136 into support, it could unlock these profits and propel the price to $147. However, failure to breach this level could result in a pullback to $117 or $105, highlighting the importance of breaking through this key resistance point. A Final Look at the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term Qubetics, AAVE, and Litecoin are each making waves in the crypto world, offering unique opportunities for investors seeking short-term gains. Qubetics stands out with its revolutionary interoperability solutions and record-breaking presale, offering unmatched ROI potential. AAVE impresses with its whale-driven momentum, Ethereum backing, and innovative growth strategies. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s strong rally and long-term holder support make it a reliable choice for continued bullish momentum. For those looking to maximize their investments, Qubetics offers an unbeatable chance to join the Qubetics presale and capitalize on one of the most promising projects in the crypto space today.

Per Seoul Shinmun , South Korean crypto traders are “troubled.” They are concerned by the fact that the holiday “overlaps with the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming base rate decision,” the outlet wrote. South Korean Crypto Community: Time to HODL, Sell, or Buy? As such, the outlet reported, domestic traders are unsure if they should hold, pre-emptively sell, or even buy coins during the holiday. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit over the past year. (Source: CoinGecko) This year, Lunar New Year falls on January 29. But in South Korea – as the days prior to and following New Year’s Day are also public holidays – most firms are also giving their workers the day off on Monday (27) and Friday (31). That means that, including the two weekends, most workers have nine days off this year. But while the South Korean stock market will be inactive during the holidays, the 24/7 nature of crypto means no such slowdown is expected in the coin markets. The media outlet said Upbit crypto exchange data shows domestic Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) prices trended upward “during the Lunar New Year holiday for the past three years.” Korea started the Lunar New Year holiday with scattered rain and snow flurries on Monday, although most areas have seen only a few snowflakes. https://t.co/DxMw9syGcV — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) January 27, 2025 Holiday Uncertainty for Traders Kim (first name withheld) is a Seoul-based crypto trader. He told Cryptonews.com that the holiday period would likely be full of “uncertainty” this year. Kim said: “It will be a bit of a nail-biting time if the Fed or US President Donald Trump make announcements. If so, the South Korean market will probably respond fast. But traders are always ready for volatility in the markets. We just have to stay alert. That’s the nature of trading crypto.” The holiday period, however, has also seen significant drops. These have included instances of day-on-day drops of up to 5%. The top five coins per trading volume on the South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb on January 27, 2025. (Source: CoinMarketCap) For South Korean traders, almost everything will hinge on events in the USA, the media outlet reported. Domestic regulators and politicians are unlikely to make any major announcements during the holidays. So events in Washington will likely be the driving force behind any price movements on domestic platforms. Seoul Shinmun noted that “since the election of Trump ,” interest “in cryptocurrency investment has increased in South Korea.” The Fed is widely expected to freeze its current benchmark interest rate of 4.25-4.50% at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which kicks off on January 28. South Korea is undergoing an unprecedented political crisis with impeached President Yoon facing one legal proceeding that could oust him from office and another that brings a possible death penalty. Here's what to know. https://t.co/jKB92C62QD — Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) January 27, 2025 Experts Speak The crypto services provider Matrixport told the same media outlet: “In the past 12 years, Bitcoin has risen 11 times during the Lunar New Year holiday period. Negative factors such as the Fed’s hawkish stance are putting downward pressure on the markets. But positive factors, like expectations about a forthcoming strategic Bitcoin reserve in the US, are supporting BTC prices. So there is a high probability of an increase in the days following the Lunar New Year holiday.” An unnamed domestic crypto exchange employee told Seoul Shinmun: “Since Trump’s election, market liquidity has increased rapidly. And South Korean trading volumes here have increased to a level surpassing that of the stock market. The crypto market operates 24 hours a day and is highly volatile. So people would be wise to take a cautious approach.” The post South Korean Crypto Investors Face ‘Nail-biting’ Lunar New Year Conundrum appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|South Korea|Trading,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-27 23:30:00

Faced with these warnings, some are joining a meme coin shift to utility, looking for tokens that solve real problems. Among these picks, a fresh project called Remittix stands out as a strong contender for future success. Shiba Inu and Pepe Show Signs of Struggle After a period of intense hype, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down -6.96% over the month, while Pepe (PEPE) dropped -12.24%. Critics say these meme coins rely on social media buzz more than practical uses. While Shiba Inu tries adding features for loyal fans, many doubt it can stay strong in the face of competition. As a result, more investors see a meme coin shift to utility happening, where coins like Remittix may offer stable growth. Likewise, Pepe soared on memes but lacks a clear plan for long-term adoption. Many who once praised Pepe (PEPE) for quick gains now worry about future crashes. Observers note that meme-based tokens can tumble just as fast as they rise. Hoping to avoid major losses, holders of both Shiba Inu and Pepe look at tokens built for real use cases—like Remittix (RTX), which addresses cross-border payments. The Appeal of Utility Tokens Experts link the meme coin shift to utility to rising demand for coins that can fix real finance issues. While Shiba Inu captured attention through meme culture, it now faces a crowded market. Meanwhile, Pepe struggles to keep up if big holders exit. By contrast, Remittix focuses on cheap, fast transfers, drawing interest from those who value direct benefits over internet hype. Supporters say Remittix (RTX) outperforms meme tokens by tackling everyday challenges. It aims to reduce fees on international payments, helping families, freelancers, and businesses. This focus on real-world solutions has driven many Shiba Inu and Pepe holders to join its presale. By merging user-friendly transactions with the fun side of crypto, Remittix stands to eclipse older meme coins in the next few years. Remittix Prepares for 2025 Dominance With many predicting a decline for both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) in 2025, the stage is set for Remittix (RTX) to shine. Some investors foresee 100x returns if Remittix gains enough traction. Unlike meme tokens, it doesn’t rely on surprise tweets or viral spikes; instead, it builds steady demand by solving cross-border finance woes. This steady growth could give Remittix a lasting edge, especially if more users adopt it for daily transactions. The meme coin shift to utility suggests people now prefer tokens that help them save on remittances or speed up global payments. By 2025, experts think Remittix may outlive weaker meme coins, proving that practical solutions often beat short-lived hype cycles. Conclusion While Shiba Inu and Pepe once drew large followings, many now doubt their longevity. Fearing crashes by 2025, holders from both groups seem eager to join the meme coin shift to utility. Leading this trend, Remittix (RTX) offers fast, low-cost transfers that appeal to anyone wanting real worth in a coin. With its user-focused approach, Remittix appears ready to become a top choice for those seeking stability beyond memes.

In response to these forecasts, some investors are transitioning from meme coins to utility tokens, seeking options that address real-world issues. Among these, a new project called Remittix is emerging as a promising candidate for future growth. Shiba Inu and Pepe Facing Challenges After experiencing a surge of excitement, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has decreased by -6.96% over the past month, and Pepe (PEPE) has fallen by -12.24%. Critics argue that these meme coins depend heavily on social media excitement rather than practical applications. Although Shiba Inu is working on adding features for its dedicated users, many doubt its ability to withstand increasing competition. Consequently, more investors are witnessing a shift from meme coins to utility tokens, with Remittix potentially offering more stable growth opportunities. Similarly, Pepe gained popularity through memes but lacks a solid plan for sustained adoption. Many who once admired Pepe (PEPE) for its rapid gains now fear potential downturns. Observers point out that meme-based tokens can fall as quickly as they rise. To avoid significant losses, holders of both Shiba Inu and Pepe are turning to tokens designed for real-world applications—such as Remittix (RTX), which targets cross-border payment solutions. The Attraction of Utility Tokens Experts attribute the trend from meme coins to utility tokens to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies that address genuine financial challenges. While Shiba Inu captivated audiences through memes, it now faces stiff competition in a crowded market. Meanwhile, Pepe struggles to maintain momentum if major holders decide to sell. In contrast, Remittix emphasizes cost-effective and speedy transactions, appealing to those who prioritize tangible benefits over online buzz. Advocates claim Remittix (RTX) surpasses meme tokens by addressing everyday issues. Its goal is to lower fees on international transactions, benefiting families, freelancers, and businesses alike. This real-world focus has attracted numerous Shiba Inu and Pepe holders to its presale. By combining user-friendly transactions with the engaging aspects of cryptocurrency, Remittix is poised to surpass older meme coins in the coming years. Remittix Gears Up for Dominance in 2025 With predictions of a downturn for both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) in 2025, Remittix (RTX) is positioned to take the spotlight. Some investors anticipate 100x returns if Remittix gains sufficient traction. Unlike meme tokens, it doesn't depend on unexpected tweets or viral trends; instead, it aims to create consistent demand by resolving issues in cross-border finance. This steady growth could provide Remittix with a lasting advantage, especially as more users begin using it for everyday transactions. The shift from meme coins to utility tokens indicates that people now prefer cryptocurrencies that help them save on remittances or expedite global payments. By 2025, experts predict Remittix may outlast weaker meme coins, demonstrating that practical solutions often triumph over fleeting hype. Conclusion While Shiba Inu and Pepe once attracted large numbers of followers, doubts about their sustainability are growing. With concerns over potential declines by 2025, holders from both communities are eager to embrace the shift from meme coins to utility tokens. Leading this movement, Remittix (RTX) offers quick, affordable transfers that appeal to those seeking genuine value in a cryptocurrency. With its user-oriented strategy, Remittix is poised to become a preferred choice for individuals looking for stability beyond memes.

They made the most of the Shiba Inu pump and are about to do the same with the budding 1Fuel . This has put crypto traders on their heels, as they hope to buy into 1Fuel before it's too late. The new token is billed for a massive upward rally and may yield explosive profits for proactive investors. This makes it a good crypto asset to have in your portfolio now. Can Shiba Inu return explosive yield like the early days? Shiba Inu gained popularity due to its early gains of up to 10,000x in May 2021. The meme coin became an Internet sensation getting endorsement from major market movers like Elon Musk. Shiba Inu quickly rose in prominence and was able to make early position holders wealthier. The Shiba Inu token remains a prominent token in the crypto space, ranking 17th, with about $11b market cap. However, Shiba Inu isn't looking as promising as before. The meme coin is on a downward run, dipping by about 17% in the past month. Shiba Inu is now below its $0.000020 critical support level, trading at $0.000018 currently. Analysts say the chances for an explosive run from Shiba Inu looks slim. But they expect the meme coin to reverse its dip in the coming month gradually. Shiba Inu could rally back to its $0.000024 monthly high in February, possibly ending Q1, 2025, at $0.000030. 1Fuel: Early investors eye Shiba Inu-like returns Crypto investors have been on the lookout for the next 10,000x token and 1Fuel may just be the one they are looking for. The new token is gaining high traction despite just being a presale token. Top investors see 1Fuel as a low risk purchase with a high tendency to yield high returns. Hence, many are positioning themselves to gain from it massively. The presale token is valued at $0.017 currently, but could be worth double by the next phase. This makes it important to join early, to enjoy low-price entry and potential high-margin return. The projection for the 1Fuel token is high and joining the presale at this early position could bring up to 1000x. Patience investors may even enjoy higher yield than that from 1Fuel. The 1Fuel project is among those expected to disrupt the DeFi space. The crypto project will come with a cold storage feature and technologies to make trading easier and more efficient. This will put 1Fuel amongst the most used platforms for cross-chain trading and asset management. The crypto solution will also resolve concerns about privacy by introducing a military-grade mixer to conceal users’ sensitive data. This will guarantee anonymity and ensure users' privacy is well protected. 1Fuel will be a multi-beneficial project with the power to transform the DeFi space and make it more satisfactory for users. The crypto project is already attracting interest with its features, with analysts predicting high adoption. 1Fuel's tangible utilities set it apart from Shiba Inu and other viral tokens. This implies that it's not only gaining traction based on hype, but it also has revolutionary use cases that make it essential. Thus, analysts are convinced it could boom and maintain relevance for a long time and make the owners profitable. The 1Fuel presale is still fast selling and investors eyeing Shiba Inu-like profit may consider joining the presale now.

Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $34,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address (CA) – 8i5qNveWm4AkzM2z7Abb9coLjjRbUyMGUxPR2V75FwLK – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BTC|FIAT|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-27 23:51:00

Consequently, leading altcoins like Binance Coin and Solana are set to experience a substantial rise in the first quarter, fueled by continuous advancements and enhancements in their ecosystems. Yet, despite their anticipated growth, a new PayFi venture, Remittix ($RTX) , is capturing attention within investor portfolios. This groundbreaking initiative has already been dubbed a leading crypto ICO project and is being likened to Solana's capabilities in transactions. In this article, we will delve into recent developments concerning Solana price and BNB price, exploring why their holders are increasingly turning to Remittix. Concerns Mount Over BNB's Prolonged Consolidation BNB has been actively working to expand its ecosystem and bolster its market position. Just last week, Gate Ventures committed $20 million to the BNB Incubation Alliance, aiming to accelerate blockchain and Web3 startup growth. Binance Coin also executed its 30th token burn , eliminating 1.63 million BNB valued at roughly $1.16 billion, cutting the total supply to 142.47 million BNB, with 42.47 million set to be burned through Auto-Burn and real-time methods. This strategy is pivotal for BNB's long-term value, as it helps in reducing supply and ensuring price stability. Despite these efforts, BNB price is trading at $684.81, a drop of 0.80% from last week's opening and 2.7% over the past month. This stagnation has unsettled investors, many of whom are now eyeing opportunities in Remittix, a PayFi solution that challenges both BNB price and Solana's transactional model. Is Solana's ETF Approval on the Horizon? Solana's efficiency in transactions has consistently been a major draw. Its high-speed blockchain is built to enable low fees and high throughput. Early Sunday, Solana price jumped 4.5% intraday, surpassing the $250 mark to hit $253. However, this boost hasn't translated into a strong upward trend over the past month, with prices fluctuating between $275 and $230. A potential driver for future growth is the newly proposed Solana ETF, which could elevate Solana to unprecedented levels once it gains approval. Grayscale Investments has submitted an application to list a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on the NYSE, a step that could enhance SOL's credibility among traditional investors. Despite the positive buzz around the ETF, Solana price remains on a sideways path, and holders are wary of possible delays, reminiscent of Ripple's experience. Consequently, investors are seeking alternatives, with Remittix emerging as an appealing option for stability and growth. Remittix ($RTX) - Is It the Next 100x Altcoin? Remittix is rapidly gaining traction as a pioneering PayFi initiative that provides a seamless cross-border bridge between digital and traditional currencies. A standout aspect of Remittix is its flat-fee structure, ensuring recipients get the exact amount sent without hidden costs. This advantage positions Remittix as a formidable competitor to platforms like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase, which do not offer direct crypto-to-bank transfers. With features such as worldwide access, lower costs, rapid processing, transparency, and 24/7 availability, industry insiders are not only supporting Remittix to match Solana's transaction prowess but also to become one of the top crypto ICOs of the first quarter. The ongoing presale aims to gather $36 million and is anticipated to sell out in eight weeks. The $RTX token is currently offered at a discounted rate of $0.0383, providing an enticing entry point before expected major gains. Given its potential to bridge a multi-trillion-dollar market gap and draw institutional interest, Remittix is attracting attention from Binance Coin and Solana investors eager to latch onto the next big opportunity in the crypto world. Investors are turning to Remittix for its robust security, cost-effectiveness, and its capability to offer a relevant cross-border solution for businesses and freelancers. As the market heats up, now is an ideal time to seize the Remittix presale and secure a position in what could be the next 100x altcoin.

As a result, top altcoins like Binance Coin and Solana are very likely to see a significant upswing in Q1, driven by ongoing developments and upgrades within their respective ecosystems. However, despite their projected success, a new PayFi project, Remittix ($RTX) , is stealing their spot in the portfolios of investors. This innovative project has already been labeled a top crypto ICO project and compared to the transactional capabilities of Solana. In this article we will reflect on some of the latest occurrences around Solana price and BNB price, considering why their holders are increasingly migrating into Remittix. BNB’s Month-long Consolidation is Raising Concerns BNB has been making several strides to develop its ecosystem and strengthen its market position. Last week, it was reported that Gate Ventures invested $20 million in the BNBIncubation Alliance, which will help accelerate blockchain and Web3 startups. Binance Coin also completed its 30th token burn , destroying 1.63 million BNB worth approximately $1.16 billion, reducing the total supply to 142.47 million BNB with 42.47 million left to burn via Auto-Burn and real-time mechanisms. This token burn strategy plays a crucial role in BNB's long-term value proposition, reducing supply and enhancing price stability. Contrary to these efforts, BNB price changes hands at $684.81, down 0.80% from last week's opening price and 2.7% in the last 30 days. This consolidation has spooked investors, most of whom are looking for an opportunity in Remittix, a PayFi solution rivaling BNB price and Solana's transactional concept. Would Solana ETF be Approved Soon? Solana’s transactional efficiency has long been one of its strongest selling points. Its high-speed blockchain network is designed to allow low charges and high throughput. In the early hours of Sunday, Solana price saw a sharp 4.5% intraday spike, slipping past the $250 price level to trade at $253. However, despite this rally, the Solana price trajectory has shown little upward movement over the past month, oscillating between $275 and $230 price points. An important catalyst for this growth in the future will likely be the recently proposed Solana ETF, which could take Solana to new highs once approved. Grayscale Investments has filed an application to list a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on the NYSE, a move that may even further legitimize SOL in the eyes of traditional investors. While the ETF is surrounded by optimism, Solana price continues to move sideways and holders remain skeptical about the possibility of delays, which might be like what happened with Ripple. Due to this fact, investors have started to look for other options and one of the attractive ones is Remittix for stability and growth. Remittix ($RTX) - The Next 100x Altcoin? Remittix is quickly gaining momentum as an innovative PayFi project that offers a frictionless cross-border bridge between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. One of the standout features of Remittix is its flat-fee model, ensuring that recipients receive the exact amount sent without hidden charges. This feature has positioned Remittix as a key challenger to competitors like Stripe, Wise and Coinbase, none of which offer direct crypto-to-bank transfers. With advantages such as global reach, lower fees, faster processing, transparency and 24/7 accessibility, industry experts are not only backing Remittix to rival Solana’s transaction efficiency but also offer one of the top crypto ICOs of Q1. The ongoing presale aims to raise $36 million and is expected to sell out within eight weeks. The $RTX token is currently priced at a discounted rate of $0.0383 making it an attractive entry point before anticipated parabolic rallies. Given its potential to bridge a multi-trillion-dollar market gap and attract institutional interest, Remittix is drawing attention from Binance Coin and Solana holders eager to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto. Investors are looking to Remittix for robust security, cost efficiency and the ability to provide a relatable cross-border solution to businesses and freelancers.

What starts with a surge of excitement can quickly turn into chaos. The launch of the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin in January not only captured the crypto community’s attention but also opened Pandora’s box as fraudsters eager to exploit the hype, overwhelming the market with fake tokens and harmful applications. On Jan. 17, President Donald Trump debuted his meme coin marketed as a unique opportunity to express “support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs” embodied by the symbol TRUMP, according to the meme coin’s official website, which was also featured on Trump’s announcement on X.

Go to https://t.co/GX3ZxT5xyq — Have Fun! pic.twitter.com/flIKYyfBrC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 Within just 48 hours of its release, TRUMP achieved a market cap of $72 billion, creating a “perfect storm for fraud,” analysts at Israel-headquartered blockchain forensic firm Blockaid say. However, this surge attracted not only speculators seeking to earn quick bucks but also malicious actors who sought to take advantage of the frenzy. The blockchain firm revealed in a research report that scammers wasted no time in capitalizing on the buzz surrounding the token’s release. These malicious actors quickly flooded the market with fake tokens, hoping to deceive investors who were eager to jump on the bandwagon. The report shows a 206% increase in tokens using the “Trump” name on the launch day, from 3,300 to 6,800 tokens. These scammers created numerous tokens that were designed to mimic the TRUMP meme coin, making it difficult for investors to distinguish legitimate assets from fraudulent ones. A Blockaid spokesperson told crypto.news that scammers began making it “increasingly difficult for investors to distinguish between legitimate tokens and malicious ones.” “ and this challenge is not unique to TRUMP. In almost every major web3 launch, our team sees how threat actors are creating projects that mimic the branding and excitement of the real tokens, creating confusion and exposing users to significant risks.” Oz Tamir, the research and development lead at Blockaid The number of fake tokens containing the word “Trump” | Source: Blockaid With the public eager to purchase TRUMP tokens, these fake assets were able to gain traction and even generate profit for the scammers behind them. The same surge in interest was seen in malicious decentralized applications, which also saw a sharp increase following the launch. The day after the meme coin hit the market, impersonator dApps saw a 14x rise, Blockaid says, adding that more than 90 fake applications appeared in just 24 hours. You might also like: Blockaid new dashboard to track web3 activity and threats Blockaid’s report also notes that scammers didn’t stop with just the TRUMP token. Other tokens referencing members of the Trump family, such as “Melania” and “Barron,” surged by hundreds of per cent, too, giving the impression of a network of tokens tied to the Trump brand. These tokens helped create the “illusion of an interconnected ecosystem,” Blockaid says. Tamir notes that the biggest spike in fake tokens “was noticeable on Solana, especially during this launch, given the prevalence of meme coins on the network.” “That said, EVM networks like Ethereum have consistently been a hotspot for scams as well, including both fake tokens and malicious dApps targeting EVM users.” Oz Tamir As the excitement around high-profile launches grows, so does the opportunity for scammers to take advantage of unsuspecting users. Unfortunately, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, while empowering users, also opens the door for malicious actors to exploit the system. In response to the surge in scam activity, Blockaid says it has been trying to prevent users from interacting with malicious tokens and fake dApps. Since the launch of the TRUMP token, the firm disclosed it has blocked hundreds of users from engaging with fraudulent assets.

This blockchain-powered e-commerce platform is not only redefining online shopping but also generating significant excitement with its presale, which has now surged past $950,000. This article explores the latest developments in the crypto space, highlighting why Web3Bay is emerging as a top investment opportunity in 2025. Cardano’s Hydra Upgrade Fuels Optimism Cardano (ADA) is on a roll, with its recent Hydra upgrade propelling the blockchain to new heights. This innovative scaling solution has significantly boosted Cardano’s transaction speed, reaching an impressive 501,000 transactions per second (TPS) while keeping costs low. This makes Cardano a strong contender in the race for blockchain efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, Cardano is gaining real-world traction, with Argentina embracing the technology for various applications, including social security benefits systems, university collaborations, and union records. These developments showcase the growing utility of ADA and its potential for widespread adoption. With ADA currently trading at $1.12, analysts are optimistic about its future prospects. Many believe that Cardano could surpass its previous all-time high of $3.09 and potentially reach $5 in this cycle, fueled by its robust technology and increasing adoption. Toncoin’s Price Surge: Is $7 the Next Target? Toncoin (TON) is also generating excitement, with key indicators suggesting a potential surge in its price. Currently priced at $5.63, TON has shown strong upward momentum, rebounding from a recent low of $4.99. CryptoQuant’s Normalized Risk Metric (NRM) indicates that TON is entering a low-risk accumulation phase, historically a precursor to significant price increases. If TON breaks above its 50-day simple moving average at $5.88, analysts predict that it could soon reach targets of $6 or even $7. Web3Bay Presale Explodes Past $950k! $1 Million Next?! Web3Bay is not just another crypto project; it’s a game-changer that’s poised to disrupt the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry.

With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early investors could see returns exceeding 6,430%. But Web3Bay is more than just a promising investment. The platform is packed with innovative features, including decentralized storage, Layer-2 scaling for fast and affordable transactions, and cross-chain compatibility.7 Furthermore, Web3Bay boasts a community-driven governance model, ensuring that users have a say in shaping the platform’s future. With its presale inching towards $1 million and its innovative features generating significant buzz, Web3Bay is emerging as a top contender in the crypto space. This is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that has the potential to redefine how we shop online.

39588996,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-breaks-records-as-unknown-tech-launch-looks-to-take-on-cardano,1738022948,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/39588996.jpeg,1Fuel Breaks Records As Unknown Tech Launch Looks To Take On Cardano,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-breaks-records-as-unknown-tech-launch-looks-to-take-on-cardano,"ADA experiences increased market volatility as 1Fuel (OFT) emerges as a strong competitor in crypto. With its advanced DeFi features, cross-chain transactions, and robust privacy measures, 1Fuel attracts significant investment, challenging ADA's position in the market. The performance of its record-breaking presale shows that 1Fuel is prepared to disrupt existing platforms and potentially reinvent digital asset management during 2025. Cardano’s struggles continue: Analysts adjust price predictions for ADA Cardano (ADA) is currently facing a challenging period, with its price experiencing a notable decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has dropped approximately 9.5% in the past 24 hours, bringing its value down to around $0.90. This significant price decrease can be attributed to large-scale sell-offs by whales, creating uncertainty among investors and raising concerns about the coin’s performance in the coming weeks. The analysts at CoinCodex project ADA to climb up to $2 by February 20, 2025, representing a 111% market gain. Cardano investors anticipate the coin value hitting the $2.61 mark in mid-April, accompanied by a projected 169% market value growth. The Changelly forecast projects Cardano's peak value to reach $1.46 during April but expects prices to stay below $2. The Cardano ecosystem expands by increasing active addresses to 50,000, notwithstanding price fluctuations. At its current trading price of $0.8771, Cardano maintains a total market capitalization of $30.85 billion with a daily transaction volume of $941.56 million. 1Fuel: The rising DeFi powerhouse set to disrupt the crypto market The innovative DeFi and digital asset management solutions of 1Fuel (OFT) have propelled it to compete at the front of the cryptocurrency market. The platform distinguishes itself through its complete ecosystem to provide future-proof crypto features for user convenience and advanced functionality. The core functionality of the 1Fuel service consists of a decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet that lets users achieve cross-chain transactions quickly with a single button click. The 1Fuel platform distinguishes itself with its unique single-click mechanism that removes the requirement to use multiple wallets or additional tools to move assets through diverse blockchains. 1Fuel's true disruptive capability results from its dedication to privacy protection and security. Through the platform's privacy mixer feature, every transaction benefits from total anonymity and is protected by disposable wallets and military-grade cold storage. 1Fuel surpasses the standard privacy protocols of Ledger and Core Wallet by delivering enhanced protection so users can enjoy a secure digital transaction environment. The storage functionality of 1Fuel represents only a fraction of how the platform transforms crypto asset management. The platform offers three core features: a crypto debit and credit card for fast fiat exchange, a peer-to-peer exchange for direct transfers, and AI-powered asset management tools. Because of its distinctive features, 1Fuel provides a strong solution for storing and managing digital assets, appealing to many investors. Large investors, often called ""whales,"" consider 1Fuel a top choice in decentralized finance (DeFi) investments due to its high-profit potential in the growing DeFi market. The ongoing presale has already distributed more than 156 million tokens and raised over $1.5 million. Analysts believe that 1Fuel's value could increase 100 times after its launch, particularly given its low price of $0.017.

The new model released on Monday, has come along with huge excitement about the DeepSeek’s R1, which has impacted the tech stock market, resulting in volatility on the market with chipmaking giant Nvidia shares dropping by over 17%. DeepSeek says Janus-Pro-7B is better than many prominent models Some AI enthusiasts concur with the startup that the latest model is better than many models on some benchmarks. An AI observer Rowan Cheung indicated that the new model outperforms competitors OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion on some benchmarks like GenEval and DPG-Bench. The Chinese startup also claimed the superiority of its model in a technical report on Monday. DeepSeek said its model outclassed rivals from OpenAI and Stability AI on rankings for image generation using text prompts. According to Disclose.tv , the benchmarks highlight Janus-Pro-7B’s competitive advantage, which has potential to influence future AI research. This comes as the industry is observing developments taking place in China and how other global firms will react to this advancement and the intensified competition ahead. Apart from R1, another development from the Chinese AI startup that has disrupted the tech industry, the release of Janus-Pro-7B comes as the sector is fast evolving with tech firms from all over the globe are innovating to release new products and services and stay ahead of competition. Janus-Pro-7B is capable of generating images making it competitive on the market. In their technical report, DeepSeek AI revealed that Janus-Pro-7B boasts 7 billion parameters, coupled with improved training speed and accuracy in image generation from text prompts. According to Cheung’s observations, DeepSeek AI’s new model could break new barriers to AI performance. The GenEval and DPG-Bench perpetuated by Investing.com and mentioned by Cheung are important in evaluating how effective and versatile AI models are. To outperform in these benchmarks shows that DeepSeek’s new model has a competitive edge in tasks, influencing the paths of future research and development. Deepseek’s industry effect According to Reuters, the DeepSeek-V3 model has become a top-rated free app on Apple’s App Store in the US. Janus-Pro-7B is an upgrade on the previously created Janus released late last year.Janus had initially been a product of DeepSeek launching a new assistant based on the DeepSeek-V3 model. The release of Deepseek AI’s Janus-Pro-7B has had a cataclysmic impact on the sector, especially the financial performance of the markets. Share prices of numerous AI related stocks have dropped significantly in the last few hours as investors assessed the possible impact of the new and strong Chinese ChatGPT alternative. From Tokyo to New York, investors sold off several tech stocks due to fears that the emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI model would threaten the current dominance of AI leaders like Nvidia. Nvidia was on track to lose as much $600 billion in market value, becoming the biggest ever single-day loss on Wall Street. “If it’s true that DeepSeek is the proverbial ‘better mousetrap,’ that could disrupt the entire AI narrative that has helped drive the markets over the last two years,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. “It could mean less demand for chips, less need for a massive build-out of power production to fuel the models, and less need for large-scale data centers. However, it could also mean that AI becomes more accessible and help kickstart the development of a wide array of useful applications.” Jacobsen. According to Invest.com, the immediate investor reaction shows the sensitivity of tech stocks to innovations and the high expectations for the role of AI in technology in the future. However, Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns almost one million Nvidia shares described the Monday selloff as an over-reaction.

Amidst this buzz, Cardano (ADA) is experiencing a slump, while many of its holders are shifting their focus to Remittix (RTX). This emerging project is rapidly gaining traction in the PayFi sector, drawing investors to its presale in droves. Designed to revolutionize international payments, Remittix aims to tackle financial inefficiencies with a platform that prioritizes ease, speed, and accessibility. What are the standout features of this groundbreaking PayFi solution, and what might the future hold for Cardano in 2025? Cardano (ADA) Experiences a Sudden Decline Cardano (ADA) kicked off 2025 on a high note, climbing from $0.86 to $1.13 in just 5 days. However, its success was short-lived as Cardano (ADA) plunged back to $0.88 on the 9th. After a few more fluctuations, Cardano (ADA) settled at $0.98, still above its December price, but the past week has witnessed a steep 7.22% drop. Additionally, Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume has decreased, currently at $588 million, which is relatively small compared to its hefty $34.6 billion market cap. Cardano's price forecast appears grim, but one advantage is the limited involvement of whales, reducing the likelihood of massive sell-offs compared to other cryptocurrencies. Remittix Revolutionizes Global Payment Systems Remittix is tackling one of the major challenges in finance today: inefficiency. Cross-border transactions are often outdated, burdened with high fees, long processing times, and hidden costs that frustrate users. Remittix provides a contemporary solution by enabling users to seamlessly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send funds to any worldwide bank account, effectively removing these obstacles. Traders can take advantage of Remittix’s exceptional flexibility. Imagine cashing out your profits in fiat instantly, bypassing intermediaries. Remittix streamlines currency exchanges, ensuring quick and dependable transactions. This platform also presents significant benefits for businesses. The Remittix Pay API allows companies to accept cryptocurrency payments while finalizing transactions in fiat. This feature creates new payment avenues for freelancers, online retailers, and service providers without requiring them to grasp the complexities of cryptocurrencies. Remittix (RTX) offers a wide range of fiat and crypto pairs, providing high flexibility for both businesses and individuals. The platform supports 30 fiat currencies and over 50 cryptocurrency pairs, simplifying fund management. This versatility makes Remittix (RTX) an attractive option for companies operating across various regions.

Its innovative approach to addressing cross-border payment challenges and the broader PayFi landscape has led industry experts to predict a 800% price increase by the end of its presale and a potential 5,000% surge after launch.

Among the excitement, Cardano (ADA) is facing downturns while many holders are eyeing up Remittix (RTX), a new project that is quickly becoming a top contender in the PayFi space, with investors flocking in to the presale left, right, and center. Engineered to transform cross-border payments, Remittix is setting out to address real-world financial inefficiencies with a platform that combines simplicity, speed, and accessibility. So what are the key features of this revolutionary PayFi solution and how might Cardano fare in 2025? Cardano (ADA) Posts Sharp Dip Cardano (ADA) started off 2025 strong, rallying from $0.86 to $1.13 within the space of 5 days, though its fortune didn’t last long as Cardano (ADA) then dropped dramatically on the 9th, back down to $0.88. A couple of fluctuations later, Cardano (ADA) has ended up at the $0.98 mark, still representing an increase on its December price, though the last week has seen a sharp 7.22% dip. Cardano’s 24 hour trading volume has also taken a hit, now sitting at $588 million, which is minimal relative to Cardano’s sizable $34.6 billion market cap. Cardano’s current price trajectory looks bleak, though one thing the asset has going for it is that very few whales are involved with Cardano, so large sell offs are typically less explosive than with other cryptos. Remittix Changes the Game for Global Payments Remittix is addressing one of the biggest problems in finance today: inefficiency. Cross-border transactions tend to be terribly outdated. Typical systems charge high fees, have long processing times, and frustrate users with hidden costs. Remittix offers a modern alternative. By allowing users to seamlessly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and transfer funds to any global bank account, Remittix eliminates these pain points. Traders stand to benefit from Remittix’s unparalleled flexibility. Imagine being able to cash out your profits in fiat instantly without the need for intermediaries. Remittix simplifies the process of swapping currencies, ensuring speed and reliability at all times. The platform also offers a strong value proposition for businesses. The Remittix Pay API allows companies to accept cryptocurrency payments while settling transactions in fiat. For freelancers, online stores, and service providers, this functionality opens up new payment options without requiring them to understand the complexities of cryptocurrencies. Remittix (RTX) offers a broad selection of fiat and crypto pairs to offer high levels of flexibility for businesses and individuals. In total, there are 30 fiat currencies supported and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs available, making managing funds easy. This adaptability has made Remittix (RTX) an appealing tool for companies operating across multiple regions. Security and privacy are becoming top concerns in today’s financial landscape, and Remittix excels in both areas. Recipients of payments via Remittix receive funds as standard bank transfers, with no indication that the transaction originated in cryptocurrency. This mechanism ensures that platform users can benefit from blockchain technology without compromising on discretion. Proactive Investors Flock To The Remittix Presale Currently priced at $0.0350, $RTX has raised over $8 million in its ICO and shows no sign of losing momentum any time soon. Its modern approach to issues in the cross-border payments space and PayFi in general has led industry analysts to anticipate an 800% price upshot by the end of the presale and a potential 5,000% rally post-launch.

Each one has a loyal community and fresh ideas. While Bonk is a newer meme coin, Dogecoin carries meme fame, and Remittix aims to solve real financial problems. Below, we explore how Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) might perform by the end of January—and why many think Remittix could surpass them all. Bonk’s Outlook Over the past day, Bonk is down -3.17%, with a -13.76% drop over the week. Despite these dips, some fans still view Bonk (BONK) as a fun meme coin with unique community events—like recent burns meant to boost scarcity. Yet meme coins often rely on hype, so people wanting a viral altcoin price prediction might be cautious. Others note that new tokens can surprise everyone if they find a lasting use case. Even though Bonk has a strong online following, critics point out it lacks major partnerships or serious adoption. If it wants to stay among the best altcoins for 2025, it must show real progress soon. Meanwhile, new practical coins like Remittix (RTX) might lure traders away. Some also compare Bonk (BONK) with established meme tokens, raising questions about how long the project can keep attention. Dogecoin’s Potential Some still champion Dogecoin, which is down -1.21% today, -11.32% this week, but up +12.92% for the month. While Dogecoin (DOGE) holds a top spot among meme coins, people wonder if upcoming ETF possibilities could spark another rally. Others look for a viral altcoin price prediction that goes beyond memes, prompting them to explore more functional tokens. Devoted holders say Dogecoin might see higher demand if more businesses and influencers push for adoption. Even so, meme coins can’t rely on hype forever. If investors want coins that fix real issues, Remittix (RTX) looks more appealing. Some watchers think Dogecoin (DOGE) will keep a loyal fan base, but its main draw remains the meme factor, which might not satisfy serious use cases. Remittix: The Real Outperformer Over the last few weeks, Remittix soared about +142%, drawing attention from traders who focus on practical solutions. Supporters highlight how Remittix (RTX) cuts cross-border fees, offering rapid money transfers. Because it handles real problems, many see it as the strongest contender among the best altcoins for 2025. In contrast to meme coins, Remittix delivers an everyday purpose that could sustain growth long after the hype dies down. While Bonk and Dogecoin chase internet fame, Remittix (RTX) aims for global adoption. Some call it a prime example of a viral altcoin price prediction that isn’t tied to short-lived trends. By providing near-instant conversions to fiat, Remittix could capture users who want more than memes. That’s why experts say Remittix stands poised to outperform both Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in the months ahead. Conclusion All three tokens—Bonk, Dogecoin, and Remittix—have drawn attention for January 2025. Bonk (BONK) tries to build a meme-based community, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains an iconic meme coin, and Remittix(RTX) tackles real-world money transfers. Yet many believe Remittix leads the pack among the best altcoins for 2025, thanks to its practical use and rapid adoption. If real-world utility matters most, Remittix may claim the spotlight.

Each boasts a dedicated community and innovative ideas. While Bonk is a newer meme coin, Dogecoin has meme recognition, and Remittix seeks to tackle genuine financial issues. Let's delve into how Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) could fare by the end of January—and why many anticipate that Remittix may outpace them all. Forecast for Bonk In the past 24 hours, Bonk has dropped by -3.17%, and it has seen a -13.76% decline over the week. Despite these setbacks, some enthusiasts still see Bonk (BONK) as an entertaining meme coin with distinctive community activities—such as recent burns intended to increase scarcity. However, meme coins often depend on hype, so those seeking a viral altcoin price prediction might approach with caution. Others point out that new tokens can surprise everyone if they establish a lasting utility. Even though Bonk enjoys a strong online following, critics note its lack of significant partnerships or widespread adoption. To maintain its status among the top altcoins for 2025, it needs to demonstrate real progress soon. Meanwhile, new practical tokens like Remittix (RTX) could attract traders away. Comparisons between Bonk (BONK) and established meme tokens also raise questions about the project's ability to sustain interest. Dogecoin’s Future Prospects Some continue to support Dogecoin, which is down -1.21% today, -11.32% for the week, but has risen +12.92% over the month. While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a leading meme coin, there's speculation about whether potential ETF developments could trigger another surge. Others are looking for a viral altcoin price prediction that extends beyond memes, prompting them to consider more functional tokens. Loyal supporters believe Dogecoin could see increased demand if more companies and influencers advocate for its adoption. Nonetheless, meme coins can't rely on hype indefinitely. For investors seeking tokens that address real issues, Remittix (RTX) appears more attractive. Some observers think Dogecoin (DOGE) will maintain a dedicated fan base, but its primary appeal remains the meme factor, which might not satisfy those looking for serious applications. Remittix: The Genuine Standout Recently, Remittix has surged by approximately +142%, capturing the interest of traders who prioritize practical solutions. Advocates emphasize how Remittix (RTX) reduces cross-border fees, providing fast money transfers. Since it addresses real-world issues, many view it as the strongest candidate among the best altcoins for 2025. Unlike meme coins, Remittix offers a day-to-day purpose that could sustain growth long after the hype fades. While Bonk and Dogecoin chase online popularity, Remittix (RTX) is aiming for worldwide adoption. Some consider it a prime example of a viral altcoin price prediction that isn't tied to fleeting trends. By offering near-instant conversions to fiat, Remittix has the potential to attract users seeking more than just memes. That's why experts predict Remittix is set to outperform both Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in the upcoming months. Conclusion All three tokens—Bonk, Dogecoin, and Remittix—have captured attention for January 2025. Bonk (BONK) aims to establish a meme-based community, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues as a classic meme coin, and Remittix (RTX) addresses real-world money transfers. Yet, many believe Remittix is leading the charge among the best altcoins for 2025, due to its practical application and swift adoption. If real-world utility is the priority, Remittix might take the spotlight.

The sell-off was caused by Chinese AI company DeepSeek, who shattered confidence in the competitiveness of US tech companies. Nvidia’s shares plummeted to levels not seen since October, dragging the broader tech market down with it. The crash hit other major players hard too. Micron and Arm Holdings dropped over 11% and 10%, respectively, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom took severe hits of 6% and 17%. Power infrastructure companies tied to AI, like Constellation Energy and Vistra, faced staggering losses of 20% and 28%, respectively. European chip giants ASML and ASM International saw sharp declines during trading hours, while in Asia, Japanese chipmakers like Advantest and Tokyo Electron also reported massive losses. In late December, DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model and claimed it built the model in just two months on a $6 million budget, a figure that dwarfs the multi-billion-dollar investments typically required for similar projects in the West. Also, the company rolled out a reasoning model last week that third-party tests say outperformed OpenAI’s most recent offerings. Nvidia praises DeepSeek Nvidia addressed the situation early on in the day. A CNBC report claims the company said, “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. Their work shows how new models can be created using widely available models and export-compliant compute. Inference still requires a significant number of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking.” They added that DeepSeek’s models prove new scaling laws for AI—pre-training, post-training, and now test-time scaling. Meanwhile, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz and an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, called DeepSeek’s breakthrough “one of the most amazing and impressive advancements I’ve ever seen” in a social media post. But while investors panicked over Monday’s sell-off, Wall Street analysts are raising broader concerns about US leadership in AI. Citi analysts said DeepSeek’s success shows how the cost of computing has become a major barrier in the industry. They added that US companies still dominate the high-end AI chip market, but the emergence of cost-efficient alternatives like DeepSeek’s models could challenge that dominance. The $500 billion Stargate AI project was announced last week, and Citi analysts believe the project demonstrates how the need for top-tier GPUs, like those manufactured by Nvidia, will persist regardless of any competition. Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts questioned DeepSeek’s claims that it developed its models for under $6 million. They suggested that figure might not include prior research and experiments. In a research note, the analysts called DeepSeek’s tools “fantastic” but warned against labeling them as miracles. They described fears of a collapse in the AI infrastructure market as “overblown.” JPMorgan Chase added to the debate. “Investors are concerned that rather than impede China’s progress in AI, US restrictions have pushed Chinese companies to innovate faster and more efficiently,” they wrote. The immediate impact of DeepSeek’s announcement is clear: a massive reevaluation of the AI sector’s biggest players. Nvidia, which trades at a premium 32 times its next 12 months’ earnings, saw its valuation come under scrutiny as its shares plunged.

Solana Has Seen A Crash Over The Last 24 Hours The cryptocurrency sector as a whole has plummeted during the past day, with Solana not being spared as its price has also gone through a notable decline. Below is a chart that shows how SOL’s recent performance has looked. From the graph, it’s visible that Solana has suffered a steep plunge of almost 12% in this period, which is worse than many other top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, has seen a decline of around 5%. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $181,000? Mayer Multiple Reveals When BTC Will Become ‘Overbought’ Following this crash, Solana is now back at the $227 level. The asset has seemingly paused its fall for now, but it’s possible that it would resume soon. SOL Has Breached Under Its Symmetrical Triangle In a post on X earlier in the day, analyst Ali Martinez discussed about a Symmetrical Triangle that Solana had been trading inside. The “Symmetrical Triangle” here is a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that forms when the price of an asset consolidates between two trendlines of a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the triangle connects together lower highs in the price, while the lower level joins higher lows. As the asset travels inside the pattern, its range gradually converges on the midpoint line. Like other TA patterns, the upper level of this pattern is likely to provide resistance to the asset. Similarly, the lower line can help the cryptocurrency to reach a bottom. A break out of either of the trendlines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, a break above the triangle is a bullish signal, while a fall under it can lead to a bearish outcome. The Symmetrical Triangle is just one possible type of triangular-shaped formation that an asset can display. Two other popular ones are the Ascending and Descending Triangles, which occur when one of the trendlines is parallel to the time-axis (the upper one in the case of the former and the lower one for the latter). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that the 1-hour price of Solana had been stuck inside over the past week: From the graph, it’s visible that Solana was approaching the apex of the triangle when Martinez had made the post. As the consolidation becomes narrower, a breakout can become more probable to occur, which appears to be just what has happened with SOL in the hours since. The height of this triangle was equal to a swing of around 20%. Usually, Symmetrical Triangle breakouts are of the same degree as the height of the pattern, so the analyst had noted that SOL could be primed for a 20% move.

Beyond the humor and quirky branding, these tokens now offer tangible opportunities for growth. Crypto projects that include bonus incentives have become a go-to choice for savvy investors. Why? Because who doesn’t love doubling their chances at massive returns? Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu initially led the charge, showcasing the sheer power of community-driven movements. Now, newer players like BTFD Coin (BTFD) are taking the spotlight with innovative features, including staking, play-to-earn (P2E) games, and exclusive referral programs. Add bonus codes like LAUNCH100, and you’ve got a recipe for a frenzy in the crypto market. With established tokens like Floki Inu (FLOKI) and rising stars such as Brett (BRETT) joining the game, the meme coin universe is more exciting than ever. But BTFD is set to shake things up even further with its aggressive presale performance and creative rewards. Let’s dive into why this coin—and a few others—might just make your investment portfolio pop. BTFD Coin: The Ultimate Game-Changer in Meme Coins BTFD Coin has raised over $5.7M in its presale, crossing the halfway mark of its journey within the first two weeks.

BTFD offers an innovative referral program, rewarding users for bringing in new investors. It’s simple: share your unique referral link, and when someone invests, you earn rewards in tokens. It’s a win-win for everyone involved, making BTFD a community-first project. The Bulls Squad initiative adds a creative twist.

That nets you 218,750,000 tokens. When BTFD hits $0.0006 post-presale, your holdings would skyrocket to a value of $131,250—a potential profit of $96,250.

The FlokiFi Locker allows projects to secure their liquidity, building trust with investors. The Valhalla game is another hit, where players can earn FLOKI tokens in an engaging, virtual environment.

Its innovative ecosystem and loyal community have ensured its place in the top tier of meme cryptos. BRETT: A Rising Star with Community Backing BRETT is the underdog story every investor loves. With a strong focus on community engagement, BRETT has rapidly gained traction as a meme coin with heart. Built on a decentralized framework, it prioritizes transparency and user involvement in decision-making. One standout feature is BRETT’s deflationary mechanism. With every transaction, a small percentage of tokens are burned, reducing supply and increasing demand. This unique approach has helped stabilize its value and attract long-term investors. The coin also has a creative side. BRETT supports independent artists and meme creators, hosting contests and funding projects that highlight its quirky charm. This strategy has turned casual fans into active participants, growing its loyal user base. BRETT isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a cultural movement. Its dedication to transparency, creativity, and community engagement ensures it remains a standout pick for 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe Coin holders are turning their focus to Elluminex, a promising new viral coin. Table of Contents Pepe saw spectacular growth Elluminex could be the next 100x token Last year saw several crypto assets achieve spectacular growth. The latest bull market only compounded these gains, leaving traders hungry for more. Pepe was among these tokens, increasing over 30,000% in the last few years. Still, Pepe is currently among the biggest memecoins, but its potential upside is limited. Traders looking for similar gains should look for new projects. One of the most promising ones is Elluminex (ELX), a DeFi token promising to transform the TON ecosystem. Pepe saw spectacular growth Pepe is currently one of the dominant memecoins, maintaining the fourth position among all memecoins. The token used to be the third largest memecoin before the sudden rise of the Official Trump token. This development has rocked investors, and Pepe has seen significant volatility. Last week, Pepe dropped 16.71%, to its current price of $0.00001542. Still, this was after a year of strong growth, and Pepe is still up 1420.30% from the same time last year. Still, recent on-chain data shows large whale activity. For instance, the “0x8f5″ address withdrew 280 billion Pepe from Binance, worth around $5 million. This indicates that the whale is gearing for significant moves, which will likely increase volatility. Technical indicators show mixed signals for Pepe. While the weekly oscillators are mostly bearish, moving averages are mixed. Notably, short-term moving averages point to sell, indicating slowing momentum for Pepe. You might also like: Crypto analyst Ali says DOGE could go to $15, new altcoin to boost Toncoin Elluminex could be the next 100x token While Pepe has seen significant growth, Elluminex is just starting out. Elluminex is a DeFi hub for TON, currently the fastest-growing chain. Its strong fundamentals give it the potential to replicate some of the largest bull runs. Last year, TON’s ecosystem showed significant growth. For one, the number of wallet addresses on the network grew by 3380%. Moreover, network TVL increased 8x, to a high of $740 million. Driving this increase in activity was its Telegram integration, through engaging games such as Notcoin. Despite its strong metrics, TON’s DeFi ecosystem is still in its infancy. For that reason, traders are betting that the Elluminex could change the narrative. Its network of cross-chain bridges will connect TON to 40 major blockchains. This will bring in much-needed liquidity, helping stabilize asset prices and boost confidence in the network. Cross chain bridges also enable Elluminex to offer trading with low slippage, which is crucial for making profit. This is why the platform has the potential to attract more traders to TON. The potential effect of this is hard to overstate. For instance, when Uniswap launched on Ethereum, it helped increase ETH’s price from $200 to $1,000 in a single year. Elluminex also offers advanced trading features, including an AI Portfolio tracker. This tool will give actionable insights based on real-time data. This feature will help level the playing field for traders, making trading more accessible than ever. Thanks to its advanced features, Elluminex has the potential to become a premier DeFi hub on TON. This position’s it for significant growth in 2025. To learn more about Elluminex, visit the website , Twitter , and Telegram .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Wall Street Pepe smashes $61 million presale milestone, cementing its status and aiming for more gains. Table of Contents Wall Street Pepe: The retail-driven change in crypto Why Wall Street Pepe is generating massive demand Presale nearing its end Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) continues to captivate the crypto world, surpassing its $60 million fundraising goal and achieving $61.4 million in ICO. The project has garnered $7.4 million in the past six days alone, bringing the total raised since the presale end-date announcement on January 17 to $11.4 million. This momentum solidifies Wall Street Pepe as one of 2025’s hottest presales, setting new benchmarks for meme coins and signaling potential whale involvement. The recent explosive launches of TRUMP and MELANIA showed the market’s appetite for meme coins, but Wall Street Pepe takes a different approach. Unlike these projects, which faced criticism for centralized control over token supply, WEPE is built on a foundation of community-driven tokenomics. The project ensures fairness by distributing the supply widely among its community, preventing large-scale control by founders and aligning with its mission of empowering investors of all sizes. Wall Street Pepe’s structure not only fosters trust but also positions it as a project built to deliver long-term value for its supporters, making it a standout in the competitive meme coin space. With WEPE tokens currently priced at $0.0003665, early investors still have a chance to join before all tokens are sold out. $60M raised. Focused. Energized. Moist. 🐸⚔️ pic.twitter.com/Siqf6zqVKM — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 26, 2025 Wall Street Pepe: The retail-driven change in crypto Wall Street Pepe has captured the attention of both retail investors and whales, creating a unique ecosystem where traders of all sizes can thrive. With significant whale activity driving momentum alongside strong retail support, WEPE has positioned itself as a standout project in the meme coin space. Unlike other meme coins, WEPE combines the power of large transactions with a vibrant community of smaller traders, fostering a dynamic and inclusive environment. This balance between retail investors and whales underscores Wall Street Pepe’s broad appeal and growing influence in the market. More than just a meme coin, Wall Street Pepe functions as a private trading group designed to empower everyday investors. Members benefit from shared strategies, curated market insights, and actionable trading signals, enabling them to compete effectively against whales. Just recently, Altcoin Daily noted that major financial institutions engage in market manipulation. However, Wall Street Pepe’s community-driven mission offers retail investors the tools to challenge these trends. By uniting smaller traders, WEPE has created a space for collective impact, allowing retail investors to navigate the market with confidence. WEPE stands out in the meme coin space by combining its lighthearted Pepe the Frog aesthetic with practical tools and a mission to challenge traditional financial powerhouses. Token holders unlock exclusive perks, including access to high-probability trades, top meme coin opportunities, and a dynamic community space aimed at collaborative success. You might also like: Pepe coin price crashes as risky patterns slowly develop Why Wall Street Pepe is generating massive demand Wall Street Pepe’s meteoric rise can be attributed to several key factors, which crypto influencer ClayBro outlined in a recent analysis. With over $61 million raised at a pace of around $100,000 per hour, the project has captured widespread attention, demonstrating strong presale momentum. While whales seem to be jumping on board, smaller investors remain at the heart of the project, creating a unique balance of inclusivity and high demand, the expert said. ClayBro added that the token stands out for its transformative features, offering staking rewards of up to 21% APY, curated crypto insights, and tools designed to help investors navigate the rapidly evolving market. He said he is bullish on WEPE’s future, forecasting a price of $0.13 by the end of 2025, with potential peaks during market rallies. Pro-crypto policies and increasing institutional adoption may further fuel long-term growth. Additionally, the project’s focus on empowering smaller traders aligns with a growing demand for fairer market participation, reinforcing its mission. Wall Street Pepe’s approach has positioned it as a transformative force in the crypto space, making it far more than just another meme coin. Presale nearing its end With a maximum allocation of 146 billion WEPE tokens (73% of the total supply), the window to secure tokens at the presale price is closing. The overwhelming demand suggests tokens may sell out before the official presale end date. To join this movement, visit the Wall Street Pepe website and connect a wallet, such as Best Wallet, a leading Web3 solution offering multichain support and easy access to promising investments. The app, available on Google Play or the Apple App Store, simplifies the process of purchasing WEPE directly. For more information on Wall Street Pepe, visit their website , X , or Telegram .

Pseudonymous trader Pentoshi tells his 847,800 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the Ethereum ( ETH )-based automated staking service Lido DAO ( LDO ) is gearing up for a steep move up. The analyst believes that traders will enter long positions on LDO amid speculations that US regulators will approve the staking of ETH held in spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “LDO Probably violent repricing when the filings come in the next couple of weeks… If you believe ETH staking will be approved, then LDO is likely a great bet. So far, the price seems to be appreciating rapidly and has begun to start to price this in.” Source: Pentoshi/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to be targeting $3.612 for LDO. At time of writing, LDO is worth $1.95 Another altcoin on the trader’s radar is Ondo Finance ( ONDO ), a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that aims to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs). Pentoshi says the ONDO Summit 2025 slated for February 6th could fuel short-term rallies for the crypto asset. “ONDO summit coming up in [10 days]. BlackRock’s chief investment officer will be speaking and they have many connections there that will likely lead to some speculation short-term. Price could potentially move up leading into the event followed by a sell-off on whatever news it may be. Might be a good short-term play. One-12 days.” The trader also highlights that he plans to unload his ONDO stack just before the event. At time of writing, ONDO is worth $1.29.

Musk Fuks Robots (MUSKROBO), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Fuks Robots can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Robots could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Robots launched with over $40,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Robots on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Robots by entering its contract address (CA) – 9yuANCwHs443YpCDnUr2GfSkDSTxUweQL1m2vMaYnTT5 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 01:11:00

This is partly because the performance of ADA stands as both an indicator of general market performance and a standard for innovative blockchain technologies. Present technical analysis shows warnings of a downward movement in Cardano (ADA) price. Bearish indicators predict a major price adjustment. While Cardano navigates uncertainty, 1Fuel (OFT) is capturing attention in DeFi. With its innovative privacy-focused wallet and ongoing presale, 1Fuel generates considerable buzz. Investors are asking whether 1Fuel could be the latest breakthrough in decentralized finance. Can Cardano (ADA) Reclaim the $3.00 Mark? Cardano maintains its leading position among altcoins because technological advances continue unabated with expanding decentralized finance integration. ADA is trading at $0.88 on January 27, 2025. The market capitalization of Cardano stands at $31 billion . Investors hope to see Cardano reclaim its peak price level of $3.00 sooner rather than later. Though the blockchain’s native token, ADA, took a 10% price dip over the last 24 hours, Cardano is still one of the leading players in the crypto space. Analysts are bullish, particularly with the upcoming Plomin hard fork, an upgrade designed to increase decentralization and refine on-chain governance. Despite existing challenges, the long-term outlook for Cardano remains strong and positive. ADA stands a good chance to recover if it maintains its position above $0.807 as it exhibits a bullish pennant formation on the weekly chart. However, some investors have started looking for alternatives since Cardano’s research-driven development strategy could mean limited growth potential. Although the project has stable long-term prospects, its incrementally slow growth greatly contrasts with the high potential offered by projects like 1Fuel. 1Fuel has captivated attention with rapid, high-yielding potential. Is 1Fuel The Next Big Thing in The $120 Billion DeFi Industry? A new crypto wallet is on the horizon with sights on disrupting the DeFi space. According to CoinGecko, decentralized finance is worth over $120 billion and 1Fuel aims to provide solutions for cross-chain transaction obstacles that DeFi users face. Cross-chain transactions, at the moment, pose unique difficulties for traders because of their complexity. Users are exposed to risks of funds loss while shuffling between wallets. Security remains the highest priority for 1Fuel’s development team. The privacy technology in the project allows all users to keep their financial activities anonymous. This DeFi gem also features military-grade cold storage where users can store their digital assets offline. With this, the assets are unreachable by hacks and breaches while accessible to the user. Users can also use disposable wallets which can be discarded when no longer needed. These security features provide maximum transaction protection, making 1Fuel the top choice for privacy-focused investors. This new wallet leverages AI to give its users an edge in the market.

It’s an exciting time to be a part of this convergence, as innovative platforms are emerging that are redefining how we buy and sell online. Web3Bay, a blockchain-powered marketplace, is leading the charge with its groundbreaking approach and a presale that’s attracting massive attention. But it’s not just startups that are making waves; established e-commerce giants like Mercari are also embracing the crypto revolution, with their own crypto exchange seeing a surge in user activity. This article explores the remarkable achievements of Web3Bay and how it’s shaping the future of online shopping, while also examining the broader trend of cryptocurrency adoption in the e-commerce sector. Web3Bay: A Presale Success Story Web3Bay (3BAY) is not just another player in the e-commerce space; it’s a pioneer that’s shaping the future of online shopping. With its secure and transparent platform, innovative use of blockchain technology, and commitment to user empowerment, Web3Bay is poised to become a leader in the decentralized e-commerce revolution. In just a couple weeks of presale, the platform has successfully raised over $930,000, underscoring significant investor enthusiasm. The presale coin price of $0.004562625 in stage 4, which has attracted considerable buying interest, reflects the confidence investors have in the potential of this platform. This robust participation in the early stages of the presale highlights the growing trend toward integrating blockchain into e-commerce platforms, where it can offer enhanced transparency, security, and efficiency. Web3Bay’s commitment to decentralization empowers users by giving them more control over their data and transactions, unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that often operate as centralized gatekeepers. Web3Bay’s platform aims to redefine the traditional e-commerce business model by utilizing blockchain to ensure secure and transparent transactions. It offers users the ability to conduct transactions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries, reducing fees and increasing speed. Moreover, by incorporating smart contracts, Web3Bay guarantees that all parties adhere to agreed terms before any transaction is completed, thereby mitigating fraud and enhancing user trust. Mercari: Japanese E-commerce Platform Embraces Crypto The growing convergence of e-commerce and cryptocurrency is not limited to startups like Web3Bay. Established e-commerce giants are also recognizing the potential of blockchain technology. Mercari, a well-known Japanese e-commerce platform, has recently expanded into the cryptocurrency space with its own crypto exchange. This strategic move has yielded impressive results, with Mercari reporting a ninefold increase in user activity on its crypto exchange. This surge in popularity underscores the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and valuable component of the e-commerce landscape. Mercari’s foray into the crypto world is a testament to the increasing integration of blockchain technology and digital currencies into mainstream businesses. By offering users the ability to buy, sell, and trade crypto assets, Mercari is not only diversifying its services but also catering to the growing demographic of crypto-savvy consumers. A Quick Recap The success stories of Web3Bay and Mercari illustrate a significant shift in the e-commerce landscape. Blockchain offers solutions to many challenges that have plagued traditional e-commerce platforms, such as payment security, product authenticity, and transaction efficiency. By leveraging blockchain’s inherent transparency and security, platforms like Web3Bay are creating a more trustworthy and efficient online shopping experience. Looking ahead, the synergy between e-commerce and cryptocurrencies is expected to strengthen, driven by consumer demand for greater security, transparency, and global accessibility. Web3Bay’s blockchain-powered marketplace and Mercari’s successful crypto exchange are just the beginning of this exciting evolution.

Stellar Coin is making strides in the global payment systems by enabling swift and economical international transactions, currently valued at $0.08. On the other hand, the Cardano price is causing a stir among investors, with forecasts suggesting a potential increase to $7, supported by its robust technical infrastructure and consistent growth pattern. BlockDAG captures significant attention with a successful $185 million presale. Offering the LAUNCH300 bonus, which triples BDAG holdings instantly, BlockDAG stands out at a price of $0.0248 and a projected 3932% return by 2025, marking it as one of the best cryptos to buy now for explosive growth. Stellar Coin: Transforming International Payments Stellar is revolutionizing the approach to international transactions by providing a rapid, efficient, and low-cost method for global transfers. Its open-source network links financial entities, payment gateways, and individuals, thereby establishing itself as an essential instrument for remittances and international dealings. With a current valuation near $0.08, Stellar Coin is gaining the interest of leading banks and fintech firms. This growing interest is driven by Stellar Coin’s effective applications in digital finance. Despite the presence of competitors focusing on payment solutions, Stellar’s ability to address financial hurdles renders it a solid investment for those looking for practical and operational investment options. Cardano Price Trajectory: Anticipating a Surge to $7 While Cardano’s price has shown stability, the outlook from industry specialists remains favorable for its future. Predictions suggest ADA might rise to $7 soon, presenting an attractive option for investors interested in cryptocurrencies with solid foundations. Famed analyst Big Mike notes that according to the Elliott Wave theory, ADA could escalate to $3 in its third phase before a slight retreat to $1.5 and an eventual climb to $7. These cycles are expected to unfold gradually, starting from May 2023 and extending potentially through April 2024. Technically, ADA has shown promising signs, climbing from $0.28 to $1.33 last year and now testing a support level at $0.81. If this holds and a bullish pennant forms, Cardano’s price could revisit $3, setting the stage for considerable growth. Amplify Your Crypto Portfolio with BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 promotion delivers an exceptional 300% bonus on each BDAG purchase, effectively tripling your holdings instantly. This opportunity provides a strategic advantage for those looking to enhance their position in the cryptocurrency market. Currently, BlockDAG’s presale has successfully raised $185 million, attracting attention from key players in the industry and moving closer to its goal of $600 million. This momentum is building confidence among buyers. Experts predict that BDAG’s price could reach $1 by 2025, which, from its current price of $0.0248, could yield a return of 3932%. Those who secured early have already realized a 2380% ROI, highlighting BDAG’s potential as one of the best cryptos to buy now. The LAUNCH300 initiative not only increases your immediate holdings — for example, buying 1,000 BDAG now would instantly give you 4,000 coins — but also positions you to benefit from the upcoming price increases as the current batch nears its end. Now is an optimal time to buy for significant growth by 2025. Identifying the Best Cryptos to Buy Now For those looking for the best cryptos to buy now , Stellar Coin, Cardano, and BlockDAG offer lucrative opportunities. Stellar Coin, priced attractively at $0.08, continues to excel in facilitating international payments. Cardano remains a key interest for investors, with potential pricing reaching $7, supported by robust technical indicators and steady growth trajectories. BlockDAG distinguishes itself with its presale success and the LAUNCH300 bonus, providing threefold returns on BDAG purchases.

At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $101,000, following a 3.7% decline in the last 24 hours. This recent movement appears to have not only instilled hope in investors but has also caught the attention of analysts now closely monitoring on-chain data and short-term holder behavior to understand the asset’s next potential move and the critical levels to watch. Related Reading: Crypto Experts Forecast Bitcoin Market Peak: Bear Market Could Emerge Within 3 Months Key Support level for Bitcoin Yonsei Dent, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake Platform, has highlighted key metrics indicating that short-term holders (STH) may play a pivotal role in defining Bitcoin’s immediate support levels. In his latest analysis, Dent identified $89,900 as a critical support level for holders who have held BTC for one week to six months. He noted that most short-term holders remain in profit, which reduces the likelihood of a sudden wave of selling pressure. However, Dent also acknowledged that holders in the three-to-six-month range are at a loss, though their limited market share—9.4% of the Realized Cap—minimizes their potential to disrupt broader market dynamics. Dent’s findings also indicate that the $89,900 level serves as both a technical and on-chain support zone. As market volatility continues to compress, this support level gains importance. Any breach or bounce from this range is likely to draw significant attention from traders and analysts. The data suggests that short-term pullbacks may not trigger widespread panic selling, keeping the market relatively stable around this price mark. With Volatility Highly Compressed, Where is the Key STH Support Level? “This suggests that $89.9k could be a stable support zone, even amid short-term pullbacks.” – By @Yonsei_dent Link 👇https://t.co/4ayRJBQlWe pic.twitter.com/iNlBMriS78 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 27, 2025 Major Players Refuse To Sell Their BTC Holdings Meanwhile, another CryptoQuant analyst, Grizzly, provided additional insight into the behavior of long-term and short-term holders. According to Grizzly, the SOPR ratio—measuring the profit ratio between long-term and short-term holders—has not risen as sharply during the current bull run compared to previous cycles. This may indicate a shift in market behavior as Bitcoin matures. Grizzly pointed out that as more cycles occur, investors become less inclined to engage in speculative trading. Instead, they appear to adopt a more measured approach, treating Bitcoin as a long-term asset rather than a quick profit opportunity. Furthermore, Grizzly noted that institutional participation in Bitcoin has fundamentally “altered” market dynamics. With more capital flowing into Bitcoin portfolios rather than exchanges, there is a visible decrease in immediate selling pressure.

Filecoin is scaling its decentralized storage network to new heights, while Binance continues to dominate as the go-to trading platform for millions of users. But the star of the show is Qubetics, which has achieved a major milestone with its Stage 19 presale, attracting over 16,700 token holders at a price of $0.0606. With 448 million $TICS tokens already sold, Qubetics is proving why it’s the best crypto to buy this week. While Filecoin’s data storage innovations and Binance’s trading dominance are impressive, Qubetics is redefining the blockchain landscape with its real-world applications and game-changing technologies like its asset tokenization marketplace and TICSScan explorer. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics the frontrunner and explore how Filecoin and Binance are shaping the future of blockchain. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization At the core of Qubetics’ ecosystem is its real-world asset tokenization marketplace , a solution designed to bridge the gap between tangible assets and digital ownership. This platform allows businesses and individuals to tokenize assets such as real estate, art, or intellectual property, enabling fractional ownership and opening up new investment opportunities. Imagine a small business owner in Chicago who owns a commercial property but lacks the funds to expand. With Qubetics, they can tokenize the property into digital shares and sell them to investors worldwide, raising capital while retaining partial ownership. Similarly, an artist in Los Angeles can tokenize their artwork, giving fans the opportunity to invest in their creations. By democratizing access to traditionally exclusive markets, Qubetics empowers users from all walks of life. This level of inclusivity, combined with blockchain transparency and security, positions Qubetics as a game-changer in the crypto space and among the top 3 cryptos . TICSScan: Redefining Blockchain Transparency Qubetics’ TICSScan is another groundbreaking innovation, offering users unparalleled insight into the blockchain ecosystem. This explorer provides real-time data on transactions, token movements, and contract interactions, enabling investors and developers to make informed decisions. For instance, a crypto trader in Brazil can use TICSScan to monitor the flow of $TICS tokens across exchanges, optimizing their trading strategy. Developers can also leverage this tool to analyze smart contract performance, ensuring their projects run smoothly. By providing a clear window into blockchain activity, TICSScan enhances trust and accountability within the Qubetics ecosystem. Qubetics Presale: A Record-Breaking Opportunity Qubetics’ Stage 19 presale has attracted over 16,700 token holders, selling 448 million $TICS tokens at a price of $0.0606. Each presale stage lasts only seven days, with a 10% price hike every Sunday at midnight, creating a sense of urgency among investors. Now, let’s talk about ROI. A $1,000 investment at the current price would yield 16,487 tokens. If $TICS hits its projected $15 post-mainnet launch in Q2 2025, that investment could skyrocket to $247,305. It’s no wonder Qubetics is the best crypto to buy this week, combining innovative technology with impressive growth potential. Filecoin: Scaling Decentralized Data Storage Filecoin is making significant strides in the decentralized storage space, positioning itself as a critical player in blockchain infrastructure. According to recent updates, Filecoin’s network now supports over 18 exabytes of storage, enough to back up the entire internet several times over. This capability has attracted a growing number of developers and enterprises looking for secure, decentralized alternatives to traditional cloud storage. What sets Filecoin apart is its ability to incentivize users to share unused storage space. This model not only reduces costs but also promotes sustainability, making it an attractive option for businesses aiming to lower their carbon footprint. Analysts predict continued growth for Filecoin as demand for decentralized storage solutions rises across industries. Binance: Dominating the Crypto Trading Arena Binance remains the undisputed leader in crypto trading, boasting a daily trading volume exceeding $50 billion and a user base that spans over 180 countries. The platform’s ability to adapt to market changes and introduce innovative features, such as Binance Earn and Launchpad, keeps it at the forefront of the industry. Recent reports highlight Binance’s success in fostering ecosystem growth through its BNB Chain, which supports over 1,000 decentralized applications (dApps). By combining scalability, security, and low transaction fees, Binance continues to attract developers and users alike. Its global reach and robust infrastructure make it a cornerstone of the crypto market. The Final Word Filecoin’s data storage innovations and Binance’s trading ecosystem highlight their unique strengths, but neither matches the transformative potential of Qubetics. With its real-world asset tokenization marketplace, TICSScan transparency tool, and a presale that has already attracted over 16,700 holders, Qubetics is redefining blockchain innovation. It’s no surprise analysts are calling it one of the top 3 cryptos . Whether you’re an investor seeking high ROI or a business looking for blockchain solutions, Qubetics offers unmatched opportunities. Don’t miss your chance to join the Qubetics presale and be part of the next big thing in crypto. For more information, visit Qubetics, join their Telegram, or follow them on Twitter.

PayPal USD ( PYUSD ), a stablecoin issued on Solana and Ethereum chains, can now be accessible on Cardano ( ADA ) through Wanchain’s interoperability solution, according to a press release Wanchain shared with crypto.news. Wanchain chief executive Temujin Louie says the bridge will give users “more options, increased flexibility and control” while transferring assets across different chains. Cardano’s decentralized finance ecosystem with nearly $447 million in total value locked per data from DefiLlama, will open doors for “greater synergy between networks, fueling innovation and adoption, and ultimately driving the next wave of blockchain interoperability across ecosystems,” Louie added.

CHILLGUY’s Price Surge: A Warning and Opportunity CHILLGUY has recently experienced a remarkable 50% price surge, driven by viral meme culture, strategic exchange listings, and speculative investments. This sharp increase has captured significant attention, making it a hot topic among traders and investors alike. However, it’s important to remember that meme coins are notoriously volatile, with their value often tied to fleeting social media trends and market sentiment. While CHILLGUY’s growth is impressive, investors should exercise caution. Meme coins’ unpredictability makes them a risky investment, and it’s crucial to conduct thorough research and risk assessment before making any moves. As with all speculative assets, equally significant risks accompany the potential for substantial gains, and understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the market safely. Pudgy Penguins: The NFT Phenomenon That Took Off Pudgy Penguins have significantly impacted the NFT world with their charming designs and community-driven approach. Initially launched at just 0.03 ETH, these playful digital assets rapidly gained popularity, with some rare pieces selling for over 100 ETH. Their success was driven by a perfect combination of relatability, scarcity, and the organic social media buzz surrounding them, which made them highly desirable among collectors and investors. While early adopters reaped massive profits, later buyers faced steep barriers to entry, with prices rising sharply over time. Pudgy Penguins’ meteoric rise highlights the power of cultural appeal in the digital asset space. It demonstrates how the right mix of community engagement and scarcity can create significant demand, making it one of the standout success stories in the NFT market.

The open-source model was first released in December when the company said it took only two months and less than $6 million to create. The amount reported was noticeably far less than the hundreds of billions of dollars that tech giants such as OpenAI, Meta, and others have allegedly committed to developing their own models. Throughout the day, fears grew that China may be surpassing the US in the scale and efficiency of its AI investments. However, Trump’s Crypto Czar, David Sacks, has expressed confidence in the US’s ability to continue to lead in AI innovation. David Sacks comments on DeepSeek’s success In a response posted on X (formerly Twitter), Sacks, whose position in Trump’s administration involves shaping US policy on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, admitted that DeepSeek has shown the AI race will be competitive. He also praised the new president for rescinding the Biden EO, which he said “hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not)” Sacks is confident in the US, but he also thinks it can’t afford to be complacent in the race. There were mixed opinions to Sacks’ sentiment, but most seemed to agree that things will no longer be the same with DeepSeek around. As Crypto Czar, Sacks will play a role in creating a legal framework for the crypto industry and guide AI policy. DeepSeek’s success may provide the rationale to focus on minimal regulation to encourage innovation if he believes that is the only way to compete with China’s growing AI economy. How tech stocks reacted to China’s DeepSeek DeepSeek’s open-source model was released last year but its outstanding qualities did not become evident until this year, reaching viral popularly by the weekend. Since then, the app has become the top free app in the Apple App Store, pushing OpenAI’s ChatGPT into second place. The result was a sell-off of American tech stocks as worried investors seemed to have lost conviction. Nvidia was one of the biggest losers in the stock market slump as its shares plummeted as much as 18%, representing the biggest market value drop in US stock market history. The leading hardware company for AI lost nearly $600 billion in market value on Monday as tech stocks plunged. The Nasdaq Composite, which tracks the country’s largest tech firms, fell more than 3%. The Dow ended up nearly 300 points after falling earlier in the day, and the S&P 500 tumbled almost 1.5%. Nvidia said in a statement that “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement” and an example of what is possible, “leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” Other semiconductor companies that also saw major losses include Micron Technology and Arm Holdings, which both fell 10%. ASML also slid by 6%. Mega-cap tech firms also felt the ripple effect. Microsoft fell 2%, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, plummeted 4%. Meta Platforms, which is developing its own open-source AI model, also took a dump earlier in the day but ended higher by 1.9%. DeepSeek has tech giants in the US finally paying attention. Speaking at the World Economic Forum last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek’s advances and said, “We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the Select Committee on China, said “the US cannot allow CCP models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions. We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek’s AI infrastructure.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",AI|DeepSeek|OpenAI,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 02:53:01

While $TRUMP Coin has garnered massive attention thanks to its viral appeal and association with Donald Trump, Lightchain AI is quietly gaining traction among savvy investors looking for long-term growth. In this article, we’ll break down the stark differences between these two projects to help you decide which is the better investment. $TRUMP Coin – Riding the Meme Wave The $TRUMP Coin has taken the market by storm, leveraging Donald Trump’s polarizing persona and the popularity of meme coins. Much like Dogecoin or PEPE, its appeal lies in its humor, branding, and ability to generate hype. Early investors in $TRUMP Coin have seen impressive short-term gains, as the token’s value soared thanks to social media buzz and speculative trading. However, meme coins like $TRUMP are inherently volatile. Their value is driven almost entirely by community enthusiasm, making them highly susceptible to sharp price drops once the hype fades. Moreover, the lack of utility or real-world application limits their potential for long-term growth. For investors seeking a quick profit, $TRUMP Coin might be appealing, but it’s a risky bet without a solid foundation. Lightchain AI Project Built for the Future Unlike the hype-driven approach of $TRUMP Coin, Lightchain AI stands out as a project focused on real innovation and utility. Combining blockchain and artificial intelligence, it is building a transformative platform to address real-world challenges. Its emphasis on scalable, privacy-first technology sets it apart in the competitive crypto space. The presale has already garnered over $12.8 million, with tokens priced at $0.005625, reflecting strong confidence from early investors. Lightchain AI’s ability to attract such significant investment highlights its potential for long-term growth and adoption. In a market filled with speculation, Lightchain AI’s commitment to delivering impactful solutions makes it a promising leader in the new wave of blockchain technology. Investment Comparison – Hype vs. Utility Here’s how $TRUMP Coin and Lightchain AI stack up. Feature $TRUMP Coin Lightchain AI Main Appeal Meme-driven hype and branding Real-world applications and innovation Growth Potential Short-term price pumps Long-term, exponential growth Utility Minimal, hype-based High, with practical use cases Volatility Extremely high Relatively stable Entry Price Varies based on market hype $0.005625 (presale) While $TRUMP Coin might offer quick gains, Lightchain AI presents a balanced opportunity for investors seeking both growth and stability. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 03:00:00

Bitcoin’s price fell 3% to $101,400, with earlier lows reaching $97,750. The CoinDesk 20 index, which tracks a weighted average of various cryptocurrencies, recorded a 7% decline, reflecting the overall market’s cooling after reaching record highs earlier this month. Nasdaq Drops Over 3% As DeepSeek’s AI Advances Raise Concerns The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index also faced a downturn, dropping over 3%, influenced by concerns stemming from a Chinese startup, DeepSeek. The company recently announced the development of a competitive artificial intelligence model at a fraction of the cost of existing solutions, raising alarms about potential shifts in US dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Related Reading: Ready To Rocket? Dogecoin Chart Hints At Major Gains Ahead This news has sparked fears regarding Big Tech’s spending on artificial intelligence models and data centers, further exacerbating the sell-off in tech stocks in the United States market. In premarket trading, shares of major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and MicroStrategy fell about 2% each. Bitcoin mining companies took even larger hits; Core Scientific saw its shares plummet by 21%, while Terawulf and Iren (formerly Iris Energy) lost 16%. The correlation between the cryptocurrency market and the tech sector remains strong, as noted by Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, who pointed out that Bitcoin is currently more closely aligned with movements in the Nasdaq than with traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Long Liquidations Hit Bitcoin Traders The market’s volatility was further driven by significant liquidations among traders who had bet against a downturn. Over the past 24 hours, more than $250 million in long liquidations occurred, forcing leveraged traders to sell their Bitcoin holdings to cover losses. This wave of selling coincided with a mixed market reaction to President Donald Trump’s recent executive order on cryptocurrency, which had generated anticipation in the lead-up to its release but failed to meet all investor expectations. Many traders expressed disappointment that the executive order did not establish a dedicated stockpile of Bitcoin, a term that implies a more passive approach to holding assets, rather than an active strategy of regular purchases.

With the uncertainty surrounding the executive order now resolved, the market has shifted its focus to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, set to conclude on Wednesday. Market strategist Joel Kruger of LMAX noted that investors are nervously anticipating the Fed’ stance, hoping for a more accommodative approach while fearing that the central bank may not adopt the dovish tone the markets desire. Despite the recent price declines, Kruger reassured investors that the overall trend in Bitcoin remains positive, stating, “When we look at the Bitcoin chart, there is nothing bearish about the price action.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin chart|bitcoin nasdaq|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin signals|bitcoin technical analysis|btc|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|cryptocurrency|DeepSeek|DeFi|NASDAQ,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-28 03:00:03

33767162,[object Object],1738033229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ripple Gains Ground: Secures Money Transmitter Licenses In NY And Texas,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-secures-money-transmitter-licenses-ny-texas/,"Blockchain payment company Ripple has announced the acquisition of two additional Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in the United States, one from New York and another from Texas on Monday. This brings Ripple’s total to over 55 Money Transmitter Licenses across its payments, custody, and stablecoin operations, underscoring the company’s robust growth in the regulatory landscape. Ripple Expands Global Reach According to recent reports , with these new licenses, Ripple is now better positioned to provide its customers with enhanced cross-border payment solutions, enabling the company to manage end-to-end transactions effectively. Joanie Xie, Managing Director of North America at Ripple, highlighted the increasing interest from financial institutions and crypto businesses eager to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology for faster and more cost-efficient payment processes. She stated: With years of experience working in both crypto and with financial institutions, Ripple is well-positioned to support companies that are ready to take advantage of the current landscape. Ripple’s achievements extend beyond US borders, as the company holds a Major Payment Institution License in Singapore, Virtual Asset Service Provider registrations in Ireland and the Cayman Islands, and an in-principal license from Dubai’s Financial Services Authority (DFSA). Ramps Up Domestic Hiring Amid Crypto-Friendly Regulations To date, Ripple has processed approximately $70 billion in payment volume on its blockchain-based ledger, reflecting its growing influence in the global financial ecosystem. The company has also seen a doubling of North American customers within its payment network over the past year. Despite facing regulatory challenges, including a protracted legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the status of its XRP token , Ripple remains optimistic about its future in the US. The SEC alleged that XRP constituted an unregistered security; however, a court ruling determined that XRP offerings to retail customers were legitimate, although Ripple was fined $125 million for violations concerning institutional offerings. The recent shift in the political landscape, particularly with the Trump administration’s appointment of crypto-friendly regulators, has fostered an optimistic outlook for the crypto industry in the US, capitalizing on this favorable environment by ramping up its domestic presence. The company has reported that approximately 75 percent of its open positions are now based in the US, with a notable increase in domestic hiring compared to 2023. Despite these advances, XRP consolidates at $3, failing to break above its current record high of $3.40, which was set over seven years ago. Nonetheless, the altcoin still holds onto substantial gains of 40% and 470% on a monthly and year-to-date basis, respectively.

Here’s What Every Investor Should Know About This $0.04 Crypto Token,https://nulltx.com/wallitiq-wltq-a-serious-threat-to-cardano-ada-or-just-hype-heres-what-every-investor-should-know-about-this-0-04-crypto-token/,"WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) entry into the crypto market has sparked significant interest, with experts already dubbing it the “Top altcoin of 2025”. The fact that this crypto token has already raised an estimated $6 million in its ongoing presale is a clear indication of its potential and the trust the crypto community has in it. With its rapid growth, this low-priced crypto token is set to outperform established alternatives such as Cardano (ADA). Read on to discover more about this Ethereum crypto token and the unique features that set it apart. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Ethereum Crypto Token Overshadowing Cardano (ADA) And Other Seasoned Alternatives WallitIQ (WLTQ) is an innovative decentralized crypto wallet that allows investors to store and transact over 1,000 cryptocurrencies efficiently and securely. It emerged to solve investors’ security concerns about seasoned wallets such as MetaMask and Binance. Interestingly, its crypto token is also one of the best performing in the market, outshining alternatives such as Cardano (ADA). A captivating characteristic of the WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet is its unique integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology into its platform. With its AI build, the decentralized platform has attracted an array of crypto whales and retail investors. Data shows its ongoing presale has received mainstream attention, raising over $6 million. WallitIQ (WLTQ) prioritizes the safety of investors’ holdings, guaranteeing their security 24/7 with an AI-powered intelligent security system . This system, which includes biometric authentication, behavioral analysis, and anomaly detection, uses AI to monitor and establish transactions and behavioral patterns. Any deviation from these patterns is promptly detected and flagged as a potential threat, guaranteeing the safety of investors’ assets. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI-driven market insights , investors are equipped with a powerful tool to manuever the crypto market. The AI analyzes data, market trends, patterns, and sentiment to determine the future market outlook. These insights are not only comprehensive but also provided in real-time, allowing investors to make informed decisions that can mitigate their losses in a bear market and maximize their profits in a bullish one. To further emphasize its reliability and transparency, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a security assessment by SolidProof , a top blockchain auditing firm. Its smart contract was certified secure. Likewise, it has been listed on the CoinMarketCap website, a massive feat for an emerging crypto project. Investors are prompted to join crypto whales and savvy investors who have acquired the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token. By holding this token, investors can maximize the potential of the world-class infrastructure. Prudent investors can take advantage of the ongoing presale and buy the crypto token for an offered price of only $0.0420 . The low-priced token is expected to generate sumptuous returns for early investors when its value surges in the coming days. Cardano (ADA): Has The Smart Contract Powerhouse Reign Come To An End? The emergence of innovative altcoins such as WallitIQ (WLTQ) has shifted the focus from the smart contract and dApp powerhouse Cardano (ADA). The blockchain platform, which carried great momentum when it was launched in 2017, has recently dwindled in value. This decline in value has led to speculation that Cardano’s (ADA) reign is gradually ending, replaced by newer alternatives like WallitIQ (WLTQ). The blockchain platform’s price trend on CoinGecko also supports this claim. The price dipped by 8.5% and 2.4% in the last seven days and 24 hours, respectively. However, for Cardano (ADA) to bounce back, bulls must push the price and maintain momentum. If this doesn’t happen in the coming days, investors may move to innovative options like WallitIQ (WLTQ) for mouthwatering gains. Conclusion WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) fast growth and ROI potential could cause investors in seasoned altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) to abandon the platforms. The Ethereum crypto token has been a major revelation in the crypto scene, attracting all kinds of investors to its presale. With investors streaming into the platform daily, the current inexpensive presale price could sell out sooner than expected. Late investors would need to pay more to buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token. Consequently, prudent investors are prompted to take advantage of this last-minute opportunity and buy this crypto token now.

Trump Conquers Canada (TRUMPCAN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Conquers Canada can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Conquers Canada could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Conquers Canada launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Conquers Canada on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Conquers Canada by entering its contract address (CA) – HiPRoUXHrovHyJPB5StmSF2XwERbh78iLEfaxtpjVHJC – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 03:08:44

OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM, BITCOIN, and XRP Are Leading the Way!",https://thecoinrise.com/the-next-crypto-king-officialmagacoin-com-bitcoin-and-xrp-are-leading-the-way/,"THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is rapidly emerging as a top contender in the crypto market, with predictions of 2,000% growth potential before 2025. While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation . Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $6.09 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $9.89. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $100 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos recover to its all-time high soon?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $1.10 Market cap $1,124,401,542.96 Trading volume $53,717,376.07 Circulating supply 1,027,119,218.98 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $1.01 24-hour high $1.12 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.51% 50-day SMA $1.331 14-Day RSI 36.04 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-day SMA $0.926 Tezos price analysis: XTZ shows signs of recovery despite broader bearish momentum TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has seen a 2.15% gain in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $1.036, and resistance is at $1.235. Tezos shows signs of short-term recovery. On January 28, Tezos (XTZ) is trading at $1.103, with resistance at $1.235 and support at $1.036. Holding above $1.036 is key to avoiding further decline, while a rebound in buying could push the price above $1.219. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ continues to trend lower The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin shows a continued dip in the price. XTZ’s value is currently around $1.101, just above its critical support of around $1. XTZ continues to trend lower The MACD indicator also confirms the selling pressure observed on the chart, with a bearish crossover. The RSI (42.47) reflects a rather neutral market, indicating reduced volatility and potential price consolidation. If buyer interest does not return soon, XTZ could break below $1. The coin must break past resistance at $1.235 for a recovery to be confirmed. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Buyers reenter XTZ’s market in the short-term The 4-hour chart shows a slight recovery, trading above the lower Bollinger Bands. The Bollinger Bands are expanding, suggesting increased volatility in the short term and possible recovery. Buyers reenter XTZ’s market in the short term The MFI and CMF indicators show that there is not enough buying interest to push the price up. If XTZ fails to stay above $1.036, it might move toward lower support levels. XTZ must move back above the middle Bollinger Band at $1.127 to confirm a recovery. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.1764 SELL SMA 5 $1.1752 SELL SMA 10 $1.2318 SELL SMA 21 $1.2657 SELL SMA 50 $1.3310 SELL SMA 100 $1.1499 SELL SMA 200 $0.9268 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.2321 SELL EMA 5 $1.2535 SELL EMA 10 $1.2893 SELL EMA 21 $1.3262 SELL EMA 50 $1.2972 SELL EMA 100 $1.1630 SELL EMA 200 $1.0313 BUY What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ is struggling to break past the $1.127 resistance, which it needs to clear to continue its recovery. However, with weak money flow and low momentum, the price could stall here and may even drop back to $1.036 if it fails to push higher. Is Tezos a good long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today, falling from $1.12 to as low as $1.013, a 9.55% price drop—a move spurred by sellers disposing of their coins and taking a profit. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ is currently trading between $1.01 – $1.12.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 03:12:55

This Bull Meme Coin is Smashing All Kinds of Records as its Presale Journey Enters Business End,https://thecoinrise.com/snek-left-you-behind-this-bull-meme-coin-is-smashing-all-kinds-of-records-as-its-presale-journey-enters-business-end/,"Many of the top new meme coins to buy this week are shaking up the market in ways we haven’t seen before. Snek (SNEK) had its moment, riding the meme coin wave with a quirky community and solid branding. But as the meme coin landscape evolves, new contenders like BTFD Coin ($BTFD) are stealing the spotlight. With BTFD Coin smashing presale records, thanks to its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, referral program, and a powerful community of Bulls, it’s clear the competition is heating up. Meme coins have evolved from being funny internet tokens to real investment opportunities. Over the years, we’ve seen Dogecoin and Shiba Inu take the world by storm, proving the power of community-backed projects. Now, top new meme coins to buy this week are bringing innovation to the table, blending entertainment, utility, and serious financial gains. BTFD Coin is leading the charge, with its P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, allowing players to earn $BTFD during P2E gameplay . But that’s not all. BTFD Coin’s presale has already raised over $5.7 million, and whispers of a Binance listing have crypto enthusiasts buzzing. If the listing comes to fruition, analysts predict the price could rocket from $0.00016 to $0.006, offering jaw-dropping returns. So, how does BTFD stack up against Snek, and why is it one of the top new meme coins to buy this week? Let’s dig in. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin; it’s a phenomenon. Its presale has been a roaring success, starting at $0.000004 and climbing to $0.00016 in Stage 14. With over 67 billion tokens sold to more than 9,700 holders, the Bulls Squad is proving unstoppable. Analysts are already projecting a price of $0.006 after its presale ends, marking a potential ROI of 3,650% for early investors. What makes BTFD Coin one of the top new meme coins to buy this week isn’t just its presale performance—it’s the ecosystem it’s building. On January 1, 2025, BTFD launched the full version of its P2E game. Players are diving in, earning $BTFD Coins while enjoying an engaging gaming experience. This utility adds a layer of fun and financial opportunity rarely seen in meme coins. But wait, there’s more. The 90% APY staking program, which went live on December 2, 2024, is another big draw. Investors can grow their holdings passively while enjoying incredible returns. The referral program sweetens the deal, allowing users to earn extra tokens by bringing in friends and family. The Bulls Squad community, with its 9,700+ holders, is at the heart of BTFD Coin’s success. These loyal supporters have turned the coin into a movement, amplifying its reach and creating buzz across social media. BTFD Coin Presale: Smashing Records and Setting New Standards The BTFD Coin presale is the talk of the town. It raised over $4.5 million within its first month and has now crossed $5.7 million in Stage 14. With just two stages left before its listing at $0.0006, the excitement is palpable. BTFD Coin’s success lies in its ability to innovate. The P2E game launched earlier this year has been a massive hit, bringing gamers and investors into the fold. The staking program, offering 90% APY, is another major draw, providing passive income opportunities that few coins can match. The referral program is driving exponential growth, creating a ripple effect that’s bringing in new investors by the day. And then there’s the Binance rumor. If BTFD lands on the world’s largest crypto exchange, analysts are predicting a price surge to $0.006. For early investors, that’s the kind of return dreams are made of. With just two stages left in the presale, the clock is ticking. This is your chance to get in before the rest of the world catches on. Snek: A Fading Star? Snek was once a name on everyone’s lips. With its quirky branding and community-driven ethos, it had all the makings of a great meme coin. But as the market evolves, Snek seems to be losing its edge. At $0.00571, it’s struggling to compete with newer, more innovative projects. One of Snek’s biggest challenges is its lack of utility. While its community remains loyal, it doesn’t have the features that coins like BTFD bring to the table. There’s no P2E game, no staking rewards, and no referral program to incentivize new investors. Without these, it’s hard for Snek to stand out in a crowded market. That’s not to say Snek doesn’t have potential. Its branding and loyal fan base give it a strong foundation. But in a world where top new meme coins to buy this week are pushing boundaries, Snek feels like it’s stuck in the past. Investors looking for serious returns might find better opportunities elsewhere. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is undeniably one of the top new meme coins to buy this week. Its record-breaking presale, innovative ecosystem, and strong community make it a standout in the meme coin market. While Snek had its moment, it’s clear that BTFD is the future. Don’t wait too long. The presale is in its final stages, and the opportunity to lock in gains at $0.00016 won’t last. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin presale . Join the Bulls Squad today and be part of something extraordinary. This isn’t just a coin—it’s a movement. The question is, are you ready to ride the wave?

ETH is now correcting losses and might face resistance near the $3,220 zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,220 resistance zone. The price is trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,270 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it stays below the $3,300 level. Ethereum Price Dips Further Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $3,320 and $3,220 levels, like Bitcoin . ETH even declined below the $3,050 level before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $3,021 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $3,050 and $3,120 levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,427 swing high to the $3,021 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,220 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,427 swing high to the $3,021 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,250 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,270 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $3,300. A clear move above the $3,300 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,420 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,120 level. The first major support sits near the $3,050. A clear move below the $3,050 support might push the price toward the $3,020 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,000 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,950.

However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2. Exclusive Sale Platform: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is only available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN , adding an exclusive appeal that many competitors lack. Unlike Solana or Optimism (OP), which are widely traded, this controlled distribution creates a sense of urgency for early investors. 3. Early-Stage Momentum: Raising $1 million within minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its market appeal. With predictions of a 50,000% increase, it’s capturing attention as a high-potential token for investors seeking exponential returns. How It Stacks Up Against the Competition Solana (SOL, $25.01): Known for speed and scalability, but it lacks the exclusive presale advantage and early momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token. Optimism (OP, $1.72): A solid project for scalability, but it’s overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s unique market positioning. Act Now Before It’s Too Late Analysts are calling THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN one of the most promising tokens for 2025, with unparalleled growth potential.

The analyst further revealed the new targets that have emerged for ETH due to the bullish pattern. Ethereum Price Forms Flag And Pole Pattern In a TradingView post, Kartik revealed that the Ethereum price had formed a flag and pole pattern, indicating that ETH could be set for a breakout. The analyst noted that this pattern has formed while Ethereum is currently on a downtrend from the $4,100 resistance level. In line with this, he revealed targets to watch out for following the formation of this pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With Rising Channel Pattern Kartik stated that the next strong support level is at $2,800. He added that the Ethereum price could see a positive move from either a breakout of the trendline or support at the $2,800 level, or both could co-occur. The analyst also advised market participants to wait for things to play out before making any decisions. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Ethereum price could rebound from the support level at $2,800 and rally to $3,600. The chart also showed that Ethereum could even rally to as high as $4,000. Meanwhile, ETH could face some resistance at around $4,100 as it targets higher prices. A break of the $4,100 resistance could lead to a further rally to $4,400. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price, stating that a breakout is imminent. This came as he remarked that ETH was on the verge of breaking out from a falling wedge pattern. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also stated that the ETH breakout seems very close, which could send its price to $4,000. ETH To Reach $5,000 Thanks To These Fundamentals In an X post, crypto analyst Ted predicted that the Ethereum price will reach $5,000 before April this year. The analyst alluded to ETH’s fundamentals to prove why such a parabolic rally is possible for the second-largest crypto by market cap. First, he mentioned the fact that Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial is buying and staking ETH, which is bullish for Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum Gets Massive $12,000 Price Tag From Research Lead Ahead Of Major Upgrade Ted further mentioned the launch of Etherealize, which will help onboard institutions. This move could increase the inflows into the ETH ETFs, which is a positive for the Ethereum price. The analyst also mentioned the Pectra upgrade, which is coming in March 2025. Alongside these bullish fundamentals, he noted that sentiment is at an all-time low, which he claimed is the best signal for reversal. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,130, down almost 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Add to that the questionable oversight of the investors who funded the whole thing, and you have a recipe for a disaster that has left many in the crypto community reeling from the aftermath. 12 hours ago, $RUNES launched on Solana as an experiment “backed” by influencers, including Runetoshi. The launch was immediately sniped by on-chain bots, resulting in a pump-and-dump scheme with a massive price drop post-launch. What happened? •No real decentralization… pic.twitter.com/RC8i4ciFHd — The Web3 Meme Guy (@Web3MemeGuy) January 26, 2025 The Promise of RUNES: A Vision That Didn’t Materialize RUNES was promoted as a groundbreaking new token that debuted on the Solana blockchain and enjoyed strong backing from a number of influencers. Initial press and discussions surrounding the token’s launch were very optimistic, primarily because well-known personalities in the crypto world—like Runetoshi—were championing the project. However, the aftermath of the token’s release did not align with the vision many had for it and instead took a considerably darker turn. The token first witnessed an enormous upsurge, attaining an astonishing market cap of $28 million not long after going live. Yet this spike was swiftly followed by a steep and rapid descent in price. The market cap plummeted to a paltry $500,000 in just a handful of days, with a number of investors left in the ashes. The rise and fall of the token can be traced to a number of largely ignored or overlooked factors. These factors are the following: improper decentralization, bad distribution mechanisms, and lack of transparency. With so many things working against it, one has to wonder if the project was ever really intended to succeed or if it was just a way for the people inside it and the bots that help them to make some quick profits. Rune developer Runetoshi released a Memecoin called Runes on Solana yesterday, and once pushed it up to a market value of $28 million, and then the token quickly collapsed in a violent sell-off, and the market value has fallen to $500k. Runetoshi's Twitter account has been… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 27, 2025 The Downfall: Bots, Insiders, and Lack of Transparency A leading criticism of the RUNES launch concerns the overwhelming role on-chain bots played in the token distribution. Instead of a fair and decentralized approach, these bots and a small group of insiders grabbed up most of the tokens, resulting in an immediate but unsustainable price spike. The behavior essentially turned the launch into a pump-and-dump scheme, with bots and insiders taking the lion’s share of the rewards. When the surge in demand created by them was exhausted, they dumped their tokens onto the market. Those who were caught up in the initial hype, believing it to be a legitimate project rather than a scheme, suffered a huge crash. The situation was exacerbated by the project’s complete lack of transparency concerning token distribution and the beneficiaries of the launch. This absence of straightforward answers and insight into the token mechanics left many investors with an uncomfortable number of uncertainties and a predictable number of complaints. The transparency complaints then fed right back into the project’s reputation: If you can’t see what was done and with what, it becomes easier to accuse folks of doing something untoward. The Aftermath: Runetoshi’s Suspension and the Fallout The token’s value collapsing wasn’t enough—the RUNES fallout has continued to unfold. One of the big influencers behind the project, known as Runetoshi, had his Twitter account suspended. No one knows why—or should I say, no one who knows what’s going on with this project has come forward to explain it. For many, the suspension has come to symbolize the RUNES project—a symbol of confusion and a real lack of understanding among both the project’s leadership and those who supposedly support the project. And what about speculation? Here’s what I’ve seen float around on various social platforms. Although the project was once regarded as an enticing new opportunity for the Solana ecosystem, it now stands as a cautionary tale. RUNES collapsed, and with it, the easy-come-easy-go promises of quick profits that 2021’s red-hot crypto market seemed to assure. Now, as the not-so-tweetable tale of woe unfolds, we’re reminded that most crypto projects here today can be gone tomorrow. And the ones here tomorrow may not have our best interests at heart any more than the ones in the past week did. Lessons Learned: The Need for Accountability and Transparency The accountability, transparency, and decentralization of the RUNES launch are significant in the world of cryptocurrency. We are in an ecosystem where community trust and collective participation are the norms. If a project promised to live up to these standards and then failed to do so, that project would certainly be in jeopardy. For investors, the ascent and descent of RUNES serves as a chilling reminder that not every token or project is conceived in the hopes of delivering enduring worth. Although the allure of rapid returns can be captivating, it’s vital to consider fresh offerings with a buoyant skepticism and the salt that makes skepticism healthy. In the end, RUNES’s collapse points to a greater need for sustained oversight and better regulatory frameworks in the space of cryptocurrency. When the project is all said and done, it could leave behind a question not just about the viability of an asset like RUNES but also about the sustainability over time of a space that has become known for its lack of transparency and its uneven distribution of rewards.

DeepSeek drew worldwide attention last month with its research paper describing DeepSeek-V3, which achieved training through $6 million worth of computational resources. DeepSeek demonstrated cost-effective computing practices through its use of Nvidia H800 chips with limited capabilities. During the past week, DeepSeek revealed its R1 model, which uses power that is twenty to fifty times cheaper than OpenAI’s o1 model, depending on the task, according to their official WeChat. Altman said in the X post that “Deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price.” deepseek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. — Sam Altman (@sama) January 28, 2025 He also noted OpenAI’s primary interest in research progression and its need for more computational capabilities. He emphasized that ever-increasing computational capability represents his organization’s primary requirement for delivering on its mission objectives. Nvidia now operates under greater pressure as cost-effective alternatives begin to appear in the market. Recently, Wall Street witnessed its greatest single-day financial disaster when Nvidia lost $593 billion in market value last Monday. Trump says DeepSeek is a positive development and a wake-up call for US industries According to an NBC report President Donald Trump suggeste d that Am erican tech firms sharpen their focus while addressing in Florida on Monday. He said, “The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing.” The low cost model surged to number one on Apple’s app store during the weekend, threatening U.S. tech supremacy while Trump expressed his faith in America’s capability to maintain its competitive advantage. He also pointed out a silver lining in DeepSeek’s low-cost approach, calling it “very much a positive development” for innovation. According to him, tech firms could save budgetary resources and “come up with, hopefully, the same solution.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",AI|DeepSeek|OpenAI,EN,0,0,MARKET|RESEARCH|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 04:35:00

This bold accumulation comes in the midst of the $SHIB market seeing some significant price fluctuations. Both investors and analysts now watch key price levels that will help determine the Shiba Inu token’s future trajectory. After the market dropped, this whale accumulated another 257.5B $SHIB ($4.6M). This whale currently holds 477.5B $SHIB ($8.57M). https://t.co/k75VUmJZRh pic.twitter.com/xu5GYKZBcN — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 27, 2025 Whale Accumulation Amid Market Volatility The whale’s most recent purchase of 257.5 billion $SHIB, worth $4.6 million, underscores confidence in the token’s long-term potential, despite recent price drops. The Shiba Inu market, like a good deal of the cryptocurrency space, has been volatile, issuing some notable corrections in recent weeks. And yet, this whale’s continued accumulation tends to reinforce the notion that $SHIB holds value for big investors, even in uncertain market conditions. The $SHIB price was not rising but the whale was still buying. Their approach seemed to be one of capitalizing on the lower price points, and the volatility in the market seemed to be no deterrent to them. In fact, we reported that this particular whale had added another 20 billion tokens to their already extensive stash, bringing their total holdings to over 477 billion tokens. That begs the question: What exactly does this whale know that we don’t? Key Support Levels for $SHIB: Analyst’s Insight The whale’s accumulation says a lot about their faith in $SHIB’s future. Still, analysts are watching certain price levels that might play a pivotal role in determining the token’s next move. One of these is the support zone that extends from $0.0000185 to $0.0000212. If $SHIB can hold these levels, it might mean the token is gearing up for a bounce. The $0.0000185 to $0.0000212 range stands as the most critical support zone for #ShibaInu $SHIB ! pic.twitter.com/mKXcYtvqS1 — Ali (@ali_charts) January 27, 2025 Support zones play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, as they signal price levels at which demand seems robust enough to halt any further downturns. The range that Martinez has identified serves as a zone where $SHIB could see a ton of buying interest, a reasonable precursor for any price recovery that $SHIB might experience. The Shiba Inu community is experiencing the same market swings as the rest of the crypto space. But there’s a good chance that $SHIB will hold at the support levels it has in place and will regain momentum, just like the rest of the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, with the next market upswing. Shiba Inu Community’s Bold Vision: ShibOS and the Web3 Revolution Even though market conditions might appear unpredictable, the Shiba Inu community is pressing onward, creating possibly epoch-making developments in decentralized technology. Perhaps the most thrilling recent development is ShibOS, an operating system powered by the Shiba Inu blockchain, which is intended to help transition Web2 applications into the decentralized Web3 world. ShibOS vows to be a revolutionary power for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, smashing a path between traditional Web2 services and the nascent world of Web3. Providing a bridge to this new landscape is no small feat. Wired recently posted a list of “uses” for ShibOS that the decentralized platform promises to make possible. The article did not explain what it means for ShibOS to be a “decentralized platform.” Still, the following are purportedly 36 ways (listed as “cases”) that ShibOS will serve users in this Shiba-powered Web3. The #Shiba Inu community unveils #ShibOS – a blockchain-powered operating system designed for a smooth Web2 to Web3 transition! With 36 use cases, it's shaping the future of decentralized tech. #ShibaInu #Crypto #Web3 #Blockchain https://t.co/cQwF4tFvAx pic.twitter.com/tJGqHX7FoV — Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) January 23, 2025 At a time when many in the tech community look for ways to integrate blockchain into everyday applications, ShibOS has launched. It’s current in the tech community, and it’s trying to bring decentralized technology to the general public. And in doing so, ShibOS could be leading the way to a much-talked-about decentralized future. But it still runs on ordinary hardware and can only integrate so much with the usual applications of the tech community, which is a huge part of what blockchain and Web3 want to change. What Lies Ahead for $SHIB and the Shiba Inu Ecosystem? The Shiba Inu community keeps innovating with projects like ShibOS, and that makes the outlook for $SHIB seem quite promising, especially if the important support zones hold. The latest market volatility may have some people on edge, but the way whales are acting and the way the Shiba Inu team is making moves suggest this project is very much alive. The whale’s most recent acquisition offers investors a glimpse into the long-term possible payoffs that $SHIB might yield. This is especially true considering the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s evolution and the ever-emerging use cases for the token. If Shiba Inu can navigate the current market’s headwinds and continue to promise—and deliver!—innovation, it could return to being a real-deal crypto space player, and so could its token. The Shiba Inu project may well be set for its most thrilling turns yet as it pushes into Web3 with ShibOS. It’s possibly the most Web3 thing the Shiba team has done yet, and with the help of a real community, it’s a thrilling prospect. Whether or not the market follows suit and prices rocket, at least the Shiba Inu community isn’t abandoning the Web3 dream anytime soon. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

An enormous amount of tokens will be unlocked and made available for trading—all told, worth over $790 million. This week’s unlocks feature several projects that will release a large proportion of their overall token supply. Sui (SUI) takes the lead this week in token unlocks, accounting for a single release worth a whopping $288.64 million. This release sees 2.66% of Sui’s total token supply unlocked. This pivotal moment for the project and its investors raises some significant questions about what exactly the project is and where it’s headed. Among the other significant projects are Tribal (TRIBL), ENA, Optimism (OP), ZetaChain (ZETA), and dYdX (DYDX). They, too, have planned unlock events that add up to a considerable number of tokens set to enter circulation. Traders and investors are sure to focus on these scheduled occasions. Whether or not that attention will significantly impact the price of the unlocked tokens and the overall market is a tricky question that we will explore in depth later on. Upcoming Token Unlocks ( January 27 – February 02 ) Several crypto projects will unlock tokens this week, including $TRIBL ,$ENA ,$OP , $SUI , $ZETA and $DYDX . Investors, keep an eye on these token unlocks event pic.twitter.com/UEpiguT30F — SSI (SoSoValue Indexes) (@SoSoValue) January 27, 2025 Top 7 Token Unlocks to Watch This Week The crypto community keeps its focus on the events where tokens are unlocked, and this week sees the largest unlocks of seven different tokens. Here is a detailed look at those unlock events and the tokens that will be unlocked: 1⃣ Sui (SUI) – Unlock Value: $288.64M – Percentage of Supply: 2.66% Sui is absolutely the star of the week. The blockchain platform, famed for its high-performance capacity and developer-friendly ecosystem, is ready to unlock a colossal portion of its tokens. This event is likely to spark trading activity, possibly influencing SUI’s market dynamics in the days to come. 2⃣ Ronin (RON) – Unlock Value: $49.31M The Ethereum sidechain for blockchain games like Axie Infinity, Ronin ranks second on the list. The $49.31 million unlock could provide liquidity to the market and influence the growth trajectory of the handful of projects utilizing the Ronin network. 3⃣ Optimism (OP) – Unlock Value: $43.89M Optimism, one of Ethereum’s foremost Layer-2 scaling solutions, is next in line for a significant unlock event. The release of $43.89 million worth of OP tokens is likely to garner interest from DeFi aficionados and investors. Historically, Optimism’s unlock events have been associated with price volatility, making this another important event for traders to watch closely. 4⃣ dYdX (DYDX) – Unlock Value: $8.46M dYdX, the decentralized derivatives exchange, is poised to release $8.46 million worth of tokens. The platform stands to gain from the increased liquidity and trading activity among users seeking decentralized options and could see this translation into better overall market performance for the token itself. 5⃣ Prime (PRIME) – Unlock Value: $6.52M PRIME is an underappreciated token that will unleash tokens valued at $6.52 million. While it may not attract attention in the way some large-scale launches do, it nonetheless accounts for a chunk of this week’s total and might prove lucrative to investors looking for something off the beaten path. 6⃣ Grass (GRASS) – Unlock Value: $6.41M Another emerging token, GRASS adds $6.41 million to the mix. Its unlock event, though smaller in scale, reflects the broader trend of increased token circulation across various projects. Seventh and last in our countdown is Tai (TAI)—coming in with a $6.4 million unlock event. TAI (like GRASS, which came in just ahead of TAI in our countdown) highlights the diversity of projects participating in this week’s unlock events. Top 7 Token Unlocks of the Upcoming Week The following tokens with the largest unlock amount will be unlocked next week: $SUI – $288.64M $RON – $49.31M $OP – $43.89M $DYDX – $8.46M $PRIME – $6.52M $GRASS – $6.41M $TAI – $6.40M pic.twitter.com/bfFVmskhK9 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) January 27, 2025 Impact of Token Unlock Events on the Market In the cryptocurrency market, play a crucial role. When locked tokens transition into active circulation, they often influence token prices in various ways. One such way is through the simple supply-and-demand dynamic that dictates much of the movement in not just crypto, but all capital markets. If a token moves from being locked up to being active and it’s sold off in large amounts, in tandem with what might be considered either a “normal” or “abnormal” amount of demand for that token, then you could very well expect to see the price dip. It is recommended that investors pay close attention to these unlock events, particularly those that concern well-known tokens such as SUI, RON, and OP. Given the likelihood of price swings, this is a good moment to consider what sort of tactical decisions you want to make, be it trading on an actual or even a planned price basis or opting for a more buy-and-hold, “see what happens next” approach. To sum up, the next week holds substantial occurrences for the crypto sphere, with more than $790 million in token value poised to be unleashed. As always, making decisions with a basis in accurate information and keeping an eagle eye on market movements will be crucial for any investor trying to steer a steady course through these potentially favorable—and risky—developments.

The investment appears to be World Liberty’s coming-out party, as the project has virtually no market presence or awareness until this latest funding round. Far from a typical SEC-regulated underwriter, Web3Port Labs is instead a Chinese-based partner of a Maryland venture capital firm that seems more interested in the upcoming investment blitzkrieg of China’s new digital yuan than this Trump-connected project.

This recent funding seeks to ensure that the World Liberty platform hits its next set of milestones and pays off the promise that it saw in the project’s vision. WLFI Token Sale: A Two-Phase Success Story Following the tremendous success of its initial pre-sale, World Liberty Financial announced earlier this month the launch of the second stage of its token sale. Investors have already shown their enthusiasm for the project, with the pre-sale round selling out in short order. In this next round, 20 billion WLFI tokens—or 20% of the total supply—are being offered at the remarkably low price of $0.015 per token. This round will close on January 20, 2025, and following on from the clear interest in the project, it looks set to sell out. Now in its second stage, the pre-sale gives 5 billion WLFI tokens for sale at an increased price of $0.05 each, reflecting the project’s growing confidence in the market and increasing valuation. World Liberty Financial has set a sky-high $5 billion valuation for this part of the pre-sale, which they say underscores their aggressive growth strategy. And the tone of the sale so far is one of considerable excitement and investor confidence. @Worldlibertyfi $WLFI has raised $10M in funding from @Web3Port_Labs World Liberty Financial, a crypto project, promoted by the Trump family, secures $10M in latest funding from Web3Port.

Earlier in… pic.twitter.com/KhOqpYcJVC — CryptoDep #StandWithUkraine (@Crypto_Dep) January 27, 2025 This rapid increase in attention can be credited in part to the Trump’s family backing, which gives the project much more visibility and credibility. But institutional interest is also making a big splash. When seasoned investors like Web3Port Labs come on board, they signal to the larger marketplace that World Liberty Financial is a potentially big player in the crypto and DeFi spaces. Strategic Vision and Market Positioning World Liberty Financial’s intention is to transform the mechanisms of global finance using the blockchain. By this, they mean to construct an alternative layer of global finance that is secure, efficient, and offers the kind of borderless service that today’s consumers and businesses demand. They see this layer as one that can attract yield-seeking investment and also serve as a much-needed innovation engine for the global economy. The efforts of the project are likely to accelerate and scale up, thanks to the significant funding raised from Web3Port Labs. Adding liquidity to our ecosystem via the token sale strengthens our project’s finances even further and allows us to keep innovating and forming strategic partnerships. The excitement about WLFI is not undeserved. A lot of people view the project as a probable game-changer for cryptocurrency, thanks to its high-profile backers and its innovative take on fintech. Observers of the crypto scene have even noted that the $5 billion price tag slapped on the second pre-sale round seems to reflect not only the project’s grand ambitions but also its knack for pulling in some serious investor interest. What’s Next for WLFI? The next steps for World Liberty Financial are drawing attention as the second pre-sale round gathers speed. The project has its sights set on just the kinds of things you want to see from a crypto venture: expanding its ecosystem, building partnerships, and—most crucially—launching additional financial products meant to serve a clientele as diverse as its global presence. All of this seems very much in the works, thanks to a solid investment base, a successful start to the token sale. The fast sell-out of the first pre-sale round and the growing demand in the second phase hint at WLFI being an opportunity worth watching for investors. The backing by Web3Port Labs also signals increased interest from prominent players in the blockchain space, adding another layer of credibility to the project. To sum up, World Liberty Financial’s recent funding round, in which it raised $10 million, and the strong showing of its token sale really do make it seem as if the company could be an important player in the crypto market. It is making waves, and that usually means more people are looking at it. In the investment community, the interest level in crypto has risen dramatically, and while many in that community are skeptical of the veracity of what’s being sold and to whom, this company has the potential to be one that drives the attraction of the investment crowd to the crypto world at large.

""I own XRP, BTC, and ETH, among a handful of others – we live in a multichain world, and I’ve advocated for a level-playing field instead of one token versus another. If a govt digital asset reserve is created - I believe it should be representative of the industry, not just one token (whether it be BTC, XRP or anything else),"" Garlinghouse said on X . Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration will evaluate whether to create a national digital asset stockpile, having backed the idea in the lead-up to the November elections. The crypto market anticipates that a potential reserve would include bitcoin, the leading digital asset by market value and the one with the highest level of institutional adoption. Currently, traders active over decentralized betting platform Polymarket only see a 17% chance of Trump greenlighting the project in the first 100 days of his administration. Garlinghouse, however, is against the maximalism that promotes BTC as the only deserving candidate for a potential national reserve. ""Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress, and I’m very glad to see fewer and fewer folks ascribe to this outdated and misinformed thinking,"" Garlinghouse said.

This marks the third time in 2025 that the EF has sold ETH, raising concerns among ETH holders about the cryptocurrency’s relatively lackluster price performance. EF Continues To Sell Ethereum, But Analysts Offer Hope In a post on X earlier today, on-chain analytics platform Spot On Chain identified a transaction showing that the EF had offloaded another 100 ETH. As of January 27, the EF has sold a total of 300 ETH for approximately $981,200. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say Naturally, the continued selling pressure from the EF has contributed to Ethereum’s price struggles. Over the past 24 hours, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has fallen by 5.7%, trading at $3,125 at the time of writing. That being said, the EF still holds a substantial amount of Ethereum. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the non-profit organization owns 269,175 ETH, worth more than $800 million at current market prices. While the EF’s decision to periodically sell ETH has raised concerns among some of the digital asset’s largest holders, seasoned crypto trader CoinMamba believes that all may not be lost for ETH just yet. In a post on X, CoinMamba shared a chart providing ‘some hopium’ for the next two months. According to the analysis, the months of February and March have historically delivered strong returns for ETH holders. The analyst explained that Ethereum has only posted negative returns in February once, back in 2018, when the digital asset had already surged by 50% in January of that year. In February 2024, the cryptocurrency saw a 46.3% increase in price. Crypto trader Crypto Rover shared their analysis aligning with the prediction of ETH appreciating in value over the next couple of months. The trader emphasized that ETH is still in a ‘massive uptrend,’ and there is no reason to panic. Is ETH On The Cusp Of A Rally? Despite being overshadowed for much of 2024 by the likes of SUI, Solana (SOL), and XRP, analysts are confident that ETH has yet to experience a bullish price momentum that could bring it closer to its current all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outperform Bitcoin In 2025? Report Predicts $8,000 ETH Price For example, recent analysis by crypto analyst Mister Crypto suggests that ETH has likely bottomed out and a price rally could be imminent for the smart contract platform token. Another analyst pointed out that ETH is completing an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the three-day chart, which is considered a bullish signal for the digital asset. However, concerns remain regarding Ethereum’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin (BTC), with the ETH/BTC trading pair hitting four-year lows. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,125, down 5.7% over the past 24 hours.

Solana (SOL) whale activity remains strong despite a 22.93% pullback in its price, signaling optimism among large investors about Solana’s future prospects. Meanwhile, the BNB token is keeping tongues wagging with its $1.16 billion token burn, solidifying its deflationary approach and sparking further interest among traders. Adding to the market excitement, the BlockDAG (BDAG) X1 App has surpassed 500,000 active users, showcasing the growing demand for accessible mining solutions. The app’s ability to let users earn up to 20 BDAG coins daily has led many to call it the best crypto to mine on mobile. Solana Whale Activity Could Renew Buying Interest Solana whale activity has caught the crypto community’s interest, especially after the token dropped 22.93% from its all-time high of $294.33 to $227. Analysts note that Solana whale activity has not wavered, with addresses holding 10,000+ SOL reaching 5,137 before slightly retreating to 5,128. This uptick in Solana whale activity suggests that larger investors remain optimistic about the project’s direction. Some believe that Solana whale activity could keep the market strong, even though technical indicators point to weakening upward pressure. The average directional index (ADX) has reportedly fallen from 66.2 to 27.2, hinting at a slowing trend. Observers are closely watching whether institutional-level Solana whale activity will continue to support the token’s near-term recovery. BNB Token Burn Enhances Ecosystem Value The BNB token has taken another step toward reducing overall supply, following the BNB Foundation’s 30th quarterly token burn worth $1.16 billion. This event permanently removed 1,634,200.95 tokens from circulation, including 110,000 BNB token units lost during the recent BNB Chain Fusion. Analysts believe this deflationary model could amplify demand by maintaining scarcity. The Auto-Burn system, vital for fairness and transparency, calculates how many tokens to remove based on price and network data. The BNB token continues to draw attention, especially given the foundation’s plan to burn an additional 42 million tokens in the future. For many traders, the BNB token now appears even more appealing due to the foundation’s ongoing efforts to regulate supply. Why Is BlockDAG The Best Crypto to Mine on Mobile? BlockDAG mining is in high demand, which is evident from the extraordinary growth of its X1 App. The mining app’s total active users have surpassed 500,000, a milestone that reinforces the project’s decentralized ecosystem. The swift adoption rate suggests significant interest in BlockDAG’s forward-thinking approach, offering a user-friendly method for mining BDAG coins without the complexity of physical rigs. The app lets users earn up to 20 BDAG daily, potentially boosting profits through referral bonuses if new participants actively mine. Once BDAG hits the predicted $1 value, crypto miners will see a modest daily return of $20, accumulating into a more substantial monthly $600, and yearly gains of $7,200. The huge success of the BlockDAG crypto presale proves the enthusiasm of traders, with more than $185 million raised and 18 billion BDAG coins sold. Early supporters have already experienced a 2,380% ROI, as BDAG’s price has jumped from $0.001 to $0.0248, with more price surges on the horizon. This has increased the demand for BDAG mining, which has led to a surge in X1 app users. The X1 App’s straightforward interface, complete with a leaderboard and daily engagement features, keeps miners involved and informed. By lowering barriers to entry, BlockDAG encourages broader participation for those seeking a reliable platform to mine and trade digital assets. Experience the Momentum: Crypto’s Best Era Yet All these latest developments in the crypto market highlight the ongoing opportunities for traders and miners. Solana whale activity continues to demonstrate the confidence of large investors, even as the price pulls back to $227. Meanwhile, the BNB token burn, which permanently removed $1.16 billion worth of tokens, strengthens its deflationary model and hints at increased scarcity-driven demand. Yet the biggest demand in crypto right now is for BlockDAG. As crypto miners rush to mine BDAG, its X1 app has crossed 500,000 active users, quickly becoming the easiest and best crypto to mine on mobile. Offering up to 20 BDAG coins daily and bonus rewards through referrals, the app combines simplicity and profitability for both new and experienced miners. Now is the best time for traders, miners, and crypto enthusiasts to explore BlockDAG’s ecosystem as its presale advances and opportunities grow.

This recognition comes after LOYAL invested in $TRUMP, the official meme coin of Donald Trump, the U.S. President through HTX and the generous donation of all his profits to fund the construction of a school in a remote region of China. To commemorate this act of generosity, HTX DAO will mint a unique Soulbound Token (SBT) for LOYAL. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, SBTs cannot be transferred or sold, making them a digital badge of honor. This particular SBT will feature a design symbolizing the interconnected nature of blockchain networks and the heart of charity. LOYAL, a passionate advocate for Web3, seized the opportunity presented by the launch of the $TRUMP meme coin. By investing in $TRUMP through HTX, he quickly realized significant gains. Rather than keeping the profits, he chose to use the funds to make a lasting impact on the lives of others. The funds will be used towards the construction of a school in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, which will provide educational opportunities for children in the rural communities. “Being named HTX DAO Charity Ambassador is a true honor,” said LOYAL. “This recognition inspires me to continue my work in the Web3 space and to help others. I hope that more people will join me in leveraging blockchain technology for social good.” HTX DAO and LOYAL will collaborate on a documentary that will be released on January 29th at 21:21:21 PM UTC+8. This video will delve into the story behind the donation and explore the potential of decentralized charity. “We believe that blockchain technology can revolutionize the way we approach philanthropy,” said Molly, a spokesperson for HTX DAO. “By using blockchain, we can ensure that donations are transparent, secure, and have the maximum impact. We are proud to support LOYAL and his efforts to build a more equitable world.” HTX DAO’s Charity Ambassador program aims to recognize individuals who are making a positive difference through the use of Web3 technology. By highlighting these inspiring stories, HTX DAO hopes to encourage more people to get involved in decentralized philanthropy. About HTX DAO HTX DAO is a blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organization dedicated to revolutionizing decentralized governance and expanding the applications of blockchain technology. Our vision is centered around open finance and a decentralized, tokenized economy. At the core of HTX DAO, governance is democratically and transparently vested in the hands of HTX token holders. We warmly invite individuals and communities to join our journey, actively participate, and contribute, together shaping an open and innovative future for the blockchain world.

Over the last day, long liquidations across exchanges amounted to $68 million. This makes one of the sharpest and most remarkable price movements in a while—certainly the most notable for October so far. “The market has become extremely volatile,” noted one analyst. As $BTC 's price fell below $100K, long liquidations surged. In the past 24 hours, a total of $68M worth of longs were liquidated across exchanges, making it one of the most notable events recently: https://t.co/vmxHItMnSa pic.twitter.com/b8pdhwESM6 — glassnode (@glassnode) January 27, 2025 The long liquidations of Bitcoin over a 24-hour period amounted to nearly $3 million, placing this event as the trio’s third-largest long liquidation within the past quarter of a year. Liquidation means forced selling of an asset, which in this case refers to Bitcoin, that’s being held by near-sighted investors who have bet on the price going up. Since Bitcoin’s recent pinnacle of $108,000 on January 20, 2025, the market has entered a choppy and corrective phase. This downward trajectory has run its course and culminated in the current descent to $98,000. But as pullbacks go, this one is not your father’s Bitcoin correction. The severity of unrealized losses remains muted when compared to earlier price declines. Since the recent #Bitcoin peak at $108k on January 20th, the market has entered a choppy pattern, culminating in today's correction to $98k. During this move, the total supply in loss, denominated in USD, has risen by $187B: https://t.co/G4nFVJV79k pic.twitter.com/JszYJVUm0F — glassnode (@glassnode) January 27, 2025 Analyzing the Current Bitcoin Correction Push the recent market downturn, and the total USD-denominated supply in loss has increased by $187 billion. While pushy, this number is 43 percent lower than the figure we had in mid-January. In fact, it is significantly below most of our recent bear periods and suggesting that, while we are correcting, we are doing so with a lot less in unrealized losses than we have seen lately. In other words, this resilient push isn’t pushing us down into the lows we had in January. The activity in Bitcoin options markets adds another layer of uncertainty. For January 31, 2025, the data from options shows a substantial concentration of put options with strike prices well above the current trading level of Bitcoin, namely, above $105,000. – At $105,000: 734 BTC puts contrasted with 2,484 BTC calls. – At $110,000: 392 BTC puts as opposed to 5,355 BTC calls. $BTC options expiring 31 Jan 2025 show a large concentration of puts above $105K: $105K: 734 BTC puts vs. 2,484 BTC calls. $110K: 392 BTC puts vs. 5,355 BTC calls. https://t.co/jfjWVY5TJ6 pic.twitter.com/Rtz7DLkyf6 — glassnode (@glassnode) January 27, 2025 What is intriguing is that at the $100,000 level, puts and calls are in relative balance, with 2,152 BTC puts and 2,645 BTC calls. This equilibrium reflects a neutral or uncertain sentiment at this key psychological level. Below $100,000, however, puts dominate in a big way, indicating that traders are placing a lot of bets on a strong downside move: At $90,000: 2,070 BTC puts as opposed to 949 BTC calls. – When the price hits $80,000: 1,425 BTC puts compared to 255 BTC calls. Traders appear to consider these levels as possible support zones for Bitcoin and are getting ready for additional downside danger, given their position in the futures market. Bitcoin Exchange Flows and Historical Parallels Even though the market has been turbulent, flows into Bitcoin exchanges have been negative since January 21. This suggests that investors are retaining or accumulating Bitcoin. It hints that something like a long-term confidence might be developing in the digital gold, even while the short-term prospects for the market seem lousy. Bitcoin exchange flows have been negative since the 21st of Jan, hinting at ongoing accumulation. pic.twitter.com/hiQ8K5eprQ — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 27, 2025 Another comparison that analysts have drawn is between the current market cycle and Bitcoin’s historical performance during 2015-2018. Ali Martinez, in an analysis for Investing.com, said that he sees “striking similarities” between the current price action and the buildup just before Bitcoin went parabolic. If we’re to take any analogy from that period, it’s this: a fantastic upward price breakout in Bitcoin could occur at any moment. #Bitcoin is showing striking similarities to the 2015-2018 cycle. Historically, it was around this point when $BTC went parabolic. pic.twitter.com/VLD8ehzj6K — Ali (@ali_charts) January 26, 2025 Furthering the buoyancy, Bitcoin spot ETFs have seen the appearance of noteworthy net inflows over the past week (January 21-24). Bitcoin spot ETFs tallied a net inflow of $1.76 billion in this period, with BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) accounting for a whopping $1.32 billion of this total. BlackRock aside, the other spot ETFs didn’t contribute too much to this recent growth. But with these figures in mind, the future of spot ESPs in the space seems a whole lot brighter. Last week (January 21 to January 24, Eastern Time), Bitcoin spot ETFs had a weekly net inflow of US$1.76 billion. Blackrock Bitcoin ETF IBIT had a weekly net inflow of US$1.32 billion. https://t.co/YanotfbWiJ pic.twitter.com/0kQoHUbuiM — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 27, 2025 Outlook and Key Takeaways The $100,000 ceiling for Bitcoin is now a thing of the past. What dropped it and why? Was it just a market correction that was bound to happen? Or are there other factors at work? Well, liquidations and downside hedging—what’s that you ask? Let me save a longer explanation for later and instead refer you to the following list for a clearer understanding. The uncertainty in the options market is evident, with sentiment around $100,000 that is either long or short. Investors are definitely covering their bases, though, with numerous put options providing strong downside protection at $90,000 and $80,000—levels that are likely to hold for at least the next few weeks. In this context, the historical pattern of a late-year recovery is particularly relevant. So, too, are the recent unprecedented inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. At this moment, Bitcoin investors and traders are keeping a close watch on important support levels and the general market trend. As the latter attempts to come out of this corrective phase, it is hard to say which way things will go. The fundamentals of the Bitcoin market have not changed for the worse. Those betting against Bitcoin might want to consider the number of Bitcoin ATMs, the number of Bitcoin users, and the various companies that now accept payment in Bitcoin.

""KuCoin avoided implementing required anti-money laundering policies designed to identify criminal actors and prevent illicit transactions,"" U.S. Attorney Danielle R. Sassoon said in a statement. ""KuCoin was used to facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of suspicious transactions and to transmit potentially criminal proceeds, including proceeds from darknet markets and malware, ransomware, and fraud schemes,"" the statement added. As part of the guilty plea, KuCoin has agreed to exit the U.S. market for at least two years and two of the exchange's founders, Chun ""Michael"" Gan and Ke ""Eric"" Tang, will also depart from the company. KuCoin served approximately 1.5 million registered users who were located in the U.S., and earned at least approximately $184.5 million in fees from those U.S. registered users, the release said. The release notes that KuCoin employees openly promoted that the exchange did not have a know-your-customer (KYC) program. It was only in August 2023 that KuCoin adopted a KYC process, but it wasn't implemented on existing customers. Gan and Tang, the exchange's founders, have agreed to forfeit approximately $2.7 million in funds that were generated as a result of KuCoin's operations in the U.S. In a press release from KuCoin , Gan said he was stepping down from the exchange to ensure its continued success and he had no intent to violate any U.S. or international law.

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $700 resistance. BNB price is struggling to clear the $685 resistance zone. The price is now trading above $675 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $674 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $668 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Comeback After a decent increase, BNB price struggled to settle above the $700 level. It started a pullback from the $691 high, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was drop below the $685 support zone. The price even dived below the $650 level. A low was formed at $637 and the price recently started a strong rebound. There was a move above the $650 level. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $691 swing high to the $637 low. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $674 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading above $675 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $691 swing high to the $637 low. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $685 level. The next resistance sits near the $692 level. A clear move above the $692 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $700. A close above the $700 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $720 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $732 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $685 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $675 level. The next major support is near the $668 level. The main support sits at $655. If there is a downside break below the $655 support, the price could drop toward the $635 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $620 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $675 and $668.

On January 25, 2023, the network experienced the creation of 206,290 new wallet addresses within 24 hours—its largest daily wallet creation since October 2022. This remarkable surge in new wallet creation suggests that, beneath the surface, there is a strong, continuing interest in and demand for the Ethereum network. Despite mild price concerns throughout crypto as the weekend came to an end, Ethereum's network blasted off with an astonishing 206,290 new addresses created between January 24th and 25th. This was the highest surge in network growth since October 8, 2022. The 27-month… pic.twitter.com/xGNL9dakUk — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 27, 2025 Unprecedented Wallet Growth Amidst Negative Sentiment Ethereum has seen an influx of new addresses, which have brought with them a fresh batch of negative $ETH sentiment. The fortune of the crypto addresses appears to be tied to the performance of Ethereum itself, which has been lagging other altcoin projects in the past few weeks. Most people in the crypto universe are aware, however, that Ethereum is far and away the front-runner in terms of its fully implemented decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, as well as its “staking” offering that’s about to pump a whole lot more $ETH into the economy. Ethereum’s widespread usefulness keeps pulling users in. It is the foundational layer for DeFi protocols and is hosting an enormous and diverse assembly of dApps. It is absolutely unrivaled in the blockchain space. And yet, the number of wallets being created on Ethereum has been exploding, in a positive sense, of course, recently. So, its desirability and pull effect amongst new users and developers remains strong, even if the developers and users in question are not forking over any cryptocurrency at the present moment. Ethereum Foundation’s Strategic Moves Adding to the week’s activity, the Ethereum Foundation executed another strategic sale of 100 ETH. According to Onchain Lens, the foundation sold the ETH at an average price of $3,078.93, receiving 307,893 DAI in exchange. This transaction brings the foundation’s total ETH sales for 2025 to 300 ETH. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has stated that the foundation might look into staking or DeFi income options as alternatives to selling ETH. However, the foundation’s recent sales suggest that it’s maintaining its strategy of effectively converting some of its holdings into stable assets, with the possible goals of diversifying its treasury or funding ongoing development initiatives. According to Onchain Lens, the Ethereum Foundation once again sold 100 ETH at an average price of $3,078.93 in exchange for 307,893 DAI. Since 2025, the Ethereum Foundation has sold a total of 300 ETH. Previously, Vitalik said that he would consider using staking or DeFi income… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 27, 2025 Although the sales have generated some chatter among members of our community, they actually demonstrate a disciplined approach by the foundation—one that guarantees both the financial security of the foundation and continuing support for the growth and innovation of Ethereum. Strong Inflows into Ethereum Spot ETFs Interest from institutions in Ethereum remains very high, as can be seen from the recent large inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). From January 21 to January 24, Ethereum spot ETFs saw $139 million come in, with the BlackRock ETF (ETHA) being the major driver of that figure. ETHA brought in $135 million over that period, making these funds, at the moment, not just large but also rather presumed-safe places to put Ethereum exposure. The inflows show an inflating institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability. With BlackRock and other titans of finance stepping into the Ethereum market, the asset’s spot as a bedrock of the crypto ecosystem looks only increasingly secure. Last week (January 21 to January 24, Eastern Time), the Ethereum spot ETF had a net inflow of US$139 million. The Blackrock Ethereum ETF ETHA had a weekly net inflow of US$135 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/IVS2ii3NUa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 27, 2025 Ethereum’s Role in the Broader Crypto Landscape Ethereum’s capacity to draw fresh users, keep institutional interest alive, and maintain its reigning position in DeFi is a testament to its resilience and relevance in the changing crypto landscape. The network’s swift wallet growth suggests that, notwithstanding price volatility in the near term, Ethereum has not only added to its installed base but has also reinforced its position as a foundational layer in the blockchain industry. In addition, Ethereum offers both staking and DeFi protocols, which are additional services that provide utility for those investing in Ethereum. The DeFi protocols allow people who own Ethereum to participate in decentralized financial products in what is now being called the “DeFi Summer.” Looking Ahead Ethereum is sailing through a difficult market, but its long-term outlook is still very bullish. The network seems not only able but also eager to welcome new users, and it is doing a remarkably good job of persuading even large institutional players to buy in. If anything, Ethereum’s core seems more energized than ever. The recent increase in the establishment of wallets, along with vigorous inflows into exchange-traded funds and the deft management of Ethereum’s underlying base, underscores the diversified appeal of the second-largest cryptocurrency. Although the current sentiment may be somewhat frosty, Ethereum’s fundamentals shine brightly. The crypto market is changing. Ethereum, for its part, is evolving. With decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, and an increase in decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum seems fairly well situated to seize future opportunities as the blockchain market evolves and (probably) matures. Why? Enhanced adoption and scalability solutions—like Ethereum 2.0—that are in the works promise to keep the network resilient. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

These products could bring fresh opportunities for traders to amplify their exposure to popular cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, while also giving lesser-known coins, including Cardano, Polkadot, and even memecoins like TRUMP and BONK, their first ETF products. With the SEC’s new crypto task force in action, all eyes are on whether these filings survive or get shut down. Let’s see what it means for you. A Game-Changer for Crypto ETFs Tuttle Capital Management has filed with the U.S. SEC to introduce 10 leveraged crypto ETFs. Among the highlights are the 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF, 2X Long Solana Daily Target ETF, and 2X Long Litecoin Daily Target ETF. These ETFs aim to double the daily performance of their underlying assets, offering investors a high-risk, high-reward trading option. This S-1 filing is significant for some cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Polkadot, which are set to receive their first-ever ETF products. It also marks a bold entry for memecoins like TRUMP, BONK, and MELANIA, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the crypto ETF. While Dogecoin has seen ETF filings before, these new additions signal a growing interest in integrating even the most volatile assets into mainstream financial products. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Litecoin Price To Hit $150 As Grayscale Files For Litecoin ETF? , Regulatory Challenges and Expert Opinions While this move has excited the investors, it raises questions about regulatory problems. Crypto ETFs have faced significant scrutiny from the SEC, with approvals often delayed or denied due to market volatility and investor protection concerns. ETF expert James Seyffart highlighted that Tuttle Capital’s filings might challenge the SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs. The SEC’s crypto task force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to play a crucial role in deciding the fate of these applications. Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda has already launched a Crypto Task Force to tackle the growing challenges of the crypto market. The team aims to create clear rules to reduce confusion and provide better guidance for investors and industry professionals. Better Odds for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin Despite the challenges, analysts believe that Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs stand a better chance of gaining approval. These assets are known for their strong market presence, higher decentralization, and relatively stable adoption rates. For instance, the Litecoin ETF proposed by Canary Capital has already progressed with its SEC filing, indicating a growing acceptance of more established cryptocurrencies in the ETF space. A Growing Trend in Crypto Investments Tuttle Capital’s bold move comes amid a surge in crypto ETF filings. Grayscale and CoinShares recently applied for Litecoin ETFs , while Canary Capital proposed an ETF for Hedera. The competition is heating up as asset managers explore new ways to bring crypto to traditional markets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Musk Fuks Robots (MUSKROBO), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Fuks Robots can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Robots could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Robots launched with over $40,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Robots on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Robots by entering its contract address (CA) – 9yuANCwHs443YpCDnUr2GfSkDSTxUweQL1m2vMaYnTT5 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 05:16:00

This case, filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in March 2024, also involves the platform’s co-founders, Chun Gan, and Ke Tang, who are stepping down from their roles as part of the settlement. The rising KYC and money laundering cases by the crypto exchanges are hampering the faith of crypto investors. Right now all eyes are on the first crypto order which can change the crypto rules and give a safe trading platform for crypto investors. Trump is working to bring crypto assets into daily use to make it more accessible but before that, the firms should follow the guidelines to safeguard their crypto investors. What Was KuCoin Accused Of? As per the latest update from Samuel Rubenfeld, a Senior Reporter with MLExclusive, KuCoin’s operator, Peken Global Ltd, has agreed to a $300 million settlement with U.S. authorities. This includes $113 million in fines, $184.5 million in civil forfeitures, and $22 million in additional fines and refunds. As part of the deal with DOJ , KuCoin will stop operating in New York, and its co-founders, Chun Gan, and Ke Tang, will step down, each forfeiting $2.7 million. Gan has already announced his departure, calling the settlement a fair resolution. As part of the agreement, KuCoin will stop operating in New York.

This case is part of a larger trend of US regulators cracking down on crypto companies that break the law. Other platforms, like BitMEX and Robinhood, have faced similar actions, resulting in hefty fines and leadership changes. Under President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President administration, the US is taking a tougher stance on crypto regulation . While the government wants to create clear rules for the industry, it is also showing little tolerance for companies that fail to comply with existing laws. What’s Next? The US is ramping up its regulatory efforts with the help of a new crypto task force , led by Hester Peirce, and other government agencies like the DOJ and SEC. These groups aim to create a safer and more transparent crypto market while cracking down on bad actors. For KuCoin, this settlement closes a major chapter, but it also serves as a warning to other crypto companies about the importance of following the rules. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin falls below $100K as the crypto market faces tech-linked volatility. Fed’s interest rate stance dampens risk appetite, extending crypto losses. Within the last 24 hours, a massive $920 billion was wiped out of the cryptocurrency market. This decline is closely linked to a broader sell-off in the technology sector. The recent launch of a free, open-source AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek has intensified competition in the tech industry, leading to substantial losses in U.S. tech stocks. This development has had a ripple effect on cryptocurrencies, which often move in tandem with tech equities. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, fell below $100,000 , reaching an 11-day low. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, also faced significant declines. Analysts suggest that the high correlation between Bitcoin and tech stocks, particularly the Nasdaq 100, has fueled this downturn.

The founders, who took a guilty plea, resigned and agreed to pay almost $300 million in fines and forfeitures in an active case since 2024. KuCoin was charged with defying anti-laundering laws only a few years after settling a similar civil law in the state of New York. The Seychelles-based Peken Global Ltd., one of the three entities operating as KuCoin, answered to charges on Monday before US District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan. The judge, in the ruling, fined it about $113 million and forfeited $184.5 million. The exchange and its two founders, Chun Gan, and Ke Tang, were put on trial in March 2024 for plotting to run an unlicensed money-transmitting business in breach of an anti-money laundering program. The two founders then agreed to defer prosecution, each forfeiting about $2.7 million. In December 2023, the exchange platform settled a $22 million fine and refunds in New York; it further agreed to end trading in New York in a civil suit where the state attorney general claimed KuCoin failed to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer and falsely represented itself as a crypto exchange. KuCoin has struggled with regulatory compliance US Attorney Danielle R. Sassoon said, “For years, KuCoin avoided implementing required anti-money laundering policies designed to identify criminal actors and prevent illicit transactions.” As a result, KuCoin was used to facilitate billions of dollars worth of suspicious transactions and to transmit potentially criminal proceeds, including proceeds from darknet markets and malware, ransomware, and fraud schemes. KuCoin has been struggling with regulatory compliance in different territories and jurisdictions. Away from the United States, the company faced regulatory challenges in Canada. In 2022, the Ontario Securities Commission imposed an embargo on KuCoin from serving users in the country because they didn’t meet the regulatory threshold to operate there. In addition to Canada, KuCoin has also faced regulatory challenges in India. The firm was part of several exchanges that were sent out of the Indian market due to compliance issues. United States tightens compliance rules in crypto The United States authorities have stepped up their efforts to ensure crypto players comply with regulations. Kucoin isn’t the only player facing regulatory sanctions for failing to adhere to set standards. Coincidentally, another Seychelles-based exchange, BITMEX, was also used as an example to lawbreakers. The firm was fined $100 million for breaching the US anti-money laundering laws. The platform was found guilty of violating the Bank Secrecy Act, which is responsible for strict identity verification compliance and monitoring illicit financial activities.

Privacy-focused AI platform Venice AI, founded by Bitcoin advocate Erik Voorhees, launched its Venice Token (VVV) on Ethereum's Base network, achieving a $1 billion valuation within hours. Meanwhile, the viral success of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has spurred a surge in malicious ”DeepSeek” scam tokens, highlighting the risks associated with emerging technologies. DeepSeek's Viral Success Sparks Surge in Malicious Crypto Tokens A recent surge in malicious ”DeepSeek” cryptocurrency tokens has raised alarm in the crypto community, mirroring a troubling trend of scammers exploiting trending narratives to deceive unsuspecting users. According to data from the security firm BlockAid, the past 24 hours have seen the creation of at least 75 scam tokens tied to the Chinese AI company DeepSeek, representing a threefold increase from the previous day. This spike in fraudulent tokens follows the release of DeepSeek's latest AI app version on Jan. 20, which quickly went viral, climbing to the top of the Apple App Store. While the company's innovative AI technology has garnered widespread attention, its success has also drawn scammers aiming to capitalize on its newfound popularity. The surge in scam tokens tied to DeepSeek is reminiscent of the proliferation of fraudulent tokens that followed former US President Donald Trump’s launch of a meme coin on Jan. 18. During that event, the number of Trump-branded tokens skyrocketed from an average of 3,300 daily launches to a staggering 6,800 on the day of the official meme coin debut. Similarly, DeepSeek’s viral AI model has become a new target for crypto fraudsters. Oz Tamir, a research analyst at BlockAid, highlighted the sophistication of these scams. Scammers have created a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics DeepSeek’s official website. The fraudulent DApp includes a “Connect Wallet” button that, when clicked, could potentially drain a user’s crypto wallet. Tamir emphasized the growing need for vigilance, as scammers refine their methods to deceive even experienced crypto users. DeepSeek itself has issued clear warnings about the rise of scam tokens. In a pinned post on its X account dated Jan. 10, the company stated, ”DeepSeek has not issued any cryptocurrency. Currently, there is only one official account on the Twitter platform. We will not contact anyone through other accounts. Please stay vigilant and guard against potential scams.” Despite these warnings, scammers have managed to launch and briefly sustain two fake DeepSeek tokens, one of which reached a market capitalization of $48 million before its momentum cooled. Another fraudulent token reached a $13 million market cap, demonstrating the scale and speed with which these scams can attract unsuspecting investors. The proliferation of scam tokens tied to DeepSeek reflects a broader trend of scammers exploiting viral moments to launch fraudulent cryptocurrencies. According to BlockAid , scammers are becoming increasingly adept at creating fake tokens and exploiting trending narratives. The launch of Official Trump (TRUMP) and First Lady Melania’s meme coin (MELANIA) earlier this month triggered a similar wave of copycat tokens. This latest incident also shows the interconnectedness of crypto and artificial intelligence in the public imagination. DeepSeek’s rise to prominence stems from the impressive capabilities of its AI model, which the company claims cost under $6 million to develop — a fraction of the billions spent by American tech giants like OpenAI. The company’s viral success has not only drawn attention to its innovative approach but has also made it a prime target for exploitation. The rapid rise of malicious tokens tied to DeepSeek has caused ripples in the financial markets, with fears of widespread scams contributing to a sell-off in certain sectors. This development comes at a time of heightened scrutiny on both AI and cryptocurrency innovation. On Jan. 23, President Trump signed an executive order revoking past policies that were perceived as barriers to American AI development, signaling the U.S. government’s intent to remain competitive in the global AI race. David Sacks, a prominent AI and crypto advocate who served in the Trump administration, described DeepSeek’s AI model as evidence of an increasingly competitive landscape. However, the darker side of this competition — the rise of sophisticated scams — has raised concerns about the need for stronger safeguards to protect consumers. Staying Vigilant Amid the AI-Crypto Convergence As DeepSeek continues to dominate headlines, the company’s viral success highlights both the potential and the perils of the intersection between AI and cryptocurrency. While innovations like DeepSeek’s AI model showcase the transformative possibilities of technology, the associated surge in scam tokens brings attention to the importance of vigilance in the evolving crypto landscape. For users, the lesson is clear: always verify the authenticity of cryptocurrency projects before engaging with them. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or connecting wallets to unverified platforms, and rely on official channels for information. As scammers become more sophisticated, the crypto community must remain proactive in protecting itself from exploitation. Venice AI Launches Privacy-Focused Token on Ethereum’s Base Network, Reaching $1 Billion Valuation in Hours In a remarkable debut, Venice AI, a privacy-focused artificial intelligence platform founded by Bitcoin pioneer Erik Voorhees, launched its self-titled Venice Token (VVV) on Ethereum’s layer-2 Base network on Jan. 27. Within just two hours of its launch, the token achieved a fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeding $1 billion, marking a significant milestone in the fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies. Data from decentralized exchange tracker DEXScreener reveals that VVV’s FDV climbed to more than $1 billion shortly after 6 PM UTC, less than two hours post-launch. By the end of the day, the token’s FDV had surged further to approximately $1.65 billion, with a circulating market capitalization of $306.4 million. Currently, 25 million tokens out of the total 100 million supply have been released to the public, while the number of token holders has surpassed 13,200, as per Basescan data. Venice AI’s rapid ascent in value signals strong market interest for its innovative offerings. The platform has positioned itself as a champion of privacy and censorship resistance in the AI space, leveraging blockchain technology to provide secure and private access to generative AI models. The Venice Token (VVV) serves more than just a financial purpose. According to a statement from the platform on Jan. 27, users who purchase and stake VVV gain free ongoing inference access to its API, enabling private and uncensored generative text, image, and code creation. The API supports models like DeepSeek’s newly released R-1, which has garnered significant attention for its capabilities. DeepSeek R-1, developed by the Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, has made waves for its performance, reportedly rivaling industry leader ChatGPT. However, concerns over data privacy and potential links to Chinese data collection practices have created turmoil in US markets. Erik Voorhees addressed these concerns directly, assuring users that when the R-1 model is accessed through Venice, “none of it is going anywhere,” reaffirming the platform’s commitment to data privacy and security. The distribution of the VVV token has been carefully structured to incentivize both users and developers. Of the 100 million total supply: 25 million tokens are allocated to 100,000 eligible Venice users. 25 million tokens are reserved for specific Base users, including holders of Aerodrome Finance (AERO) and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) tokens. 35% of tokens are allocated to Venice itself for platform development and operations. 10% are set aside for an incentive fund aimed at fostering ecosystem growth. 5% are allocated for liquidity to ensure smooth trading operations. An additional 14 million tokens will be emitted annually to maintain token availability and support the platform’s growth. Notably, Venice has chosen not to conduct a presale for outside investors and has refrained from implementing a governance mechanism, emphasizing its focus on utility over speculation. Since its launch in May 2024, Venice AI has amassed a user base of over 400,000 registered accounts, with an impressive 15,000 inference requests per hour. The platform’s focus on privacy and uncensored AI interactions has resonated with a global audience, particularly amid growing concerns over data misuse and censorship in mainstream AI applications. In addition to staking benefits, Venice has opened its API to AI agents, developers, and third-party applications, broadening its appeal and utility. The move aligns with Voorhees’ vision of empowering users and developers in a decentralized ecosystem. Erik Voorhees: From Bitcoin Pioneer to AI Innovator Erik Voorhees, a long-standing advocate for financial and data privacy, is no stranger to innovation. Before founding Venice AI, he made his mark as an early Bitcoin pioneer and the founder of the crypto exchange ShapeShift in 2014. Venice AI’s launch also coincides with the rise of DeepSeek R-1, a model that has disrupted traditional assumptions about AI by delivering high performance with lower computational requirements. Despite its controversial reception in the US, DeepSeek R-1’s capabilities have sparked a global conversation about the future of AI innovation and competition. The launch of Venice Token and its rapid valuation growth represent a pivotal moment in the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. By combining the privacy-first ethos of cryptocurrency with the transformative potential of generative AI, Venice AI is carving out a unique niche in an increasingly competitive landscape. As the platform continues to grow, its emphasis on data privacy, decentralization, and user empowerment is likely to attract more developers, investors, and users seeking alternatives to traditional AI platforms. Whether Venice can sustain its early momentum remains to be seen, but its successful token launch signals strong market confidence in its vision. With over 400,000 users already on board and a $1.65 billion FDV within hours of its token launch, Venice AI is poised to be a major player at the intersection of AI and blockchain. For privacy-conscious users and advocates of decentralized technology, Venice represents a beacon of what the future could hold.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-28 05:30:00

With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN.

Will JUP Price Mark A New ATH in February 2025? The JUP price has been defending the lower support zone around $0.8 since the start of the year, which has now become a strong base. As a result, the price triggered a strong rebound, printing massive bullish candles. Currently, the price appears to be poised to reclaim the interim highs just above $1.4, while more upswing is on the horizon. The daily chart of JUP appears to be extremely strong, as the bulls are leaving no stones unturned in holding the momentum upright. The 50/200-day MA’s bearish crossover had raised some concerns but the 50-day MA seems to be preparing for an immediate bullish crossover or the Golden Cross. Besides, the Chainlin Money flow has been hovering around the average or ‘0’, indicating the rally maintained its strength amid the recent selloff. Now that it has raised above ‘0’, it suggests an increase in the market’s strength. Therefore, Jupiter’s (JUP) price appears to be primed to test the local resistance at $1.3 anytime from now and a sustained breach could eventually push the price to the final resistance zone. Once this zone between $1.37 and $1.39 is tested and cleared, it could form a new ATH above $1.5 initially and later close to $2.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|JUP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-28 05:51:10

This latest acquisition saw the company spend approximately $1.1 billion on the market’s leading cryptocurrency from January 21 to January 26, as disclosed in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With these purchases, MicroStrategy now holds around 471,107 BTC, valued at roughly $30.4 billion, representing over 2% of the total Bitcoin supply that will ever exist. MicroStrategy Aims To Boost Bitcoin Holdings Beyond 500,000 To further finance its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, MicroStrategy has announced plans to sell $250 million in perpetual preferred stock, offering an attractive 8% fixed coupon. This stock will have a conversion price of $1,000, although details remain limited as the information is not yet public. The venture aims to bolster the company’s already substantial Bitcoin holdings, which are nearing the 500,000 BTC milestone. Related Reading: Want To Get Rich? Here’s How To Create A Coin Like XRP From Scratch—Expert MicroStrategy has employed various fundraising strategies, including at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings, with a goal of raising $42 billion in capital through 2027. The company’s stock has also shown remarkable growth, surging approximately 600% over the past year, although it experienced a slight decline of about 1.4% to $348.65 in early trading on Monday. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price fell around 2.5% to $101,500. Authorized Shares To Support Future Capital Raises MicroStrategy also announced recently that it would redeem over $1 billion of its 0% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2027 earlier than anticipated, with a planned redemption date of February 24. This move is intended to streamline the company’s financial obligations and provide greater flexibility for future capital raises. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer noted that this strategy would allow investors to focus on the company’s operations rather than potential financial impediments. Redeeming these notes could also pave the way for MicroStrategy to issue new convertible debt with longer maturities, enhancing its capital-raising options. The company plans to offer approximately 2.5 million shares of Series A perpetual strike preferred stock, which will be senior to its Class A common stock and provide regular quarterly dividends starting March 31.

Moreover, MicroStrategy has the green light from shareholders to significantly increase its authorized shares—from 330 million to 10.3 billion for Class A common stock—enabling it to pursue further equity offerings. This decision aligns with the company’s ongoing efforts to maintain liquidity and support its ambitious Bitcoin acquisition strategy without needing to liquidate its holdings. Saylor emphasized the company’s liquidity position, asserting, “We’ve had and expect to continue to have ample access to liquidity through our capital markets activities and cash flows from operations.” The firm’s co-founder further reassured investors that the company has no intention of selling its Bitcoin to meet interest obligations, reinforcing MicroStrategy’s commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy.
