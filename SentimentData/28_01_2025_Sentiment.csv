Wall Street analysts hint that such a surprising scene is about to unfold again with a currently underrated AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) . They believe this AI coin will outpace Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin this year, leaving many shocked while bringing mouth-watering gains to wise investors. Cheap WallitIQ (WLTQ) Could Beat Shiba Inu (SHIB) And Dogecoin Wall Street analysts recognize that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin are long-standing players in the crypto world. Shiba Inu (SHIB) became one in 2021, when it rose volcanically by about 40,000,000%, driven by community support and broader market sentiment for meme coins. That year, it hit an all-time high of $0.00008616. Despite many predictions that followed, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has traded way below that point ever since, currently around $0.000020. Similarly, Dogecoin gained massive popularity in 2021 when it hit an all-time high of $0.73. This was followed by a sharp correction, dropping below $0.3 by the end of the year. Ever since, Dogecoin has faced highs and lows, with predictions indicating a possible surge in 2025. Wall Street analysts expect a bullish crypto extra in 2025 and foretell that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin could see fair rises. However, they predict that whatever these two major players bring will fall behind what a new AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), will deliver. This AI coin is highly innovative and has many untapped opportunities. With its powerful features, Wall Street analysts say it is well-positioned to dominate the $600 billion crypto wallet and AI market. They expect the AI coin to generate at least $5 million in monthly revenue. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Irresistible AI Features Attracts Investors Worldwide Wall Street analysts have good reason to back WallitIQ (WLTQ) over Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin. In explaining their stance, they mention that this new AI coin is rapidly attracting investors with edge-cutting AI-crypto features. Many of these features are already live on the crypto wallet management app, which the platform launched recently. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) app features a fully interactive candlestick chart , allowing users to analyze price trends for various crypto tickers over different timeframes. It’s also fully connected to the CoinGecko API , allowing users to view real-time prices for each currency. Additionally, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) interface is highly intuitive, with a responsive and visually attractive design. Soon, users will be able to do more by personalizing their price alerts and wallet updates. This innovative AI coin platform also improves crypto management by allowing users to run simulated ETH and USDT wallet management. It also supports running virtual ETH and USDT transfers to foreign addresses. That’s not all. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is well future-proof, as it includes placeholders for upcoming features on its settings page. It, therefore, demonstrates its scalability for improved features in the future. The platform has shown its reliability by completing a smart contract audit with SolidProof , a trusted agency in the crypto world. In response, Wall Street analysts and other big investors are rapidly boarding its train, assured of big gains. In its previous presale, the native altcoin raised over $6 million and sold about 350 million tokens. Such rapid adoption is bound to skyrocket its price in no time. Therefore, the ongoing presale, where the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is selling for $0.0420 only, will soon be over. Conclusion Wall Street analysts have picked WallitIQ (WLTQ) as the best choice for good reason. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin have long held their place as community favorites, this AI coin is shaping up to be the breakout star of 2025. For any investor who wants to make life-changing gains this year, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is the best entry point. The chance to join is still available for $0.0420 only. Before it jumps 50% to the next price and you miss out on such a sweet deal, join the promising AI coin’s presale now.

RCO Finance (RCOF) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and Hedera (HBAR) are three coins under $1 that could skyrocket by 2025. With the right moves, these coins might turn small investments into life-changing returns. Could these be the hidden gems that make investors rich? 1. RCO Finance RCO Finance is making a big impact in the DeFi space by combining AI technology with blockchain. This innovative approach makes RCO Finance a top choice for investors seeking profits and cutting-edge financial solutions. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy, RCO Finance is definitely worth considering. At the heart of RCO Finance is its intelligent robo-advisor, an AI trading tool that provides users with customized investment strategies. This tool helps users make informed decisions, even if they have little financial knowledge. The robo-advisor analyzes real-time data from credible sources, providing accurate advice that enables traders to make data-backed decisions quickly. RCO Finance’s tokenomics are designed to sustain the project and prevent liquidity issues. A significant portion of tokens is allocated for public sale, ensuring equal access to all and promoting community development. This approach helps build trust among investors and promotes a healthy trading environment. The RCO Finance platform offers users access to multiple trading assets, including traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This allows users to diversify portfolios and balance their risks and returns. With its diverse asset offerings, RCO Finance is an attractive option for investors seeking to minimize risk. To protect users, RCO Finance has partnered with SolidProof to conduct regular audits of its smart contracts. This partnership demonstrates the platform’s commitment to ensuring the safety of investors’ assets and promoting a trustworthy trading environment, which can positively impact the best altcoins. And the best part? You can access all these features on its recently launched beta platform . 2. DOGE Dogecoin’s market cap has surged 14% to $58 billion after a new government website featuring the Dogecoin logo appeared. The website was registered by a US government employee, confirming its connection to the government. This development has sparked interest in Dogecoin and most of the best altcoins. In price terms, DOGE rose and is now selling at $0.397, sparking renewed discussions about its potential to hit the $1 mark. The recent launch of a new government website has significantly boosted Dogecoin among the best altcoins. Analysts and traders are optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, citing technical patterns and market trends that could drive a rally taking Dogecoin to $1 or more, potentially generating over 50,000% ROI for investors. 3. HBAR A major development for Hedera Hashgraph is the filing of an HBAR exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If approved, this ETF would allow investors to buy HBAR directly. Additionally, Hedera is allocating 4.86 billion HBAR, worth around $408 million, to develop its ecosystem and improve governance. The project is also partnering with Nvidia and Chainlink to integrate artificial intelligence and advanced data oracles into its network. The price of HBAR declined in the last seven days. With a decline of 14.67%, HBAR currently stands at $0.3272. The best altcoins’ analysts think HBAR is forming a bullish pattern, which could send its price soaring to $2.30. If this happens, HBAR could increase by up to 50,000% or more, making it an auspicious investment opportunity. RCOF Makes Headlines Ahead of the Best Altcoins with $11 Million Token Presale RCOF is gaining attention as a standout altcoin, having raised over $11 million in its ongoing token presale. With its current price at $0.1, analysts predict a remarkable surge of over 500% during the remaining presale phases. This presents a prime investment opportunity for those looking to buy into a promising altcoin. If predictions go as planned, the RCOF coin could even soar and reach a listing price of $0.60 by the end of the presale. Also, some experts forecast a massive price rise of around 43,000% by the end of the year. Of course, this makes RCOF an exciting investment prospect, mainly due to its potential for long-term growth. RCOF token holders can also look forward to quarterly dividends and rewards based on their holdings. This added benefit makes RCOF an attractive choice for investors seeking growth and regular returns, making it one of the best crypto investments to consider.

Analyst Reveals When Price Will Crash To $50,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-crash-to-50000/,"The Bitcoin price has long been celebrated for its explosive growth during bull market periods. However, its cyclic nature, which consists of both a bull and a bear market, often leaves many market watchers unprepared for inevitable crashes. If history is any guide, a crypto analyst predicts that Bitcoin will skyrocket to a new price peak in 2025 and hit the end of the road after crashing to $50,000 in 2026. Despite the anticipated bull run in 2025, historical data suggests that Bitcoin could soon experience a significant market correction. TradingView analyst Xanrox said in a recent report that BTC’s price will crash to $50,000 in 2026. Analyst Calls For BTC Price Crash To $50,000 The analyst explained that statistically, Bitcoin’s price tends to crash by 77% to 86% every four years. Moreover, his predicted price decline to $50,000 aligns with past bull cycle patterns, where Bitcoin sheds substantial value after every bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims For $150,000-$170,000 With Wave Formation, Here Are The Details Presenting a chart, the analyst highlighted the estimated durations of the Bitcoin bull and bear market. He disclosed that the bull market often lasts between 742 and 1,065 days, while the bear market typically lasts 344 to 413 days. Although previous cycles saw Bitcoin correcting to severe levels, Xanrox suggests that this upcoming crash will be much weaker due to the market’s maturing structure and the involvement of institutions. He predicts that Bitcoin will plummet by 65%, leaving many investors at a loss when they sell at low prices. Nevertheless, the TradingView analyst asserts that the downturn could present a potential buying opportunity for investors who understand the cyclical nature of the Bitcoin market. Xanrox confirmed that the market is in the final stage of the 4-year bull cycle, which should end between February and November 2025. The analyst forecasts Bitcoin’s next market top at $125,000 in 2025, after which the price crash to $50,000 is expected by 2026. Consequently, he advises investors and traders to consider selling their holdings as the price approaches the peak and to ignore “moon boys” who propose unrealistic targets of $500,000 or $1 million for BTC. He also asserts that a surge to these ambitious targets was near impossible, as it would require an enormous market capitalization for Bitcoin. How The Bitcoin Halving Influences Market Prices According to Xanrox’s chart analysis, Bitcoin price trends have consistently followed a 4-year halving cycle, which is a historical event for the crypto market. During each halving period, the block reward for miners is cut in half, reducing the number of new BTC entering the circulation. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Retest Substantially Below $100,000 If This Level Fails The TradingView analyst disclosed that investors well versed in Bitcoin halving patterns and prepared for the projected cyclic crash would be well positioned to capitalize on his projected crash to $50,000. These investors would see a Bitcoin decline as an “incredible investment opportunity, maximizing profits on funding fees as they short Bitcoin at the top. Unsurprisingly, Xanrox’s projected drop to $50,000 aligns with the typical bear market period that follows a BTC price peak. Historically, each 4-year halving cycle has included both a bull run and a bear market, with the latter signaling that the cycle is ending.

As blockchain technology continues to disrupt industries and push adoption rates higher, several cryptocurrencies stand out as top contenders for massive growth. But which coin will truly dominate the market and deliver the highest returns ahead of the next big rally? Web3Bay (3BAY): The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce space by introducing a decentralized marketplace built on blockchain technology. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay rely on centralized control, often charging high fees and monopolizing user data. Web3Bay eliminates these issues by creating a platform where buyers and sellers transact directly, with complete transparency and reduced costs. Web3Bay’s presale has already raised nearly $1 million, signaling strong investor confidence. At a presale price of $0.004562, the native token, 3BAY, offers early investors an incredible opportunity. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early adopters could see a 4,193% ROI . If Web3Bay achieves its long-term goal of disrupting the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry, the token could climb even higher, potentially hitting $0.50 or more in the years ahead. Web3Bay leverages blockchain’s transparency and security to empower users. Its smart contract-based architecture ensures secure, automated transactions, while decentralized storage solutions like IPFS protect user data. Additionally, Web3Bay operates under a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), allowing token holders to shape the platform’s future through governance votes. Bitcoin (BTC): The Undisputed Leader Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, remains the most recognized and trusted cryptocurrency in the market. Its status as a store of value and hedge against inflation has only strengthened as institutional adoption increases. With limited supply and growing demand, Bitcoin is a reliable choice for both new and seasoned investors. Bitcoin’s price has seen consistent growth during past bull runs, and many analysts predict that it could reach $182,000 or more during the next rally. This growth would be driven by factors such as the 2024 halving event, which will reduce mining rewards and create a supply shock, as well as increasing institutional interest from companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and others. Ethereum (ETH): The Foundation of Web3 Ethereum powers the majority of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces, making it the backbone of the Web3 ecosystem. Its recent transition to Ethereum 2.0 has improved scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction speeds, positioning it for long-term growth. Currently priced around $3000, Ethereum is expected to climb to $10,000 or more during the 2025 bull run, representing a 270% ROI . This growth will be fueled by the increasing number of developers building on Ethereum, as well as the continued adoption of Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. Solana (SOL): The Speed King Solana has gained widespread recognition for its high-speed and low-cost transactions, making it a favorite for developers building decentralized applications and NFTs. Its ability to process over 65,000 transactions per second sets it apart from competitors like Ethereum. Solana’s current price of $258 could soar to $1,000 or higher in the next bull run, offering a 287% ROI . Its growing ecosystem, which includes partnerships with major companies like Google Cloud, ensures continued adoption and expansion. Cardano (ADA): The Eco-Friendly Blockchain Cardano is a research-driven blockchain that prioritizes sustainability, scalability, and security. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is not only energy-efficient but also highly scalable, making it an eco-friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Currently priced under $1, Cardano offers an affordable entry point for investors. With predictions of ADA reaching $5 or more, it could deliver a 400% ROI during the 2025 bull run. Final Thoughts The 2025 bull run promises to be one of the most exciting periods in cryptocurrency history, with projects like Web3Bay, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano leading the charge. Each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique value propositions and growth potential, making them strong candidates for investment. Web3Bay stands out for its innovative approach to e-commerce and massive ROI potential, while Bitcoin provides stability and long-term value. Ethereum’s dominance in decentralized applications, Solana’s high-speed infrastructure, and Cardano’s eco-friendly solutions round out a diverse portfolio for the upcoming rally.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , CoinShares says that institutional crypto investment vehicles raked in nearly $2 billion last week alone. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US$1.9bn last week bringing year-to-date (YTD) inflows to US$4.8bn — likely as a result of recent presidential executive orders that proposed the initiation of a strategic reserve asset in Bitcoin. Despite the relatively flat price action last week, trading volumes were high at US$25bn for the week, comprising 37% of all trading volumes on trusted crypto exchanges.” Source: CoinShares The United States regionally led international inflows, raking in $1.7 billion of the $1.9 billion in inflows. Canada, Switzerland and Germany provided $31 million, $35 million, and $23 million, respectively. Bitcoin ( BTC ), per usual, snatched up the lion’s share of inflows. “Bitcoin saw inflows totaling US$1.6bn, bringing YTD inflows to US$4.4bn, accounting for 92% of all inflows in the digital asset sector. Following Bitcoin’s pre-inauguration new all-time highs last week, it was no surprise to see short-Bitcoin ETFs regain traction, with inflows of US$5.1 million.” Ethereum ( ETH ) led altcoins with $205 million in inflows, bringing YTD ETH inflows to $177 million. With the exception of Cardano ( ADA ), no crypto institutional investment products suffered outflows last week.

Bessent, a billionaire former hedge fund manager, didn't give the crypto sector much to chew on during his nomination hearing earlier this month, but he's a known digital assets enthusiast. His boss, Trump, has already assigned him a spot on the team assigned to marshal the federal government toward a friendly system of oversight. The Senate voted 68-29 to approve Bessent's nomination Monday evening, and he'll officially join Trump's cabinet when he's sworn in to permanently replace predecessor Janet Yellen. At the center of Trump's agenda is the extension of tax cuts, so that top priority may shove crypto down the list, though the president did include it among his opening salvo of executive orders. Senator Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican who chairs the Senate Financial Committee, called Bessent ""one of the sharpest minds in the global finance industry"" before the Monday confirmation, saying ""his background and training are tailor-made for this role."" Trump's crypto order will have Bessent's Treasury taking a role on a governmental working group — backed by ""individual expertise from leaders in digital assets and digital markets"" — to hash out the strategy for U.S. crypto policy. His department is among those who'll owe the White House a report in less than two months on how to modify existing regulations or establish new ones at the Treasury, and the wider group must ""recommend regulatory and legislative proposals"" within six months. He'll also be responsible for erasing his predecessor's crypto work that had been directed by former President Joe Biden. The order also bans work on a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), which had never progressed beyond the tire-kicking stage in the U.S., despite enthusiastic adoption and testing by other jurisdictions, including China. As a nominee, the ex-chief of Key Square Group told senators in his confirmation hearing that he saw ""no reason"" to pursue the idea of a domestic CBDC, further endearing himself to crypto insiders who have been nervous the government might pursue a digital dollar. But he wasn't questioned about crypto policies. Still, Bessent is no stranger to digital assets. He'd tucked hundreds of thousands of dollars of his personal wealth into a bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), as noted in his lengthy financial disclosures. Those assets were liquidated when he received Trump's nomination. At the Treasury, Bessent is also in command of its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that had pursued crypto services with enforcement actions and rulemaking , especially involving so-called mixing services that seek to grant users anonymity by blending their transactions to make it difficult to track them. The Treasury's financial-crimes arm had focused on digital assets as a popular means of transaction in human trafficking and child exploitation . Bessent's department additionally manages U.S. financial sanctions , which have historically given the federal government reach into overseas activity, such as when it targeted mixer Tornado Cash with sanctions that were recently overturned in federal court .

AAVE has been buzzing with increased whale activity and institutional backing, while Litecoin’s impressive 25% rally following Grayscale’s spot ETF filing has made it a standout performer. Both coins are showing immense potential for short-term gains with their strong market momentum and solid fundamentals. But Qubetics ($TICS) is a game-changer in its own right. This innovative Web3 aggregator is redefining blockchain technology by solving interoperability issues and uniting major blockchains into a single ecosystem. With over $11.1 million raised in its ongoing presale and jaw-dropping ROI predictions, Qubetics is proving why it’s one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. Qubetics Tackles Blockchain Interoperability Interoperability has been a roadblock in the crypto space, with blockchains operating in isolation and hindering seamless transactions. Qubetics changes the game as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, integrating major networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into a unified ecosystem. This makes cross-chain asset transfers and data sharing smoother than ever. Picture a logistics company relying on multiple blockchains for payments and supply chain tracking. Without interoperability, they’re stuck juggling complex processes. Enter Qubetics, simplifying everything by connecting these chains seamlessly, saving time and resources. From developers building multi-chain dApps to everyday users transferring assets, Qubetics bridges the gap for all, cementing its status as one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term . Qubetics Presale Surges Past $11.1 Million Qubetics’ presale continues to dominate, currently in its 19th stage. With over $11.1 million raised, more than 16,700 token holders, and 448 million $TICS tokens sold, it’s clear this project has the attention of serious investors. Each presale stage lasts seven days, with prices increasing by 10% every Sunday at midnight. At its current price of $0.0606, $TICS offers incredible ROI potential. Analysts predict a price of $0.25 at the end of the presale, translating to a 312.17% ROI. Post-presale, the numbers get even more enticing: $1 ($TICS) delivers a 1548.70% ROI, while a price of $10 after its Q2 2025 mainnet launch equals a staggering 16,387.05% ROI. For example, investing $1,250 now would net you 20,608.82 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $10, that same investment turns into $206,088. With analysts projecting even higher returns, there’s no better time to join the Qubetics presale. AAVE Gains Momentum With Whale and Institutional Backing AAVE has become a centerpiece in the DeFi market, thanks to a surge in whale activity and strong institutional support. Recently, a whale deposited 17,002 AAVE worth $5.9 million onto Binance, sparking speculation about future price movements. This follows an earlier $13.5 million profit (+330%) from the same whale’s trades, underscoring their bullish sentiment. Adding to this momentum is the Ethereum Foundation’s $165 million allocation to AAVE through a 50,000 ETH fund. This substantial capital boost strengthens AAVE’s liquidity and reinforces its integration within Ethereum’s ecosystem, signaling long-term confidence in the platform. The multi-signature wallet setup accompanying the funds ensures security and transparency, attracting more institutional investors. AAVE is also exploring innovative strategies for growth. One proposal involves integrating Bitcoin mining revenues into its treasury, diversifying income streams, and increasing scalability. Another plan focuses on incorporating the GHO stablecoin into Bitcoin transactions, potentially positioning AAVE as a key player in both DeFi and Bitcoin-based finance. Combined with a bullish symmetrical triangle technical setup, AAVE is well-positioned for a breakout once it clears the $372 resistance level. Litecoin Rides a 25% Rally With Spot ETF Hype Litecoin (LTC) has seen a 25% price surge following Grayscale’s filing for a spot Litecoin ETF. This news has attracted significant demand from institutional investors, validating the efforts of long-term holders (LTHs) who have consistently supported LTC through market fluctuations. The MVRV Long/Short Difference indicator remains highly positive, showing that LTHs are in profit and providing stability to the Litecoin market. This group of investors plays a crucial role in reducing price volatility by holding onto their assets instead of selling during fluctuations. Their consistent backing has enabled Litecoin to sustain its bullish momentum even in challenging market conditions. Supporting this bullish outlook is the IOMAP metric, which reveals that over 2 million LTC, valued at $256 million, were purchased in the $128 to $135 range. If Litecoin flips $136 into support, it could unlock these profits and propel the price to $147. However, failure to breach this level could result in a pullback to $117 or $105, highlighting the importance of breaking through this key resistance point. A Final Look at the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term Qubetics, AAVE, and Litecoin are each making waves in the crypto world, offering unique opportunities for investors seeking short-term gains. Qubetics stands out with its revolutionary interoperability solutions and record-breaking presale, offering unmatched ROI potential. AAVE impresses with its whale-driven momentum, Ethereum backing, and innovative growth strategies. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s strong rally and long-term holder support make it a reliable choice for continued bullish momentum. For those looking to maximize their investments, Qubetics offers an unbeatable chance to join the Qubetics presale and capitalize on one of the most promising projects in the crypto space today.

Per Seoul Shinmun , South Korean crypto traders are “troubled.” They are concerned by the fact that the holiday “overlaps with the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming base rate decision,” the outlet wrote. South Korean Crypto Community: Time to HODL, Sell, or Buy? As such, the outlet reported, domestic traders are unsure if they should hold, pre-emptively sell, or even buy coins during the holiday. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit over the past year. (Source: CoinGecko) This year, Lunar New Year falls on January 29. But in South Korea – as the days prior to and following New Year’s Day are also public holidays – most firms are also giving their workers the day off on Monday (27) and Friday (31). That means that, including the two weekends, most workers have nine days off this year. But while the South Korean stock market will be inactive during the holidays, the 24/7 nature of crypto means no such slowdown is expected in the coin markets. The media outlet said Upbit crypto exchange data shows domestic Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) prices trended upward “during the Lunar New Year holiday for the past three years.” Korea started the Lunar New Year holiday with scattered rain and snow flurries on Monday, although most areas have seen only a few snowflakes. https://t.co/DxMw9syGcV — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) January 27, 2025 Holiday Uncertainty for Traders Kim (first name withheld) is a Seoul-based crypto trader. He told Cryptonews.com that the holiday period would likely be full of “uncertainty” this year. Kim said: “It will be a bit of a nail-biting time if the Fed or US President Donald Trump make announcements. If so, the South Korean market will probably respond fast. But traders are always ready for volatility in the markets. We just have to stay alert. That’s the nature of trading crypto.” The holiday period, however, has also seen significant drops. These have included instances of day-on-day drops of up to 5%. The top five coins per trading volume on the South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb on January 27, 2025. (Source: CoinMarketCap) For South Korean traders, almost everything will hinge on events in the USA, the media outlet reported. Domestic regulators and politicians are unlikely to make any major announcements during the holidays. So events in Washington will likely be the driving force behind any price movements on domestic platforms. Seoul Shinmun noted that “since the election of Trump ,” interest “in cryptocurrency investment has increased in South Korea.” The Fed is widely expected to freeze its current benchmark interest rate of 4.25-4.50% at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which kicks off on January 28. South Korea is undergoing an unprecedented political crisis with impeached President Yoon facing one legal proceeding that could oust him from office and another that brings a possible death penalty. Here's what to know. https://t.co/jKB92C62QD — Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) January 27, 2025 Experts Speak The crypto services provider Matrixport told the same media outlet: “In the past 12 years, Bitcoin has risen 11 times during the Lunar New Year holiday period. Negative factors such as the Fed’s hawkish stance are putting downward pressure on the markets. But positive factors, like expectations about a forthcoming strategic Bitcoin reserve in the US, are supporting BTC prices. So there is a high probability of an increase in the days following the Lunar New Year holiday.” An unnamed domestic crypto exchange employee told Seoul Shinmun: “Since Trump’s election, market liquidity has increased rapidly. And South Korean trading volumes here have increased to a level surpassing that of the stock market. The crypto market operates 24 hours a day and is highly volatile. So people would be wise to take a cautious approach.” The post South Korean Crypto Investors Face ‘Nail-biting’ Lunar New Year Conundrum appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|South Korea|Trading,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-27 23:30:00
33767162,[object Object],1738020633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Taker Order Bearish Pressure Hits Highest Level Since January 9 – Market Remains Stable For Now,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-taker-order-bearish-pressure-hits-highest-level-since-january-9-market-remains-stable-for-now/,"Bitcoin has slipped below the $100K mark for the first time in 10 days, sparking a wave of bearish sentiment across the market. The drop has fueled uncertainty among investors, who are closely watching the next move. However, many analysts view this pullback as a healthy retrace, potentially setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next leg higher in the ongoing bullish cycle. Axel Adler, a prominent crypto analyst, shared key insights on X, shedding light on the current state of the market. According to Adler, Taker order bearish pressure stands at $1.6 billion over the past 24 hours—a notably high level not seen in the last month. This indicates significant selling activity but also reflects high trading volume, suggesting that market participants are actively positioning for what could be an important phase for Bitcoin. Despite the bearish sentiment , many experts believe the retrace is necessary to build momentum for the next rally. The $96K-$100K range is now a crucial zone to watch, with bulls needing to reclaim $100K quickly to reignite optimism. A strong bounce from these levels could validate the retrace as a consolidation phase rather than a trend reversal, keeping Bitcoin on track for further gains. Bitcoin Faces Volatility: Healthy Retrace Below $100K? Bitcoin’s price has been on a rollercoaster for weeks, with volatility and uncertainty dominating the market narrative. After reaching a high of $109K, the cryptocurrency has dipped below the $100K mark, sparking debates about whether this is the cycle’s top or just a temporary pullback. While some analysts suggest Bitcoin may have peaked, others argue this correction is a healthy retrace that could fuel the next leg up. Prominent crypto analyst Axel Adler weighed in on the situation, sharing insights on X . Adler revealed that Taker order bearish pressure has surged to $1.6 billion over the past 24 hours—an unusually high level for the past month. The last time bearish pressure was this elevated was on January 9, when it peaked at $1.8 billion. Despite these figures, Adler remains optimistic, noting that everything appears to be under control for now, as long as key support levels hold. This retrace raises key questions: Could this be Bitcoin’s final major pullback before surging to new all-time highs? How long will this consolidation phase last, and could prices dip even lower before finding support? For now, investors and analysts are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s critical levels around $96K-$100K. Holding above these thresholds could pave the way for a rally back toward $109K and beyond. However, failure to defend these support zones might lead to extended consolidation or deeper corrections. As Bitcoin navigates this pivotal moment, market participants remain hopeful that this pullback is simply a prelude to the next significant move, potentially propelling the cryptocurrency into uncharted territory. BTC Price Eyes Recovery Above $100K Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $99,000, stabilizing after testing its 4-hour 200 moving average around $98,500. This level has historically acted as a strong support and could serve as a launching pad for a recovery. If BTC manages to hold above this key technical level, a quick bounce back toward the $100K mark is on the table. Despite the potential for recovery, there remains a possibility of further downside. If BTC fails to maintain its position above the 4-hour 200 moving average, the price could slide to test lower demand zones around the $96K mark. Such a move would likely create more consolidation before bulls attempt another push higher. The critical level for bulls remains $100K. A decisive surge above this psychological barrier in the coming days could reinvigorate market sentiment and set the stage for a rally toward the all-time high (ATH). Breaking above $100K would not only signal renewed bullish momentum but also confirm that Bitcoin remains on track to explore uncharted price territory.

Faced with these warnings, some are joining a meme coin shift to utility, looking for tokens that solve real problems. Among these picks, a fresh project called Remittix stands out as a strong contender for future success. Shiba Inu and Pepe Show Signs of Struggle After a period of intense hype, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down -6.96% over the month, while Pepe (PEPE) dropped -12.24%. Critics say these meme coins rely on social media buzz more than practical uses. While Shiba Inu tries adding features for loyal fans, many doubt it can stay strong in the face of competition. As a result, more investors see a meme coin shift to utility happening, where coins like Remittix may offer stable growth. Likewise, Pepe soared on memes but lacks a clear plan for long-term adoption. Many who once praised Pepe (PEPE) for quick gains now worry about future crashes. Observers note that meme-based tokens can tumble just as fast as they rise. Hoping to avoid major losses, holders of both Shiba Inu and Pepe look at tokens built for real use cases—like Remittix (RTX), which addresses cross-border payments. The Appeal of Utility Tokens Experts link the meme coin shift to utility to rising demand for coins that can fix real finance issues. While Shiba Inu captured attention through meme culture, it now faces a crowded market. Meanwhile, Pepe struggles to keep up if big holders exit. By contrast, Remittix focuses on cheap, fast transfers, drawing interest from those who value direct benefits over internet hype. Supporters say Remittix (RTX) outperforms meme tokens by tackling everyday challenges. It aims to reduce fees on international payments, helping families, freelancers, and businesses. This focus on real-world solutions has driven many Shiba Inu and Pepe holders to join its presale. By merging user-friendly transactions with the fun side of crypto, Remittix stands to eclipse older meme coins in the next few years. Remittix Prepares for 2025 Dominance With many predicting a decline for both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) in 2025, the stage is set for Remittix (RTX) to shine. Some investors foresee 100x returns if Remittix gains enough traction. Unlike meme tokens, it doesn’t rely on surprise tweets or viral spikes; instead, it builds steady demand by solving cross-border finance woes. This steady growth could give Remittix a lasting edge, especially if more users adopt it for daily transactions. The meme coin shift to utility suggests people now prefer tokens that help them save on remittances or speed up global payments. By 2025, experts think Remittix may outlive weaker meme coins, proving that practical solutions often beat short-lived hype cycles. Conclusion While Shiba Inu and Pepe once drew large followings, many now doubt their longevity. Fearing crashes by 2025, holders from both groups seem eager to join the meme coin shift to utility. Leading this trend, Remittix (RTX) offers fast, low-cost transfers that appeal to anyone wanting real worth in a coin. With its user-focused approach, Remittix appears ready to become a top choice for those seeking stability beyond memes.

Consequently, more investors are witnessing a shift from meme coins to utility tokens, with Remittix potentially offering more stable growth opportunities. Similarly, Pepe gained popularity through memes but lacks a solid plan for sustained adoption. Many who once admired Pepe (PEPE) for its rapid gains now fear potential downturns. Observers point out that meme-based tokens can fall as quickly as they rise. To avoid significant losses, holders of both Shiba Inu and Pepe are turning to tokens designed for real-world applications—such as Remittix (RTX), which targets cross-border payment solutions. The Attraction of Utility Tokens Experts attribute the trend from meme coins to utility tokens to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies that address genuine financial challenges. While Shiba Inu captivated audiences through memes, it now faces stiff competition in a crowded market. Meanwhile, Pepe struggles to maintain momentum if major holders decide to sell. In contrast, Remittix emphasizes cost-effective and speedy transactions, appealing to those who prioritize tangible benefits over online buzz. Advocates claim Remittix (RTX) surpasses meme tokens by addressing everyday issues. Its goal is to lower fees on international transactions, benefiting families, freelancers, and businesses alike. This real-world focus has attracted numerous Shiba Inu and Pepe holders to its presale. By combining user-friendly transactions with the engaging aspects of cryptocurrency, Remittix is poised to surpass older meme coins in the coming years. Remittix Gears Up for Dominance in 2025 With predictions of a downturn for both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) in 2025, Remittix (RTX) is positioned to take the spotlight. Some investors anticipate 100x returns if Remittix gains sufficient traction. Unlike meme tokens, it doesn't depend on unexpected tweets or viral trends; instead, it aims to create consistent demand by resolving issues in cross-border finance. This steady growth could provide Remittix with a lasting advantage, especially as more users begin using it for everyday transactions. The shift from meme coins to utility tokens indicates that people now prefer cryptocurrencies that help them save on remittances or expedite global payments. By 2025, experts predict Remittix may outlast weaker meme coins, demonstrating that practical solutions often triumph over fleeting hype. Conclusion While Shiba Inu and Pepe once attracted large numbers of followers, doubts about their sustainability are growing. With concerns over potential declines by 2025, holders from both communities are eager to embrace the shift from meme coins to utility tokens. Leading this movement, Remittix (RTX) offers quick, affordable transfers that appeal to those seeking genuine value in a cryptocurrency. With its user-oriented strategy, Remittix is poised to become a preferred choice for individuals looking for stability beyond memes.

These three meme coins are redefining what it means to invest in crypto with a story-driven approach that’s both engaging and profitable. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) emerges as a trailblazer in the icy wilderness of myths and untold mysteries. Its adventurous narrative takes investors through uncharted locations, with each presale tied to an exclusive story and realm.

This article explores the top meme coins to invest in 2025 , diving deep into Arctic Pablo Coin, Turbo, and Book of Meme. Each has its own charm, but only one may deliver the adventure and returns you’re seeking. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Mystical Journey with Enormous ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement. Imagine venturing into hidden icy realms and uncovering mystical $APC coins—tokens not just of monetary value but also of adventure and discovery. Arctic Pablo’s current location, El-Dorado, marks the sixth phase of its journey, with over $500,000 already raised. Early investors see a lifetime opportunity with an ROI potential exceeding 20,918% from presale to launch. Here’s where it gets even more enticing: Arctic Pablo Coin employs a robust burn mechanism, permanently eliminating unsold tokens weekly during the presale. This deflationary approach boosts scarcity, driving up the value of each coin. Arctic Pablo’s total supply is set at 221,200,000,000 APC, with public presales making up 50% of that. With its adventurous narrative and unique tokenomics, Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a ticket to an extraordinary journey. Investing $100 in Arctic Pablo today at $0.000038 would yield 2,630,105 APC coins. Upon listing at $0.008, that investment balloons to $21,040.84. Add to this the chance to stake your $APC tokens for a dazzling 66% APY, and you’ve got a coin that rewards both active traders and long-term holders. Arctic Pablo Coin’s narrative bridges the gap between myth and reality. Its unique storytelling captivates investors while creating wealth-generation opportunities as it travels through realms like Snowy Shores and now El-Dorado. The final presale price of $0.0008 and launch price of $0.008 make it a steal for early adopters. Book of Meme: The Humor-Fueled Investment Powerhouse Book of Meme (BOME) is more than just a token; it’s a tribute to meme culture. Trading at $0.003220, it boasts a trading volume of $89,324,399 over the last 24 hours, cementing its place as a serious contender among meme coins. With a circulating supply of 68,953,211,632 BOME coins, it’s an investor’s delight for those looking to ride the wave of humor-driven crypto. Book of Meme thrives on community engagement, making it one of the top meme coins to invest in. Its tokenomics are straightforward yet effective. With every transaction, a portion is redistributed among holders, ensuring that loyal investors are continuously rewarded. It’s this combination of humor and utility that has catapulted Book of Meme to prominence. Turbo: Speed Meets Simplicity in Meme Coins Turbo ($TURBO) is the high-octane meme coin investors can’t stop talking about. Trading at $0.004824 with a market cap of $332,842,021, Turbo’s allure lies in its straightforward tokenomics and massive trading volume of $91,943,411. Unlike Arctic Pablo’s adventurous narrative or Book of Meme’s humor-centric appeal, Turbo keeps it simple: limited supply, high demand, and a strong community. With 69,000,000,000 TURBO coins in circulation, it offers investors a unique opportunity to capitalize on scarcity-driven value appreciation. Turbo’s recent 17.41% price dip might seem like a red flag, but seasoned investors know it’s a potential entry point. Turbo thrives on momentum, and its community’s engagement ensures that the coin remains relevant and desirable. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Book of Meme, and Turbo each bring something unique to the table. Arctic Pablo Coin combines adventure, high ROI potential, and an engaging narrative to captivate investors. Book of Meme offers humor-fueled community engagement with profitable tokenomics, while Turbo’s simplicity and efficiency make it an appealing option for fast-paced traders.

They made the most of the Shiba Inu pump and are about to do the same with the budding 1Fuel . This has put crypto traders on their heels, as they hope to buy into 1Fuel before it's too late. The new token is billed for a massive upward rally and may yield explosive profits for proactive investors. This makes it a good crypto asset to have in your portfolio now. Can Shiba Inu return explosive yield like the early days? Shiba Inu gained popularity due to its early gains of up to 10,000x in May 2021. The meme coin became an Internet sensation getting endorsement from major market movers like Elon Musk. Shiba Inu quickly rose in prominence and was able to make early position holders wealthier. The Shiba Inu token remains a prominent token in the crypto space, ranking 17th, with about $11b market cap. However, Shiba Inu isn't looking as promising as before. The meme coin is on a downward run, dipping by about 17% in the past month. Shiba Inu is now below its $0.000020 critical support level, trading at $0.000018 currently. Analysts say the chances for an explosive run from Shiba Inu looks slim. But they expect the meme coin to reverse its dip in the coming month gradually. Shiba Inu could rally back to its $0.000024 monthly high in February, possibly ending Q1, 2025, at $0.000030. 1Fuel: Early investors eye Shiba Inu-like returns Crypto investors have been on the lookout for the next 10,000x token and 1Fuel may just be the one they are looking for. The new token is gaining high traction despite just being a presale token. Top investors see 1Fuel as a low risk purchase with a high tendency to yield high returns. Hence, many are positioning themselves to gain from it massively. The presale token is valued at $0.017 currently, but could be worth double by the next phase. This makes it important to join early, to enjoy low-price entry and potential high-margin return. The projection for the 1Fuel token is high and joining the presale at this early position could bring up to 1000x. Patience investors may even enjoy higher yield than that from 1Fuel. The 1Fuel project is among those expected to disrupt the DeFi space. The crypto project will come with a cold storage feature and technologies to make trading easier and more efficient. This will put 1Fuel amongst the most used platforms for cross-chain trading and asset management. The crypto solution will also resolve concerns about privacy by introducing a military-grade mixer to conceal users’ sensitive data. This will guarantee anonymity and ensure users' privacy is well protected. 1Fuel will be a multi-beneficial project with the power to transform the DeFi space and make it more satisfactory for users. The crypto project is already attracting interest with its features, with analysts predicting high adoption. 1Fuel's tangible utilities set it apart from Shiba Inu and other viral tokens. This implies that it's not only gaining traction based on hype, but it also has revolutionary use cases that make it essential. Thus, analysts are convinced it could boom and maintain relevance for a long time and make the owners profitable. The 1Fuel presale is still fast selling and investors eyeing Shiba Inu-like profit may consider joining the presale now.

Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $34,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address (CA) – 8i5qNveWm4AkzM2z7Abb9coLjjRbUyMGUxPR2V75FwLK – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BTC|FIAT|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-27 23:51:00

Consequently, leading altcoins like Binance Coin and Solana are set to experience a substantial rise in the first quarter, fueled by continuous advancements and enhancements in their ecosystems. Yet, despite their anticipated growth, a new PayFi venture, Remittix ($RTX) , is capturing attention within investor portfolios. This groundbreaking initiative has already been dubbed a leading crypto ICO project and is being likened to Solana's capabilities in transactions. In this article, we will delve into recent developments concerning Solana price and BNB price, exploring why their holders are increasingly turning to Remittix. Concerns Mount Over BNB's Prolonged Consolidation BNB has been actively working to expand its ecosystem and bolster its market position. Just last week, Gate Ventures committed $20 million to the BNB Incubation Alliance, aiming to accelerate blockchain and Web3 startup growth. Binance Coin also executed its 30th token burn , eliminating 1.63 million BNB valued at roughly $1.16 billion, cutting the total supply to 142.47 million BNB, with 42.47 million set to be burned through Auto-Burn and real-time methods. This strategy is pivotal for BNB's long-term value, as it helps in reducing supply and ensuring price stability. Despite these efforts, BNB price is trading at $684.81, a drop of 0.80% from last week's opening and 2.7% over the past month. This stagnation has unsettled investors, many of whom are now eyeing opportunities in Remittix, a PayFi solution that challenges both BNB price and Solana's transactional model. Is Solana's ETF Approval on the Horizon? Solana's efficiency in transactions has consistently been a major draw. Its high-speed blockchain is built to enable low fees and high throughput. Early Sunday, Solana price jumped 4.5% intraday, surpassing the $250 mark to hit $253. However, this boost hasn't translated into a strong upward trend over the past month, with prices fluctuating between $275 and $230. A potential driver for future growth is the newly proposed Solana ETF, which could elevate Solana to unprecedented levels once it gains approval. Grayscale Investments has submitted an application to list a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on the NYSE, a step that could enhance SOL's credibility among traditional investors. Despite the positive buzz around the ETF, Solana price remains on a sideways path, and holders are wary of possible delays, reminiscent of Ripple's experience. Consequently, investors are seeking alternatives, with Remittix emerging as an appealing option for stability and growth. Remittix ($RTX) - Is It the Next 100x Altcoin? Remittix is rapidly gaining traction as a pioneering PayFi initiative that provides a seamless cross-border bridge between digital and traditional currencies. A standout aspect of Remittix is its flat-fee structure, ensuring recipients get the exact amount sent without hidden costs. This advantage positions Remittix as a formidable competitor to platforms like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase, which do not offer direct crypto-to-bank transfers. With features such as worldwide access, lower costs, rapid processing, transparency, and 24/7 availability, industry insiders are not only supporting Remittix to match Solana's transaction prowess but also to become one of the top crypto ICOs of the first quarter. The ongoing presale aims to gather $36 million and is anticipated to sell out in eight weeks. The $RTX token is currently offered at a discounted rate of $0.0383, providing an enticing entry point before expected major gains. Given its potential to bridge a multi-trillion-dollar market gap and draw institutional interest, Remittix is attracting attention from Binance Coin and Solana investors eager to latch onto the next big opportunity in the crypto world. Investors are turning to Remittix for its robust security, cost-effectiveness, and its capability to offer a relevant cross-border solution for businesses and freelancers. As the market heats up, now is an ideal time to seize the Remittix presale and secure a position in what could be the next 100x altcoin.

As a result, top altcoins like Binance Coin and Solana are very likely to see a significant upswing in Q1, driven by ongoing developments and upgrades within their respective ecosystems. However, despite their projected success, a new PayFi project, Remittix ($RTX) , is stealing their spot in the portfolios of investors. This innovative project has already been labeled a top crypto ICO project and compared to the transactional capabilities of Solana. In this article we will reflect on some of the latest occurrences around Solana price and BNB price, considering why their holders are increasingly migrating into Remittix. BNB’s Month-long Consolidation is Raising Concerns BNB has been making several strides to develop its ecosystem and strengthen its market position. Last week, it was reported that Gate Ventures invested $20 million in the BNBIncubation Alliance, which will help accelerate blockchain and Web3 startups. Binance Coin also completed its 30th token burn , destroying 1.63 million BNB worth approximately $1.16 billion, reducing the total supply to 142.47 million BNB with 42.47 million left to burn via Auto-Burn and real-time mechanisms. This token burn strategy plays a crucial role in BNB's long-term value proposition, reducing supply and enhancing price stability. Contrary to these efforts, BNB price changes hands at $684.81, down 0.80% from last week's opening price and 2.7% in the last 30 days. This consolidation has spooked investors, most of whom are looking for an opportunity in Remittix, a PayFi solution rivaling BNB price and Solana's transactional concept. Would Solana ETF be Approved Soon? Solana’s transactional efficiency has long been one of its strongest selling points. Its high-speed blockchain network is designed to allow low charges and high throughput. In the early hours of Sunday, Solana price saw a sharp 4.5% intraday spike, slipping past the $250 price level to trade at $253. However, despite this rally, the Solana price trajectory has shown little upward movement over the past month, oscillating between $275 and $230 price points. An important catalyst for this growth in the future will likely be the recently proposed Solana ETF, which could take Solana to new highs once approved. Grayscale Investments has filed an application to list a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on the NYSE, a move that may even further legitimize SOL in the eyes of traditional investors. While the ETF is surrounded by optimism, Solana price continues to move sideways and holders remain skeptical about the possibility of delays, which might be like what happened with Ripple. Due to this fact, investors have started to look for other options and one of the attractive ones is Remittix for stability and growth. Remittix ($RTX) - The Next 100x Altcoin? Remittix is quickly gaining momentum as an innovative PayFi project that offers a frictionless cross-border bridge between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. One of the standout features of Remittix is its flat-fee model, ensuring that recipients receive the exact amount sent without hidden charges. This feature has positioned Remittix as a key challenger to competitors like Stripe, Wise and Coinbase, none of which offer direct crypto-to-bank transfers. With advantages such as global reach, lower fees, faster processing, transparency and 24/7 accessibility, industry experts are not only backing Remittix to rival Solana’s transaction efficiency but also offer one of the top crypto ICOs of Q1. The ongoing presale aims to raise $36 million and is expected to sell out within eight weeks. The $RTX token is currently priced at a discounted rate of $0.0383 making it an attractive entry point before anticipated parabolic rallies. Given its potential to bridge a multi-trillion-dollar market gap and attract institutional interest, Remittix is drawing attention from Binance Coin and Solana holders eager to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto. Investors are looking to Remittix for robust security, cost efficiency and the ability to provide a relatable cross-border solution to businesses and freelancers.

What starts with a surge of excitement can quickly turn into chaos. The launch of the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin in January not only captured the crypto community’s attention but also opened Pandora’s box as fraudsters eager to exploit the hype, overwhelming the market with fake tokens and harmful applications. On Jan. 17, President Donald Trump debuted his meme coin marketed as a unique opportunity to express “support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs” embodied by the symbol TRUMP, according to the meme coin’s official website, which was also featured on Trump’s announcement on X.

Go to https://t.co/GX3ZxT5xyq — Have Fun! pic.twitter.com/flIKYyfBrC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 Within just 48 hours of its release, TRUMP achieved a market cap of $72 billion, creating a “perfect storm for fraud,” analysts at Israel-headquartered blockchain forensic firm Blockaid say. However, this surge attracted not only speculators seeking to earn quick bucks but also malicious actors who sought to take advantage of the frenzy. The blockchain firm revealed in a research report that scammers wasted no time in capitalizing on the buzz surrounding the token’s release. These malicious actors quickly flooded the market with fake tokens, hoping to deceive investors who were eager to jump on the bandwagon. The report shows a 206% increase in tokens using the “Trump” name on the launch day, from 3,300 to 6,800 tokens. These scammers created numerous tokens that were designed to mimic the TRUMP meme coin, making it difficult for investors to distinguish legitimate assets from fraudulent ones. A Blockaid spokesperson told crypto.news that scammers began making it “increasingly difficult for investors to distinguish between legitimate tokens and malicious ones.” “ and this challenge is not unique to TRUMP. In almost every major web3 launch, our team sees how threat actors are creating projects that mimic the branding and excitement of the real tokens, creating confusion and exposing users to significant risks.” Oz Tamir, the research and development lead at Blockaid The number of fake tokens containing the word “Trump” | Source: Blockaid With the public eager to purchase TRUMP tokens, these fake assets were able to gain traction and even generate profit for the scammers behind them. The same surge in interest was seen in malicious decentralized applications, which also saw a sharp increase following the launch. The day after the meme coin hit the market, impersonator dApps saw a 14x rise, Blockaid says, adding that more than 90 fake applications appeared in just 24 hours. You might also like: Blockaid new dashboard to track web3 activity and threats Blockaid’s report also notes that scammers didn’t stop with just the TRUMP token. Other tokens referencing members of the Trump family, such as “Melania” and “Barron,” surged by hundreds of per cent, too, giving the impression of a network of tokens tied to the Trump brand. These tokens helped create the “illusion of an interconnected ecosystem,” Blockaid says. Tamir notes that the biggest spike in fake tokens “was noticeable on Solana, especially during this launch, given the prevalence of meme coins on the network.” “That said, EVM networks like Ethereum have consistently been a hotspot for scams as well, including both fake tokens and malicious dApps targeting EVM users.” Oz Tamir As the excitement around high-profile launches grows, so does the opportunity for scammers to take advantage of unsuspecting users. Unfortunately, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, while empowering users, also opens the door for malicious actors to exploit the system. In response to the surge in scam activity, Blockaid says it has been trying to prevent users from interacting with malicious tokens and fake dApps.

This blockchain-powered e-commerce platform is not only redefining online shopping but also generating significant excitement with its presale, which has now surged past $950,000. This article explores the latest developments in the crypto space, highlighting why Web3Bay is emerging as a top investment opportunity in 2025. Cardano’s Hydra Upgrade Fuels Optimism Cardano (ADA) is on a roll, with its recent Hydra upgrade propelling the blockchain to new heights. This innovative scaling solution has significantly boosted Cardano’s transaction speed, reaching an impressive 501,000 transactions per second (TPS) while keeping costs low. This makes Cardano a strong contender in the race for blockchain efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, Cardano is gaining real-world traction, with Argentina embracing the technology for various applications, including social security benefits systems, university collaborations, and union records. These developments showcase the growing utility of ADA and its potential for widespread adoption. With ADA currently trading at $1.12, analysts are optimistic about its future prospects. Many believe that Cardano could surpass its previous all-time high of $3.09 and potentially reach $5 in this cycle, fueled by its robust technology and increasing adoption. Toncoin’s Price Surge: Is $7 the Next Target? Toncoin (TON) is also generating excitement, with key indicators suggesting a potential surge in its price. Currently priced at $5.63, TON has shown strong upward momentum, rebounding from a recent low of $4.99. CryptoQuant’s Normalized Risk Metric (NRM) indicates that TON is entering a low-risk accumulation phase, historically a precursor to significant price increases. If TON breaks above its 50-day simple moving average at $5.88, analysts predict that it could soon reach targets of $6 or even $7. Web3Bay Presale Explodes Past $950k! $1 Million Next?! Web3Bay is not just another crypto project; it’s a game-changer that’s poised to disrupt the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. By combining blockchain technology with a user-centric approach, Web3Bay is creating a truly revolutionary platform. While Cardano and Toncoin are making waves, Web3Bay is stealing the show with its presale, which has now raised over $930,000. This blockchain-powered e-commerce platform is redefining online shopping, offering users a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace. Web3Bay’s native token, 3BAY, is at the heart of this ecosystem. Currently priced at $0.004562625 in stage 4 of the presale, 3BAY offers a compelling investment opportunity. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early investors could see returns exceeding 6,430%. But Web3Bay is more than just a promising investment. The platform is packed with innovative features, including decentralized storage, Layer-2 scaling for fast and affordable transactions, and cross-chain compatibility.7 Furthermore, Web3Bay boasts a community-driven governance model, ensuring that users have a say in shaping the platform’s future. With its presale inching towards $1 million and its innovative features generating significant buzz, Web3Bay is emerging as a top contender in the crypto space. This is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that has the potential to redefine how we shop online. Summing Up The crypto landscape is constantly shifting, with established projects like Cardano and Toncoin showcasing impressive growth and innovation. Cardano’s Hydra upgrade is a testament to its commitment to scalability and efficiency, while Toncoin’s bullish signals suggest a potential price surge on the horizon. However, Web3Bay emerges as a standout contender, offering not just a promising investment opportunity but also a vision for the future of e-commerce. With its presale nearing the $1 million milestone and its innovative features capturing the attention of the crypto community, Web3Bay is poised to redefine how we shop online.

39588996,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-breaks-records-as-unknown-tech-launch-looks-to-take-on-cardano,1738022948,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/39588996.jpeg,1Fuel Breaks Records As Unknown Tech Launch Looks To Take On Cardano,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-breaks-records-as-unknown-tech-launch-looks-to-take-on-cardano,"ADA experiences increased market volatility as 1Fuel (OFT) emerges as a strong competitor in crypto. With its advanced DeFi features, cross-chain transactions, and robust privacy measures, 1Fuel attracts significant investment, challenging ADA's position in the market. The performance of its record-breaking presale shows that 1Fuel is prepared to disrupt existing platforms and potentially reinvent digital asset management during 2025. Cardano’s struggles continue: Analysts adjust price predictions for ADA Cardano (ADA) is currently facing a challenging period, with its price experiencing a notable decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has dropped approximately 9.5% in the past 24 hours, bringing its value down to around $0.90. This significant price decrease can be attributed to large-scale sell-offs by whales, creating uncertainty among investors and raising concerns about the coin’s performance in the coming weeks. The analysts at CoinCodex project ADA to climb up to $2 by February 20, 2025, representing a 111% market gain. Cardano investors anticipate the coin value hitting the $2.61 mark in mid-April, accompanied by a projected 169% market value growth. The Changelly forecast projects Cardano's peak value to reach $1.46 during April but expects prices to stay below $2. The Cardano ecosystem expands by increasing active addresses to 50,000, notwithstanding price fluctuations. At its current trading price of $0.8771, Cardano maintains a total market capitalization of $30.85 billion with a daily transaction volume of $941.56 million. 1Fuel: The rising DeFi powerhouse set to disrupt the crypto market The innovative DeFi and digital asset management solutions of 1Fuel (OFT) have propelled it to compete at the front of the cryptocurrency market. The platform distinguishes itself through its complete ecosystem to provide future-proof crypto features for user convenience and advanced functionality. The core functionality of the 1Fuel service consists of a decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet that lets users achieve cross-chain transactions quickly with a single button click. The 1Fuel platform distinguishes itself with its unique single-click mechanism that removes the requirement to use multiple wallets or additional tools to move assets through diverse blockchains. 1Fuel's true disruptive capability results from its dedication to privacy protection and security. Through the platform's privacy mixer feature, every transaction benefits from total anonymity and is protected by disposable wallets and military-grade cold storage. 1Fuel surpasses the standard privacy protocols of Ledger and Core Wallet by delivering enhanced protection so users can enjoy a secure digital transaction environment. The storage functionality of 1Fuel represents only a fraction of how the platform transforms crypto asset management. The platform offers three core features: a crypto debit and credit card for fast fiat exchange, a peer-to-peer exchange for direct transfers, and AI-powered asset management tools. Because of its distinctive features, 1Fuel provides a strong solution for storing and managing digital assets, appealing to many investors. Large investors, often called ""whales,"" consider 1Fuel a top choice in decentralized finance (DeFi) investments due to its high-profit potential in the growing DeFi market. The ongoing presale has already distributed more than 156 million tokens and raised over $1.5 million. Analysts believe that 1Fuel's value could increase 100 times after its launch, particularly given its low price of $0.017.

The new model released on Monday, has come along with huge excitement about the DeepSeek’s R1, which has impacted the tech stock market, resulting in volatility on the market with chipmaking giant Nvidia shares dropping by over 17%. DeepSeek says Janus-Pro-7B is better than many prominent models Some AI enthusiasts concur with the startup that the latest model is better than many models on some benchmarks. An AI observer Rowan Cheung indicated that the new model outperforms competitors OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion on some benchmarks like GenEval and DPG-Bench. The Chinese startup also claimed the superiority of its model in a technical report on Monday. DeepSeek said its model outclassed rivals from OpenAI and Stability AI on rankings for image generation using text prompts. According to Disclose.tv , the benchmarks highlight Janus-Pro-7B’s competitive advantage, which has potential to influence future AI research. This comes as the industry is observing developments taking place in China and how other global firms will react to this advancement and the intensified competition ahead. Apart from R1, another development from the Chinese AI startup that has disrupted the tech industry, the release of Janus-Pro-7B comes as the sector is fast evolving with tech firms from all over the globe are innovating to release new products and services and stay ahead of competition. Janus-Pro-7B is capable of generating images making it competitive on the market. In their technical report, DeepSeek AI revealed that Janus-Pro-7B boasts 7 billion parameters, coupled with improved training speed and accuracy in image generation from text prompts. According to Cheung’s observations, DeepSeek AI’s new model could break new barriers to AI performance. The GenEval and DPG-Bench perpetuated by Investing.com and mentioned by Cheung are important in evaluating how effective and versatile AI models are. To outperform in these benchmarks shows that DeepSeek’s new model has a competitive edge in tasks, influencing the paths of future research and development. Deepseek’s industry effect According to Reuters, the DeepSeek-V3 model has become a top-rated free app on Apple’s App Store in the US. Janus-Pro-7B is an upgrade on the previously created Janus released late last year.Janus had initially been a product of DeepSeek launching a new assistant based on the DeepSeek-V3 model. The release of Deepseek AI’s Janus-Pro-7B has had a cataclysmic impact on the sector, especially the financial performance of the markets. Share prices of numerous AI related stocks have dropped significantly in the last few hours as investors assessed the possible impact of the new and strong Chinese ChatGPT alternative. From Tokyo to New York, investors sold off several tech stocks due to fears that the emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI model would threaten the current dominance of AI leaders like Nvidia. Nvidia was on track to lose as much $600 billion in market value, becoming the biggest ever single-day loss on Wall Street. “If it’s true that DeepSeek is the proverbial ‘better mousetrap,’ that could disrupt the entire AI narrative that has helped drive the markets over the last two years,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. “It could mean less demand for chips, less need for a massive build-out of power production to fuel the models, and less need for large-scale data centers. However, it could also mean that AI becomes more accessible and help kickstart the development of a wide array of useful applications.” Jacobsen. According to Invest.com, the immediate investor reaction shows the sensitivity of tech stocks to innovations and the high expectations for the role of AI in technology in the future. However, Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns almost one million Nvidia shares described the Monday selloff as an over-reaction.

Amidst this buzz, Cardano (ADA) is experiencing a slump, while many of its holders are shifting their focus to Remittix (RTX). This emerging project is rapidly gaining traction in the PayFi sector, drawing investors to its presale in droves. Designed to revolutionize international payments, Remittix aims to tackle financial inefficiencies with a platform that prioritizes ease, speed, and accessibility. What are the standout features of this groundbreaking PayFi solution, and what might the future hold for Cardano in 2025? Cardano (ADA) Experiences a Sudden Decline Cardano (ADA) kicked off 2025 on a high note, climbing from $0.86 to $1.13 in just 5 days. However, its success was short-lived as Cardano (ADA) plunged back to $0.88 on the 9th. After a few more fluctuations, Cardano (ADA) settled at $0.98, still above its December price, but the past week has witnessed a steep 7.22% drop. Additionally, Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume has decreased, currently at $588 million, which is relatively small compared to its hefty $34.6 billion market cap. Cardano's price forecast appears grim, but one advantage is the limited involvement of whales, reducing the likelihood of massive sell-offs compared to other cryptocurrencies. Remittix Revolutionizes Global Payment Systems Remittix is tackling one of the major challenges in finance today: inefficiency. Cross-border transactions are often outdated, burdened with high fees, long processing times, and hidden costs that frustrate users. Remittix provides a contemporary solution by enabling users to seamlessly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send funds to any worldwide bank account, effectively removing these obstacles.

Remittix (RTX) offers a wide range of fiat and crypto pairs, providing high flexibility for both businesses and individuals. The platform supports 30 fiat currencies and over 50 cryptocurrency pairs, simplifying fund management.

Among the excitement, Cardano (ADA) is facing downturns while many holders are eyeing up Remittix (RTX), a new project that is quickly becoming a top contender in the PayFi space, with investors flocking in to the presale left, right, and center. Engineered to transform cross-border payments, Remittix is setting out to address real-world financial inefficiencies with a platform that combines simplicity, speed, and accessibility. So what are the key features of this revolutionary PayFi solution and how might Cardano fare in 2025? Cardano (ADA) Posts Sharp Dip Cardano (ADA) started off 2025 strong, rallying from $0.86 to $1.13 within the space of 5 days, though its fortune didn’t last long as Cardano (ADA) then dropped dramatically on the 9th, back down to $0.88. A couple of fluctuations later, Cardano (ADA) has ended up at the $0.98 mark, still representing an increase on its December price, though the last week has seen a sharp 7.22% dip. Cardano’s 24 hour trading volume has also taken a hit, now sitting at $588 million, which is minimal relative to Cardano’s sizable $34.6 billion market cap. Cardano’s current price trajectory looks bleak, though one thing the asset has going for it is that very few whales are involved with Cardano, so large sell offs are typically less explosive than with other cryptos. Remittix Changes the Game for Global Payments Remittix is addressing one of the biggest problems in finance today: inefficiency. Cross-border transactions tend to be terribly outdated. Typical systems charge high fees, have long processing times, and frustrate users with hidden costs. Remittix offers a modern alternative.

The Remittix Pay API allows companies to accept cryptocurrency payments while settling transactions in fiat. For freelancers, online stores, and service providers, this functionality opens up new payment options without requiring them to understand the complexities of cryptocurrencies. Remittix (RTX) offers a broad selection of fiat and crypto pairs to offer high levels of flexibility for businesses and individuals. In total, there are 30 fiat currencies supported and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs available, making managing funds easy.

Security and privacy are becoming top concerns in today’s financial landscape, and Remittix excels in both areas. Recipients of payments via Remittix receive funds as standard bank transfers, with no indication that the transaction originated in cryptocurrency. This mechanism ensures that platform users can benefit from blockchain technology without compromising on discretion. Proactive Investors Flock To The Remittix Presale Currently priced at $0.0350, $RTX has raised over $8 million in its ICO and shows no sign of losing momentum any time soon.

Each one has a loyal community and fresh ideas. While Bonk is a newer meme coin, Dogecoin carries meme fame, and Remittix aims to solve real financial problems. Below, we explore how Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) might perform by the end of January—and why many think Remittix could surpass them all. Bonk’s Outlook Over the past day, Bonk is down -3.17%, with a -13.76% drop over the week. Despite these dips, some fans still view Bonk (BONK) as a fun meme coin with unique community events—like recent burns meant to boost scarcity. Yet meme coins often rely on hype, so people wanting a viral altcoin price prediction might be cautious. Others note that new tokens can surprise everyone if they find a lasting use case. Even though Bonk has a strong online following, critics point out it lacks major partnerships or serious adoption. If it wants to stay among the best altcoins for 2025, it must show real progress soon. Meanwhile, new practical coins like Remittix (RTX) might lure traders away. Some also compare Bonk (BONK) with established meme tokens, raising questions about how long the project can keep attention. Dogecoin’s Potential Some still champion Dogecoin, which is down -1.21% today, -11.32% this week, but up +12.92% for the month. While Dogecoin (DOGE) holds a top spot among meme coins, people wonder if upcoming ETF possibilities could spark another rally. Others look for a viral altcoin price prediction that goes beyond memes, prompting them to explore more functional tokens. Devoted holders say Dogecoin might see higher demand if more businesses and influencers push for adoption. Even so, meme coins can’t rely on hype forever. If investors want coins that fix real issues, Remittix (RTX) looks more appealing. Some watchers think Dogecoin (DOGE) will keep a loyal fan base, but its main draw remains the meme factor, which might not satisfy serious use cases. Remittix: The Real Outperformer Over the last few weeks, Remittix soared about +142%, drawing attention from traders who focus on practical solutions. Supporters highlight how Remittix (RTX) cuts cross-border fees, offering rapid money transfers. Because it handles real problems, many see it as the strongest contender among the best altcoins for 2025. In contrast to meme coins, Remittix delivers an everyday purpose that could sustain growth long after the hype dies down. While Bonk and Dogecoin chase internet fame, Remittix (RTX) aims for global adoption. Some call it a prime example of a viral altcoin price prediction that isn’t tied to short-lived trends. By providing near-instant conversions to fiat, Remittix could capture users who want more than memes. That’s why experts say Remittix stands poised to outperform both Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in the months ahead. Conclusion All three tokens—Bonk, Dogecoin, and Remittix—have drawn attention for January 2025. Bonk (BONK) tries to build a meme-based community, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains an iconic meme coin, and Remittix(RTX) tackles real-world money transfers. Yet many believe Remittix leads the pack among the best altcoins for 2025, thanks to its practical use and rapid adoption. If real-world utility matters most, Remittix may claim the spotlight.

Each boasts a dedicated community and innovative ideas. While Bonk is a newer meme coin, Dogecoin has meme recognition, and Remittix seeks to tackle genuine financial issues. Let's delve into how Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) could fare by the end of January—and why many anticipate that Remittix may outpace them all. Forecast for Bonk In the past 24 hours, Bonk has dropped by -3.17%, and it has seen a -13.76% decline over the week. Despite these setbacks, some enthusiasts still see Bonk (BONK) as an entertaining meme coin with distinctive community activities—such as recent burns intended to increase scarcity. However, meme coins often depend on hype, so those seeking a viral altcoin price prediction might approach with caution. Others point out that new tokens can surprise everyone if they establish a lasting utility. Even though Bonk enjoys a strong online following, critics note its lack of significant partnerships or widespread adoption. To maintain its status among the top altcoins for 2025, it needs to demonstrate real progress soon. Meanwhile, new practical tokens like Remittix (RTX) could attract traders away. Comparisons between Bonk (BONK) and established meme tokens also raise questions about the project's ability to sustain interest. Dogecoin’s Future Prospects Some continue to support Dogecoin, which is down -1.21% today, -11.32% for the week, but has risen +12.92% over the month. While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a leading meme coin, there's speculation about whether potential ETF developments could trigger another surge. Others are looking for a viral altcoin price prediction that extends beyond memes, prompting them to consider more functional tokens. Loyal supporters believe Dogecoin could see increased demand if more companies and influencers advocate for its adoption. Nonetheless, meme coins can't rely on hype indefinitely. For investors seeking tokens that address real issues, Remittix (RTX) appears more attractive. Some observers think Dogecoin (DOGE) will maintain a dedicated fan base, but its primary appeal remains the meme factor, which might not satisfy those looking for serious applications. Remittix: The Genuine Standout Recently, Remittix has surged by approximately +142%, capturing the interest of traders who prioritize practical solutions. Advocates emphasize how Remittix (RTX) reduces cross-border fees, providing fast money transfers. Since it addresses real-world issues, many view it as the strongest candidate among the best altcoins for 2025. Unlike meme coins, Remittix offers a day-to-day purpose that could sustain growth long after the hype fades. While Bonk and Dogecoin chase online popularity, Remittix (RTX) is aiming for worldwide adoption. Some consider it a prime example of a viral altcoin price prediction that isn't tied to fleeting trends. By offering near-instant conversions to fiat, Remittix has the potential to attract users seeking more than just memes. That's why experts predict Remittix is set to outperform both Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in the upcoming months. Conclusion All three tokens—Bonk, Dogecoin, and Remittix—have captured attention for January 2025. Bonk (BONK) aims to establish a meme-based community, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues as a classic meme coin, and Remittix (RTX) addresses real-world money transfers. Yet, many believe Remittix is leading the charge among the best altcoins for 2025, due to its practical application and swift adoption. If real-world utility is the priority, Remittix might take the spotlight.

Solana Has Seen A Crash Over The Last 24 Hours The cryptocurrency sector as a whole has plummeted during the past day, with Solana not being spared as its price has also gone through a notable decline. Below is a chart that shows how SOL’s recent performance has looked. From the graph, it’s visible that Solana has suffered a steep plunge of almost 12% in this period, which is worse than many other top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, has seen a decline of around 5%. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $181,000? Mayer Multiple Reveals When BTC Will Become ‘Overbought’ Following this crash, Solana is now back at the $227 level. The asset has seemingly paused its fall for now, but it’s possible that it would resume soon. SOL Has Breached Under Its Symmetrical Triangle In a post on X earlier in the day, analyst Ali Martinez discussed about a Symmetrical Triangle that Solana had been trading inside. The “Symmetrical Triangle” here is a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that forms when the price of an asset consolidates between two trendlines of a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the triangle connects together lower highs in the price, while the lower level joins higher lows. As the asset travels inside the pattern, its range gradually converges on the midpoint line. Like other TA patterns, the upper level of this pattern is likely to provide resistance to the asset. Similarly, the lower line can help the cryptocurrency to reach a bottom. A break out of either of the trendlines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, a break above the triangle is a bullish signal, while a fall under it can lead to a bearish outcome. The Symmetrical Triangle is just one possible type of triangular-shaped formation that an asset can display. Two other popular ones are the Ascending and Descending Triangles, which occur when one of the trendlines is parallel to the time-axis (the upper one in the case of the former and the lower one for the latter). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that the 1-hour price of Solana had been stuck inside over the past week: From the graph, it’s visible that Solana was approaching the apex of the triangle when Martinez had made the post. As the consolidation becomes narrower, a breakout can become more probable to occur, which appears to be just what has happened with SOL in the hours since. The height of this triangle was equal to a swing of around 20%. Usually, Symmetrical Triangle breakouts are of the same degree as the height of the pattern, so the analyst had noted that SOL could be primed for a 20% move.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe Coin holders are turning their focus to Elluminex, a promising new viral coin. Table of Contents Pepe saw spectacular growth Elluminex could be the next 100x token Last year saw several crypto assets achieve spectacular growth. The latest bull market only compounded these gains, leaving traders hungry for more. Pepe was among these tokens, increasing over 30,000% in the last few years. Still, Pepe is currently among the biggest memecoins, but its potential upside is limited. Traders looking for similar gains should look for new projects. One of the most promising ones is Elluminex (ELX), a DeFi token promising to transform the TON ecosystem. Pepe saw spectacular growth Pepe is currently one of the dominant memecoins, maintaining the fourth position among all memecoins. The token used to be the third largest memecoin before the sudden rise of the Official Trump token. This development has rocked investors, and Pepe has seen significant volatility. Last week, Pepe dropped 16.71%, to its current price of $0.00001542. Still, this was after a year of strong growth, and Pepe is still up 1420.30% from the same time last year. Still, recent on-chain data shows large whale activity. For instance, the “0x8f5″ address withdrew 280 billion Pepe from Binance, worth around $5 million. This indicates that the whale is gearing for significant moves, which will likely increase volatility. Technical indicators show mixed signals for Pepe. While the weekly oscillators are mostly bearish, moving averages are mixed. Notably, short-term moving averages point to sell, indicating slowing momentum for Pepe.

Elluminex is a DeFi hub for TON, currently the fastest-growing chain. Its strong fundamentals give it the potential to replicate some of the largest bull runs. Last year, TON’s ecosystem showed significant growth. For one, the number of wallet addresses on the network grew by 3380%. Moreover, network TVL increased 8x, to a high of $740 million. Driving this increase in activity was its Telegram integration, through engaging games such as Notcoin. Despite its strong metrics, TON’s DeFi ecosystem is still in its infancy. For that reason, traders are betting that the Elluminex could change the narrative. Its network of cross-chain bridges will connect TON to 40 major blockchains. This will bring in much-needed liquidity, helping stabilize asset prices and boost confidence in the network. Cross chain bridges also enable Elluminex to offer trading with low slippage, which is crucial for making profit. This is why the platform has the potential to attract more traders to TON. The potential effect of this is hard to overstate. For instance, when Uniswap launched on Ethereum, it helped increase ETH’s price from $200 to $1,000 in a single year. Elluminex also offers advanced trading features, including an AI Portfolio tracker. This tool will give actionable insights based on real-time data. This feature will help level the playing field for traders, making trading more accessible than ever. Thanks to its advanced features, Elluminex has the potential to become a premier DeFi hub on TON. This position’s it for significant growth in 2025. To learn more about Elluminex, visit the website , Twitter , and Telegram .
