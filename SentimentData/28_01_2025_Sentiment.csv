Wall Street analysts hint that such a surprising scene is about to unfold again with a currently underrated AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) . They believe this AI coin will outpace Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin this year, leaving many shocked while bringing mouth-watering gains to wise investors. Cheap WallitIQ (WLTQ) Could Beat Shiba Inu (SHIB) And Dogecoin Wall Street analysts recognize that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin are long-standing players in the crypto world. Shiba Inu (SHIB) became one in 2021, when it rose volcanically by about 40,000,000%, driven by community support and broader market sentiment for meme coins. That year, it hit an all-time high of $0.00008616. Despite many predictions that followed, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has traded way below that point ever since, currently around $0.000020. Similarly, Dogecoin gained massive popularity in 2021 when it hit an all-time high of $0.73. This was followed by a sharp correction, dropping below $0.3 by the end of the year. Ever since, Dogecoin has faced highs and lows, with predictions indicating a possible surge in 2025. Wall Street analysts expect a bullish crypto extra in 2025 and foretell that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin could see fair rises. However, they predict that whatever these two major players bring will fall behind what a new AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), will deliver. This AI coin is highly innovative and has many untapped opportunities. With its powerful features, Wall Street analysts say it is well-positioned to dominate the $600 billion crypto wallet and AI market. They expect the AI coin to generate at least $5 million in monthly revenue. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Irresistible AI Features Attracts Investors Worldwide Wall Street analysts have good reason to back WallitIQ (WLTQ) over Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin. In explaining their stance, they mention that this new AI coin is rapidly attracting investors with edge-cutting AI-crypto features. Many of these features are already live on the crypto wallet management app, which the platform launched recently. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) app features a fully interactive candlestick chart , allowing users to analyze price trends for various crypto tickers over different timeframes. It’s also fully connected to the CoinGecko API , allowing users to view real-time prices for each currency. Additionally, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) interface is highly intuitive, with a responsive and visually attractive design. Soon, users will be able to do more by personalizing their price alerts and wallet updates. This innovative AI coin platform also improves crypto management by allowing users to run simulated ETH and USDT wallet management. It also supports running virtual ETH and USDT transfers to foreign addresses. That’s not all. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is well future-proof, as it includes placeholders for upcoming features on its settings page. It, therefore, demonstrates its scalability for improved features in the future. The platform has shown its reliability by completing a smart contract audit with SolidProof , a trusted agency in the crypto world. In response, Wall Street analysts and other big investors are rapidly boarding its train, assured of big gains. In its previous presale, the native altcoin raised over $6 million and sold about 350 million tokens. Such rapid adoption is bound to skyrocket its price in no time. Therefore, the ongoing presale, where the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is selling for $0.0420 only, will soon be over. Conclusion Wall Street analysts have picked WallitIQ (WLTQ) as the best choice for good reason. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin have long held their place as community favorites, this AI coin is shaping up to be the breakout star of 2025. For any investor who wants to make life-changing gains this year, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is the best entry point. The chance to join is still available for $0.0420 only. Before it jumps 50% to the next price and you miss out on such a sweet deal, join the promising AI coin’s presale now.

RCO Finance (RCOF) , Dogecoin (DOGE), and Hedera (HBAR) are three coins under $1 that could skyrocket by 2025. With the right moves, these coins might turn small investments into life-changing returns. Could these be the hidden gems that make investors rich? 1. RCO Finance RCO Finance is making a big impact in the DeFi space by combining AI technology with blockchain. This innovative approach makes RCO Finance a top choice for investors seeking profits and cutting-edge financial solutions. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy, RCO Finance is definitely worth considering. At the heart of RCO Finance is its intelligent robo-advisor, an AI trading tool that provides users with customized investment strategies. This tool helps users make informed decisions, even if they have little financial knowledge. The robo-advisor analyzes real-time data from credible sources, providing accurate advice that enables traders to make data-backed decisions quickly. RCO Finance’s tokenomics are designed to sustain the project and prevent liquidity issues. A significant portion of tokens is allocated for public sale, ensuring equal access to all and promoting community development. This approach helps build trust among investors and promotes a healthy trading environment. The RCO Finance platform offers users access to multiple trading assets, including traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This allows users to diversify portfolios and balance their risks and returns. With its diverse asset offerings, RCO Finance is an attractive option for investors seeking to minimize risk. To protect users, RCO Finance has partnered with SolidProof to conduct regular audits of its smart contracts. This partnership demonstrates the platform’s commitment to ensuring the safety of investors’ assets and promoting a trustworthy trading environment, which can positively impact the best altcoins. And the best part? You can access all these features on its recently launched beta platform . 2. DOGE Dogecoin’s market cap has surged 14% to $58 billion after a new government website featuring the Dogecoin logo appeared. The website was registered by a US government employee, confirming its connection to the government. This development has sparked interest in Dogecoin and most of the best altcoins. In price terms, DOGE rose and is now selling at $0.397, sparking renewed discussions about its potential to hit the $1 mark. The recent launch of a new government website has significantly boosted Dogecoin among the best altcoins. Analysts and traders are optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, citing technical patterns and market trends that could drive a rally taking Dogecoin to $1 or more, potentially generating over 50,000% ROI for investors. 3. HBAR A major development for Hedera Hashgraph is the filing of an HBAR exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If approved, this ETF would allow investors to buy HBAR directly. Additionally, Hedera is allocating 4.86 billion HBAR, worth around $408 million, to develop its ecosystem and improve governance. The project is also partnering with Nvidia and Chainlink to integrate artificial intelligence and advanced data oracles into its network. The price of HBAR declined in the last seven days. With a decline of 14.67%, HBAR currently stands at $0.3272. The best altcoins’ analysts think HBAR is forming a bullish pattern, which could send its price soaring to $2.30. If this happens, HBAR could increase by up to 50,000% or more, making it an auspicious investment opportunity. RCOF Makes Headlines Ahead of the Best Altcoins with $11 Million Token Presale RCOF is gaining attention as a standout altcoin, having raised over $11 million in its ongoing token presale. With its current price at $0.1, analysts predict a remarkable surge of over 500% during the remaining presale phases. This presents a prime investment opportunity for those looking to buy into a promising altcoin. If predictions go as planned, the RCOF coin could even soar and reach a listing price of $0.60 by the end of the presale. Also, some experts forecast a massive price rise of around 43,000% by the end of the year. Of course, this makes RCOF an exciting investment prospect, mainly due to its potential for long-term growth. RCOF token holders can also look forward to quarterly dividends and rewards based on their holdings. This added benefit makes RCOF an attractive choice for investors seeking growth and regular returns, making it one of the best crypto investments to consider.

Analyst Reveals When Price Will Crash To $50,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-crash-to-50000/,"The Bitcoin price has long been celebrated for its explosive growth during bull market periods. However, its cyclic nature, which consists of both a bull and a bear market, often leaves many market watchers unprepared for inevitable crashes. If history is any guide, a crypto analyst predicts that Bitcoin will skyrocket to a new price peak in 2025 and hit the end of the road after crashing to $50,000 in 2026. Despite the anticipated bull run in 2025, historical data suggests that Bitcoin could soon experience a significant market correction. TradingView analyst Xanrox said in a recent report that BTC’s price will crash to $50,000 in 2026. Analyst Calls For BTC Price Crash To $50,000 The analyst explained that statistically, Bitcoin’s price tends to crash by 77% to 86% every four years. Moreover, his predicted price decline to $50,000 aligns with past bull cycle patterns, where Bitcoin sheds substantial value after every bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims For $150,000-$170,000 With Wave Formation, Here Are The Details Presenting a chart, the analyst highlighted the estimated durations of the Bitcoin bull and bear market. He disclosed that the bull market often lasts between 742 and 1,065 days, while the bear market typically lasts 344 to 413 days. Although previous cycles saw Bitcoin correcting to severe levels, Xanrox suggests that this upcoming crash will be much weaker due to the market’s maturing structure and the involvement of institutions. He predicts that Bitcoin will plummet by 65%, leaving many investors at a loss when they sell at low prices. Nevertheless, the TradingView analyst asserts that the downturn could present a potential buying opportunity for investors who understand the cyclical nature of the Bitcoin market. Xanrox confirmed that the market is in the final stage of the 4-year bull cycle, which should end between February and November 2025. The analyst forecasts Bitcoin’s next market top at $125,000 in 2025, after which the price crash to $50,000 is expected by 2026. Consequently, he advises investors and traders to consider selling their holdings as the price approaches the peak and to ignore “moon boys” who propose unrealistic targets of $500,000 or $1 million for BTC. He also asserts that a surge to these ambitious targets was near impossible, as it would require an enormous market capitalization for Bitcoin. How The Bitcoin Halving Influences Market Prices According to Xanrox’s chart analysis, Bitcoin price trends have consistently followed a 4-year halving cycle, which is a historical event for the crypto market. During each halving period, the block reward for miners is cut in half, reducing the number of new BTC entering the circulation. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Retest Substantially Below $100,000 If This Level Fails The TradingView analyst disclosed that investors well versed in Bitcoin halving patterns and prepared for the projected cyclic crash would be well positioned to capitalize on his projected crash to $50,000. These investors would see a Bitcoin decline as an “incredible investment opportunity, maximizing profits on funding fees as they short Bitcoin at the top. Unsurprisingly, Xanrox’s projected drop to $50,000 aligns with the typical bear market period that follows a BTC price peak. Historically, each 4-year halving cycle has included both a bull run and a bear market, with the latter signaling that the cycle is ending.

As blockchain technology continues to disrupt industries and push adoption rates higher, several cryptocurrencies stand out as top contenders for massive growth. But which coin will truly dominate the market and deliver the highest returns ahead of the next big rally? Web3Bay (3BAY): The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce space by introducing a decentralized marketplace built on blockchain technology. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay rely on centralized control, often charging high fees and monopolizing user data. Web3Bay eliminates these issues by creating a platform where buyers and sellers transact directly, with complete transparency and reduced costs. Web3Bay’s presale has already raised nearly $1 million, signaling strong investor confidence. At a presale price of $0.004562, the native token, 3BAY, offers early investors an incredible opportunity. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early adopters could see a 4,193% ROI . If Web3Bay achieves its long-term goal of disrupting the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry, the token could climb even higher, potentially hitting $0.50 or more in the years ahead. Web3Bay leverages blockchain’s transparency and security to empower users. Its smart contract-based architecture ensures secure, automated transactions, while decentralized storage solutions like IPFS protect user data. Additionally, Web3Bay operates under a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), allowing token holders to shape the platform’s future through governance votes. Bitcoin (BTC): The Undisputed Leader Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, remains the most recognized and trusted cryptocurrency in the market. Its status as a store of value and hedge against inflation has only strengthened as institutional adoption increases. With limited supply and growing demand, Bitcoin is a reliable choice for both new and seasoned investors. Bitcoin’s price has seen consistent growth during past bull runs, and many analysts predict that it could reach $182,000 or more during the next rally. This growth would be driven by factors such as the 2024 halving event, which will reduce mining rewards and create a supply shock, as well as increasing institutional interest from companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and others. Ethereum (ETH): The Foundation of Web3 Ethereum powers the majority of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces, making it the backbone of the Web3 ecosystem. Its recent transition to Ethereum 2.0 has improved scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction speeds, positioning it for long-term growth. Currently priced around $3000, Ethereum is expected to climb to $10,000 or more during the 2025 bull run, representing a 270% ROI . This growth will be fueled by the increasing number of developers building on Ethereum, as well as the continued adoption of Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. Solana (SOL): The Speed King Solana has gained widespread recognition for its high-speed and low-cost transactions, making it a favorite for developers building decentralized applications and NFTs. Its ability to process over 65,000 transactions per second sets it apart from competitors like Ethereum. Solana’s current price of $258 could soar to $1,000 or higher in the next bull run, offering a 287% ROI . Its growing ecosystem, which includes partnerships with major companies like Google Cloud, ensures continued adoption and expansion. Cardano (ADA): The Eco-Friendly Blockchain Cardano is a research-driven blockchain that prioritizes sustainability, scalability, and security. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is not only energy-efficient but also highly scalable, making it an eco-friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Currently priced under $1, Cardano offers an affordable entry point for investors. With predictions of ADA reaching $5 or more, it could deliver a 400% ROI during the 2025 bull run. Final Thoughts The 2025 bull run promises to be one of the most exciting periods in cryptocurrency history, with projects like Web3Bay, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano leading the charge. Each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique value propositions and growth potential, making them strong candidates for investment. Web3Bay stands out for its innovative approach to e-commerce and massive ROI potential, while Bitcoin provides stability and long-term value. Ethereum’s dominance in decentralized applications, Solana’s high-speed infrastructure, and Cardano’s eco-friendly solutions round out a diverse portfolio for the upcoming rally.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , CoinShares says that institutional crypto investment vehicles raked in nearly $2 billion last week alone. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US$1.9bn last week bringing year-to-date (YTD) inflows to US$4.8bn — likely as a result of recent presidential executive orders that proposed the initiation of a strategic reserve asset in Bitcoin. Despite the relatively flat price action last week, trading volumes were high at US$25bn for the week, comprising 37% of all trading volumes on trusted crypto exchanges.” Source: CoinShares The United States regionally led international inflows, raking in $1.7 billion of the $1.9 billion in inflows. Canada, Switzerland and Germany provided $31 million, $35 million, and $23 million, respectively. Bitcoin ( BTC ), per usual, snatched up the lion’s share of inflows. “Bitcoin saw inflows totaling US$1.6bn, bringing YTD inflows to US$4.4bn, accounting for 92% of all inflows in the digital asset sector. Following Bitcoin’s pre-inauguration new all-time highs last week, it was no surprise to see short-Bitcoin ETFs regain traction, with inflows of US$5.1 million.” Ethereum ( ETH ) led altcoins with $205 million in inflows, bringing YTD ETH inflows to $177 million. With the exception of Cardano ( ADA ), no crypto institutional investment products suffered outflows last week.

Bessent, a billionaire former hedge fund manager, didn't give the crypto sector much to chew on during his nomination hearing earlier this month, but he's a known digital assets enthusiast. His boss, Trump, has already assigned him a spot on the team assigned to marshal the federal government toward a friendly system of oversight. The Senate voted 68-29 to approve Bessent's nomination Monday evening, and he'll officially join Trump's cabinet when he's sworn in to permanently replace predecessor Janet Yellen. At the center of Trump's agenda is the extension of tax cuts, so that top priority may shove crypto down the list, though the president did include it among his opening salvo of executive orders. Senator Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican who chairs the Senate Financial Committee, called Bessent ""one of the sharpest minds in the global finance industry"" before the Monday confirmation, saying ""his background and training are tailor-made for this role."" Trump's crypto order will have Bessent's Treasury taking a role on a governmental working group — backed by ""individual expertise from leaders in digital assets and digital markets"" — to hash out the strategy for U.S. crypto policy. His department is among those who'll owe the White House a report in less than two months on how to modify existing regulations or establish new ones at the Treasury, and the wider group must ""recommend regulatory and legislative proposals"" within six months. He'll also be responsible for erasing his predecessor's crypto work that had been directed by former President Joe Biden. The order also bans work on a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), which had never progressed beyond the tire-kicking stage in the U.S., despite enthusiastic adoption and testing by other jurisdictions, including China. As a nominee, the ex-chief of Key Square Group told senators in his confirmation hearing that he saw ""no reason"" to pursue the idea of a domestic CBDC, further endearing himself to crypto insiders who have been nervous the government might pursue a digital dollar. But he wasn't questioned about crypto policies. Still, Bessent is no stranger to digital assets. He'd tucked hundreds of thousands of dollars of his personal wealth into a bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), as noted in his lengthy financial disclosures. Those assets were liquidated when he received Trump's nomination. At the Treasury, Bessent is also in command of its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that had pursued crypto services with enforcement actions and rulemaking , especially involving so-called mixing services that seek to grant users anonymity by blending their transactions to make it difficult to track them. The Treasury's financial-crimes arm had focused on digital assets as a popular means of transaction in human trafficking and child exploitation . Bessent's department additionally manages U.S. financial sanctions , which have historically given the federal government reach into overseas activity, such as when it targeted mixer Tornado Cash with sanctions that were recently overturned in federal court .

AAVE has been buzzing with increased whale activity and institutional backing, while Litecoin’s impressive 25% rally following Grayscale’s spot ETF filing has made it a standout performer. Both coins are showing immense potential for short-term gains with their strong market momentum and solid fundamentals. But Qubetics ($TICS) is a game-changer in its own right. This innovative Web3 aggregator is redefining blockchain technology by solving interoperability issues and uniting major blockchains into a single ecosystem. With over $11.1 million raised in its ongoing presale and jaw-dropping ROI predictions, Qubetics is proving why it’s one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term. Qubetics Tackles Blockchain Interoperability Interoperability has been a roadblock in the crypto space, with blockchains operating in isolation and hindering seamless transactions. Qubetics changes the game as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, integrating major networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into a unified ecosystem. This makes cross-chain asset transfers and data sharing smoother than ever. Picture a logistics company relying on multiple blockchains for payments and supply chain tracking. Without interoperability, they’re stuck juggling complex processes. Enter Qubetics, simplifying everything by connecting these chains seamlessly, saving time and resources. From developers building multi-chain dApps to everyday users transferring assets, Qubetics bridges the gap for all, cementing its status as one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term . Qubetics Presale Surges Past $11.1 Million Qubetics’ presale continues to dominate, currently in its 19th stage. With over $11.1 million raised, more than 16,700 token holders, and 448 million $TICS tokens sold, it’s clear this project has the attention of serious investors. Each presale stage lasts seven days, with prices increasing by 10% every Sunday at midnight. At its current price of $0.0606, $TICS offers incredible ROI potential. Analysts predict a price of $0.25 at the end of the presale, translating to a 312.17% ROI. Post-presale, the numbers get even more enticing: $1 ($TICS) delivers a 1548.70% ROI, while a price of $10 after its Q2 2025 mainnet launch equals a staggering 16,387.05% ROI. For example, investing $1,250 now would net you 20,608.82 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $10, that same investment turns into $206,088. With analysts projecting even higher returns, there’s no better time to join the Qubetics presale. AAVE Gains Momentum With Whale and Institutional Backing AAVE has become a centerpiece in the DeFi market, thanks to a surge in whale activity and strong institutional support. Recently, a whale deposited 17,002 AAVE worth $5.9 million onto Binance, sparking speculation about future price movements. This follows an earlier $13.5 million profit (+330%) from the same whale’s trades, underscoring their bullish sentiment. Adding to this momentum is the Ethereum Foundation’s $165 million allocation to AAVE through a 50,000 ETH fund. This substantial capital boost strengthens AAVE’s liquidity and reinforces its integration within Ethereum’s ecosystem, signaling long-term confidence in the platform. The multi-signature wallet setup accompanying the funds ensures security and transparency, attracting more institutional investors. AAVE is also exploring innovative strategies for growth. One proposal involves integrating Bitcoin mining revenues into its treasury, diversifying income streams, and increasing scalability. Another plan focuses on incorporating the GHO stablecoin into Bitcoin transactions, potentially positioning AAVE as a key player in both DeFi and Bitcoin-based finance. Combined with a bullish symmetrical triangle technical setup, AAVE is well-positioned for a breakout once it clears the $372 resistance level. Litecoin Rides a 25% Rally With Spot ETF Hype Litecoin (LTC) has seen a 25% price surge following Grayscale’s filing for a spot Litecoin ETF. This news has attracted significant demand from institutional investors, validating the efforts of long-term holders (LTHs) who have consistently supported LTC through market fluctuations. The MVRV Long/Short Difference indicator remains highly positive, showing that LTHs are in profit and providing stability to the Litecoin market. This group of investors plays a crucial role in reducing price volatility by holding onto their assets instead of selling during fluctuations. Their consistent backing has enabled Litecoin to sustain its bullish momentum even in challenging market conditions. Supporting this bullish outlook is the IOMAP metric, which reveals that over 2 million LTC, valued at $256 million, were purchased in the $128 to $135 range. If Litecoin flips $136 into support, it could unlock these profits and propel the price to $147. However, failure to breach this level could result in a pullback to $117 or $105, highlighting the importance of breaking through this key resistance point. A Final Look at the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term Qubetics, AAVE, and Litecoin are each making waves in the crypto world, offering unique opportunities for investors seeking short-term gains. Qubetics stands out with its revolutionary interoperability solutions and record-breaking presale, offering unmatched ROI potential. AAVE impresses with its whale-driven momentum, Ethereum backing, and innovative growth strategies. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s strong rally and long-term holder support make it a reliable choice for continued bullish momentum. For those looking to maximize their investments, Qubetics offers an unbeatable chance to join the Qubetics presale and capitalize on one of the most promising projects in the crypto space today.

Per Seoul Shinmun , South Korean crypto traders are “troubled.” They are concerned by the fact that the holiday “overlaps with the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming base rate decision,” the outlet wrote. South Korean Crypto Community: Time to HODL, Sell, or Buy? As such, the outlet reported, domestic traders are unsure if they should hold, pre-emptively sell, or even buy coins during the holiday. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit over the past year. (Source: CoinGecko) This year, Lunar New Year falls on January 29. But in South Korea – as the days prior to and following New Year’s Day are also public holidays – most firms are also giving their workers the day off on Monday (27) and Friday (31). That means that, including the two weekends, most workers have nine days off this year. But while the South Korean stock market will be inactive during the holidays, the 24/7 nature of crypto means no such slowdown is expected in the coin markets. The media outlet said Upbit crypto exchange data shows domestic Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) prices trended upward “during the Lunar New Year holiday for the past three years.” Korea started the Lunar New Year holiday with scattered rain and snow flurries on Monday, although most areas have seen only a few snowflakes. https://t.co/DxMw9syGcV — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) January 27, 2025 Holiday Uncertainty for Traders Kim (first name withheld) is a Seoul-based crypto trader. He told Cryptonews.com that the holiday period would likely be full of “uncertainty” this year. Kim said: “It will be a bit of a nail-biting time if the Fed or US President Donald Trump make announcements. If so, the South Korean market will probably respond fast. But traders are always ready for volatility in the markets. We just have to stay alert. That’s the nature of trading crypto.” The holiday period, however, has also seen significant drops. These have included instances of day-on-day drops of up to 5%. The top five coins per trading volume on the South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb on January 27, 2025. (Source: CoinMarketCap) For South Korean traders, almost everything will hinge on events in the USA, the media outlet reported. Domestic regulators and politicians are unlikely to make any major announcements during the holidays. So events in Washington will likely be the driving force behind any price movements on domestic platforms. Seoul Shinmun noted that “since the election of Trump ,” interest “in cryptocurrency investment has increased in South Korea.” The Fed is widely expected to freeze its current benchmark interest rate of 4.25-4.50% at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which kicks off on January 28. South Korea is undergoing an unprecedented political crisis with impeached President Yoon facing one legal proceeding that could oust him from office and another that brings a possible death penalty. Here's what to know. https://t.co/jKB92C62QD — Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) January 27, 2025 Experts Speak The crypto services provider Matrixport told the same media outlet: “In the past 12 years, Bitcoin has risen 11 times during the Lunar New Year holiday period. Negative factors such as the Fed’s hawkish stance are putting downward pressure on the markets. But positive factors, like expectations about a forthcoming strategic Bitcoin reserve in the US, are supporting BTC prices. So there is a high probability of an increase in the days following the Lunar New Year holiday.” An unnamed domestic crypto exchange employee told Seoul Shinmun: “Since Trump’s election, market liquidity has increased rapidly. And South Korean trading volumes here have increased to a level surpassing that of the stock market. The crypto market operates 24 hours a day and is highly volatile. So people would be wise to take a cautious approach.” The post South Korean Crypto Investors Face ‘Nail-biting’ Lunar New Year Conundrum appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|South Korea|Trading,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-27 23:30:00

Faced with these warnings, some are joining a meme coin shift to utility, looking for tokens that solve real problems. Among these picks, a fresh project called Remittix stands out as a strong contender for future success. Shiba Inu and Pepe Show Signs of Struggle After a period of intense hype, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down -6.96% over the month, while Pepe (PEPE) dropped -12.24%. Critics say these meme coins rely on social media buzz more than practical uses. While Shiba Inu tries adding features for loyal fans, many doubt it can stay strong in the face of competition. As a result, more investors see a meme coin shift to utility happening, where coins like Remittix may offer stable growth. Likewise, Pepe soared on memes but lacks a clear plan for long-term adoption. Many who once praised Pepe (PEPE) for quick gains now worry about future crashes. Observers note that meme-based tokens can tumble just as fast as they rise. Hoping to avoid major losses, holders of both Shiba Inu and Pepe look at tokens built for real use cases—like Remittix (RTX), which addresses cross-border payments. The Appeal of Utility Tokens Experts link the meme coin shift to utility to rising demand for coins that can fix real finance issues. While Shiba Inu captured attention through meme culture, it now faces a crowded market. Meanwhile, Pepe struggles to keep up if big holders exit. By contrast, Remittix focuses on cheap, fast transfers, drawing interest from those who value direct benefits over internet hype. Supporters say Remittix (RTX) outperforms meme tokens by tackling everyday challenges. It aims to reduce fees on international payments, helping families, freelancers, and businesses. This focus on real-world solutions has driven many Shiba Inu and Pepe holders to join its presale. By merging user-friendly transactions with the fun side of crypto, Remittix stands to eclipse older meme coins in the next few years. Remittix Prepares for 2025 Dominance With many predicting a decline for both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) in 2025, the stage is set for Remittix (RTX) to shine. Some investors foresee 100x returns if Remittix gains enough traction. Unlike meme tokens, it doesn’t rely on surprise tweets or viral spikes; instead, it builds steady demand by solving cross-border finance woes. This steady growth could give Remittix a lasting edge, especially if more users adopt it for daily transactions. The meme coin shift to utility suggests people now prefer tokens that help them save on remittances or speed up global payments. By 2025, experts think Remittix may outlive weaker meme coins, proving that practical solutions often beat short-lived hype cycles. Conclusion While Shiba Inu and Pepe once drew large followings, many now doubt their longevity. Fearing crashes by 2025, holders from both groups seem eager to join the meme coin shift to utility. Leading this trend, Remittix (RTX) offers fast, low-cost transfers that appeal to anyone wanting real worth in a coin. With its user-focused approach, Remittix appears ready to become a top choice for those seeking stability beyond memes.

In response to these forecasts, some investors are transitioning from meme coins to utility tokens, seeking options that address real-world issues. Among these, a new project called Remittix is emerging as a promising candidate for future growth. Shiba Inu and Pepe Facing Challenges After experiencing a surge of excitement, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has decreased by -6.96% over the past month, and Pepe (PEPE) has fallen by -12.24%. Critics argue that these meme coins depend heavily on social media excitement rather than practical applications. Although Shiba Inu is working on adding features for its dedicated users, many doubt its ability to withstand increasing competition. Consequently, more investors are witnessing a shift from meme coins to utility tokens, with Remittix potentially offering more stable growth opportunities. Similarly, Pepe gained popularity through memes but lacks a solid plan for sustained adoption. Many who once admired Pepe (PEPE) for its rapid gains now fear potential downturns. Observers point out that meme-based tokens can fall as quickly as they rise. To avoid significant losses, holders of both Shiba Inu and Pepe are turning to tokens designed for real-world applications—such as Remittix (RTX), which targets cross-border payment solutions. The Attraction of Utility Tokens Experts attribute the trend from meme coins to utility tokens to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies that address genuine financial challenges. While Shiba Inu captivated audiences through memes, it now faces stiff competition in a crowded market. Meanwhile, Pepe struggles to maintain momentum if major holders decide to sell. In contrast, Remittix emphasizes cost-effective and speedy transactions, appealing to those who prioritize tangible benefits over online buzz. Advocates claim Remittix (RTX) surpasses meme tokens by addressing everyday issues. Its goal is to lower fees on international transactions, benefiting families, freelancers, and businesses alike. This real-world focus has attracted numerous Shiba Inu and Pepe holders to its presale. By combining user-friendly transactions with the engaging aspects of cryptocurrency, Remittix is poised to surpass older meme coins in the coming years. Remittix Gears Up for Dominance in 2025 With predictions of a downturn for both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) in 2025, Remittix (RTX) is positioned to take the spotlight. Some investors anticipate 100x returns if Remittix gains sufficient traction. Unlike meme tokens, it doesn't depend on unexpected tweets or viral trends; instead, it aims to create consistent demand by resolving issues in cross-border finance. This steady growth could provide Remittix with a lasting advantage, especially as more users begin using it for everyday transactions. The shift from meme coins to utility tokens indicates that people now prefer cryptocurrencies that help them save on remittances or expedite global payments. By 2025, experts predict Remittix may outlast weaker meme coins, demonstrating that practical solutions often triumph over fleeting hype. Conclusion While Shiba Inu and Pepe once attracted large numbers of followers, doubts about their sustainability are growing. With concerns over potential declines by 2025, holders from both communities are eager to embrace the shift from meme coins to utility tokens. Leading this movement, Remittix (RTX) offers quick, affordable transfers that appeal to those seeking genuine value in a cryptocurrency. With its user-oriented strategy, Remittix is poised to become a preferred choice for individuals looking for stability beyond memes.

They made the most of the Shiba Inu pump and are about to do the same with the budding 1Fuel . This has put crypto traders on their heels, as they hope to buy into 1Fuel before it's too late. The new token is billed for a massive upward rally and may yield explosive profits for proactive investors. This makes it a good crypto asset to have in your portfolio now. Can Shiba Inu return explosive yield like the early days? Shiba Inu gained popularity due to its early gains of up to 10,000x in May 2021. The meme coin became an Internet sensation getting endorsement from major market movers like Elon Musk. Shiba Inu quickly rose in prominence and was able to make early position holders wealthier. The Shiba Inu token remains a prominent token in the crypto space, ranking 17th, with about $11b market cap. However, Shiba Inu isn't looking as promising as before. The meme coin is on a downward run, dipping by about 17% in the past month. Shiba Inu is now below its $0.000020 critical support level, trading at $0.000018 currently. Analysts say the chances for an explosive run from Shiba Inu looks slim. But they expect the meme coin to reverse its dip in the coming month gradually. Shiba Inu could rally back to its $0.000024 monthly high in February, possibly ending Q1, 2025, at $0.000030. 1Fuel: Early investors eye Shiba Inu-like returns Crypto investors have been on the lookout for the next 10,000x token and 1Fuel may just be the one they are looking for. The new token is gaining high traction despite just being a presale token. Top investors see 1Fuel as a low risk purchase with a high tendency to yield high returns. Hence, many are positioning themselves to gain from it massively. The presale token is valued at $0.017 currently, but could be worth double by the next phase. This makes it important to join early, to enjoy low-price entry and potential high-margin return. The projection for the 1Fuel token is high and joining the presale at this early position could bring up to 1000x. Patience investors may even enjoy higher yield than that from 1Fuel. The 1Fuel project is among those expected to disrupt the DeFi space. The crypto project will come with a cold storage feature and technologies to make trading easier and more efficient. This will put 1Fuel amongst the most used platforms for cross-chain trading and asset management. The crypto solution will also resolve concerns about privacy by introducing a military-grade mixer to conceal users’ sensitive data. This will guarantee anonymity and ensure users' privacy is well protected. 1Fuel will be a multi-beneficial project with the power to transform the DeFi space and make it more satisfactory for users. The crypto project is already attracting interest with its features, with analysts predicting high adoption. 1Fuel's tangible utilities set it apart from Shiba Inu and other viral tokens. This implies that it's not only gaining traction based on hype, but it also has revolutionary use cases that make it essential. Thus, analysts are convinced it could boom and maintain relevance for a long time and make the owners profitable. The 1Fuel presale is still fast selling and investors eyeing Shiba Inu-like profit may consider joining the presale now.

Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $34,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address (CA) – 8i5qNveWm4AkzM2z7Abb9coLjjRbUyMGUxPR2V75FwLK – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BTC|FIAT|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-27 23:51:00

As a result, top altcoins like Binance Coin and Solana are very likely to see a significant upswing in Q1, driven by ongoing developments and upgrades within their respective ecosystems. However, despite their projected success, a new PayFi project, Remittix ($RTX) , is stealing their spot in the portfolios of investors. This innovative project has already been labeled a top crypto ICO project and compared to the transactional capabilities of Solana. In this article we will reflect on some of the latest occurrences around Solana price and BNB price, considering why their holders are increasingly migrating into Remittix. BNB’s Month-long Consolidation is Raising Concerns BNB has been making several strides to develop its ecosystem and strengthen its market position. Last week, it was reported that Gate Ventures invested $20 million in the BNBIncubation Alliance, which will help accelerate blockchain and Web3 startups. Binance Coin also completed its 30th token burn , destroying 1.63 million BNB worth approximately $1.16 billion, reducing the total supply to 142.47 million BNB with 42.47 million left to burn via Auto-Burn and real-time mechanisms. This token burn strategy plays a crucial role in BNB's long-term value proposition, reducing supply and enhancing price stability. Contrary to these efforts, BNB price changes hands at $684.81, down 0.80% from last week's opening price and 2.7% in the last 30 days. This consolidation has spooked investors, most of whom are looking for an opportunity in Remittix, a PayFi solution rivaling BNB price and Solana's transactional concept. Would Solana ETF be Approved Soon? Solana’s transactional efficiency has long been one of its strongest selling points. Its high-speed blockchain network is designed to allow low charges and high throughput. In the early hours of Sunday, Solana price saw a sharp 4.5% intraday spike, slipping past the $250 price level to trade at $253. However, despite this rally, the Solana price trajectory has shown little upward movement over the past month, oscillating between $275 and $230 price points. An important catalyst for this growth in the future will likely be the recently proposed Solana ETF, which could take Solana to new highs once approved. Grayscale Investments has filed an application to list a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on the NYSE, a move that may even further legitimize SOL in the eyes of traditional investors. While the ETF is surrounded by optimism, Solana price continues to move sideways and holders remain skeptical about the possibility of delays, which might be like what happened with Ripple. Due to this fact, investors have started to look for other options and one of the attractive ones is Remittix for stability and growth. Remittix ($RTX) - The Next 100x Altcoin? Remittix is quickly gaining momentum as an innovative PayFi project that offers a frictionless cross-border bridge between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. One of the standout features of Remittix is its flat-fee model, ensuring that recipients receive the exact amount sent without hidden charges. This feature has positioned Remittix as a key challenger to competitors like Stripe, Wise and Coinbase, none of which offer direct crypto-to-bank transfers. With advantages such as global reach, lower fees, faster processing, transparency and 24/7 accessibility, industry experts are not only backing Remittix to rival Solana’s transaction efficiency but also offer one of the top crypto ICOs of Q1. The ongoing presale aims to raise $36 million and is expected to sell out within eight weeks. The $RTX token is currently priced at a discounted rate of $0.0383 making it an attractive entry point before anticipated parabolic rallies. Given its potential to bridge a multi-trillion-dollar market gap and attract institutional interest, Remittix is drawing attention from Binance Coin and Solana holders eager to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto. Investors are looking to Remittix for robust security, cost efficiency and the ability to provide a relatable cross-border solution to businesses and freelancers. While the market is heating up, this is the perfect moment to take advantage of the Remittix presale and lock a stake in what could very well be the next 100x altcoin.

Consequently, leading altcoins like Binance Coin and Solana are set to experience a substantial rise in the first quarter, fueled by continuous advancements and enhancements in their ecosystems. Yet, despite their anticipated growth, a new PayFi venture, Remittix ($RTX) , is capturing attention within investor portfolios. This groundbreaking initiative has already been dubbed a leading crypto ICO project and is being likened to Solana's capabilities in transactions. In this article, we will delve into recent developments concerning Solana price and BNB price, exploring why their holders are increasingly turning to Remittix. Concerns Mount Over BNB's Prolonged Consolidation BNB has been actively working to expand its ecosystem and bolster its market position. Just last week, Gate Ventures committed $20 million to the BNB Incubation Alliance, aiming to accelerate blockchain and Web3 startup growth. Binance Coin also executed its 30th token burn , eliminating 1.63 million BNB valued at roughly $1.16 billion, cutting the total supply to 142.47 million BNB, with 42.47 million set to be burned through Auto-Burn and real-time methods. This strategy is pivotal for BNB's long-term value, as it helps in reducing supply and ensuring price stability. Despite these efforts, BNB price is trading at $684.81, a drop of 0.80% from last week's opening and 2.7% over the past month. This stagnation has unsettled investors, many of whom are now eyeing opportunities in Remittix, a PayFi solution that challenges both BNB price and Solana's transactional model. Is Solana's ETF Approval on the Horizon? Solana's efficiency in transactions has consistently been a major draw. Its high-speed blockchain is built to enable low fees and high throughput. Early Sunday, Solana price jumped 4.5% intraday, surpassing the $250 mark to hit $253. However, this boost hasn't translated into a strong upward trend over the past month, with prices fluctuating between $275 and $230. A potential driver for future growth is the newly proposed Solana ETF, which could elevate Solana to unprecedented levels once it gains approval. Grayscale Investments has submitted an application to list a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on the NYSE, a step that could enhance SOL's credibility among traditional investors. Despite the positive buzz around the ETF, Solana price remains on a sideways path, and holders are wary of possible delays, reminiscent of Ripple's experience. Consequently, investors are seeking alternatives, with Remittix emerging as an appealing option for stability and growth. Remittix ($RTX) - Is It the Next 100x Altcoin? Remittix is rapidly gaining traction as a pioneering PayFi initiative that provides a seamless cross-border bridge between digital and traditional currencies. A standout aspect of Remittix is its flat-fee structure, ensuring recipients get the exact amount sent without hidden costs. This advantage positions Remittix as a formidable competitor to platforms like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase, which do not offer direct crypto-to-bank transfers.

What starts with a surge of excitement can quickly turn into chaos. The launch of the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin in January not only captured the crypto community’s attention but also opened Pandora’s box as fraudsters eager to exploit the hype, overwhelming the market with fake tokens and harmful applications. On Jan. 17, President Donald Trump debuted his meme coin marketed as a unique opportunity to express “support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs” embodied by the symbol TRUMP, according to the meme coin’s official website, which was also featured on Trump’s announcement on X.

Go to https://t.co/GX3ZxT5xyq — Have Fun! pic.twitter.com/flIKYyfBrC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 Within just 48 hours of its release, TRUMP achieved a market cap of $72 billion, creating a “perfect storm for fraud,” analysts at Israel-headquartered blockchain forensic firm Blockaid say. However, this surge attracted not only speculators seeking to earn quick bucks but also malicious actors who sought to take advantage of the frenzy. The blockchain firm revealed in a research report that scammers wasted no time in capitalizing on the buzz surrounding the token’s release. These malicious actors quickly flooded the market with fake tokens, hoping to deceive investors who were eager to jump on the bandwagon. The report shows a 206% increase in tokens using the “Trump” name on the launch day, from 3,300 to 6,800 tokens. These scammers created numerous tokens that were designed to mimic the TRUMP meme coin, making it difficult for investors to distinguish legitimate assets from fraudulent ones. A Blockaid spokesperson told crypto.news that scammers began making it “increasingly difficult for investors to distinguish between legitimate tokens and malicious ones.” “ and this challenge is not unique to TRUMP. In almost every major web3 launch, our team sees how threat actors are creating projects that mimic the branding and excitement of the real tokens, creating confusion and exposing users to significant risks.” Oz Tamir, the research and development lead at Blockaid The number of fake tokens containing the word “Trump” | Source: Blockaid With the public eager to purchase TRUMP tokens, these fake assets were able to gain traction and even generate profit for the scammers behind them. The same surge in interest was seen in malicious decentralized applications, which also saw a sharp increase following the launch. The day after the meme coin hit the market, impersonator dApps saw a 14x rise, Blockaid says, adding that more than 90 fake applications appeared in just 24 hours. You might also like: Blockaid new dashboard to track web3 activity and threats Blockaid’s report also notes that scammers didn’t stop with just the TRUMP token. Other tokens referencing members of the Trump family, such as “Melania” and “Barron,” surged by hundreds of per cent, too, giving the impression of a network of tokens tied to the Trump brand. These tokens helped create the “illusion of an interconnected ecosystem,” Blockaid says. Tamir notes that the biggest spike in fake tokens “was noticeable on Solana, especially during this launch, given the prevalence of meme coins on the network.” “That said, EVM networks like Ethereum have consistently been a hotspot for scams as well, including both fake tokens and malicious dApps targeting EVM users.” Oz Tamir As the excitement around high-profile launches grows, so does the opportunity for scammers to take advantage of unsuspecting users. Unfortunately, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, while empowering users, also opens the door for malicious actors to exploit the system. In response to the surge in scam activity, Blockaid says it has been trying to prevent users from interacting with malicious tokens and fake dApps. Since the launch of the TRUMP token, the firm disclosed it has blocked hundreds of users from engaging with fraudulent assets.

This blockchain-powered e-commerce platform is not only redefining online shopping but also generating significant excitement with its presale, which has now surged past $950,000. This article explores the latest developments in the crypto space, highlighting why Web3Bay is emerging as a top investment opportunity in 2025. Cardano’s Hydra Upgrade Fuels Optimism Cardano (ADA) is on a roll, with its recent Hydra upgrade propelling the blockchain to new heights. This innovative scaling solution has significantly boosted Cardano’s transaction speed, reaching an impressive 501,000 transactions per second (TPS) while keeping costs low. This makes Cardano a strong contender in the race for blockchain efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, Cardano is gaining real-world traction, with Argentina embracing the technology for various applications, including social security benefits systems, university collaborations, and union records. These developments showcase the growing utility of ADA and its potential for widespread adoption. With ADA currently trading at $1.12, analysts are optimistic about its future prospects. Many believe that Cardano could surpass its previous all-time high of $3.09 and potentially reach $5 in this cycle, fueled by its robust technology and increasing adoption. Toncoin’s Price Surge: Is $7 the Next Target? Toncoin (TON) is also generating excitement, with key indicators suggesting a potential surge in its price. Currently priced at $5.63, TON has shown strong upward momentum, rebounding from a recent low of $4.99. CryptoQuant’s Normalized Risk Metric (NRM) indicates that TON is entering a low-risk accumulation phase, historically a precursor to significant price increases. If TON breaks above its 50-day simple moving average at $5.88, analysts predict that it could soon reach targets of $6 or even $7. Web3Bay Presale Explodes Past $950k! $1 Million Next?! Web3Bay is not just another crypto project; it’s a game-changer that’s poised to disrupt the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. By combining blockchain technology with a user-centric approach, Web3Bay is creating a truly revolutionary platform.

With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early investors could see returns exceeding 6,430%. But Web3Bay is more than just a promising investment. The platform is packed with innovative features, including decentralized storage, Layer-2 scaling for fast and affordable transactions, and cross-chain compatibility.7 Furthermore, Web3Bay boasts a community-driven governance model, ensuring that users have a say in shaping the platform’s future. With its presale inching towards $1 million and its innovative features generating significant buzz, Web3Bay is emerging as a top contender in the crypto space. This is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that has the potential to redefine how we shop online. Summing Up The crypto landscape is constantly shifting, with established projects like Cardano and Toncoin showcasing impressive growth and innovation. Cardano’s Hydra upgrade is a testament to its commitment to scalability and efficiency, while Toncoin’s bullish signals suggest a potential price surge on the horizon. However, Web3Bay emerges as a standout contender, offering not just a promising investment opportunity but also a vision for the future of e-commerce.

39588996,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-breaks-records-as-unknown-tech-launch-looks-to-take-on-cardano,1738022948,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/39588996.jpeg,1Fuel Breaks Records As Unknown Tech Launch Looks To Take On Cardano,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-breaks-records-as-unknown-tech-launch-looks-to-take-on-cardano,"ADA experiences increased market volatility as 1Fuel (OFT) emerges as a strong competitor in crypto. With its advanced DeFi features, cross-chain transactions, and robust privacy measures, 1Fuel attracts significant investment, challenging ADA's position in the market. The performance of its record-breaking presale shows that 1Fuel is prepared to disrupt existing platforms and potentially reinvent digital asset management during 2025. Cardano’s struggles continue: Analysts adjust price predictions for ADA Cardano (ADA) is currently facing a challenging period, with its price experiencing a notable decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has dropped approximately 9.5% in the past 24 hours, bringing its value down to around $0.90. This significant price decrease can be attributed to large-scale sell-offs by whales, creating uncertainty among investors and raising concerns about the coin’s performance in the coming weeks. The analysts at CoinCodex project ADA to climb up to $2 by February 20, 2025, representing a 111% market gain. Cardano investors anticipate the coin value hitting the $2.61 mark in mid-April, accompanied by a projected 169% market value growth. The Changelly forecast projects Cardano's peak value to reach $1.46 during April but expects prices to stay below $2. The Cardano ecosystem expands by increasing active addresses to 50,000, notwithstanding price fluctuations. At its current trading price of $0.8771, Cardano maintains a total market capitalization of $30.85 billion with a daily transaction volume of $941.56 million. 1Fuel: The rising DeFi powerhouse set to disrupt the crypto market The innovative DeFi and digital asset management solutions of 1Fuel (OFT) have propelled it to compete at the front of the cryptocurrency market. The platform distinguishes itself through its complete ecosystem to provide future-proof crypto features for user convenience and advanced functionality. The core functionality of the 1Fuel service consists of a decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet that lets users achieve cross-chain transactions quickly with a single button click. The 1Fuel platform distinguishes itself with its unique single-click mechanism that removes the requirement to use multiple wallets or additional tools to move assets through diverse blockchains. 1Fuel's true disruptive capability results from its dedication to privacy protection and security. Through the platform's privacy mixer feature, every transaction benefits from total anonymity and is protected by disposable wallets and military-grade cold storage. 1Fuel surpasses the standard privacy protocols of Ledger and Core Wallet by delivering enhanced protection so users can enjoy a secure digital transaction environment. The storage functionality of 1Fuel represents only a fraction of how the platform transforms crypto asset management. The platform offers three core features: a crypto debit and credit card for fast fiat exchange, a peer-to-peer exchange for direct transfers, and AI-powered asset management tools. Because of its distinctive features, 1Fuel provides a strong solution for storing and managing digital assets, appealing to many investors. Large investors, often called ""whales,"" consider 1Fuel a top choice in decentralized finance (DeFi) investments due to its high-profit potential in the growing DeFi market. The ongoing presale has already distributed more than 156 million tokens and raised over $1.5 million. Analysts believe that 1Fuel's value could increase 100 times after its launch, particularly given its low price of $0.017.

The new model released on Monday, has come along with huge excitement about the DeepSeek’s R1, which has impacted the tech stock market, resulting in volatility on the market with chipmaking giant Nvidia shares dropping by over 17%. DeepSeek says Janus-Pro-7B is better than many prominent models Some AI enthusiasts concur with the startup that the latest model is better than many models on some benchmarks. An AI observer Rowan Cheung indicated that the new model outperforms competitors OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion on some benchmarks like GenEval and DPG-Bench. The Chinese startup also claimed the superiority of its model in a technical report on Monday. DeepSeek said its model outclassed rivals from OpenAI and Stability AI on rankings for image generation using text prompts. According to Disclose.tv , the benchmarks highlight Janus-Pro-7B’s competitive advantage, which has potential to influence future AI research. This comes as the industry is observing developments taking place in China and how other global firms will react to this advancement and the intensified competition ahead. Apart from R1, another development from the Chinese AI startup that has disrupted the tech industry, the release of Janus-Pro-7B comes as the sector is fast evolving with tech firms from all over the globe are innovating to release new products and services and stay ahead of competition. Janus-Pro-7B is capable of generating images making it competitive on the market. In their technical report, DeepSeek AI revealed that Janus-Pro-7B boasts 7 billion parameters, coupled with improved training speed and accuracy in image generation from text prompts. According to Cheung’s observations, DeepSeek AI’s new model could break new barriers to AI performance. The GenEval and DPG-Bench perpetuated by Investing.com and mentioned by Cheung are important in evaluating how effective and versatile AI models are. To outperform in these benchmarks shows that DeepSeek’s new model has a competitive edge in tasks, influencing the paths of future research and development. Deepseek’s industry effect According to Reuters, the DeepSeek-V3 model has become a top-rated free app on Apple’s App Store in the US. Janus-Pro-7B is an upgrade on the previously created Janus released late last year.Janus had initially been a product of DeepSeek launching a new assistant based on the DeepSeek-V3 model. The release of Deepseek AI’s Janus-Pro-7B has had a cataclysmic impact on the sector, especially the financial performance of the markets. Share prices of numerous AI related stocks have dropped significantly in the last few hours as investors assessed the possible impact of the new and strong Chinese ChatGPT alternative. From Tokyo to New York, investors sold off several tech stocks due to fears that the emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI model would threaten the current dominance of AI leaders like Nvidia. Nvidia was on track to lose as much $600 billion in market value, becoming the biggest ever single-day loss on Wall Street. “If it’s true that DeepSeek is the proverbial ‘better mousetrap,’ that could disrupt the entire AI narrative that has helped drive the markets over the last two years,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. “It could mean less demand for chips, less need for a massive build-out of power production to fuel the models, and less need for large-scale data centers. However, it could also mean that AI becomes more accessible and help kickstart the development of a wide array of useful applications.” Jacobsen. According to Invest.com, the immediate investor reaction shows the sensitivity of tech stocks to innovations and the high expectations for the role of AI in technology in the future. However, Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns almost one million Nvidia shares described the Monday selloff as an over-reaction.

Among the excitement, Cardano (ADA) is facing downturns while many holders are eyeing up Remittix (RTX), a new project that is quickly becoming a top contender in the PayFi space, with investors flocking in to the presale left, right, and center. Engineered to transform cross-border payments, Remittix is setting out to address real-world financial inefficiencies with a platform that combines simplicity, speed, and accessibility. So what are the key features of this revolutionary PayFi solution and how might Cardano fare in 2025? Cardano (ADA) Posts Sharp Dip Cardano (ADA) started off 2025 strong, rallying from $0.86 to $1.13 within the space of 5 days, though its fortune didn’t last long as Cardano (ADA) then dropped dramatically on the 9th, back down to $0.88. A couple of fluctuations later, Cardano (ADA) has ended up at the $0.98 mark, still representing an increase on its December price, though the last week has seen a sharp 7.22% dip. Cardano’s 24 hour trading volume has also taken a hit, now sitting at $588 million, which is minimal relative to Cardano’s sizable $34.6 billion market cap. Cardano’s current price trajectory looks bleak, though one thing the asset has going for it is that very few whales are involved with Cardano, so large sell offs are typically less explosive than with other cryptos. Remittix Changes the Game for Global Payments Remittix is addressing one of the biggest problems in finance today: inefficiency. Cross-border transactions tend to be terribly outdated. Typical systems charge high fees, have long processing times, and frustrate users with hidden costs. Remittix offers a modern alternative. By allowing users to seamlessly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and transfer funds to any global bank account, Remittix eliminates these pain points. Traders stand to benefit from Remittix’s unparalleled flexibility. Imagine being able to cash out your profits in fiat instantly without the need for intermediaries. Remittix simplifies the process of swapping currencies, ensuring speed and reliability at all times. The platform also offers a strong value proposition for businesses. The Remittix Pay API allows companies to accept cryptocurrency payments while settling transactions in fiat. For freelancers, online stores, and service providers, this functionality opens up new payment options without requiring them to understand the complexities of cryptocurrencies. Remittix (RTX) offers a broad selection of fiat and crypto pairs to offer high levels of flexibility for businesses and individuals. In total, there are 30 fiat currencies supported and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs available, making managing funds easy. This adaptability has made Remittix (RTX) an appealing tool for companies operating across multiple regions. Security and privacy are becoming top concerns in today’s financial landscape, and Remittix excels in both areas. Recipients of payments via Remittix receive funds as standard bank transfers, with no indication that the transaction originated in cryptocurrency.

Proactive Investors Flock To The Remittix Presale Currently priced at $0.0350, $RTX has raised over $8 million in its ICO and shows no sign of losing momentum any time soon. Its modern approach to issues in the cross-border payments space and PayFi in general has led industry analysts to anticipate an 800% price upshot by the end of the presale and a potential 5,000% rally post-launch. For investors seeking a project with strong fundamentals and practical applications in the modern world, Remittix (RTX) stands out as an unmissable opportunity.

Amidst this buzz, Cardano (ADA) is experiencing a slump, while many of its holders are shifting their focus to Remittix (RTX). This emerging project is rapidly gaining traction in the PayFi sector, drawing investors to its presale in droves. Designed to revolutionize international payments, Remittix aims to tackle financial inefficiencies with a platform that prioritizes ease, speed, and accessibility. What are the standout features of this groundbreaking PayFi solution, and what might the future hold for Cardano in 2025? Cardano (ADA) Experiences a Sudden Decline Cardano (ADA) kicked off 2025 on a high note, climbing from $0.86 to $1.13 in just 5 days. However, its success was short-lived as Cardano (ADA) plunged back to $0.88 on the 9th. After a few more fluctuations, Cardano (ADA) settled at $0.98, still above its December price, but the past week has witnessed a steep 7.22% drop. Additionally, Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume has decreased, currently at $588 million, which is relatively small compared to its hefty $34.6 billion market cap. Cardano's price forecast appears grim, but one advantage is the limited involvement of whales, reducing the likelihood of massive sell-offs compared to other cryptocurrencies. Remittix Revolutionizes Global Payment Systems Remittix is tackling one of the major challenges in finance today: inefficiency. Cross-border transactions are often outdated, burdened with high fees, long processing times, and hidden costs that frustrate users.

Each one has a loyal community and fresh ideas. While Bonk is a newer meme coin, Dogecoin carries meme fame, and Remittix aims to solve real financial problems. Below, we explore how Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) might perform by the end of January—and why many think Remittix could surpass them all. Bonk’s Outlook Over the past day, Bonk is down -3.17%, with a -13.76% drop over the week. Despite these dips, some fans still view Bonk (BONK) as a fun meme coin with unique community events—like recent burns meant to boost scarcity. Yet meme coins often rely on hype, so people wanting a viral altcoin price prediction might be cautious. Others note that new tokens can surprise everyone if they find a lasting use case. Even though Bonk has a strong online following, critics point out it lacks major partnerships or serious adoption. If it wants to stay among the best altcoins for 2025, it must show real progress soon. Meanwhile, new practical coins like Remittix (RTX) might lure traders away. Some also compare Bonk (BONK) with established meme tokens, raising questions about how long the project can keep attention. Dogecoin’s Potential Some still champion Dogecoin, which is down -1.21% today, -11.32% this week, but up +12.92% for the month. While Dogecoin (DOGE) holds a top spot among meme coins, people wonder if upcoming ETF possibilities could spark another rally. Others look for a viral altcoin price prediction that goes beyond memes, prompting them to explore more functional tokens. Devoted holders say Dogecoin might see higher demand if more businesses and influencers push for adoption. Even so, meme coins can’t rely on hype forever. If investors want coins that fix real issues, Remittix (RTX) looks more appealing. Some watchers think Dogecoin (DOGE) will keep a loyal fan base, but its main draw remains the meme factor, which might not satisfy serious use cases. Remittix: The Real Outperformer Over the last few weeks, Remittix soared about +142%, drawing attention from traders who focus on practical solutions. Supporters highlight how Remittix (RTX) cuts cross-border fees, offering rapid money transfers. Because it handles real problems, many see it as the strongest contender among the best altcoins for 2025. In contrast to meme coins, Remittix delivers an everyday purpose that could sustain growth long after the hype dies down. While Bonk and Dogecoin chase internet fame, Remittix (RTX) aims for global adoption. Some call it a prime example of a viral altcoin price prediction that isn’t tied to short-lived trends. By providing near-instant conversions to fiat, Remittix could capture users who want more than memes. That’s why experts say Remittix stands poised to outperform both Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in the months ahead. Conclusion All three tokens—Bonk, Dogecoin, and Remittix—have drawn attention for January 2025. Bonk (BONK) tries to build a meme-based community, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains an iconic meme coin, and Remittix(RTX) tackles real-world money transfers. Yet many believe Remittix leads the pack among the best altcoins for 2025, thanks to its practical use and rapid adoption. If real-world utility matters most, Remittix may claim the spotlight.

Each boasts a dedicated community and innovative ideas. While Bonk is a newer meme coin, Dogecoin has meme recognition, and Remittix seeks to tackle genuine financial issues. Let's delve into how Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) could fare by the end of January—and why many anticipate that Remittix may outpace them all. Forecast for Bonk In the past 24 hours, Bonk has dropped by -3.17%, and it has seen a -13.76% decline over the week. Despite these setbacks, some enthusiasts still see Bonk (BONK) as an entertaining meme coin with distinctive community activities—such as recent burns intended to increase scarcity. However, meme coins often depend on hype, so those seeking a viral altcoin price prediction might approach with caution. Others point out that new tokens can surprise everyone if they establish a lasting utility. Even though Bonk enjoys a strong online following, critics note its lack of significant partnerships or widespread adoption. To maintain its status among the top altcoins for 2025, it needs to demonstrate real progress soon. Meanwhile, new practical tokens like Remittix (RTX) could attract traders away. Comparisons between Bonk (BONK) and established meme tokens also raise questions about the project's ability to sustain interest. Dogecoin’s Future Prospects Some continue to support Dogecoin, which is down -1.21% today, -11.32% for the week, but has risen +12.92% over the month. While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a leading meme coin, there's speculation about whether potential ETF developments could trigger another surge. Others are looking for a viral altcoin price prediction that extends beyond memes, prompting them to consider more functional tokens. Loyal supporters believe Dogecoin could see increased demand if more companies and influencers advocate for its adoption. Nonetheless, meme coins can't rely on hype indefinitely. For investors seeking tokens that address real issues, Remittix (RTX) appears more attractive. Some observers think Dogecoin (DOGE) will maintain a dedicated fan base, but its primary appeal remains the meme factor, which might not satisfy those looking for serious applications. Remittix: The Genuine Standout Recently, Remittix has surged by approximately +142%, capturing the interest of traders who prioritize practical solutions. Advocates emphasize how Remittix (RTX) reduces cross-border fees, providing fast money transfers. Since it addresses real-world issues, many view it as the strongest candidate among the best altcoins for 2025. Unlike meme coins, Remittix offers a day-to-day purpose that could sustain growth long after the hype fades. While Bonk and Dogecoin chase online popularity, Remittix (RTX) is aiming for worldwide adoption. Some consider it a prime example of a viral altcoin price prediction that isn't tied to fleeting trends. By offering near-instant conversions to fiat, Remittix has the potential to attract users seeking more than just memes. That's why experts predict Remittix is set to outperform both Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in the upcoming months. Conclusion All three tokens—Bonk, Dogecoin, and Remittix—have captured attention for January 2025. Bonk (BONK) aims to establish a meme-based community, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues as a classic meme coin, and Remittix (RTX) addresses real-world money transfers. Yet, many believe Remittix is leading the charge among the best altcoins for 2025, due to its practical application and swift adoption. If real-world utility is the priority, Remittix might take the spotlight.

The sell-off was caused by Chinese AI company DeepSeek, who shattered confidence in the competitiveness of US tech companies. Nvidia’s shares plummeted to levels not seen since October, dragging the broader tech market down with it. The crash hit other major players hard too. Micron and Arm Holdings dropped over 11% and 10%, respectively, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom took severe hits of 6% and 17%. Power infrastructure companies tied to AI, like Constellation Energy and Vistra, faced staggering losses of 20% and 28%, respectively. European chip giants ASML and ASM International saw sharp declines during trading hours, while in Asia, Japanese chipmakers like Advantest and Tokyo Electron also reported massive losses. In late December, DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model and claimed it built the model in just two months on a $6 million budget, a figure that dwarfs the multi-billion-dollar investments typically required for similar projects in the West. Also, the company rolled out a reasoning model last week that third-party tests say outperformed OpenAI’s most recent offerings. Nvidia praises DeepSeek Nvidia addressed the situation early on in the day. A CNBC report claims the company said, “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. Their work shows how new models can be created using widely available models and export-compliant compute. Inference still requires a significant number of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking.” They added that DeepSeek’s models prove new scaling laws for AI—pre-training, post-training, and now test-time scaling. Meanwhile, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz and an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, called DeepSeek’s breakthrough “one of the most amazing and impressive advancements I’ve ever seen” in a social media post. But while investors panicked over Monday’s sell-off, Wall Street analysts are raising broader concerns about US leadership in AI. Citi analysts said DeepSeek’s success shows how the cost of computing has become a major barrier in the industry. They added that US companies still dominate the high-end AI chip market, but the emergence of cost-efficient alternatives like DeepSeek’s models could challenge that dominance. The $500 billion Stargate AI project was announced last week, and Citi analysts believe the project demonstrates how the need for top-tier GPUs, like those manufactured by Nvidia, will persist regardless of any competition. Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts questioned DeepSeek’s claims that it developed its models for under $6 million. They suggested that figure might not include prior research and experiments. In a research note, the analysts called DeepSeek’s tools “fantastic” but warned against labeling them as miracles. They described fears of a collapse in the AI infrastructure market as “overblown.” JPMorgan Chase added to the debate. “Investors are concerned that rather than impede China’s progress in AI, US restrictions have pushed Chinese companies to innovate faster and more efficiently,” they wrote. The immediate impact of DeepSeek’s announcement is clear: a massive reevaluation of the AI sector’s biggest players. Nvidia, which trades at a premium 32 times its next 12 months’ earnings, saw its valuation come under scrutiny as its shares plunged.

Solana Has Seen A Crash Over The Last 24 Hours The cryptocurrency sector as a whole has plummeted during the past day, with Solana not being spared as its price has also gone through a notable decline. Below is a chart that shows how SOL’s recent performance has looked. From the graph, it’s visible that Solana has suffered a steep plunge of almost 12% in this period, which is worse than many other top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, has seen a decline of around 5%. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $181,000? Mayer Multiple Reveals When BTC Will Become ‘Overbought’ Following this crash, Solana is now back at the $227 level. The asset has seemingly paused its fall for now, but it’s possible that it would resume soon. SOL Has Breached Under Its Symmetrical Triangle In a post on X earlier in the day, analyst Ali Martinez discussed about a Symmetrical Triangle that Solana had been trading inside. The “Symmetrical Triangle” here is a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that forms when the price of an asset consolidates between two trendlines of a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the triangle connects together lower highs in the price, while the lower level joins higher lows. As the asset travels inside the pattern, its range gradually converges on the midpoint line. Like other TA patterns, the upper level of this pattern is likely to provide resistance to the asset. Similarly, the lower line can help the cryptocurrency to reach a bottom. A break out of either of the trendlines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, a break above the triangle is a bullish signal, while a fall under it can lead to a bearish outcome. The Symmetrical Triangle is just one possible type of triangular-shaped formation that an asset can display. Two other popular ones are the Ascending and Descending Triangles, which occur when one of the trendlines is parallel to the time-axis (the upper one in the case of the former and the lower one for the latter). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that the 1-hour price of Solana had been stuck inside over the past week: From the graph, it’s visible that Solana was approaching the apex of the triangle when Martinez had made the post. As the consolidation becomes narrower, a breakout can become more probable to occur, which appears to be just what has happened with SOL in the hours since. The height of this triangle was equal to a swing of around 20%. Usually, Symmetrical Triangle breakouts are of the same degree as the height of the pattern, so the analyst had noted that SOL could be primed for a 20% move.

Beyond the humor and quirky branding, these tokens now offer tangible opportunities for growth. Crypto projects that include bonus incentives have become a go-to choice for savvy investors. Why? Because who doesn’t love doubling their chances at massive returns? Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu initially led the charge, showcasing the sheer power of community-driven movements. Now, newer players like BTFD Coin (BTFD) are taking the spotlight with innovative features, including staking, play-to-earn (P2E) games, and exclusive referral programs. Add bonus codes like LAUNCH100, and you’ve got a recipe for a frenzy in the crypto market. With established tokens like Floki Inu (FLOKI) and rising stars such as Brett (BRETT) joining the game, the meme coin universe is more exciting than ever. But BTFD is set to shake things up even further with its aggressive presale performance and creative rewards. Let’s dive into why this coin—and a few others—might just make your investment portfolio pop. BTFD Coin: The Ultimate Game-Changer in Meme Coins BTFD Coin has raised over $5.7M in its presale, crossing the halfway mark of its journey within the first two weeks.

BTFD offers an innovative referral program, rewarding users for bringing in new investors. It’s simple: share your unique referral link, and when someone invests, you earn rewards in tokens. It’s a win-win for everyone involved, making BTFD a community-first project. The Bulls Squad initiative adds a creative twist.

That nets you 218,750,000 tokens. When BTFD hits $0.0006 post-presale, your holdings would skyrocket to a value of $131,250—a potential profit of $96,250.

The FlokiFi Locker allows projects to secure their liquidity, building trust with investors. The Valhalla game is another hit, where players can earn FLOKI tokens in an engaging, virtual environment.

Its innovative ecosystem and loyal community have ensured its place in the top tier of meme cryptos. BRETT: A Rising Star with Community Backing BRETT is the underdog story every investor loves. With a strong focus on community engagement, BRETT has rapidly gained traction as a meme coin with heart. Built on a decentralized framework, it prioritizes transparency and user involvement in decision-making. One standout feature is BRETT’s deflationary mechanism. With every transaction, a small percentage of tokens are burned, reducing supply and increasing demand. This unique approach has helped stabilize its value and attract long-term investors. The coin also has a creative side. BRETT supports independent artists and meme creators, hosting contests and funding projects that highlight its quirky charm. This strategy has turned casual fans into active participants, growing its loyal user base. BRETT isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a cultural movement. Its dedication to transparency, creativity, and community engagement ensures it remains a standout pick for 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe Coin holders are turning their focus to Elluminex, a promising new viral coin. Table of Contents Pepe saw spectacular growth Elluminex could be the next 100x token Last year saw several crypto assets achieve spectacular growth. The latest bull market only compounded these gains, leaving traders hungry for more. Pepe was among these tokens, increasing over 30,000% in the last few years. Still, Pepe is currently among the biggest memecoins, but its potential upside is limited. Traders looking for similar gains should look for new projects. One of the most promising ones is Elluminex (ELX), a DeFi token promising to transform the TON ecosystem. Pepe saw spectacular growth Pepe is currently one of the dominant memecoins, maintaining the fourth position among all memecoins. The token used to be the third largest memecoin before the sudden rise of the Official Trump token. This development has rocked investors, and Pepe has seen significant volatility. Last week, Pepe dropped 16.71%, to its current price of $0.00001542. Still, this was after a year of strong growth, and Pepe is still up 1420.30% from the same time last year. Still, recent on-chain data shows large whale activity. For instance, the “0x8f5″ address withdrew 280 billion Pepe from Binance, worth around $5 million. This indicates that the whale is gearing for significant moves, which will likely increase volatility. Technical indicators show mixed signals for Pepe. While the weekly oscillators are mostly bearish, moving averages are mixed. Notably, short-term moving averages point to sell, indicating slowing momentum for Pepe. You might also like: Crypto analyst Ali says DOGE could go to $15, new altcoin to boost Toncoin Elluminex could be the next 100x token While Pepe has seen significant growth, Elluminex is just starting out. Elluminex is a DeFi hub for TON, currently the fastest-growing chain. Its strong fundamentals give it the potential to replicate some of the largest bull runs. Last year, TON’s ecosystem showed significant growth. For one, the number of wallet addresses on the network grew by 3380%. Moreover, network TVL increased 8x, to a high of $740 million. Driving this increase in activity was its Telegram integration, through engaging games such as Notcoin. Despite its strong metrics, TON’s DeFi ecosystem is still in its infancy. For that reason, traders are betting that the Elluminex could change the narrative. Its network of cross-chain bridges will connect TON to 40 major blockchains. This will bring in much-needed liquidity, helping stabilize asset prices and boost confidence in the network. Cross chain bridges also enable Elluminex to offer trading with low slippage, which is crucial for making profit. This is why the platform has the potential to attract more traders to TON. The potential effect of this is hard to overstate. For instance, when Uniswap launched on Ethereum, it helped increase ETH’s price from $200 to $1,000 in a single year. Elluminex also offers advanced trading features, including an AI Portfolio tracker. This tool will give actionable insights based on real-time data. This feature will help level the playing field for traders, making trading more accessible than ever. Thanks to its advanced features, Elluminex has the potential to become a premier DeFi hub on TON. This position’s it for significant growth in 2025. To learn more about Elluminex, visit the website , Twitter , and Telegram .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Wall Street Pepe smashes $61 million presale milestone, cementing its status and aiming for more gains. Table of Contents Wall Street Pepe: The retail-driven change in crypto Why Wall Street Pepe is generating massive demand Presale nearing its end Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) continues to captivate the crypto world, surpassing its $60 million fundraising goal and achieving $61.4 million in ICO. The project has garnered $7.4 million in the past six days alone, bringing the total raised since the presale end-date announcement on January 17 to $11.4 million. This momentum solidifies Wall Street Pepe as one of 2025’s hottest presales, setting new benchmarks for meme coins and signaling potential whale involvement. The recent explosive launches of TRUMP and MELANIA showed the market’s appetite for meme coins, but Wall Street Pepe takes a different approach. Unlike these projects, which faced criticism for centralized control over token supply, WEPE is built on a foundation of community-driven tokenomics. The project ensures fairness by distributing the supply widely among its community, preventing large-scale control by founders and aligning with its mission of empowering investors of all sizes. Wall Street Pepe’s structure not only fosters trust but also positions it as a project built to deliver long-term value for its supporters, making it a standout in the competitive meme coin space. With WEPE tokens currently priced at $0.0003665, early investors still have a chance to join before all tokens are sold out. $60M raised. Focused. Energized. Moist. 🐸⚔️ pic.twitter.com/Siqf6zqVKM — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 26, 2025 Wall Street Pepe: The retail-driven change in crypto Wall Street Pepe has captured the attention of both retail investors and whales, creating a unique ecosystem where traders of all sizes can thrive. With significant whale activity driving momentum alongside strong retail support, WEPE has positioned itself as a standout project in the meme coin space. Unlike other meme coins, WEPE combines the power of large transactions with a vibrant community of smaller traders, fostering a dynamic and inclusive environment. This balance between retail investors and whales underscores Wall Street Pepe’s broad appeal and growing influence in the market. More than just a meme coin, Wall Street Pepe functions as a private trading group designed to empower everyday investors. Members benefit from shared strategies, curated market insights, and actionable trading signals, enabling them to compete effectively against whales. Just recently, Altcoin Daily noted that major financial institutions engage in market manipulation. However, Wall Street Pepe’s community-driven mission offers retail investors the tools to challenge these trends. By uniting smaller traders, WEPE has created a space for collective impact, allowing retail investors to navigate the market with confidence. WEPE stands out in the meme coin space by combining its lighthearted Pepe the Frog aesthetic with practical tools and a mission to challenge traditional financial powerhouses. Token holders unlock exclusive perks, including access to high-probability trades, top meme coin opportunities, and a dynamic community space aimed at collaborative success. You might also like: Pepe coin price crashes as risky patterns slowly develop Why Wall Street Pepe is generating massive demand Wall Street Pepe’s meteoric rise can be attributed to several key factors, which crypto influencer ClayBro outlined in a recent analysis. With over $61 million raised at a pace of around $100,000 per hour, the project has captured widespread attention, demonstrating strong presale momentum. While whales seem to be jumping on board, smaller investors remain at the heart of the project, creating a unique balance of inclusivity and high demand, the expert said. ClayBro added that the token stands out for its transformative features, offering staking rewards of up to 21% APY, curated crypto insights, and tools designed to help investors navigate the rapidly evolving market. He said he is bullish on WEPE’s future, forecasting a price of $0.13 by the end of 2025, with potential peaks during market rallies. Pro-crypto policies and increasing institutional adoption may further fuel long-term growth. Additionally, the project’s focus on empowering smaller traders aligns with a growing demand for fairer market participation, reinforcing its mission. Wall Street Pepe’s approach has positioned it as a transformative force in the crypto space, making it far more than just another meme coin. Presale nearing its end With a maximum allocation of 146 billion WEPE tokens (73% of the total supply), the window to secure tokens at the presale price is closing. The overwhelming demand suggests tokens may sell out before the official presale end date. To join this movement, visit the Wall Street Pepe website and connect a wallet, such as Best Wallet, a leading Web3 solution offering multichain support and easy access to promising investments. The app, available on Google Play or the Apple App Store, simplifies the process of purchasing WEPE directly. For more information on Wall Street Pepe, visit their website , X , or Telegram .

Pseudonymous trader Pentoshi tells his 847,800 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the Ethereum ( ETH )-based automated staking service Lido DAO ( LDO ) is gearing up for a steep move up. The analyst believes that traders will enter long positions on LDO amid speculations that US regulators will approve the staking of ETH held in spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “LDO Probably violent repricing when the filings come in the next couple of weeks… If you believe ETH staking will be approved, then LDO is likely a great bet. So far, the price seems to be appreciating rapidly and has begun to start to price this in.” Source: Pentoshi/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to be targeting $3.612 for LDO. At time of writing, LDO is worth $1.95 Another altcoin on the trader’s radar is Ondo Finance ( ONDO ), a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that aims to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs). Pentoshi says the ONDO Summit 2025 slated for February 6th could fuel short-term rallies for the crypto asset. “ONDO summit coming up in [10 days]. BlackRock’s chief investment officer will be speaking and they have many connections there that will likely lead to some speculation short-term. Price could potentially move up leading into the event followed by a sell-off on whatever news it may be. Might be a good short-term play. One-12 days.” The trader also highlights that he plans to unload his ONDO stack just before the event. At time of writing, ONDO is worth $1.29.

Musk Fuks Robots (MUSKROBO), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Fuks Robots can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Robots could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Robots launched with over $40,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Robots on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Robots by entering its contract address (CA) – 9yuANCwHs443YpCDnUr2GfSkDSTxUweQL1m2vMaYnTT5 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 01:11:00

This is partly because the performance of ADA stands as both an indicator of general market performance and a standard for innovative blockchain technologies. Present technical analysis shows warnings of a downward movement in Cardano (ADA) price. Bearish indicators predict a major price adjustment. While Cardano navigates uncertainty, 1Fuel (OFT) is capturing attention in DeFi. With its innovative privacy-focused wallet and ongoing presale, 1Fuel generates considerable buzz. Investors are asking whether 1Fuel could be the latest breakthrough in decentralized finance. Can Cardano (ADA) Reclaim the $3.00 Mark? Cardano maintains its leading position among altcoins because technological advances continue unabated with expanding decentralized finance integration. ADA is trading at $0.88 on January 27, 2025. The market capitalization of Cardano stands at $31 billion . Investors hope to see Cardano reclaim its peak price level of $3.00 sooner rather than later. Though the blockchain’s native token, ADA, took a 10% price dip over the last 24 hours, Cardano is still one of the leading players in the crypto space. Analysts are bullish, particularly with the upcoming Plomin hard fork, an upgrade designed to increase decentralization and refine on-chain governance. Despite existing challenges, the long-term outlook for Cardano remains strong and positive. ADA stands a good chance to recover if it maintains its position above $0.807 as it exhibits a bullish pennant formation on the weekly chart. However, some investors have started looking for alternatives since Cardano’s research-driven development strategy could mean limited growth potential. Although the project has stable long-term prospects, its incrementally slow growth greatly contrasts with the high potential offered by projects like 1Fuel. 1Fuel has captivated attention with rapid, high-yielding potential. Is 1Fuel The Next Big Thing in The $120 Billion DeFi Industry? A new crypto wallet is on the horizon with sights on disrupting the DeFi space. According to CoinGecko, decentralized finance is worth over $120 billion and 1Fuel aims to provide solutions for cross-chain transaction obstacles that DeFi users face. Cross-chain transactions, at the moment, pose unique difficulties for traders because of their complexity. Users are exposed to risks of funds loss while shuffling between wallets. Security remains the highest priority for 1Fuel’s development team. The privacy technology in the project allows all users to keep their financial activities anonymous. This DeFi gem also features military-grade cold storage where users can store their digital assets offline. With this, the assets are unreachable by hacks and breaches while accessible to the user. Users can also use disposable wallets which can be discarded when no longer needed. These security features provide maximum transaction protection, making 1Fuel the top choice for privacy-focused investors. This new wallet leverages AI to give its users an edge in the market.

It’s an exciting time to be a part of this convergence, as innovative platforms are emerging that are redefining how we buy and sell online. Web3Bay, a blockchain-powered marketplace, is leading the charge with its groundbreaking approach and a presale that’s attracting massive attention. But it’s not just startups that are making waves; established e-commerce giants like Mercari are also embracing the crypto revolution, with their own crypto exchange seeing a surge in user activity. This article explores the remarkable achievements of Web3Bay and how it’s shaping the future of online shopping, while also examining the broader trend of cryptocurrency adoption in the e-commerce sector. Web3Bay: A Presale Success Story Web3Bay (3BAY) is not just another player in the e-commerce space; it’s a pioneer that’s shaping the future of online shopping. With its secure and transparent platform, innovative use of blockchain technology, and commitment to user empowerment, Web3Bay is poised to become a leader in the decentralized e-commerce revolution. In just a couple weeks of presale, the platform has successfully raised over $930,000, underscoring significant investor enthusiasm. The presale coin price of $0.004562625 in stage 4, which has attracted considerable buying interest, reflects the confidence investors have in the potential of this platform. This robust participation in the early stages of the presale highlights the growing trend toward integrating blockchain into e-commerce platforms, where it can offer enhanced transparency, security, and efficiency. Web3Bay’s commitment to decentralization empowers users by giving them more control over their data and transactions, unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that often operate as centralized gatekeepers. Web3Bay’s platform aims to redefine the traditional e-commerce business model by utilizing blockchain to ensure secure and transparent transactions. It offers users the ability to conduct transactions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries, reducing fees and increasing speed. Moreover, by incorporating smart contracts, Web3Bay guarantees that all parties adhere to agreed terms before any transaction is completed, thereby mitigating fraud and enhancing user trust. Mercari: Japanese E-commerce Platform Embraces Crypto The growing convergence of e-commerce and cryptocurrency is not limited to startups like Web3Bay. Established e-commerce giants are also recognizing the potential of blockchain technology. Mercari, a well-known Japanese e-commerce platform, has recently expanded into the cryptocurrency space with its own crypto exchange. This strategic move has yielded impressive results, with Mercari reporting a ninefold increase in user activity on its crypto exchange. This surge in popularity underscores the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and valuable component of the e-commerce landscape. Mercari’s foray into the crypto world is a testament to the increasing integration of blockchain technology and digital currencies into mainstream businesses. By offering users the ability to buy, sell, and trade crypto assets, Mercari is not only diversifying its services but also catering to the growing demographic of crypto-savvy consumers. A Quick Recap The success stories of Web3Bay and Mercari illustrate a significant shift in the e-commerce landscape. Blockchain offers solutions to many challenges that have plagued traditional e-commerce platforms, such as payment security, product authenticity, and transaction efficiency. By leveraging blockchain’s inherent transparency and security, platforms like Web3Bay are creating a more trustworthy and efficient online shopping experience. Looking ahead, the synergy between e-commerce and cryptocurrencies is expected to strengthen, driven by consumer demand for greater security, transparency, and global accessibility. Web3Bay’s blockchain-powered marketplace and Mercari’s successful crypto exchange are just the beginning of this exciting evolution.

Stellar Coin is making strides in the global payment systems by enabling swift and economical international transactions, currently valued at $0.08. On the other hand, the Cardano price is causing a stir among investors, with forecasts suggesting a potential increase to $7, supported by its robust technical infrastructure and consistent growth pattern. BlockDAG captures significant attention with a successful $185 million presale. Offering the LAUNCH300 bonus, which triples BDAG holdings instantly, BlockDAG stands out at a price of $0.0248 and a projected 3932% return by 2025, marking it as one of the best cryptos to buy now for explosive growth. Stellar Coin: Transforming International Payments Stellar is revolutionizing the approach to international transactions by providing a rapid, efficient, and low-cost method for global transfers. Its open-source network links financial entities, payment gateways, and individuals, thereby establishing itself as an essential instrument for remittances and international dealings. With a current valuation near $0.08, Stellar Coin is gaining the interest of leading banks and fintech firms. This growing interest is driven by Stellar Coin’s effective applications in digital finance. Despite the presence of competitors focusing on payment solutions, Stellar’s ability to address financial hurdles renders it a solid investment for those looking for practical and operational investment options. Cardano Price Trajectory: Anticipating a Surge to $7 While Cardano’s price has shown stability, the outlook from industry specialists remains favorable for its future. Predictions suggest ADA might rise to $7 soon, presenting an attractive option for investors interested in cryptocurrencies with solid foundations. Famed analyst Big Mike notes that according to the Elliott Wave theory, ADA could escalate to $3 in its third phase before a slight retreat to $1.5 and an eventual climb to $7. These cycles are expected to unfold gradually, starting from May 2023 and extending potentially through April 2024. Technically, ADA has shown promising signs, climbing from $0.28 to $1.33 last year and now testing a support level at $0.81. If this holds and a bullish pennant forms, Cardano’s price could revisit $3, setting the stage for considerable growth. Amplify Your Crypto Portfolio with BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 promotion delivers an exceptional 300% bonus on each BDAG purchase, effectively tripling your holdings instantly. This opportunity provides a strategic advantage for those looking to enhance their position in the cryptocurrency market. Currently, BlockDAG’s presale has successfully raised $185 million, attracting attention from key players in the industry and moving closer to its goal of $600 million. This momentum is building confidence among buyers. Experts predict that BDAG’s price could reach $1 by 2025, which, from its current price of $0.0248, could yield a return of 3932%. Those who secured early have already realized a 2380% ROI, highlighting BDAG’s potential as one of the best cryptos to buy now. The LAUNCH300 initiative not only increases your immediate holdings — for example, buying 1,000 BDAG now would instantly give you 4,000 coins — but also positions you to benefit from the upcoming price increases as the current batch nears its end. Now is an optimal time to buy for significant growth by 2025. Identifying the Best Cryptos to Buy Now For those looking for the best cryptos to buy now , Stellar Coin, Cardano, and BlockDAG offer lucrative opportunities. Stellar Coin, priced attractively at $0.08, continues to excel in facilitating international payments. Cardano remains a key interest for investors, with potential pricing reaching $7, supported by robust technical indicators and steady growth trajectories. BlockDAG distinguishes itself with its presale success and the LAUNCH300 bonus, providing threefold returns on BDAG purchases.

At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $101,000, following a 3.7% decline in the last 24 hours. This recent movement appears to have not only instilled hope in investors but has also caught the attention of analysts now closely monitoring on-chain data and short-term holder behavior to understand the asset’s next potential move and the critical levels to watch. Related Reading: Crypto Experts Forecast Bitcoin Market Peak: Bear Market Could Emerge Within 3 Months Key Support level for Bitcoin Yonsei Dent, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake Platform, has highlighted key metrics indicating that short-term holders (STH) may play a pivotal role in defining Bitcoin’s immediate support levels. In his latest analysis, Dent identified $89,900 as a critical support level for holders who have held BTC for one week to six months. He noted that most short-term holders remain in profit, which reduces the likelihood of a sudden wave of selling pressure. However, Dent also acknowledged that holders in the three-to-six-month range are at a loss, though their limited market share—9.4% of the Realized Cap—minimizes their potential to disrupt broader market dynamics. Dent’s findings also indicate that the $89,900 level serves as both a technical and on-chain support zone. As market volatility continues to compress, this support level gains importance. Any breach or bounce from this range is likely to draw significant attention from traders and analysts. The data suggests that short-term pullbacks may not trigger widespread panic selling, keeping the market relatively stable around this price mark. With Volatility Highly Compressed, Where is the Key STH Support Level? “This suggests that $89.9k could be a stable support zone, even amid short-term pullbacks.” – By @Yonsei_dent Link 👇https://t.co/4ayRJBQlWe pic.twitter.com/iNlBMriS78 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 27, 2025 Major Players Refuse To Sell Their BTC Holdings Meanwhile, another CryptoQuant analyst, Grizzly, provided additional insight into the behavior of long-term and short-term holders. According to Grizzly, the SOPR ratio—measuring the profit ratio between long-term and short-term holders—has not risen as sharply during the current bull run compared to previous cycles. This may indicate a shift in market behavior as Bitcoin matures. Grizzly pointed out that as more cycles occur, investors become less inclined to engage in speculative trading. Instead, they appear to adopt a more measured approach, treating Bitcoin as a long-term asset rather than a quick profit opportunity. Furthermore, Grizzly noted that institutional participation in Bitcoin has fundamentally “altered” market dynamics. With more capital flowing into Bitcoin portfolios rather than exchanges, there is a visible decrease in immediate selling pressure.

Filecoin is scaling its decentralized storage network to new heights, while Binance continues to dominate as the go-to trading platform for millions of users. But the star of the show is Qubetics, which has achieved a major milestone with its Stage 19 presale, attracting over 16,700 token holders at a price of $0.0606. With 448 million $TICS tokens already sold, Qubetics is proving why it’s the best crypto to buy this week. While Filecoin’s data storage innovations and Binance’s trading dominance are impressive, Qubetics is redefining the blockchain landscape with its real-world applications and game-changing technologies like its asset tokenization marketplace and TICSScan explorer. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics the frontrunner and explore how Filecoin and Binance are shaping the future of blockchain. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization At the core of Qubetics’ ecosystem is its real-world asset tokenization marketplace , a solution designed to bridge the gap between tangible assets and digital ownership. This platform allows businesses and individuals to tokenize assets such as real estate, art, or intellectual property, enabling fractional ownership and opening up new investment opportunities. Imagine a small business owner in Chicago who owns a commercial property but lacks the funds to expand. With Qubetics, they can tokenize the property into digital shares and sell them to investors worldwide, raising capital while retaining partial ownership. Similarly, an artist in Los Angeles can tokenize their artwork, giving fans the opportunity to invest in their creations. By democratizing access to traditionally exclusive markets, Qubetics empowers users from all walks of life. This level of inclusivity, combined with blockchain transparency and security, positions Qubetics as a game-changer in the crypto space and among the top 3 cryptos . TICSScan: Redefining Blockchain Transparency Qubetics’ TICSScan is another groundbreaking innovation, offering users unparalleled insight into the blockchain ecosystem. This explorer provides real-time data on transactions, token movements, and contract interactions, enabling investors and developers to make informed decisions. For instance, a crypto trader in Brazil can use TICSScan to monitor the flow of $TICS tokens across exchanges, optimizing their trading strategy. Developers can also leverage this tool to analyze smart contract performance, ensuring their projects run smoothly. By providing a clear window into blockchain activity, TICSScan enhances trust and accountability within the Qubetics ecosystem. Qubetics Presale: A Record-Breaking Opportunity Qubetics’ Stage 19 presale has attracted over 16,700 token holders, selling 448 million $TICS tokens at a price of $0.0606. Each presale stage lasts only seven days, with a 10% price hike every Sunday at midnight, creating a sense of urgency among investors. Now, let’s talk about ROI. A $1,000 investment at the current price would yield 16,487 tokens. If $TICS hits its projected $15 post-mainnet launch in Q2 2025, that investment could skyrocket to $247,305. It’s no wonder Qubetics is the best crypto to buy this week, combining innovative technology with impressive growth potential. Filecoin: Scaling Decentralized Data Storage Filecoin is making significant strides in the decentralized storage space, positioning itself as a critical player in blockchain infrastructure. According to recent updates, Filecoin’s network now supports over 18 exabytes of storage, enough to back up the entire internet several times over. This capability has attracted a growing number of developers and enterprises looking for secure, decentralized alternatives to traditional cloud storage. What sets Filecoin apart is its ability to incentivize users to share unused storage space. This model not only reduces costs but also promotes sustainability, making it an attractive option for businesses aiming to lower their carbon footprint. Analysts predict continued growth for Filecoin as demand for decentralized storage solutions rises across industries. Binance: Dominating the Crypto Trading Arena Binance remains the undisputed leader in crypto trading, boasting a daily trading volume exceeding $50 billion and a user base that spans over 180 countries. The platform’s ability to adapt to market changes and introduce innovative features, such as Binance Earn and Launchpad, keeps it at the forefront of the industry. Recent reports highlight Binance’s success in fostering ecosystem growth through its BNB Chain, which supports over 1,000 decentralized applications (dApps). By combining scalability, security, and low transaction fees, Binance continues to attract developers and users alike. Its global reach and robust infrastructure make it a cornerstone of the crypto market. The Final Word Filecoin’s data storage innovations and Binance’s trading ecosystem highlight their unique strengths, but neither matches the transformative potential of Qubetics. With its real-world asset tokenization marketplace, TICSScan transparency tool, and a presale that has already attracted over 16,700 holders, Qubetics is redefining blockchain innovation. It’s no surprise analysts are calling it one of the top 3 cryptos . Whether you’re an investor seeking high ROI or a business looking for blockchain solutions, Qubetics offers unmatched opportunities. Don’t miss your chance to join the Qubetics presale and be part of the next big thing in crypto. For more information, visit Qubetics, join their Telegram, or follow them on Twitter.

PayPal USD ( PYUSD ), a stablecoin issued on Solana and Ethereum chains, can now be accessible on Cardano ( ADA ) through Wanchain’s interoperability solution, according to a press release Wanchain shared with crypto.news. Wanchain chief executive Temujin Louie says the bridge will give users “more options, increased flexibility and control” while transferring assets across different chains. Cardano’s decentralized finance ecosystem with nearly $447 million in total value locked per data from DefiLlama, will open doors for “greater synergy between networks, fueling innovation and adoption, and ultimately driving the next wave of blockchain interoperability across ecosystems,” Louie added.

CHILLGUY’s Price Surge: A Warning and Opportunity CHILLGUY has recently experienced a remarkable 50% price surge, driven by viral meme culture, strategic exchange listings, and speculative investments. This sharp increase has captured significant attention, making it a hot topic among traders and investors alike. However, it’s important to remember that meme coins are notoriously volatile, with their value often tied to fleeting social media trends and market sentiment. While CHILLGUY’s growth is impressive, investors should exercise caution. Meme coins’ unpredictability makes them a risky investment, and it’s crucial to conduct thorough research and risk assessment before making any moves. As with all speculative assets, equally significant risks accompany the potential for substantial gains, and understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the market safely. Pudgy Penguins: The NFT Phenomenon That Took Off Pudgy Penguins have significantly impacted the NFT world with their charming designs and community-driven approach. Initially launched at just 0.03 ETH, these playful digital assets rapidly gained popularity, with some rare pieces selling for over 100 ETH. Their success was driven by a perfect combination of relatability, scarcity, and the organic social media buzz surrounding them, which made them highly desirable among collectors and investors. While early adopters reaped massive profits, later buyers faced steep barriers to entry, with prices rising sharply over time. Pudgy Penguins’ meteoric rise highlights the power of cultural appeal in the digital asset space. It demonstrates how the right mix of community engagement and scarcity can create significant demand, making it one of the standout success stories in the NFT market.

The open-source model was first released in December when the company said it took only two months and less than $6 million to create. The amount reported was noticeably far less than the hundreds of billions of dollars that tech giants such as OpenAI, Meta, and others have allegedly committed to developing their own models. Throughout the day, fears grew that China may be surpassing the US in the scale and efficiency of its AI investments. However, Trump’s Crypto Czar, David Sacks, has expressed confidence in the US’s ability to continue to lead in AI innovation. David Sacks comments on DeepSeek’s success In a response posted on X (formerly Twitter), Sacks, whose position in Trump’s administration involves shaping US policy on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, admitted that DeepSeek has shown the AI race will be competitive. He also praised the new president for rescinding the Biden EO, which he said “hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not)” Sacks is confident in the US, but he also thinks it can’t afford to be complacent in the race. There were mixed opinions to Sacks’ sentiment, but most seemed to agree that things will no longer be the same with DeepSeek around. As Crypto Czar, Sacks will play a role in creating a legal framework for the crypto industry and guide AI policy. DeepSeek’s success may provide the rationale to focus on minimal regulation to encourage innovation if he believes that is the only way to compete with China’s growing AI economy. How tech stocks reacted to China’s DeepSeek DeepSeek’s open-source model was released last year but its outstanding qualities did not become evident until this year, reaching viral popularly by the weekend. Since then, the app has become the top free app in the Apple App Store, pushing OpenAI’s ChatGPT into second place. The result was a sell-off of American tech stocks as worried investors seemed to have lost conviction. Nvidia was one of the biggest losers in the stock market slump as its shares plummeted as much as 18%, representing the biggest market value drop in US stock market history. The leading hardware company for AI lost nearly $600 billion in market value on Monday as tech stocks plunged. The Nasdaq Composite, which tracks the country’s largest tech firms, fell more than 3%. The Dow ended up nearly 300 points after falling earlier in the day, and the S&P 500 tumbled almost 1.5%. Nvidia said in a statement that “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement” and an example of what is possible, “leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” Other semiconductor companies that also saw major losses include Micron Technology and Arm Holdings, which both fell 10%. ASML also slid by 6%. Mega-cap tech firms also felt the ripple effect. Microsoft fell 2%, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, plummeted 4%. Meta Platforms, which is developing its own open-source AI model, also took a dump earlier in the day but ended higher by 1.9%. DeepSeek has tech giants in the US finally paying attention. Speaking at the World Economic Forum last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek’s advances and said, “We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the Select Committee on China, said “the US cannot allow CCP models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions. We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek’s AI infrastructure.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",AI|DeepSeek|OpenAI,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 02:53:01

While $TRUMP Coin has garnered massive attention thanks to its viral appeal and association with Donald Trump, Lightchain AI is quietly gaining traction among savvy investors looking for long-term growth. In this article, we’ll break down the stark differences between these two projects to help you decide which is the better investment. $TRUMP Coin – Riding the Meme Wave The $TRUMP Coin has taken the market by storm, leveraging Donald Trump’s polarizing persona and the popularity of meme coins. Much like Dogecoin or PEPE, its appeal lies in its humor, branding, and ability to generate hype. Early investors in $TRUMP Coin have seen impressive short-term gains, as the token’s value soared thanks to social media buzz and speculative trading. However, meme coins like $TRUMP are inherently volatile. Their value is driven almost entirely by community enthusiasm, making them highly susceptible to sharp price drops once the hype fades. Moreover, the lack of utility or real-world application limits their potential for long-term growth. For investors seeking a quick profit, $TRUMP Coin might be appealing, but it’s a risky bet without a solid foundation. Lightchain AI Project Built for the Future Unlike the hype-driven approach of $TRUMP Coin, Lightchain AI stands out as a project focused on real innovation and utility. Combining blockchain and artificial intelligence, it is building a transformative platform to address real-world challenges. Its emphasis on scalable, privacy-first technology sets it apart in the competitive crypto space. The presale has already garnered over $12.8 million, with tokens priced at $0.005625, reflecting strong confidence from early investors. Lightchain AI’s ability to attract such significant investment highlights its potential for long-term growth and adoption. In a market filled with speculation, Lightchain AI’s commitment to delivering impactful solutions makes it a promising leader in the new wave of blockchain technology. Investment Comparison – Hype vs. Utility Here’s how $TRUMP Coin and Lightchain AI stack up. Feature $TRUMP Coin Lightchain AI Main Appeal Meme-driven hype and branding Real-world applications and innovation Growth Potential Short-term price pumps Long-term, exponential growth Utility Minimal, hype-based High, with practical use cases Volatility Extremely high Relatively stable Entry Price Varies based on market hype $0.005625 (presale) While $TRUMP Coin might offer quick gains, Lightchain AI presents a balanced opportunity for investors seeking both growth and stability. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 03:00:00

Bitcoin’s price fell 3% to $101,400, with earlier lows reaching $97,750. The CoinDesk 20 index, which tracks a weighted average of various cryptocurrencies, recorded a 7% decline, reflecting the overall market’s cooling after reaching record highs earlier this month. Nasdaq Drops Over 3% As DeepSeek’s AI Advances Raise Concerns The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index also faced a downturn, dropping over 3%, influenced by concerns stemming from a Chinese startup, DeepSeek. The company recently announced the development of a competitive artificial intelligence model at a fraction of the cost of existing solutions, raising alarms about potential shifts in US dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Related Reading: Ready To Rocket? Dogecoin Chart Hints At Major Gains Ahead This news has sparked fears regarding Big Tech’s spending on artificial intelligence models and data centers, further exacerbating the sell-off in tech stocks in the United States market. In premarket trading, shares of major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and MicroStrategy fell about 2% each. Bitcoin mining companies took even larger hits; Core Scientific saw its shares plummet by 21%, while Terawulf and Iren (formerly Iris Energy) lost 16%. The correlation between the cryptocurrency market and the tech sector remains strong, as noted by Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, who pointed out that Bitcoin is currently more closely aligned with movements in the Nasdaq than with traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Long Liquidations Hit Bitcoin Traders The market’s volatility was further driven by significant liquidations among traders who had bet against a downturn. Over the past 24 hours, more than $250 million in long liquidations occurred, forcing leveraged traders to sell their Bitcoin holdings to cover losses. This wave of selling coincided with a mixed market reaction to President Donald Trump’s recent executive order on cryptocurrency, which had generated anticipation in the lead-up to its release but failed to meet all investor expectations. Many traders expressed disappointment that the executive order did not establish a dedicated stockpile of Bitcoin, a term that implies a more passive approach to holding assets, rather than an active strategy of regular purchases.

With the uncertainty surrounding the executive order now resolved, the market has shifted its focus to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, set to conclude on Wednesday. Market strategist Joel Kruger of LMAX noted that investors are nervously anticipating the Fed’ stance, hoping for a more accommodative approach while fearing that the central bank may not adopt the dovish tone the markets desire. Despite the recent price declines, Kruger reassured investors that the overall trend in Bitcoin remains positive, stating, “When we look at the Bitcoin chart, there is nothing bearish about the price action.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin chart|bitcoin nasdaq|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin signals|bitcoin technical analysis|btc|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|cryptocurrency|DeepSeek|DeFi|NASDAQ,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-28 03:00:03

Here’s What Every Investor Should Know About This $0.04 Crypto Token,https://nulltx.com/wallitiq-wltq-a-serious-threat-to-cardano-ada-or-just-hype-heres-what-every-investor-should-know-about-this-0-04-crypto-token/,"WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) entry into the crypto market has sparked significant interest, with experts already dubbing it the “Top altcoin of 2025”. The fact that this crypto token has already raised an estimated $6 million in its ongoing presale is a clear indication of its potential and the trust the crypto community has in it. With its rapid growth, this low-priced crypto token is set to outperform established alternatives such as Cardano (ADA). Read on to discover more about this Ethereum crypto token and the unique features that set it apart. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Ethereum Crypto Token Overshadowing Cardano (ADA) And Other Seasoned Alternatives WallitIQ (WLTQ) is an innovative decentralized crypto wallet that allows investors to store and transact over 1,000 cryptocurrencies efficiently and securely. It emerged to solve investors’ security concerns about seasoned wallets such as MetaMask and Binance. Interestingly, its crypto token is also one of the best performing in the market, outshining alternatives such as Cardano (ADA). A captivating characteristic of the WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet is its unique integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology into its platform. With its AI build, the decentralized platform has attracted an array of crypto whales and retail investors. Data shows its ongoing presale has received mainstream attention, raising over $6 million. WallitIQ (WLTQ) prioritizes the safety of investors’ holdings, guaranteeing their security 24/7 with an AI-powered intelligent security system . This system, which includes biometric authentication, behavioral analysis, and anomaly detection, uses AI to monitor and establish transactions and behavioral patterns. Any deviation from these patterns is promptly detected and flagged as a potential threat, guaranteeing the safety of investors’ assets.

To further emphasize its reliability and transparency, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a security assessment by SolidProof , a top blockchain auditing firm. Its smart contract was certified secure. Likewise, it has been listed on the CoinMarketCap website, a massive feat for an emerging crypto project. Investors are prompted to join crypto whales and savvy investors who have acquired the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token. By holding this token, investors can maximize the potential of the world-class infrastructure. Prudent investors can take advantage of the ongoing presale and buy the crypto token for an offered price of only $0.0420 . The low-priced token is expected to generate sumptuous returns for early investors when its value surges in the coming days. Cardano (ADA): Has The Smart Contract Powerhouse Reign Come To An End? The emergence of innovative altcoins such as WallitIQ (WLTQ) has shifted the focus from the smart contract and dApp powerhouse Cardano (ADA). The blockchain platform, which carried great momentum when it was launched in 2017, has recently dwindled in value. This decline in value has led to speculation that Cardano’s (ADA) reign is gradually ending, replaced by newer alternatives like WallitIQ (WLTQ). The blockchain platform’s price trend on CoinGecko also supports this claim. The price dipped by 8.5% and 2.4% in the last seven days and 24 hours, respectively. However, for Cardano (ADA) to bounce back, bulls must push the price and maintain momentum. If this doesn’t happen in the coming days, investors may move to innovative options like WallitIQ (WLTQ) for mouthwatering gains. Conclusion WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) fast growth and ROI potential could cause investors in seasoned altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) to abandon the platforms. The Ethereum crypto token has been a major revelation in the crypto scene, attracting all kinds of investors to its presale. With investors streaming into the platform daily, the current inexpensive presale price could sell out sooner than expected. Late investors would need to pay more to buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token. Consequently, prudent investors are prompted to take advantage of this last-minute opportunity and buy this crypto token now.

Trump Conquers Canada (TRUMPCAN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Conquers Canada can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Conquers Canada could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Conquers Canada launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Conquers Canada on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Conquers Canada by entering its contract address (CA) – HiPRoUXHrovHyJPB5StmSF2XwERbh78iLEfaxtpjVHJC – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 03:08:44

OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM, BITCOIN, and XRP Are Leading the Way!",https://thecoinrise.com/the-next-crypto-king-officialmagacoin-com-bitcoin-and-xrp-are-leading-the-way/,"THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is rapidly emerging as a top contender in the crypto market, with predictions of 2,000% growth potential before 2025. While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation . Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $6.09 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $9.89. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $100 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos recover to its all-time high soon?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $1.10 Market cap $1,124,401,542.96 Trading volume $53,717,376.07 Circulating supply 1,027,119,218.98 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $1.01 24-hour high $1.12 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.51% 50-day SMA $1.331 14-Day RSI 36.04 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-day SMA $0.926 Tezos price analysis: XTZ shows signs of recovery despite broader bearish momentum TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has seen a 2.15% gain in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $1.036, and resistance is at $1.235. Tezos shows signs of short-term recovery. On January 28, Tezos (XTZ) is trading at $1.103, with resistance at $1.235 and support at $1.036. Holding above $1.036 is key to avoiding further decline, while a rebound in buying could push the price above $1.219. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ continues to trend lower The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin shows a continued dip in the price. XTZ’s value is currently around $1.101, just above its critical support of around $1. XTZ continues to trend lower The MACD indicator also confirms the selling pressure observed on the chart, with a bearish crossover. The RSI (42.47) reflects a rather neutral market, indicating reduced volatility and potential price consolidation. If buyer interest does not return soon, XTZ could break below $1. The coin must break past resistance at $1.235 for a recovery to be confirmed. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Buyers reenter XTZ’s market in the short-term The 4-hour chart shows a slight recovery, trading above the lower Bollinger Bands. The Bollinger Bands are expanding, suggesting increased volatility in the short term and possible recovery. Buyers reenter XTZ’s market in the short term The MFI and CMF indicators show that there is not enough buying interest to push the price up. If XTZ fails to stay above $1.036, it might move toward lower support levels. XTZ must move back above the middle Bollinger Band at $1.127 to confirm a recovery. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.1764 SELL SMA 5 $1.1752 SELL SMA 10 $1.2318 SELL SMA 21 $1.2657 SELL SMA 50 $1.3310 SELL SMA 100 $1.1499 SELL SMA 200 $0.9268 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.2321 SELL EMA 5 $1.2535 SELL EMA 10 $1.2893 SELL EMA 21 $1.3262 SELL EMA 50 $1.2972 SELL EMA 100 $1.1630 SELL EMA 200 $1.0313 BUY What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ is struggling to break past the $1.127 resistance, which it needs to clear to continue its recovery. However, with weak money flow and low momentum, the price could stall here and may even drop back to $1.036 if it fails to push higher. Is Tezos a good long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today, falling from $1.12 to as low as $1.013, a 9.55% price drop—a move spurred by sellers disposing of their coins and taking a profit. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Quebec goes live on the Tezoso network – designed to make staking more attractive, improve transaction time and optimise economics for long-term sustainability. Earlier this week, the Quebec protocol upgrade was activated. One of the most important changes is an adjustment to the staking and delegation rewards.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ is currently trading between $1.01 – $1.12.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 03:12:55

This Bull Meme Coin is Smashing All Kinds of Records as its Presale Journey Enters Business End,https://thecoinrise.com/snek-left-you-behind-this-bull-meme-coin-is-smashing-all-kinds-of-records-as-its-presale-journey-enters-business-end/,"Many of the top new meme coins to buy this week are shaking up the market in ways we haven’t seen before. Snek (SNEK) had its moment, riding the meme coin wave with a quirky community and solid branding. But as the meme coin landscape evolves, new contenders like BTFD Coin ($BTFD) are stealing the spotlight. With BTFD Coin smashing presale records, thanks to its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, referral program, and a powerful community of Bulls, it’s clear the competition is heating up. Meme coins have evolved from being funny internet tokens to real investment opportunities. Over the years, we’ve seen Dogecoin and Shiba Inu take the world by storm, proving the power of community-backed projects. Now, top new meme coins to buy this week are bringing innovation to the table, blending entertainment, utility, and serious financial gains. BTFD Coin is leading the charge, with its P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, allowing players to earn $BTFD during P2E gameplay . But that’s not all. BTFD Coin’s presale has already raised over $5.7 million, and whispers of a Binance listing have crypto enthusiasts buzzing. If the listing comes to fruition, analysts predict the price could rocket from $0.00016 to $0.006, offering jaw-dropping returns. So, how does BTFD stack up against Snek, and why is it one of the top new meme coins to buy this week? Let’s dig in. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin; it’s a phenomenon. Its presale has been a roaring success, starting at $0.000004 and climbing to $0.00016 in Stage 14. With over 67 billion tokens sold to more than 9,700 holders, the Bulls Squad is proving unstoppable. Analysts are already projecting a price of $0.006 after its presale ends, marking a potential ROI of 3,650% for early investors. What makes BTFD Coin one of the top new meme coins to buy this week isn’t just its presale performance—it’s the ecosystem it’s building. On January 1, 2025, BTFD launched the full version of its P2E game. Players are diving in, earning $BTFD Coins while enjoying an engaging gaming experience. This utility adds a layer of fun and financial opportunity rarely seen in meme coins. But wait, there’s more. The 90% APY staking program, which went live on December 2, 2024, is another big draw. Investors can grow their holdings passively while enjoying incredible returns. The referral program sweetens the deal, allowing users to earn extra tokens by bringing in friends and family. The Bulls Squad community, with its 9,700+ holders, is at the heart of BTFD Coin’s success. These loyal supporters have turned the coin into a movement, amplifying its reach and creating buzz across social media. BTFD Coin Presale: Smashing Records and Setting New Standards The BTFD Coin presale is the talk of the town. It raised over $4.5 million within its first month and has now crossed $5.7 million in Stage 14. With just two stages left before its listing at $0.0006, the excitement is palpable. BTFD Coin’s success lies in its ability to innovate. The P2E game launched earlier this year has been a massive hit, bringing gamers and investors into the fold. The staking program, offering 90% APY, is another major draw, providing passive income opportunities that few coins can match. The referral program is driving exponential growth, creating a ripple effect that’s bringing in new investors by the day. And then there’s the Binance rumor. If BTFD lands on the world’s largest crypto exchange, analysts are predicting a price surge to $0.006. For early investors, that’s the kind of return dreams are made of. With just two stages left in the presale, the clock is ticking. This is your chance to get in before the rest of the world catches on. Snek: A Fading Star? Snek was once a name on everyone’s lips. With its quirky branding and community-driven ethos, it had all the makings of a great meme coin. But as the market evolves, Snek seems to be losing its edge. At $0.00571, it’s struggling to compete with newer, more innovative projects. One of Snek’s biggest challenges is its lack of utility. While its community remains loyal, it doesn’t have the features that coins like BTFD bring to the table. There’s no P2E game, no staking rewards, and no referral program to incentivize new investors. Without these, it’s hard for Snek to stand out in a crowded market. That’s not to say Snek doesn’t have potential. Its branding and loyal fan base give it a strong foundation. But in a world where top new meme coins to buy this week are pushing boundaries, Snek feels like it’s stuck in the past. Investors looking for serious returns might find better opportunities elsewhere. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is undeniably one of the top new meme coins to buy this week. Its record-breaking presale, innovative ecosystem, and strong community make it a standout in the meme coin market. While Snek had its moment, it’s clear that BTFD is the future. Don’t wait too long. The presale is in its final stages, and the opportunity to lock in gains at $0.00016 won’t last. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin presale . Join the Bulls Squad today and be part of something extraordinary. This isn’t just a coin—it’s a movement. The question is, are you ready to ride the wave?

ETH is now correcting losses and might face resistance near the $3,220 zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,220 resistance zone. The price is trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,270 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it stays below the $3,300 level. Ethereum Price Dips Further Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $3,320 and $3,220 levels, like Bitcoin . ETH even declined below the $3,050 level before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $3,021 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $3,050 and $3,120 levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,427 swing high to the $3,021 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,220 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,427 swing high to the $3,021 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,250 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,270 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $3,300. A clear move above the $3,300 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,420 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,120 level. The first major support sits near the $3,050. A clear move below the $3,050 support might push the price toward the $3,020 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,000 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,950.

However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2. Exclusive Sale Platform: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is only available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN , adding an exclusive appeal that many competitors lack. Unlike Solana or Optimism (OP), which are widely traded, this controlled distribution creates a sense of urgency for early investors. 3. Early-Stage Momentum: Raising $1 million within minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its market appeal. With predictions of a 50,000% increase, it’s capturing attention as a high-potential token for investors seeking exponential returns. How It Stacks Up Against the Competition Solana (SOL, $25.01): Known for speed and scalability, but it lacks the exclusive presale advantage and early momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token. Optimism (OP, $1.72): A solid project for scalability, but it’s overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s unique market positioning. Act Now Before It’s Too Late Analysts are calling THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN one of the most promising tokens for 2025, with unparalleled growth potential.

The analyst further revealed the new targets that have emerged for ETH due to the bullish pattern. Ethereum Price Forms Flag And Pole Pattern In a TradingView post, Kartik revealed that the Ethereum price had formed a flag and pole pattern, indicating that ETH could be set for a breakout. The analyst noted that this pattern has formed while Ethereum is currently on a downtrend from the $4,100 resistance level. In line with this, he revealed targets to watch out for following the formation of this pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With Rising Channel Pattern Kartik stated that the next strong support level is at $2,800. He added that the Ethereum price could see a positive move from either a breakout of the trendline or support at the $2,800 level, or both could co-occur. The analyst also advised market participants to wait for things to play out before making any decisions. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Ethereum price could rebound from the support level at $2,800 and rally to $3,600. The chart also showed that Ethereum could even rally to as high as $4,000. Meanwhile, ETH could face some resistance at around $4,100 as it targets higher prices. A break of the $4,100 resistance could lead to a further rally to $4,400. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price, stating that a breakout is imminent. This came as he remarked that ETH was on the verge of breaking out from a falling wedge pattern. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also stated that the ETH breakout seems very close, which could send its price to $4,000. ETH To Reach $5,000 Thanks To These Fundamentals In an X post, crypto analyst Ted predicted that the Ethereum price will reach $5,000 before April this year. The analyst alluded to ETH’s fundamentals to prove why such a parabolic rally is possible for the second-largest crypto by market cap. First, he mentioned the fact that Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial is buying and staking ETH, which is bullish for Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum Gets Massive $12,000 Price Tag From Research Lead Ahead Of Major Upgrade Ted further mentioned the launch of Etherealize, which will help onboard institutions. This move could increase the inflows into the ETH ETFs, which is a positive for the Ethereum price. The analyst also mentioned the Pectra upgrade, which is coming in March 2025. Alongside these bullish fundamentals, he noted that sentiment is at an all-time low, which he claimed is the best signal for reversal. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,130, down almost 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

What was supposed to simply be an experiment backed by a number of prominent influencers (like Runetoshi) turned into a chaotic situation—sniping bots, a pump-and-dump scheme, a market collapse. Add to that the questionable oversight of the investors who funded the whole thing, and you have a recipe for a disaster that has left many in the crypto community reeling from the aftermath. 12 hours ago, $RUNES launched on Solana as an experiment “backed” by influencers, including Runetoshi. The launch was immediately sniped by on-chain bots, resulting in a pump-and-dump scheme with a massive price drop post-launch. What happened? •No real decentralization… pic.twitter.com/RC8i4ciFHd — The Web3 Meme Guy (@Web3MemeGuy) January 26, 2025 The Promise of RUNES: A Vision That Didn’t Materialize RUNES was promoted as a groundbreaking new token that debuted on the Solana blockchain and enjoyed strong backing from a number of influencers. Initial press and discussions surrounding the token’s launch were very optimistic, primarily because well-known personalities in the crypto world—like Runetoshi—were championing the project. However, the aftermath of the token’s release did not align with the vision many had for it and instead took a considerably darker turn. The token first witnessed an enormous upsurge, attaining an astonishing market cap of $28 million not long after going live. Yet this spike was swiftly followed by a steep and rapid descent in price. The market cap plummeted to a paltry $500,000 in just a handful of days, with a number of investors left in the ashes. The rise and fall of the token can be traced to a number of largely ignored or overlooked factors. These factors are the following: improper decentralization, bad distribution mechanisms, and lack of transparency. With so many things working against it, one has to wonder if the project was ever really intended to succeed or if it was just a way for the people inside it and the bots that help them to make some quick profits. Rune developer Runetoshi released a Memecoin called Runes on Solana yesterday, and once pushed it up to a market value of $28 million, and then the token quickly collapsed in a violent sell-off, and the market value has fallen to $500k. Runetoshi's Twitter account has been… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 27, 2025 The Downfall: Bots, Insiders, and Lack of Transparency A leading criticism of the RUNES launch concerns the overwhelming role on-chain bots played in the token distribution. Instead of a fair and decentralized approach, these bots and a small group of insiders grabbed up most of the tokens, resulting in an immediate but unsustainable price spike. The behavior essentially turned the launch into a pump-and-dump scheme, with bots and insiders taking the lion’s share of the rewards. When the surge in demand created by them was exhausted, they dumped their tokens onto the market. Those who were caught up in the initial hype, believing it to be a legitimate project rather than a scheme, suffered a huge crash. The situation was exacerbated by the project’s complete lack of transparency concerning token distribution and the beneficiaries of the launch. This absence of straightforward answers and insight into the token mechanics left many investors with an uncomfortable number of uncertainties and a predictable number of complaints. The transparency complaints then fed right back into the project’s reputation: If you can’t see what was done and with what, it becomes easier to accuse folks of doing something untoward. The Aftermath: Runetoshi’s Suspension and the Fallout The token’s value collapsing wasn’t enough—the RUNES fallout has continued to unfold. One of the big influencers behind the project, known as Runetoshi, had his Twitter account suspended. No one knows why—or should I say, no one who knows what’s going on with this project has come forward to explain it. For many, the suspension has come to symbolize the RUNES project—a symbol of confusion and a real lack of understanding among both the project’s leadership and those who supposedly support the project. And what about speculation? Here’s what I’ve seen float around on various social platforms. Although the project was once regarded as an enticing new opportunity for the Solana ecosystem, it now stands as a cautionary tale. RUNES collapsed, and with it, the easy-come-easy-go promises of quick profits that 2021’s red-hot crypto market seemed to assure. Now, as the not-so-tweetable tale of woe unfolds, we’re reminded that most crypto projects here today can be gone tomorrow. And the ones here tomorrow may not have our best interests at heart any more than the ones in the past week did. Lessons Learned: The Need for Accountability and Transparency The accountability, transparency, and decentralization of the RUNES launch are significant in the world of cryptocurrency. We are in an ecosystem where community trust and collective participation are the norms. If a project promised to live up to these standards and then failed to do so, that project would certainly be in jeopardy. For investors, the ascent and descent of RUNES serves as a chilling reminder that not every token or project is conceived in the hopes of delivering enduring worth. Although the allure of rapid returns can be captivating, it’s vital to consider fresh offerings with a buoyant skepticism and the salt that makes skepticism healthy. In the end, RUNES’s collapse points to a greater need for sustained oversight and better regulatory frameworks in the space of cryptocurrency. When the project is all said and done, it could leave behind a question not just about the viability of an asset like RUNES but also about the sustainability over time of a space that has become known for its lack of transparency and its uneven distribution of rewards.

DeepSeek drew worldwide attention last month with its research paper describing DeepSeek-V3, which achieved training through $6 million worth of computational resources. DeepSeek demonstrated cost-effective computing practices through its use of Nvidia H800 chips with limited capabilities. During the past week, DeepSeek revealed its R1 model, which uses power that is twenty to fifty times cheaper than OpenAI’s o1 model, depending on the task, according to their official WeChat. Altman said in the X post that “Deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price.” deepseek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. — Sam Altman (@sama) January 28, 2025 He also noted OpenAI’s primary interest in research progression and its need for more computational capabilities. He emphasized that ever-increasing computational capability represents his organization’s primary requirement for delivering on its mission objectives. Nvidia now operates under greater pressure as cost-effective alternatives begin to appear in the market. Recently, Wall Street witnessed its greatest single-day financial disaster when Nvidia lost $593 billion in market value last Monday. Trump says DeepSeek is a positive development and a wake-up call for US industries According to an NBC report President Donald Trump suggeste d that Am erican tech firms sharpen their focus while addressing in Florida on Monday. He said, “The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing.” The low cost model surged to number one on Apple’s app store during the weekend, threatening U.S. tech supremacy while Trump expressed his faith in America’s capability to maintain its competitive advantage. He also pointed out a silver lining in DeepSeek’s low-cost approach, calling it “very much a positive development” for innovation. According to him, tech firms could save budgetary resources and “come up with, hopefully, the same solution.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",AI|DeepSeek|OpenAI,EN,0,0,MARKET|RESEARCH|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 04:35:00

This bold accumulation comes in the midst of the $SHIB market seeing some significant price fluctuations. Both investors and analysts now watch key price levels that will help determine the Shiba Inu token’s future trajectory. After the market dropped, this whale accumulated another 257.5B $SHIB ($4.6M). This whale currently holds 477.5B $SHIB ($8.57M). https://t.co/k75VUmJZRh pic.twitter.com/xu5GYKZBcN — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 27, 2025 Whale Accumulation Amid Market Volatility The whale’s most recent purchase of 257.5 billion $SHIB, worth $4.6 million, underscores confidence in the token’s long-term potential, despite recent price drops. The Shiba Inu market, like a good deal of the cryptocurrency space, has been volatile, issuing some notable corrections in recent weeks. And yet, this whale’s continued accumulation tends to reinforce the notion that $SHIB holds value for big investors, even in uncertain market conditions. The $SHIB price was not rising but the whale was still buying. Their approach seemed to be one of capitalizing on the lower price points, and the volatility in the market seemed to be no deterrent to them. In fact, we reported that this particular whale had added another 20 billion tokens to their already extensive stash, bringing their total holdings to over 477 billion tokens. That begs the question: What exactly does this whale know that we don’t? Key Support Levels for $SHIB: Analyst’s Insight The whale’s accumulation says a lot about their faith in $SHIB’s future. Still, analysts are watching certain price levels that might play a pivotal role in determining the token’s next move. One of these is the support zone that extends from $0.0000185 to $0.0000212. If $SHIB can hold these levels, it might mean the token is gearing up for a bounce. The $0.0000185 to $0.0000212 range stands as the most critical support zone for #ShibaInu $SHIB ! pic.twitter.com/mKXcYtvqS1 — Ali (@ali_charts) January 27, 2025 Support zones play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, as they signal price levels at which demand seems robust enough to halt any further downturns. The range that Martinez has identified serves as a zone where $SHIB could see a ton of buying interest, a reasonable precursor for any price recovery that $SHIB might experience. The Shiba Inu community is experiencing the same market swings as the rest of the crypto space. But there’s a good chance that $SHIB will hold at the support levels it has in place and will regain momentum, just like the rest of the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, with the next market upswing. Shiba Inu Community’s Bold Vision: ShibOS and the Web3 Revolution Even though market conditions might appear unpredictable, the Shiba Inu community is pressing onward, creating possibly epoch-making developments in decentralized technology. Perhaps the most thrilling recent development is ShibOS, an operating system powered by the Shiba Inu blockchain, which is intended to help transition Web2 applications into the decentralized Web3 world. ShibOS vows to be a revolutionary power for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, smashing a path between traditional Web2 services and the nascent world of Web3. Providing a bridge to this new landscape is no small feat. Wired recently posted a list of “uses” for ShibOS that the decentralized platform promises to make possible. The article did not explain what it means for ShibOS to be a “decentralized platform.” Still, the following are purportedly 36 ways (listed as “cases”) that ShibOS will serve users in this Shiba-powered Web3. The #Shiba Inu community unveils #ShibOS – a blockchain-powered operating system designed for a smooth Web2 to Web3 transition! With 36 use cases, it's shaping the future of decentralized tech. #ShibaInu #Crypto #Web3 #Blockchain https://t.co/cQwF4tFvAx pic.twitter.com/tJGqHX7FoV — Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) January 23, 2025 At a time when many in the tech community look for ways to integrate blockchain into everyday applications, ShibOS has launched. It’s current in the tech community, and it’s trying to bring decentralized technology to the general public. And in doing so, ShibOS could be leading the way to a much-talked-about decentralized future. But it still runs on ordinary hardware and can only integrate so much with the usual applications of the tech community, which is a huge part of what blockchain and Web3 want to change. What Lies Ahead for $SHIB and the Shiba Inu Ecosystem? The Shiba Inu community keeps innovating with projects like ShibOS, and that makes the outlook for $SHIB seem quite promising, especially if the important support zones hold. The latest market volatility may have some people on edge, but the way whales are acting and the way the Shiba Inu team is making moves suggest this project is very much alive. The whale’s most recent acquisition offers investors a glimpse into the long-term possible payoffs that $SHIB might yield. This is especially true considering the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s evolution and the ever-emerging use cases for the token. If Shiba Inu can navigate the current market’s headwinds and continue to promise—and deliver!—innovation, it could return to being a real-deal crypto space player, and so could its token. The Shiba Inu project may well be set for its most thrilling turns yet as it pushes into Web3 with ShibOS. It’s possibly the most Web3 thing the Shiba team has done yet, and with the help of a real community, it’s a thrilling prospect. Whether or not the market follows suit and prices rocket, at least the Shiba Inu community isn’t abandoning the Web3 dream anytime soon. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

An enormous amount of tokens will be unlocked and made available for trading—all told, worth over $790 million. This week’s unlocks feature several projects that will release a large proportion of their overall token supply. Sui (SUI) takes the lead this week in token unlocks, accounting for a single release worth a whopping $288.64 million. This release sees 2.66% of Sui’s total token supply unlocked. This pivotal moment for the project and its investors raises some significant questions about what exactly the project is and where it’s headed. Among the other significant projects are Tribal (TRIBL), ENA, Optimism (OP), ZetaChain (ZETA), and dYdX (DYDX). They, too, have planned unlock events that add up to a considerable number of tokens set to enter circulation. Traders and investors are sure to focus on these scheduled occasions. Whether or not that attention will significantly impact the price of the unlocked tokens and the overall market is a tricky question that we will explore in depth later on. Upcoming Token Unlocks ( January 27 – February 02 ) Several crypto projects will unlock tokens this week, including $TRIBL ,$ENA ,$OP , $SUI , $ZETA and $DYDX . Investors, keep an eye on these token unlocks event pic.twitter.com/UEpiguT30F — SSI (SoSoValue Indexes) (@SoSoValue) January 27, 2025 Top 7 Token Unlocks to Watch This Week The crypto community keeps its focus on the events where tokens are unlocked, and this week sees the largest unlocks of seven different tokens. Here is a detailed look at those unlock events and the tokens that will be unlocked: 1⃣ Sui (SUI) – Unlock Value: $288.64M – Percentage of Supply: 2.66% Sui is absolutely the star of the week. The blockchain platform, famed for its high-performance capacity and developer-friendly ecosystem, is ready to unlock a colossal portion of its tokens. This event is likely to spark trading activity, possibly influencing SUI’s market dynamics in the days to come. 2⃣ Ronin (RON) – Unlock Value: $49.31M The Ethereum sidechain for blockchain games like Axie Infinity, Ronin ranks second on the list. The $49.31 million unlock could provide liquidity to the market and influence the growth trajectory of the handful of projects utilizing the Ronin network. 3⃣ Optimism (OP) – Unlock Value: $43.89M Optimism, one of Ethereum’s foremost Layer-2 scaling solutions, is next in line for a significant unlock event. The release of $43.89 million worth of OP tokens is likely to garner interest from DeFi aficionados and investors. Historically, Optimism’s unlock events have been associated with price volatility, making this another important event for traders to watch closely. 4⃣ dYdX (DYDX) – Unlock Value: $8.46M dYdX, the decentralized derivatives exchange, is poised to release $8.46 million worth of tokens. The platform stands to gain from the increased liquidity and trading activity among users seeking decentralized options and could see this translation into better overall market performance for the token itself. 5⃣ Prime (PRIME) – Unlock Value: $6.52M PRIME is an underappreciated token that will unleash tokens valued at $6.52 million. While it may not attract attention in the way some large-scale launches do, it nonetheless accounts for a chunk of this week’s total and might prove lucrative to investors looking for something off the beaten path. 6⃣ Grass (GRASS) – Unlock Value: $6.41M Another emerging token, GRASS adds $6.41 million to the mix. Its unlock event, though smaller in scale, reflects the broader trend of increased token circulation across various projects. Seventh and last in our countdown is Tai (TAI)—coming in with a $6.4 million unlock event. TAI (like GRASS, which came in just ahead of TAI in our countdown) highlights the diversity of projects participating in this week’s unlock events. Top 7 Token Unlocks of the Upcoming Week The following tokens with the largest unlock amount will be unlocked next week: $SUI – $288.64M $RON – $49.31M $OP – $43.89M $DYDX – $8.46M $PRIME – $6.52M $GRASS – $6.41M $TAI – $6.40M pic.twitter.com/bfFVmskhK9 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) January 27, 2025 Impact of Token Unlock Events on the Market In the cryptocurrency market, play a crucial role. When locked tokens transition into active circulation, they often influence token prices in various ways. One such way is through the simple supply-and-demand dynamic that dictates much of the movement in not just crypto, but all capital markets. If a token moves from being locked up to being active and it’s sold off in large amounts, in tandem with what might be considered either a “normal” or “abnormal” amount of demand for that token, then you could very well expect to see the price dip. It is recommended that investors pay close attention to these unlock events, particularly those that concern well-known tokens such as SUI, RON, and OP. Given the likelihood of price swings, this is a good moment to consider what sort of tactical decisions you want to make, be it trading on an actual or even a planned price basis or opting for a more buy-and-hold, “see what happens next” approach. To sum up, the next week holds substantial occurrences for the crypto sphere, with more than $790 million in token value poised to be unleashed. As always, making decisions with a basis in accurate information and keeping an eagle eye on market movements will be crucial for any investor trying to steer a steady course through these potentially favorable—and risky—developments.

The investment appears to be World Liberty’s coming-out party, as the project has virtually no market presence or awareness until this latest funding round. Far from a typical SEC-regulated underwriter, Web3Port Labs is instead a Chinese-based partner of a Maryland venture capital firm that seems more interested in the upcoming investment blitzkrieg of China’s new digital yuan than this Trump-connected project. Whale Alert: $10M Bet on $WLFI as Pre-Sale Buzz Builds! A new whale, 0x848, dropped a massive 10M USDT to scoop up 200M #WLFiToken about 17 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/ur8WvIvBpw — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) January 27, 2025 World Liberty Financial, a promising project in the blockchain space, has attracted further investments from Web3Port Labs, a top platform in the industry. This recent funding seeks to ensure that the World Liberty platform hits its next set of milestones and pays off the promise that it saw in the project’s vision. WLFI Token Sale: A Two-Phase Success Story Following the tremendous success of its initial pre-sale, World Liberty Financial announced earlier this month the launch of the second stage of its token sale. Investors have already shown their enthusiasm for the project, with the pre-sale round selling out in short order. In this next round, 20 billion WLFI tokens—or 20% of the total supply—are being offered at the remarkably low price of $0.015 per token. This round will close on January 20, 2025, and following on from the clear interest in the project, it looks set to sell out. Now in its second stage, the pre-sale gives 5 billion WLFI tokens for sale at an increased price of $0.05 each, reflecting the project’s growing confidence in the market and increasing valuation. World Liberty Financial has set a sky-high $5 billion valuation for this part of the pre-sale, which they say underscores their aggressive growth strategy. And the tone of the sale so far is one of considerable excitement and investor confidence. @Worldlibertyfi $WLFI has raised $10M in funding from @Web3Port_Labs World Liberty Financial, a crypto project, promoted by the Trump family, secures $10M in latest funding from Web3Port. The investment platform has disclosed its plans for additional purchases. Earlier in… pic.twitter.com/KhOqpYcJVC — CryptoDep #StandWithUkraine (@Crypto_Dep) January 27, 2025 This rapid increase in attention can be credited in part to the Trump’s family backing, which gives the project much more visibility and credibility. But institutional interest is also making a big splash. When seasoned investors like Web3Port Labs come on board, they signal to the larger marketplace that World Liberty Financial is a potentially big player in the crypto and DeFi spaces. Strategic Vision and Market Positioning World Liberty Financial’s intention is to transform the mechanisms of global finance using the blockchain. By this, they mean to construct an alternative layer of global finance that is secure, efficient, and offers the kind of borderless service that today’s consumers and businesses demand. They see this layer as one that can attract yield-seeking investment and also serve as a much-needed innovation engine for the global economy. The efforts of the project are likely to accelerate and scale up, thanks to the significant funding raised from Web3Port Labs. Adding liquidity to our ecosystem via the token sale strengthens our project’s finances even further and allows us to keep innovating and forming strategic partnerships. The excitement about WLFI is not undeserved. A lot of people view the project as a probable game-changer for cryptocurrency, thanks to its high-profile backers and its innovative take on fintech. Observers of the crypto scene have even noted that the $5 billion price tag slapped on the second pre-sale round seems to reflect not only the project’s grand ambitions but also its knack for pulling in some serious investor interest. What’s Next for WLFI? The next steps for World Liberty Financial are drawing attention as the second pre-sale round gathers speed. The project has its sights set on just the kinds of things you want to see from a crypto venture: expanding its ecosystem, building partnerships, and—most crucially—launching additional financial products meant to serve a clientele as diverse as its global presence. All of this seems very much in the works, thanks to a solid investment base, a successful start to the token sale. The fast sell-out of the first pre-sale round and the growing demand in the second phase hint at WLFI being an opportunity worth watching for investors. The backing by Web3Port Labs also signals increased interest from prominent players in the blockchain space, adding another layer of credibility to the project. To sum up, World Liberty Financial’s recent funding round, in which it raised $10 million, and the strong showing of its token sale really do make it seem as if the company could be an important player in the crypto market. It is making waves, and that usually means more people are looking at it. In the investment community, the interest level in crypto has risen dramatically, and while many in that community are skeptical of the veracity of what’s being sold and to whom, this company has the potential to be one that drives the attraction of the investment crowd to the crypto world at large.

""I own XRP, BTC, and ETH, among a handful of others – we live in a multichain world, and I’ve advocated for a level-playing field instead of one token versus another. If a govt digital asset reserve is created - I believe it should be representative of the industry, not just one token (whether it be BTC, XRP or anything else),"" Garlinghouse said on X . Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration will evaluate whether to create a national digital asset stockpile, having backed the idea in the lead-up to the November elections. The crypto market anticipates that a potential reserve would include bitcoin, the leading digital asset by market value and the one with the highest level of institutional adoption. Currently, traders active over decentralized betting platform Polymarket only see a 17% chance of Trump greenlighting the project in the first 100 days of his administration. Garlinghouse, however, is against the maximalism that promotes BTC as the only deserving candidate for a potential national reserve.

This marks the third time in 2025 that the EF has sold ETH, raising concerns among ETH holders about the cryptocurrency’s relatively lackluster price performance. EF Continues To Sell Ethereum, But Analysts Offer Hope In a post on X earlier today, on-chain analytics platform Spot On Chain identified a transaction showing that the EF had offloaded another 100 ETH. As of January 27, the EF has sold a total of 300 ETH for approximately $981,200. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say Naturally, the continued selling pressure from the EF has contributed to Ethereum’s price struggles. Over the past 24 hours, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has fallen by 5.7%, trading at $3,125 at the time of writing. That being said, the EF still holds a substantial amount of Ethereum. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the non-profit organization owns 269,175 ETH, worth more than $800 million at current market prices. While the EF’s decision to periodically sell ETH has raised concerns among some of the digital asset’s largest holders, seasoned crypto trader CoinMamba believes that all may not be lost for ETH just yet. In a post on X, CoinMamba shared a chart providing ‘some hopium’ for the next two months. According to the analysis, the months of February and March have historically delivered strong returns for ETH holders. The analyst explained that Ethereum has only posted negative returns in February once, back in 2018, when the digital asset had already surged by 50% in January of that year. In February 2024, the cryptocurrency saw a 46.3% increase in price. Crypto trader Crypto Rover shared their analysis aligning with the prediction of ETH appreciating in value over the next couple of months. The trader emphasized that ETH is still in a ‘massive uptrend,’ and there is no reason to panic. Is ETH On The Cusp Of A Rally? Despite being overshadowed for much of 2024 by the likes of SUI, Solana (SOL), and XRP, analysts are confident that ETH has yet to experience a bullish price momentum that could bring it closer to its current all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outperform Bitcoin In 2025? Report Predicts $8,000 ETH Price For example, recent analysis by crypto analyst Mister Crypto suggests that ETH has likely bottomed out and a price rally could be imminent for the smart contract platform token. Another analyst pointed out that ETH is completing an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the three-day chart, which is considered a bullish signal for the digital asset. However, concerns remain regarding Ethereum’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin (BTC), with the ETH/BTC trading pair hitting four-year lows. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,125, down 5.7% over the past 24 hours.

Solana (SOL) whale activity remains strong despite a 22.93% pullback in its price, signaling optimism among large investors about Solana’s future prospects. Meanwhile, the BNB token is keeping tongues wagging with its $1.16 billion token burn, solidifying its deflationary approach and sparking further interest among traders. Adding to the market excitement, the BlockDAG (BDAG) X1 App has surpassed 500,000 active users, showcasing the growing demand for accessible mining solutions. The app’s ability to let users earn up to 20 BDAG coins daily has led many to call it the best crypto to mine on mobile. Solana Whale Activity Could Renew Buying Interest Solana whale activity has caught the crypto community’s interest, especially after the token dropped 22.93% from its all-time high of $294.33 to $227. Analysts note that Solana whale activity has not wavered, with addresses holding 10,000+ SOL reaching 5,137 before slightly retreating to 5,128. This uptick in Solana whale activity suggests that larger investors remain optimistic about the project’s direction. Some believe that Solana whale activity could keep the market strong, even though technical indicators point to weakening upward pressure. The average directional index (ADX) has reportedly fallen from 66.2 to 27.2, hinting at a slowing trend. Observers are closely watching whether institutional-level Solana whale activity will continue to support the token’s near-term recovery. BNB Token Burn Enhances Ecosystem Value The BNB token has taken another step toward reducing overall supply, following the BNB Foundation’s 30th quarterly token burn worth $1.16 billion. This event permanently removed 1,634,200.95 tokens from circulation, including 110,000 BNB token units lost during the recent BNB Chain Fusion. Analysts believe this deflationary model could amplify demand by maintaining scarcity. The Auto-Burn system, vital for fairness and transparency, calculates how many tokens to remove based on price and network data. The BNB token continues to draw attention, especially given the foundation’s plan to burn an additional 42 million tokens in the future. For many traders, the BNB token now appears even more appealing due to the foundation’s ongoing efforts to regulate supply. Why Is BlockDAG The Best Crypto to Mine on Mobile? BlockDAG mining is in high demand, which is evident from the extraordinary growth of its X1 App. The mining app’s total active users have surpassed 500,000, a milestone that reinforces the project’s decentralized ecosystem. The swift adoption rate suggests significant interest in BlockDAG’s forward-thinking approach, offering a user-friendly method for mining BDAG coins without the complexity of physical rigs. The app lets users earn up to 20 BDAG daily, potentially boosting profits through referral bonuses if new participants actively mine. Once BDAG hits the predicted $1 value, crypto miners will see a modest daily return of $20, accumulating into a more substantial monthly $600, and yearly gains of $7,200. The huge success of the BlockDAG crypto presale proves the enthusiasm of traders, with more than $185 million raised and 18 billion BDAG coins sold. Early supporters have already experienced a 2,380% ROI, as BDAG’s price has jumped from $0.001 to $0.0248, with more price surges on the horizon. This has increased the demand for BDAG mining, which has led to a surge in X1 app users. The X1 App’s straightforward interface, complete with a leaderboard and daily engagement features, keeps miners involved and informed. By lowering barriers to entry, BlockDAG encourages broader participation for those seeking a reliable platform to mine and trade digital assets. Experience the Momentum: Crypto’s Best Era Yet All these latest developments in the crypto market highlight the ongoing opportunities for traders and miners. Solana whale activity continues to demonstrate the confidence of large investors, even as the price pulls back to $227. Meanwhile, the BNB token burn, which permanently removed $1.16 billion worth of tokens, strengthens its deflationary model and hints at increased scarcity-driven demand. Yet the biggest demand in crypto right now is for BlockDAG. As crypto miners rush to mine BDAG, its X1 app has crossed 500,000 active users, quickly becoming the easiest and best crypto to mine on mobile. Offering up to 20 BDAG coins daily and bonus rewards through referrals, the app combines simplicity and profitability for both new and experienced miners. Now is the best time for traders, miners, and crypto enthusiasts to explore BlockDAG’s ecosystem as its presale advances and opportunities grow.

This recognition comes after LOYAL invested in $TRUMP, the official meme coin of Donald Trump, the U.S. President through HTX and the generous donation of all his profits to fund the construction of a school in a remote region of China. To commemorate this act of generosity, HTX DAO will mint a unique Soulbound Token (SBT) for LOYAL. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, SBTs cannot be transferred or sold, making them a digital badge of honor. This particular SBT will feature a design symbolizing the interconnected nature of blockchain networks and the heart of charity. LOYAL, a passionate advocate for Web3, seized the opportunity presented by the launch of the $TRUMP meme coin. By investing in $TRUMP through HTX, he quickly realized significant gains. Rather than keeping the profits, he chose to use the funds to make a lasting impact on the lives of others. The funds will be used towards the construction of a school in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, which will provide educational opportunities for children in the rural communities. “Being named HTX DAO Charity Ambassador is a true honor,” said LOYAL. “This recognition inspires me to continue my work in the Web3 space and to help others. I hope that more people will join me in leveraging blockchain technology for social good.” HTX DAO and LOYAL will collaborate on a documentary that will be released on January 29th at 21:21:21 PM UTC+8. This video will delve into the story behind the donation and explore the potential of decentralized charity. “We believe that blockchain technology can revolutionize the way we approach philanthropy,” said Molly, a spokesperson for HTX DAO. “By using blockchain, we can ensure that donations are transparent, secure, and have the maximum impact. We are proud to support LOYAL and his efforts to build a more equitable world.” HTX DAO’s Charity Ambassador program aims to recognize individuals who are making a positive difference through the use of Web3 technology. By highlighting these inspiring stories, HTX DAO hopes to encourage more people to get involved in decentralized philanthropy. About HTX DAO HTX DAO is a blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organization dedicated to revolutionizing decentralized governance and expanding the applications of blockchain technology. Our vision is centered around open finance and a decentralized, tokenized economy. At the core of HTX DAO, governance is democratically and transparently vested in the hands of HTX token holders. We warmly invite individuals and communities to join our journey, actively participate, and contribute, together shaping an open and innovative future for the blockchain world.

Over the last day, long liquidations across exchanges amounted to $68 million. This makes one of the sharpest and most remarkable price movements in a while—certainly the most notable for October so far. “The market has become extremely volatile,” noted one analyst. As $BTC 's price fell below $100K, long liquidations surged. In the past 24 hours, a total of $68M worth of longs were liquidated across exchanges, making it one of the most notable events recently: https://t.co/vmxHItMnSa pic.twitter.com/b8pdhwESM6 — glassnode (@glassnode) January 27, 2025 The long liquidations of Bitcoin over a 24-hour period amounted to nearly $3 million, placing this event as the trio’s third-largest long liquidation within the past quarter of a year. Liquidation means forced selling of an asset, which in this case refers to Bitcoin, that’s being held by near-sighted investors who have bet on the price going up. Since Bitcoin’s recent pinnacle of $108,000 on January 20, 2025, the market has entered a choppy and corrective phase. This downward trajectory has run its course and culminated in the current descent to $98,000. But as pullbacks go, this one is not your father’s Bitcoin correction. The severity of unrealized losses remains muted when compared to earlier price declines. Since the recent #Bitcoin peak at $108k on January 20th, the market has entered a choppy pattern, culminating in today's correction to $98k. During this move, the total supply in loss, denominated in USD, has risen by $187B: https://t.co/G4nFVJV79k pic.twitter.com/JszYJVUm0F — glassnode (@glassnode) January 27, 2025 Analyzing the Current Bitcoin Correction Push the recent market downturn, and the total USD-denominated supply in loss has increased by $187 billion. While pushy, this number is 43 percent lower than the figure we had in mid-January. In fact, it is significantly below most of our recent bear periods and suggesting that, while we are correcting, we are doing so with a lot less in unrealized losses than we have seen lately. In other words, this resilient push isn’t pushing us down into the lows we had in January. The activity in Bitcoin options markets adds another layer of uncertainty. For January 31, 2025, the data from options shows a substantial concentration of put options with strike prices well above the current trading level of Bitcoin, namely, above $105,000. – At $105,000: 734 BTC puts contrasted with 2,484 BTC calls. – At $110,000: 392 BTC puts as opposed to 5,355 BTC calls. $BTC options expiring 31 Jan 2025 show a large concentration of puts above $105K: $105K: 734 BTC puts vs. 2,484 BTC calls. $110K: 392 BTC puts vs. 5,355 BTC calls. https://t.co/jfjWVY5TJ6 pic.twitter.com/Rtz7DLkyf6 — glassnode (@glassnode) January 27, 2025 What is intriguing is that at the $100,000 level, puts and calls are in relative balance, with 2,152 BTC puts and 2,645 BTC calls. This equilibrium reflects a neutral or uncertain sentiment at this key psychological level. Below $100,000, however, puts dominate in a big way, indicating that traders are placing a lot of bets on a strong downside move: At $90,000: 2,070 BTC puts as opposed to 949 BTC calls. – When the price hits $80,000: 1,425 BTC puts compared to 255 BTC calls. Traders appear to consider these levels as possible support zones for Bitcoin and are getting ready for additional downside danger, given their position in the futures market. Bitcoin Exchange Flows and Historical Parallels Even though the market has been turbulent, flows into Bitcoin exchanges have been negative since January 21. This suggests that investors are retaining or accumulating Bitcoin. It hints that something like a long-term confidence might be developing in the digital gold, even while the short-term prospects for the market seem lousy. Bitcoin exchange flows have been negative since the 21st of Jan, hinting at ongoing accumulation. pic.twitter.com/hiQ8K5eprQ — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 27, 2025 Another comparison that analysts have drawn is between the current market cycle and Bitcoin’s historical performance during 2015-2018. Ali Martinez, in an analysis for Investing.com, said that he sees “striking similarities” between the current price action and the buildup just before Bitcoin went parabolic. If we’re to take any analogy from that period, it’s this: a fantastic upward price breakout in Bitcoin could occur at any moment. #Bitcoin is showing striking similarities to the 2015-2018 cycle. Historically, it was around this point when $BTC went parabolic. pic.twitter.com/VLD8ehzj6K — Ali (@ali_charts) January 26, 2025 Furthering the buoyancy, Bitcoin spot ETFs have seen the appearance of noteworthy net inflows over the past week (January 21-24). Bitcoin spot ETFs tallied a net inflow of $1.76 billion in this period, with BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) accounting for a whopping $1.32 billion of this total. BlackRock aside, the other spot ETFs didn’t contribute too much to this recent growth. But with these figures in mind, the future of spot ESPs in the space seems a whole lot brighter. Last week (January 21 to January 24, Eastern Time), Bitcoin spot ETFs had a weekly net inflow of US$1.76 billion. Blackrock Bitcoin ETF IBIT had a weekly net inflow of US$1.32 billion. https://t.co/YanotfbWiJ pic.twitter.com/0kQoHUbuiM — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 27, 2025 Outlook and Key Takeaways The $100,000 ceiling for Bitcoin is now a thing of the past. What dropped it and why? Was it just a market correction that was bound to happen? Or are there other factors at work? Well, liquidations and downside hedging—what’s that you ask? Let me save a longer explanation for later and instead refer you to the following list for a clearer understanding. The uncertainty in the options market is evident, with sentiment around $100,000 that is either long or short. Investors are definitely covering their bases, though, with numerous put options providing strong downside protection at $90,000 and $80,000—levels that are likely to hold for at least the next few weeks. In this context, the historical pattern of a late-year recovery is particularly relevant. So, too, are the recent unprecedented inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. At this moment, Bitcoin investors and traders are keeping a close watch on important support levels and the general market trend. As the latter attempts to come out of this corrective phase, it is hard to say which way things will go. The fundamentals of the Bitcoin market have not changed for the worse. Those betting against Bitcoin might want to consider the number of Bitcoin ATMs, the number of Bitcoin users, and the various companies that now accept payment in Bitcoin.

It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $691 swing high to the $637 low. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $685 level. The next resistance sits near the $692 level. A clear move above the $692 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $700. A close above the $700 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $720 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $732 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $685 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $675 level. The next major support is near the $668 level. The main support sits at $655. If there is a downside break below the $655 support, the price could drop toward the $635 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $620 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $675 and $668.

On January 25, 2023, the network experienced the creation of 206,290 new wallet addresses within 24 hours—its largest daily wallet creation since October 2022. This remarkable surge in new wallet creation suggests that, beneath the surface, there is a strong, continuing interest in and demand for the Ethereum network. Despite mild price concerns throughout crypto as the weekend came to an end, Ethereum's network blasted off with an astonishing 206,290 new addresses created between January 24th and 25th. This was the highest surge in network growth since October 8, 2022. The 27-month… pic.twitter.com/xGNL9dakUk — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 27, 2025 Unprecedented Wallet Growth Amidst Negative Sentiment Ethereum has seen an influx of new addresses, which have brought with them a fresh batch of negative $ETH sentiment. The fortune of the crypto addresses appears to be tied to the performance of Ethereum itself, which has been lagging other altcoin projects in the past few weeks. Most people in the crypto universe are aware, however, that Ethereum is far and away the front-runner in terms of its fully implemented decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, as well as its “staking” offering that’s about to pump a whole lot more $ETH into the economy. Ethereum’s widespread usefulness keeps pulling users in. It is the foundational layer for DeFi protocols and is hosting an enormous and diverse assembly of dApps. It is absolutely unrivaled in the blockchain space. And yet, the number of wallets being created on Ethereum has been exploding, in a positive sense, of course, recently. So, its desirability and pull effect amongst new users and developers remains strong, even if the developers and users in question are not forking over any cryptocurrency at the present moment. Ethereum Foundation’s Strategic Moves Adding to the week’s activity, the Ethereum Foundation executed another strategic sale of 100 ETH. According to Onchain Lens, the foundation sold the ETH at an average price of $3,078.93, receiving 307,893 DAI in exchange. This transaction brings the foundation’s total ETH sales for 2025 to 300 ETH. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has stated that the foundation might look into staking or DeFi income options as alternatives to selling ETH. However, the foundation’s recent sales suggest that it’s maintaining its strategy of effectively converting some of its holdings into stable assets, with the possible goals of diversifying its treasury or funding ongoing development initiatives. According to Onchain Lens, the Ethereum Foundation once again sold 100 ETH at an average price of $3,078.93 in exchange for 307,893 DAI. Since 2025, the Ethereum Foundation has sold a total of 300 ETH. Previously, Vitalik said that he would consider using staking or DeFi income… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 27, 2025 Although the sales have generated some chatter among members of our community, they actually demonstrate a disciplined approach by the foundation—one that guarantees both the financial security of the foundation and continuing support for the growth and innovation of Ethereum. Strong Inflows into Ethereum Spot ETFs Interest from institutions in Ethereum remains very high, as can be seen from the recent large inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). From January 21 to January 24, Ethereum spot ETFs saw $139 million come in, with the BlackRock ETF (ETHA) being the major driver of that figure. ETHA brought in $135 million over that period, making these funds, at the moment, not just large but also rather presumed-safe places to put Ethereum exposure. The inflows show an inflating institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability. With BlackRock and other titans of finance stepping into the Ethereum market, the asset’s spot as a bedrock of the crypto ecosystem looks only increasingly secure. Last week (January 21 to January 24, Eastern Time), the Ethereum spot ETF had a net inflow of US$139 million. The Blackrock Ethereum ETF ETHA had a weekly net inflow of US$135 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/IVS2ii3NUa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 27, 2025 Ethereum’s Role in the Broader Crypto Landscape Ethereum’s capacity to draw fresh users, keep institutional interest alive, and maintain its reigning position in DeFi is a testament to its resilience and relevance in the changing crypto landscape. The network’s swift wallet growth suggests that, notwithstanding price volatility in the near term, Ethereum has not only added to its installed base but has also reinforced its position as a foundational layer in the blockchain industry. In addition, Ethereum offers both staking and DeFi protocols, which are additional services that provide utility for those investing in Ethereum. The DeFi protocols allow people who own Ethereum to participate in decentralized financial products in what is now being called the “DeFi Summer.” Looking Ahead Ethereum is sailing through a difficult market, but its long-term outlook is still very bullish. The network seems not only able but also eager to welcome new users, and it is doing a remarkably good job of persuading even large institutional players to buy in. If anything, Ethereum’s core seems more energized than ever. The recent increase in the establishment of wallets, along with vigorous inflows into exchange-traded funds and the deft management of Ethereum’s underlying base, underscores the diversified appeal of the second-largest cryptocurrency. Although the current sentiment may be somewhat frosty, Ethereum’s fundamentals shine brightly. The crypto market is changing. Ethereum, for its part, is evolving. With decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, and an increase in decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum seems fairly well situated to seize future opportunities as the blockchain market evolves and (probably) matures. Why? Enhanced adoption and scalability solutions—like Ethereum 2.0—that are in the works promise to keep the network resilient. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

These products could bring fresh opportunities for traders to amplify their exposure to popular cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, while also giving lesser-known coins, including Cardano, Polkadot, and even memecoins like TRUMP and BONK, their first ETF products. With the SEC’s new crypto task force in action, all eyes are on whether these filings survive or get shut down. Let’s see what it means for you. A Game-Changer for Crypto ETFs Tuttle Capital Management has filed with the U.S. SEC to introduce 10 leveraged crypto ETFs. Among the highlights are the 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF, 2X Long Solana Daily Target ETF, and 2X Long Litecoin Daily Target ETF. These ETFs aim to double the daily performance of their underlying assets, offering investors a high-risk, high-reward trading option. This S-1 filing is significant for some cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Polkadot, which are set to receive their first-ever ETF products. It also marks a bold entry for memecoins like TRUMP, BONK, and MELANIA, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the crypto ETF. While Dogecoin has seen ETF filings before, these new additions signal a growing interest in integrating even the most volatile assets into mainstream financial products. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Litecoin Price To Hit $150 As Grayscale Files For Litecoin ETF? , Regulatory Challenges and Expert Opinions While this move has excited the investors, it raises questions about regulatory problems. Crypto ETFs have faced significant scrutiny from the SEC, with approvals often delayed or denied due to market volatility and investor protection concerns. ETF expert James Seyffart highlighted that Tuttle Capital’s filings might challenge the SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs. The SEC’s crypto task force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to play a crucial role in deciding the fate of these applications. Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda has already launched a Crypto Task Force to tackle the growing challenges of the crypto market. The team aims to create clear rules to reduce confusion and provide better guidance for investors and industry professionals. Better Odds for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin Despite the challenges, analysts believe that Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs stand a better chance of gaining approval. These assets are known for their strong market presence, higher decentralization, and relatively stable adoption rates. For instance, the Litecoin ETF proposed by Canary Capital has already progressed with its SEC filing, indicating a growing acceptance of more established cryptocurrencies in the ETF space. A Growing Trend in Crypto Investments Tuttle Capital’s bold move comes amid a surge in crypto ETF filings. Grayscale and CoinShares recently applied for Litecoin ETFs , while Canary Capital proposed an ETF for Hedera. The competition is heating up as asset managers explore new ways to bring crypto to traditional markets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Musk Fuks Robots (MUSKROBO), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Fuks Robots can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Robots could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Robots launched with over $40,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Robots on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Robots by entering its contract address (CA) – 9yuANCwHs443YpCDnUr2GfSkDSTxUweQL1m2vMaYnTT5 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 05:16:00

This case is part of a larger trend of US regulators cracking down on crypto companies that break the law. Other platforms, like BitMEX and Robinhood, have faced similar actions, resulting in hefty fines and leadership changes. Under President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President administration, the US is taking a tougher stance on crypto regulation . While the government wants to create clear rules for the industry, it is also showing little tolerance for companies that fail to comply with existing laws. What’s Next? The US is ramping up its regulatory efforts with the help of a new crypto task force , led by Hester Peirce, and other government agencies like the DOJ and SEC. These groups aim to create a safer and more transparent crypto market while cracking down on bad actors. For KuCoin, this settlement closes a major chapter, but it also serves as a warning to other crypto companies about the importance of following the rules. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin falls below $100K as the crypto market faces tech-linked volatility. Fed’s interest rate stance dampens risk appetite, extending crypto losses. Within the last 24 hours, a massive $920 billion was wiped out of the cryptocurrency market. This decline is closely linked to a broader sell-off in the technology sector. The recent launch of a free, open-source AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek has intensified competition in the tech industry, leading to substantial losses in U.S. tech stocks. This development has had a ripple effect on cryptocurrencies, which often move in tandem with tech equities. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, fell below $100,000 , reaching an 11-day low. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, also faced significant declines. Analysts suggest that the high correlation between Bitcoin and tech stocks, particularly the Nasdaq 100, has fueled this downturn.

The founders, who took a guilty plea, resigned and agreed to pay almost $300 million in fines and forfeitures in an active case since 2024. KuCoin was charged with defying anti-laundering laws only a few years after settling a similar civil law in the state of New York. The Seychelles-based Peken Global Ltd., one of the three entities operating as KuCoin, answered to charges on Monday before US District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan. The judge, in the ruling, fined it about $113 million and forfeited $184.5 million. The exchange and its two founders, Chun Gan, and Ke Tang, were put on trial in March 2024 for plotting to run an unlicensed money-transmitting business in breach of an anti-money laundering program. The two founders then agreed to defer prosecution, each forfeiting about $2.7 million. In December 2023, the exchange platform settled a $22 million fine and refunds in New York; it further agreed to end trading in New York in a civil suit where the state attorney general claimed KuCoin failed to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer and falsely represented itself as a crypto exchange. KuCoin has struggled with regulatory compliance US Attorney Danielle R. Sassoon said, “For years, KuCoin avoided implementing required anti-money laundering policies designed to identify criminal actors and prevent illicit transactions.” As a result, KuCoin was used to facilitate billions of dollars worth of suspicious transactions and to transmit potentially criminal proceeds, including proceeds from darknet markets and malware, ransomware, and fraud schemes. KuCoin has been struggling with regulatory compliance in different territories and jurisdictions. Away from the United States, the company faced regulatory challenges in Canada. In 2022, the Ontario Securities Commission imposed an embargo on KuCoin from serving users in the country because they didn’t meet the regulatory threshold to operate there. In addition to Canada, KuCoin has also faced regulatory challenges in India. The firm was part of several exchanges that were sent out of the Indian market due to compliance issues. United States tightens compliance rules in crypto The United States authorities have stepped up their efforts to ensure crypto players comply with regulations. Kucoin isn’t the only player facing regulatory sanctions for failing to adhere to set standards. Coincidentally, another Seychelles-based exchange, BITMEX, was also used as an example to lawbreakers. The firm was fined $100 million for breaching the US anti-money laundering laws. The platform was found guilty of violating the Bank Secrecy Act, which is responsible for strict identity verification compliance and monitoring illicit financial activities.

Privacy-focused AI platform Venice AI, founded by Bitcoin advocate Erik Voorhees, launched its Venice Token (VVV) on Ethereum's Base network, achieving a $1 billion valuation within hours. Meanwhile, the viral success of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has spurred a surge in malicious ”DeepSeek” scam tokens, highlighting the risks associated with emerging technologies. DeepSeek's Viral Success Sparks Surge in Malicious Crypto Tokens A recent surge in malicious ”DeepSeek” cryptocurrency tokens has raised alarm in the crypto community, mirroring a troubling trend of scammers exploiting trending narratives to deceive unsuspecting users. According to data from the security firm BlockAid, the past 24 hours have seen the creation of at least 75 scam tokens tied to the Chinese AI company DeepSeek, representing a threefold increase from the previous day. This spike in fraudulent tokens follows the release of DeepSeek's latest AI app version on Jan. 20, which quickly went viral, climbing to the top of the Apple App Store. While the company's innovative AI technology has garnered widespread attention, its success has also drawn scammers aiming to capitalize on its newfound popularity. The surge in scam tokens tied to DeepSeek is reminiscent of the proliferation of fraudulent tokens that followed former US President Donald Trump’s launch of a meme coin on Jan. 18. During that event, the number of Trump-branded tokens skyrocketed from an average of 3,300 daily launches to a staggering 6,800 on the day of the official meme coin debut. Similarly, DeepSeek’s viral AI model has become a new target for crypto fraudsters. Oz Tamir, a research analyst at BlockAid, highlighted the sophistication of these scams. Scammers have created a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics DeepSeek’s official website. The fraudulent DApp includes a “Connect Wallet” button that, when clicked, could potentially drain a user’s crypto wallet. Tamir emphasized the growing need for vigilance, as scammers refine their methods to deceive even experienced crypto users. DeepSeek itself has issued clear warnings about the rise of scam tokens. In a pinned post on its X account dated Jan. 10, the company stated, ”DeepSeek has not issued any cryptocurrency. Currently, there is only one official account on the Twitter platform. We will not contact anyone through other accounts. Please stay vigilant and guard against potential scams.” Despite these warnings, scammers have managed to launch and briefly sustain two fake DeepSeek tokens, one of which reached a market capitalization of $48 million before its momentum cooled. Another fraudulent token reached a $13 million market cap, demonstrating the scale and speed with which these scams can attract unsuspecting investors. The proliferation of scam tokens tied to DeepSeek reflects a broader trend of scammers exploiting viral moments to launch fraudulent cryptocurrencies. According to BlockAid , scammers are becoming increasingly adept at creating fake tokens and exploiting trending narratives. The launch of Official Trump (TRUMP) and First Lady Melania’s meme coin (MELANIA) earlier this month triggered a similar wave of copycat tokens. This latest incident also shows the interconnectedness of crypto and artificial intelligence in the public imagination. DeepSeek’s rise to prominence stems from the impressive capabilities of its AI model, which the company claims cost under $6 million to develop — a fraction of the billions spent by American tech giants like OpenAI. The company’s viral success has not only drawn attention to its innovative approach but has also made it a prime target for exploitation. The rapid rise of malicious tokens tied to DeepSeek has caused ripples in the financial markets, with fears of widespread scams contributing to a sell-off in certain sectors. This development comes at a time of heightened scrutiny on both AI and cryptocurrency innovation. On Jan. 23, President Trump signed an executive order revoking past policies that were perceived as barriers to American AI development, signaling the U.S. government’s intent to remain competitive in the global AI race. David Sacks, a prominent AI and crypto advocate who served in the Trump administration, described DeepSeek’s AI model as evidence of an increasingly competitive landscape. However, the darker side of this competition — the rise of sophisticated scams — has raised concerns about the need for stronger safeguards to protect consumers. Staying Vigilant Amid the AI-Crypto Convergence As DeepSeek continues to dominate headlines, the company’s viral success highlights both the potential and the perils of the intersection between AI and cryptocurrency. While innovations like DeepSeek’s AI model showcase the transformative possibilities of technology, the associated surge in scam tokens brings attention to the importance of vigilance in the evolving crypto landscape. For users, the lesson is clear: always verify the authenticity of cryptocurrency projects before engaging with them. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or connecting wallets to unverified platforms, and rely on official channels for information. As scammers become more sophisticated, the crypto community must remain proactive in protecting itself from exploitation. Venice AI Launches Privacy-Focused Token on Ethereum’s Base Network, Reaching $1 Billion Valuation in Hours In a remarkable debut, Venice AI, a privacy-focused artificial intelligence platform founded by Bitcoin pioneer Erik Voorhees, launched its self-titled Venice Token (VVV) on Ethereum’s layer-2 Base network on Jan. 27. Within just two hours of its launch, the token achieved a fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeding $1 billion, marking a significant milestone in the fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies. Data from decentralized exchange tracker DEXScreener reveals that VVV’s FDV climbed to more than $1 billion shortly after 6 PM UTC, less than two hours post-launch. By the end of the day, the token’s FDV had surged further to approximately $1.65 billion, with a circulating market capitalization of $306.4 million. Currently, 25 million tokens out of the total 100 million supply have been released to the public, while the number of token holders has surpassed 13,200, as per Basescan data. Venice AI’s rapid ascent in value signals strong market interest for its innovative offerings. The platform has positioned itself as a champion of privacy and censorship resistance in the AI space, leveraging blockchain technology to provide secure and private access to generative AI models. The Venice Token (VVV) serves more than just a financial purpose. According to a statement from the platform on Jan. 27, users who purchase and stake VVV gain free ongoing inference access to its API, enabling private and uncensored generative text, image, and code creation. The API supports models like DeepSeek’s newly released R-1, which has garnered significant attention for its capabilities. DeepSeek R-1, developed by the Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, has made waves for its performance, reportedly rivaling industry leader ChatGPT. However, concerns over data privacy and potential links to Chinese data collection practices have created turmoil in US markets. Erik Voorhees addressed these concerns directly, assuring users that when the R-1 model is accessed through Venice, “none of it is going anywhere,” reaffirming the platform’s commitment to data privacy and security. The distribution of the VVV token has been carefully structured to incentivize both users and developers. Of the 100 million total supply: 25 million tokens are allocated to 100,000 eligible Venice users. 25 million tokens are reserved for specific Base users, including holders of Aerodrome Finance (AERO) and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) tokens. 35% of tokens are allocated to Venice itself for platform development and operations. 10% are set aside for an incentive fund aimed at fostering ecosystem growth. 5% are allocated for liquidity to ensure smooth trading operations. An additional 14 million tokens will be emitted annually to maintain token availability and support the platform’s growth. Notably, Venice has chosen not to conduct a presale for outside investors and has refrained from implementing a governance mechanism, emphasizing its focus on utility over speculation. Since its launch in May 2024, Venice AI has amassed a user base of over 400,000 registered accounts, with an impressive 15,000 inference requests per hour. The platform’s focus on privacy and uncensored AI interactions has resonated with a global audience, particularly amid growing concerns over data misuse and censorship in mainstream AI applications. In addition to staking benefits, Venice has opened its API to AI agents, developers, and third-party applications, broadening its appeal and utility. The move aligns with Voorhees’ vision of empowering users and developers in a decentralized ecosystem. Erik Voorhees: From Bitcoin Pioneer to AI Innovator Erik Voorhees, a long-standing advocate for financial and data privacy, is no stranger to innovation. Before founding Venice AI, he made his mark as an early Bitcoin pioneer and the founder of the crypto exchange ShapeShift in 2014. Venice AI’s launch also coincides with the rise of DeepSeek R-1, a model that has disrupted traditional assumptions about AI by delivering high performance with lower computational requirements. Despite its controversial reception in the US, DeepSeek R-1’s capabilities have sparked a global conversation about the future of AI innovation and competition. The launch of Venice Token and its rapid valuation growth represent a pivotal moment in the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. By combining the privacy-first ethos of cryptocurrency with the transformative potential of generative AI, Venice AI is carving out a unique niche in an increasingly competitive landscape. As the platform continues to grow, its emphasis on data privacy, decentralization, and user empowerment is likely to attract more developers, investors, and users seeking alternatives to traditional AI platforms. Whether Venice can sustain its early momentum remains to be seen, but its successful token launch signals strong market confidence in its vision. With over 400,000 users already on board and a $1.65 billion FDV within hours of its token launch, Venice AI is poised to be a major player at the intersection of AI and blockchain. For privacy-conscious users and advocates of decentralized technology, Venice represents a beacon of what the future could hold.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-28 05:30:00

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN.

The daily volume has surged from levels below $500M to above a bullion that substantiates the claim. As a result, the JUP price is making huge waves with a remarkable 25% increase in the past 24 hours. With this, Jupiter is expected to enter the top 50 crypto rankings as its market capitalisation surges above $2 billion. Why is Jupiter (JUP) Price Surging? In the past few days, the platform has made a couple of huge upgrades that are believed to have benefitted its’ native token. Firstly, it announced a major fee rollback wherein it plans a $50 million JUP token buyback, utilizing 50% of 2024’s revenue. Next, it has also unveiled its plans to burn 3 billion JUP tokens and lastly shed light on its ecosystem expansion. Jupiter launched Jupnet by acquiring a major stake in Moonshot. Besides, the platform also announced a $10 million AI fund with Eliza Labs, focusing on enhancing the Solana ecosystem. This strategic partnership is considered the most significant one that may bolster technical advancements. With this, the traders have turned optimistic, and the buying activity has gained huge momentum as the traders appear to be bullish on the JUP price rally. Will JUP Price Mark A New ATH in February 2025? The JUP price has been defending the lower support zone around $0.8 since the start of the year, which has now become a strong base. As a result, the price triggered a strong rebound, printing massive bullish candles. Currently, the price appears to be poised to reclaim the interim highs just above $1.4, while more upswing is on the horizon. The daily chart of JUP appears to be extremely strong, as the bulls are leaving no stones unturned in holding the momentum upright. The 50/200-day MA’s bearish crossover had raised some concerns but the 50-day MA seems to be preparing for an immediate bullish crossover or the Golden Cross. Besides, the Chainlin Money flow has been hovering around the average or ‘0’, indicating the rally maintained its strength amid the recent selloff. Now that it has raised above ‘0’, it suggests an increase in the market’s strength. Therefore, Jupiter’s (JUP) price appears to be primed to test the local resistance at $1.3 anytime from now and a sustained breach could eventually push the price to the final resistance zone. Once this zone between $1.37 and $1.39 is tested and cleared, it could form a new ATH above $1.5 initially and later close to $2.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|JUP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-28 05:51:10

This latest acquisition saw the company spend approximately $1.1 billion on the market’s leading cryptocurrency from January 21 to January 26, as disclosed in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With these purchases, MicroStrategy now holds around 471,107 BTC, valued at roughly $30.4 billion, representing over 2% of the total Bitcoin supply that will ever exist. MicroStrategy Aims To Boost Bitcoin Holdings Beyond 500,000 To further finance its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, MicroStrategy has announced plans to sell $250 million in perpetual preferred stock, offering an attractive 8% fixed coupon. This stock will have a conversion price of $1,000, although details remain limited as the information is not yet public. The venture aims to bolster the company’s already substantial Bitcoin holdings, which are nearing the 500,000 BTC milestone. Related Reading: Want To Get Rich? Here’s How To Create A Coin Like XRP From Scratch—Expert MicroStrategy has employed various fundraising strategies, including at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings, with a goal of raising $42 billion in capital through 2027. The company’s stock has also shown remarkable growth, surging approximately 600% over the past year, although it experienced a slight decline of about 1.4% to $348.65 in early trading on Monday. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price fell around 2.5% to $101,500. Authorized Shares To Support Future Capital Raises MicroStrategy also announced recently that it would redeem over $1 billion of its 0% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2027 earlier than anticipated, with a planned redemption date of February 24. This move is intended to streamline the company’s financial obligations and provide greater flexibility for future capital raises. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer noted that this strategy would allow investors to focus on the company’s operations rather than potential financial impediments. Redeeming these notes could also pave the way for MicroStrategy to issue new convertible debt with longer maturities, enhancing its capital-raising options. The company plans to offer approximately 2.5 million shares of Series A perpetual strike preferred stock, which will be senior to its Class A common stock and provide regular quarterly dividends starting March 31.

Moreover, MicroStrategy has the green light from shareholders to significantly increase its authorized shares—from 330 million to 10.3 billion for Class A common stock—enabling it to pursue further equity offerings. This decision aligns with the company’s ongoing efforts to maintain liquidity and support its ambitious Bitcoin acquisition strategy without needing to liquidate its holdings. Saylor emphasized the company’s liquidity position, asserting, “We’ve had and expect to continue to have ample access to liquidity through our capital markets activities and cash flows from operations.” The firm’s co-founder further reassured investors that the company has no intention of selling its Bitcoin to meet interest obligations, reinforcing MicroStrategy’s commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy.

Cautious traders also braced for interest rate moves from major central banks later this week, notably the US Federal Reserve and the ECB. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.72% dropped 1.4% to around 39,000, while the broader Topix Index lost 0.6% to 2,740 on Tuesday, extending losses from the previous session. The Japanese yen fell below 155.5 per dollar on Tuesday, retreating from six-week highs. Investors are now focused on upcoming labor, inflation, and other economic data for further guidance. China ( SHCOMP ) market closed, the offshore yuan weakened to around 7.28 per dollar, extending losses from the previous session, as investors grappled with concerns over heightened tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. Late Monday, Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on key imports, including computer chips, pharmaceuticals, and steel, to boost US manufacturing. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.34% hovering around 20,210 after gaining in the prior two sessions. Trading was notably sluggish, with markets set to close early as the Lunar New Year looms large. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.88% to 75,717 in morning trade on Tuesday, halting losses in the previous two sessions and moving away from their lowest level in over seven months the day before. This gain was mainly driven by increases in banking and financial services stocks following the RBI's statement of several measures to boost liquidity in the banking system. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.12% to around 8,415 on Tuesday, marking its second consecutive day of gains as investors returned from the holiday-extended weekend. Australia’s NAB business confidence index inched up to -2 in December 2024 from -3 in the prior month despite marking the second straight month of negative prints.

Trump Conquers Canada (TRUMPCAN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Conquers Canada can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Conquers Canada could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Conquers Canada launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Conquers Canada on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Conquers Canada by entering its contract address (CA) – HiPRoUXHrovHyJPB5StmSF2XwERbh78iLEfaxtpjVHJC – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 06:40:00

Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines XRP and Others 1. Massive Growth Potential: XRP’s 500% returns pale in comparison to the staggering 50,000% potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Early investors are already seeing the impact of this token’s high demand and limited availability, making it the standout choice for transformative returns. 2.

Strong Community Support: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN thrives on a loyal and engaged community, driving organic growth and market demand. This strong backing amplifies its visibility and positions it as a top choice for long-term success. How It Stacks Up Against Other Cryptos Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi leader, but its growth has plateaued compared to early-stage tokens like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability, but SOL can’t match the exclusivity and skyrocketing demand of this new token.

Many believe such a leap could catapult Ripple’s holdings beyond $500 billion, bolstering its market influence and redefining cross-border payments. This momentum aligns with Ripple’s broader mission to streamline global finance through blockchain innovation. While Ripple enabled exciting financial innovations like cross-border payments, its own stablecoin, and institutionalized finance on the blockchain, Bitcoin has largely struggled to innovate beyond being a store of value. It has never achieved the scalability needed to support applications or smart contracts—areas where Ripple excels. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is redefining what’s possible for Bitcoin. Imagine a world where Bitcoin powers DeFi, NFTs, and even AI-driven applications—this is the future PlutoChain envisions. By possibly unlocking Bitcoin’s untapped potential, PlutoChain may set the stage for a new era of decentralized innovation. Let’s look into the projects in detail: Is Ripple’s ODL the Key to Propelling XRP Beyond $15 in 2025? Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service has significantly enhanced XRP’s utility in cross-border payments. For XRP to reach its goal of $13 it would need to 4x its value and analysts have varying predictions for XRP’s future. CryptoBull forecasts XRP could reach $13 in the near term, potentially exceeding $20 during a larger bull cycle. In the long term, projections from 99Bitcoins range from $12.49 to $96.32 by 2030, while the short-range projections see XRP getting to $6 driven by the widespread adoption of blockchain payments. These optimistic forecasts are based on Ripple’s strategic developments, including the approval of its stablecoin, RLUSD, by the New York Department of Financial Services, which is expected to enhance Ripple’s digital payment platform and increase XRP’s utility. More conservative forecasts, like Bitrue, anticipate XRP reaching between $2.90 and $4.10, driven by ODL adoption. However, achieving a price point beyond $15 by 2025 would require sustained institutional interest, continuous technological advancements, and favorable regulatory conditions. While ambitious, such a surge is within the realm of possibility, given the current trajectory and market dynamics. PlutoChain Gains Whale Attention with Unparalleled Layer-2 Technology Bitcoin is evolving beyond a store of value, and PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could sit at the forefront of this transformation. By introducing the first hybrid Layer-2 solution, PlutoChain could bring the world of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, NFTs, and even AI to Bitcoin’s secure infrastructure. Its breakthrough could lie in its offer of a 2-second block time compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute one. All thanks to its innovative Layer-2 technology. PlutoChain’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility could allow Ethereum-based developers to seamlessly migrate their projects to Bitcoin. This bridge between two leading blockchain ecosystems could unlock untapped potential, potentially carving a unique space for Bitcoin DeFi. Beyond speed and interoperability, PlutoChain emphasizes trust. Independent audits from SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi ensure reliability. Whales could be attracted by PlutoChain’s community governance, activated from day one, giving users real influence over the network’s future through its unique voting system. Its testnet also validates its potential, processing an impressive 43,200 daily transactions and showcasing readiness for widespread adoption. Currently, Bitcoin DeFi accounts for just 0.13% of Bitcoin’s market cap – a fraction compared to Ethereum’s 10%. By leveraging Bitcoin’s unmatched security, PlutoChain could tap into this underdeveloped market and redefine Bitcoin’s role in the blockchain landscape. Final Words Ripple’s ODL expansion brings optimism for XRP, with some projections placing it at $15 or beyond. Analysts highlight Ripple’s enhanced utility in cross-border payments as a critical factor, while institutional interest and regulatory approval bolster its long-term prospects. PlutoChain, however, could take Bitcoin’s potential further, introducing Ethereum-like smart contracts and dApps via its groundbreaking Layer-2 technology. By offering 2-second block time and EVM compatibility, PlutoChain could be a bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s capabilities. ——————- The information in this article does not represent financial or investment advice.

Coin value rose to $3.114 in the last 24 hours. Side by side, the currency received up to 7.10 percent of value from the previous close. Technical indicators give a bullish signal of the market trends. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as the buying influx was abruptly taken, recovering the price to $3.114. The RSI, as well, has risen above 60; the continual upside in the past week has led to a massive recovery. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to nearly double from its current level. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Will XRP reach $10? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a high chance of reaching $10 by 2028. It is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, which still makes it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100? If one XRP coin is worth $100, its market cap must be more than $5.4 trillion. Comparatively, Bitcoin’s market cap is $1.91T trillion; considering the current global economic situation, it is unlikely for XRP to reach $100 under current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $18.59 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Ripple’s XRP has transcended the cryptocurrency space, now rivaling traditional finance giants. On-chain data reveals XRP’s market capitalization has surpassed BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, reaching $162 billion as of January 15, 2025. This milestone positions XRP ahead of global brands like Coca-Cola, Disney, and Nike. Read more about it here . XRP surged 12% to $3.14, its highest price since 2018. This surge was fueled by a 37.4% increase in XRP holdings by “whales” (investors holding 1-10 million XRP), who accumulated 1.43 billion tokens. Read more about it here . XRP price prediction January 2025 According to XRP price prediction, in January 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $2.70. The average trading price is expected to be $2.27 for the month, while the lowest it can go as per XRP cost estimation is $2, considering the current XRP sentiment.

It is important to consider that predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested, or you can carry out your research. XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In 2025, XRP is trading near the $2.40 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 06:55:00

Dogecoin Whale Makes Massive Binance Withdrawal After Crash According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive transaction has been spotted on the Dogecoin blockchain during the past day. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 12%, But This Pattern Could Mean Decline Isn’t Over Yet The transfer in question saw the movement of 175,274,112 DOGE across the network, worth around $54.7 million at the time the sender executed the move. Given the size of the transaction, it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for it. Whales are the large investors in the market who own notable amounts of the asset in their wallet balance. The influence of any investor on the network goes up the more coins that they hold, so the whales with their massive holdings can have an important presence. As such, their behavior can be something to watch for. How the moves of a whale might affect the asset comes down to what they intended to achieve with it. Due to the anonymous nature of the blockchain, though, it’s often not easy to comment on the intent behind any transfer. Luckily, in the case of the current transaction, there is one identifiable feature attached to it: a wallet associated with a centralized platform. Below are the address details for this Dogecoin whale transfer. As is visible, the receiving address in the case of the transfer was an unknown wallet, meaning that it can’t be traced to any known central entity. Such addresses are likely to be the investors’ personal wallets. The sending address, on the other hand, was attached to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Moves like this, where tokens flow from an exchange to a self-custodial address are known as exchange outflows. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $181,000? Mayer Multiple Reveals When BTC Will Become ‘Overbought’ Generally, the investors take their Dogecoin off into self-custody when they plan to hold into the long term, so exchange outflows can have bullish implications for the memecoin’s price. The whale has made this latest exchange outflow following a sharp decline in the price of Dogecoin, so it’s possible that these were all tokens freshly bought at the lower price. If so, this would naturally be a positive sign for the asset, as it suggests the large investors think this dip of the memecoin is worth accumulating at. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.32, down more than 10% over the past week.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.10 level and has gained more than eight percent in the last 24 hours. The preferred scenario at this point is that XRP completed a wave four correction on January 13 and is currently in wave five. This five-wave pattern, which includes waves one through five, suggests that a continuation to the upside could be possible. However, wave two has yet to complete, and confirmation of a further breakout is needed. Support Zone: Between $2.50 and $2.91 A key support zone is currently between $2.50 and $2.91, which is expected to be where any corrective pullback may end. There was an initial reaction in this support area on January 20, though the breakout was not confirmed at that point. The critical level to watch for a breakout is $3.40. A move above this level could signal that XRP is on track to reach the $4.20 to $4.50 range. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s CEO Pushes for a U.S. Crypto Reserve To Includes More Than Just Bitcoin , There is an alternative, bearish scenario still in play. If XRP falls below $2.52, it would suggest that wave four is still unfolding. In this case, a deeper correction could take place, with structural support at the $1.96 level coming into focus. As for levels to monitor, support remains strong between $2.50 and $2.91, while $3.14 is the nearest resistance level to watch for a possible breakout. If XRP falls below $2.52, it could signal a move toward the $2.32 range. On the upside, if the price manages to break above $3.40, the target could shift to the $4.20 to $4.50 range. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

DOGE Does Not Stand A Chance,https://timestabloid.com/can-you-pick-the-next-altcoin-to-rally-100x-this-year-doge/,"While the Dogecoin price struggles to maintain momentum, SUI and DTX Exchange (DTX) are rapidly emerging as top contenders for this year’s most promising investments. Both projects stand out for their innovative ecosystems and strong growth potential, offering investors an edge in facing the volatile crypto market. If you’re on the hunt for the next big thing, it’s time to explore why SUI and DTX could be the breakout stars of the year. Dogecoin’s Bullish Ride: Is It Over? The Dogecoin price has a clear upward trend that is followed by a consolidation period. Late October saw the start of the major bullish momentum, which was characterized by a strong price rebound that lifted the price of Dogecoin from support close to the 200-day SMA, which was around $0.21, to a high of about $0.45. Strong buying pressure was evident in this surge, which was probably aided by the huge volume of trade at the time. According to data, the Dogecoin price entered a consolidation period after striking the $0.465 resistance level, ranging between $0.30 and $0.45. Dogecoin’s price is currently trading close to $0.35 after recently rejecting the $0.45 barrier, suggesting that the market is uncertain. The Dogecoin price movement indicates that DOGE is reaching a turning point. The price must stay above the crucial $0.30–$0.32 support zone for the overall bullish trend to continue. A retest of the 200-day SMA at $0.21 can occur if the price drops below the $0.30 support, which might increase downward pressure on the DOGE price trajectory. Investor Spotlight: Why SUI Deserves Your Attention For Blockchain developers seeking low latency and excellent speed, SUI has been a popular choice. Over the past 12 months, the SUI blockchain has emerged as a top blockchain due to its capacity to effectively manage intricate decentralized applications. This cryptocurrency’s surged over 165% over the past year with increasing usage and it is reflected in its price performance throughout the year, especially in the past few months when it reached its ATH of $5.2. Given its AI integration and recent ecosystem enhancements, as well as its growing Total Value Locked (TVL) of about $1.8 billion, the SUI ecosystem is undoubtedly a growing ecosystem. SUI emphasizes scalability in its design, making sure it can accommodate growing demand without compromising transaction speed. By combining these attributes with its cutting-edge blockchain technology platform, SUI has emerged as a project that investors find promising for a 100x rally this year. 120,000 Commodities Under One Roof: DTX Fulfills Trader’s Dream DTX Exchange (DTX) is a new entry to the crypto market and has quickly solidified its position as one of the leading altcoins owing to the project’s revolutionary offerings, solid fundamentals, and high-profit potential. It is a soon-to-be-launched exchange platform that aims to bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized finance. While the custody portion of this upcoming exchange will follow the benefits of decentralized exchanges, the performance of DTX Exchange will follow centralized exchanges. This was able to be accomplished by their entirely on-chain order book that enables anyone to verify buy and sell orders. Furthermore, it aims to unify over 120,000 commodities to be accessible from its single, unified interface. This means DTX users will have access to forex, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies under one roof, saving them from the hassle of managing multiple wallets. The platform also offers traders options like 1000x leverage and a distributed liquidity pool to give them opportunities to maximize their profit potential. The presale currently stands at its eighth stage offering each DTX token for only $0.16, collecting over $12.9M in funding. As the project is still in its early phases, analysts believe that the project has quite a lot of growth potential and is getting ready for a 100x rally this year.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors shift focus from Shiba Inu to a new contender leveraging real-world asset tokenization for transformative market potential. Table of Contents Valiant effort: Is there hope of Shiba Inu hitting $0.0005? Rexas Finance: Shiba Inu rival to reach $5 price Why RXS could hit $5 before Shiba Inu Shiba Inu vs. Rexas Finance: Meme hype and real-world utility Conclusion Investors and enthusiasts are shifting their focus from Shiba Inu to Rexas Finance as the newly established competitor is emerging into the crypto sphere. Rexas Finance is dominating the market with its real-world asset tokenization, offering both institutional and retail investors something unique. By enhancing its utility framework and launching its token builder, Rexas enables asset management by offering liquidity and transparency to previously illiquid markets. This allows them to be the best choice for maximizing profits during the next boom in the crypto markets. Valiant effort: Is there hope of Shiba Inu hitting $0.0005? Due to market instability, Shiba Inu has struggled to reach $0.0005. SHIB’s price chart showed a “death cross” after a dismal December when the 23-day moving average dipped below the 50-day, indicating a gloomy market. This technical indicator scared traders, sending SHIB to fall 21% monthly to $0.000023. Critical resistance zones like $0.000025 could change their course. If SHIB breaks this level, $0.00003 resistance may stop its rise. SHIB’s meme currency roots, volatility swings, and minimal real-world utility shroud its future. Massive token burning cuts supply and increases demand, but they may not sustain token growth. As traders and investors await its next move, SHIB must overcome opposition to reach its long-awaited $0.0005 milestone. Rexas Finance: Shiba Inu rival to reach $5 price Rexas Finance (RXS) is a promising alternative to Shiba Inu’s uncertain future . It combines practicality with development potential. Rexas Finance pioneered real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, allowing investors to acquire fractional shares of high-value assets, including real estate, art, and commodities. Rexas Token Builder makes asset-backed token creation easy, making blockchain investment more inclusive. In addition, the Rexas QuickMint Bot lets users mint tokens directly on Telegram and Discord, making them more accessible and engaging a wider audience. Rexas AI Shield, an advanced technology that protects smart contracts and ensures investment safety, is crucial to the security of the RXS ecosystem. With these cutting-edge technologies and transparency, Rexas Finance is positioning itself as a versatile platform leading the global tokenized asset revolution. At $0.175, the token’s strong fundamentals and rising usage led to a $5 milestone, making it a serious competitor to Shiba Inu.

With earlier phases selling out ahead of schedule, this success shows RXS’s strong demand and project capacity to build a dedicated and inclusive community. Many blockchain projects rely on venture money, but Rexas Finance’s public presale empowers a wider range of supporters, enabling sustainable growth and widespread adoption. Certik audit compliance and coming exchange listings : Meeting Certik audits have made Rexas Finance a safer investment. Launching on three of the top ten global exchanges will give the initiative substantial exposure and liquidity. These listings are expected to boost RXS’s price and put it on par with prominent cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu. Actual use, scalability, and incentivized engagement : Rexas Finance’s RWA tokenization technology turns illiquid assets into marketable digital tokens, making them unique. This invention and its scalable foundation give RXS the potential for mass adoption, like Shiba Inu. The $1 million offer rewards early adopters and boosts engagement. Combined with excellent fundamentals, this strategy suggests RXS might reach $5, making it a top investment opportunity. Shiba Inu vs. Rexas Finance: Meme hype and real-world utility SHIB and RXS are becoming more popular in crypto, but their paths to success differ. Speculative trading and community passion fuel the meme-inspired token Shiba Inu. To reach $0.0005, it must overcome challenges like its massive token supply and add unique features like Shibarium. However, Rexas Finance prioritizes practicality and real-world applications. RXS connects blockchain technology to traditional investing by tokenizing real-world assets, giving retail and institutional investors unprecedented opportunities. Its fast price rise from $0.175 to $5, a 2757.14% rise, shows strong market demand driven by value, preparing it for sustainable growth. RXS’s practicality and rapid development reinforce its position as a crypto market leader, while SHIB’s progress hinges on structural issues. Conclusion Rexas Finance and Shiba Inu have different growth strategies. RXS innovates by focusing on real-world utility through asset tokenization, while SHIB relies largely on speculative trading and community momentum to overcome structural difficulties. Rexas Token Builder and AI Shield technologies make RXS’s ecosystem valuable and a crypto market disruptor. Rexas Finance shows how realistic use cases and strong fundamentals may lead to 2757.14% growth from $0.175 to $5. As SHIB climbs, RXS offers a solid platform for lasting success and rewrites the blockchain innovation narrative.

He believes the reserve should include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ripple’s XRP. This idea goes against the opinion of Bitcoin supporters who think Bitcoin should be the only coin in the reserve. US Reserve To Add Other Crypto Too In a recent tweet post, Garlinghouse pointed out that the cryptocurrency industry could do much more if multiple cryptocurrencies worked together instead of fighting each other. He believes that if the crypto industry wants to succeed, it must stop focusing on one cryptocurrency over others and instead collaborate. Some thoughts on maximalism… let me say this as clearly as I can – the crypto industry has a real shot, here and now, to achieve the many goals we have in common, IF we work together instead of tearing each other down. This is not, and never will be, a zero-sum game. • I own… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 27, 2025 He noted that the cryptocurrency space should not be a “zero-sum game,” where one coin’s success equals another’s failure. Garlinghouse, who holds several cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, advocates for a fairer playing field. He believes that the future of crypto should be about collaboration, not competition. His message is clear: the industry can grow stronger if different digital assets are allowed to thrive together. Call for a Diversified Reserve Garlinghouse wants any government-backed digital asset reserve to include a variety of cryptocurrencies. According to him “If a government digital asset reserve is created, I believe it should be diversified. It should include more than just one token, whether it’s BTC, XRP, or any other.” Ripple has been working with U.S. regulators to ensure that XRP is considered in the discussions about digital asset reserves. Garlinghouse believes that a balanced and fair reserve will help support the growth of the entire cryptocurrency industry, not just one specific coin. Criticism from Bitcoin Supporters Garlinghouse’s idea hasn’t been welcomed by everyone. Some Bitcoin supporters argue that only Bitcoin should be in the reserve. Pierre Rochard, Vice President of Riot Platforms, thinks Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it the only suitable choice. He also believes that Ripple is pushing for XRP’s inclusion through lobbying efforts. Ryan Selkis from Messari also believes that Bitcoin has special features that make it better for the reserve compared to other cryptocurrencies. As the U.S. considers creating a national digital asset reserve, the question remains whether it will represent only Bitcoin or include a wider range of cryptocurrencies, as Garlinghouse suggests.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|XRP|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-28 07:07:39

Central bank digital currencies are still a tough sell, even where they’ve officially launched. GlobalData’s latest survey report reveals that for consumers in many countries, CBDCs just don’t offer enough to make the switch from familiar payment methods, as state-backed digital currencies struggle with a lack of user incentives, privacy concerns, and technological challenges. Blandina Szalay, banking and payments analyst at GlobalData, says the “very limited uptake of CBDC in countries where it fully launched — in the Bahamas, Jamaica, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, and Nigeria — can be attributed to the lack of compelling incentives for consumers to switch to CBDCs from the payment methods they are already used to.” You might also like: Russia’s official backs CBDC as key tool for business to dodge sanctions: report Convenience and habit also play a big role in how people choose to pay. According to GlobalData, CBDCs haven’t yet delivered enough benefits to make them a better option. In fact, in places with active CBDC programs, users have complained that the new systems make payments more complicated without “offering sufficient benefits.” For central banks, the challenge isn’t just technical though. Szalay says that reaching widespread adoption is crucial to achieving the benefits CBDCs are supposed to bring, like improved “cross-border payment efficiencies, fostering financial inclusion, and newfound financial and monetary stability.” As of September 2024, a report by the Atlantic Council revealed that 134 countries, representing 98% of the global economy, were exploring CBDCs. Over 65 nations, including India, Australia, and Brazil, are in advanced stages of development, piloting, or launching their CBDC projects. All G20 countries are now actively investigating their own digital currencies, with 19 in advanced stages of exploration.

Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is a Game-Changer 1. Limited Supply Driving Urgency With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that fuels growing demand. Early investors are rushing to secure their share as availability diminishes rapidly. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ADA, which are traded on numerous platforms, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is available only at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity enhances its value and provides early adopters with a unique advantage. 3. Analysts Predict Explosive Growth Experts believe THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could surpass the growth seen in KAS and ARB, with potential returns reaching up to 50,000%. Its strategic presale launch has already demonstrated unparalleled market confidence. How It Stacks Up Against Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): A trusted store of value, but its market maturity limits the potential for massive returns. Ripple (XRP): Popular for cross-border payments, but its growth trajectory cannot match THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s explosive potential. Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi leader, yet its growth has plateaued compared to this rising star. Kaspa (KAS): A strong player, but it lacks the overwhelming momentum driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN.

Despite the court’s decision, many victims remain suspicious! A Singapore High Court has approved a payment restructuring plan for the victims affected by the WazirX crypto scam. The restructuring plan was approved on Jan. 23, 2025, under the Company’s Act. 1967 , which regulates and sets guidelines on the operation of companies in India. The Singapore High Court also ruled that there was no foul play done by WazirX regarding the hack, as per Crowdfund Insider. On Jul. 18, 2024, WazirX lost over $234 million in multiple crypto assets. The attack was traced back to North Korea’s state-sponsored hacking group, the Lazarus Group. The same group was also involved in the CoinEx hack back in Sept. 2023, where it scammed the exchange out of $54 million.

If the majority approves, the exchange will distribute liquid assets within 10 business days, including any gains from the recovery of the crypto markets since the attack. WazirX, in a bid to help users recover their losses, issued recovery tokens — a form of digital credit granted to users who were affected. These tokens indicate to users how much they are owed and will also give them a share of WazirX’s future profits as well as a share of any stolen funds that may be recouped.

The crypto exchange has recovered some stolen funds, freezing $3 million worth of Tether ( USDT ), and is working with authorities in the U.S., Japan, and South Korea to retrieve further assets involved in the attack. The restructuring process will be carried out in accordance with the Singapore Scheme of Arrangement, which enables companies to formulate a formal agreement with their creditors.

However, the CEO is allegedly asking for more than four months to convene the voting process.

As the OG memecoin, it is credited for the popularity of memecoins. However, the prospects of reaching $1 are very slim for Dogecoin. That possibility would have meant huge returns for investors. All hope is not lost. Investors can take a chance on this new DeFi project with huge prospects. This altcoin has been trending on X (formerly Twitter) for over 90 hours straight. It is drawing investors who are searching for the best crypto to buy. Find out more in this space. Dogecoin To $1: How Feasible? Dogecoin is the most popular memecoin. Backed by a strong community, it has enjoyed good success. However, even a giant like Dogecoin has its limitations. The DOGE community has always coveted a $1 price for the top altcoin. This is not forthcoming. In fact, experts believe it may never happen. Dogecoin is expected to continue enjoying success. This just does not include a $1 price. The top altcoin faces competition from newer memecoins. This makes its path to $1 difficult. Also, despite good utility, Dogecoin has no specificity. This means it is likely to struggle in a market full of innovative projects. New DeFi projects emerge daily. Most have unique use cases and long-term appeal. Investors who want growth are looking to those projects and Remittix is a rising favorite. Remittix: The Altcoin Taking the Spotlight Remittix has entered the crypto scene with a clear mission: to fix cross-border payments. Sending money to another country is expensive and slow with traditional systems. Banks charge high fees, and payments can take days to complete. Remittix changes this by making transfers faster, cheaper, and more secure. Transparency is another reason why people are excited about Remittix. The team behind the project is open about their progress and goals. They provide regular updates, which helps build trust. In a world where many projects make promises they can’t keep, Remittix is showing it can deliver. The buzz around Remittix isn’t just hype. It has been trending on social media for days because people see its potential. Trending on X for over 90 hours straight shows how much interest there is in the project. As more investors join, Remittix’s DeFi coin price could grow significantly. What sets Remittix apart is its focus on a real-world problem. Cross-border payments affect millions of people, and the current system is outdated. By providing a solution, Remittix is stepping into a space that needs improvement. The platform makes sending money fast and easy. For example, someone working abroad can send money to their family easily. This comes without losing a big chunk of it to fees. This real-world use is what makes Remittix so valuable. Social media has also played a big role in Remittix’s success. The buzz on X (formerly twitter) shows the appeal of this project. This new DeFi project enjoys strong support from its users. The Remittix team listens to feedback and works to improve the platform. This is part of the reason why investors trust the project. As more people use Remittix, its value will likely increase. Dogecoin may always hold a special place in the crypto world as the OG memecoin. Its community remains strong, but its future is uncertain. Without clear use or innovation, it’s hard to see how it will compete with newer projects like Remittix. Meanwhile, Remittix is positioning itself as a leader in solving real problems. Its focus on fixing cross-border payments makes it one of the most promising projects right now. The simplicity of the platform, combined with the buzz it’s generating, could lead to significant growth. For investors looking at the best crypto to buy, Remittix is a strong contender. Its real-world applications and rising popularity make it a project to watch. As the crypto market continues to grow, coins that offer real value will likely take the lead. Remittix is proving that cryptocurrency is about more than just memes—it’s about making life easier. With its focus on improving cross-border payments, it has the potential to become a top project in the years to come. The RTX presale is ongoing at just $0.0418. So far, over 400 million tokens have been sold. With a 750 million supply, it will soon sell out. You need to act fast to secure a spot.

In a statement shared on Twitter, Dark Defender acknowledged a mistake in communication regarding the possibility of a downside break, emphasizing that corrections are a natural part of market behavior and not a cause for panic. Dark Defender explained that the recent move toward the $2.81 level aligns with an expanded C Wave scenario. This possibility was highlighted in a prior analysis shared five days earlier on his Patreon. While the original expectation was for XRP to move to $3.62 following a regular C Wave correction, the expanded C Wave scenario has not altered the ultimate price targets. According to Dark Defender, XRP remains on track for its next major milestone, despite interim fluctuations. We expected a break in hours, and it arrived. However, I should have indicated that a downside break was also possible, which was my mistake. We expected this move towards the $2.81 level and addressed it five days ago on Patreon (attached below) as a possibility. XRP showed… pic.twitter.com/UkHlP8hbcc — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) January 27, 2025 The 5-Wave Structure and Fibonacci Levels In his Patreon post, Dark Defender analyzed XRP’s behavior using Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci retracement levels. He pointed out that XRP had formed a 5-wave structure, with the correction wave (C Wave) potentially touching the $2.8160 level before resuming its upward trajectory. The Fibonacci level of $3.62 remains a key target, reflecting strong technical resistance. The chart analysis highlighted in the post shows an ABC correction in orange, which concluded before XRP moved into its current wave structure. Dark Defender noted that corrections like these are part of the broader market cycle and essential for sustained price growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Support and Sentiment In response to Dark Defender’s analysis, many community members expressed their support and appreciation for his insights. A user named Bruno commented that there is no need for skilled analysts like Dark Defender to apologize for market corrections or predictions. He highlighted the unique nature of XRP’s market dynamics, which often defy conventional technical analysis and require maturity from investors. Bruno further emphasized the valuable contributions of analysts like Dark Defender, @CasiTrades, and @egragcrypto, whose efforts help elevate the understanding of XRP’s price movements within the community. He also advised analysts to avoid engaging with critics, particularly Bitcoin maximalists , and instead focus on the long-term potential of XRP. Key Takeaways Dark Defender’s analysis underscores the importance of understanding market corrections as part of a larger trend. While short-term fluctuations may cause concern among less experienced traders, long-term targets remain unchanged. His focus on technical analysis, including Fibonacci levels and wave patterns, provides a clear framework for understanding XRP’s price action. Despite the recent correction, the XRP community remains optimistic about the asset’s potential. With ongoing analysis and support from experienced analysts, XRP holders are better equipped to navigate the ups and downs of the market. As Dark Defender concluded, the targets remain solid, and XRP is poised to achieve them as part of its natural progression.

MicroStrategy currently holds over 417,107 BTC, worth more than $48 billion. Interestingly, Cramer’s predictions often inspire the opposite outcome, leading to the humorous “Inverse Cramer” theory.

This Revolutionary PayFi altcoin breaks records by collecting over $8.3 million in its presale and selling over 380 million tokens and currently at $0.048 each. The big question is why are fans of Avalanche and Kaspa flocking to Remittix (RTX) ? Read on to understand why the new PayFi project is generating so much buzz. Avalanche Loses Investors Interest Right now, Avalanche sits around $33.08, down -11.24% for the day but down -11% over seven days and -9% this month. Some saw Avalanche (AVAX) as a top contender in DeFi, yet daily swings suggest its momentum isn’t as strong as before. Even with past hype, Avalanche faces fierce competition. Some watchers note that altcoin investor interest can shift quickly if better-performing projects appear. While Avalanche introduced advanced features, it does not currently show the same spark it once had. As whales look for bigger opportunities, many now point to Remittix as a prime place to invest. Kaspa’s Drawdown Signals a Sell Off Kaspa has seen an incredible ride to the top; in fact, it was one of the most trending altcoins of 2024. But with the highs come the lows. The Kaspa price has been continuously declining in the last four months, with a weekly drawdown that has seen it fall over 5.4% in the last seven days. While Kaspa enjoyed a good run in the first six months of 2024, its present monthly candle formation suggests it might be on a bearish trend. Remittix is Set for Explosive Growth Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients’ bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform’s open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0418 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with high growth potential at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal the success of other top altcoins but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis and evident market demand.

MicroStrategy’s latest purchase marks the firm’s 12th consecutive week of BTC buys. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Cache Grows By 10.1K MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman Michael Saylor announced that the company had spent roughly $1.1 billion to acquire the 10,107 BTC at an average price of $105,596 per BTC between Jan. 21 and Jan. 26. The Tysons, Virginia-based firm now holds a whopping 471,107 BTC — currently valued at around $47 billion. The company has spent a total of $30.4 billion on the alpha crypto, with its overall average price at $64,511 per Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has acquired 10,107 BTC for ~$1.1 billion at ~$105,596 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 2.90% YTD 2025. As of 1/26/2025, we hodl 471,107 $BTC acquired for ~$30.4 billion at ~$64,511 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/UM5dGUS9Ma — Michael Saylor (@saylor) January 27, 2025 Bitcoin is now trading for about $99,808 after dropping as low as $97,791 on Monday morning amid a crypto-wide market bloodbath, according to CoinGecko data. MicroStrategy’s Saylor kicked off the company’s Bitcoin buying master plan in 2020 and hasn’t stopped since — though over the past 12 weeks, it has accelerated its accumulation, announcing a new BTC buy every week during that period. The company has since turned to debt issuance like convertible notes and senior secured notes to finance its aggressive BTC buying spree. Saylor believes Bitcoin is the best inflation hedge and a way to get better returns for shareholders over the long term — and advises other companies to do the same. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Buying Inspire Global Corporate Adoption Last October, MicroStrategy entered a sales agreement known as the “21/21 Plan” that allows the company to raise as much as $42 billion via equity and fixed-income securities offerings for Bitcoin acquisitions. On Jan. 21, MicroStrategy shareholders expanded that plan by voting in favor of a 30x increase to the number of authorized Class A common shares to help make further Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy’s latest purchase was funded through stock sales, as was the case in previous weeks. As per a Jan. 27 SEC filing, the company sold 2.76 million shares over the past week, generating $1.1 billion in net proceeds. The company still has $4.35 billion worth of shares available for sale under their sales agreement as of January 26. Years after MicroStrategy pioneered large-scale corporate Bitcoin adoption, the strategy began picking up steam among other publicly listed companies.

This new AI Altcoin, PropiChain , is revolutionizing real estate investment with cutting-edge technology, fractional ownership, and metaverse integration. Currently priced at just $0.011 during Stage 2 of its presale, PropiChain is projected to hit $0.023 in Stage 3, doubling in value almost instantly. This could be the next coin to deliver Solana-like returns, and here’s why you should act fast. Solana’s 2021 Rally: A Benchmark for Growth Solana’s fast rise from under $1 to over $260 in 2021 captured the attention of the crypto world. Investors who got in early saw life-changing returns of over 26,000%. PropiChain is uniquely positioned to replicate such growth with its real-world utility, advanced AI capabilities, and rapidly growing community. As AI altcoins gain momentum, PropiChain’s innovative features and strong fundamentals make it a top contender for massive gains. The AI Altcoin Revolutionizing Property Investment PropiChain is an AI altcoin designed to transform the real estate market by offering fractional ownership, blockchain transparency, and metaverse integration. High entry costs, opaque processes, and limited global accessibility have traditionally plagued real estate. PropiChain’s innovative solutions make real estate investing more accessible, secure, and profitable. Its AI technology provides precise market analysis, automated property valuations, and efficient filtering. This empowers investors to identify high-potential properties quickly. For example, an investor can use PropiChain’s AI to analyze a property’s growth potential, significantly reducing the guesswork in real estate investments. Also, with real estate assets tokenization, PropiChain allows investors to buy fractional shares of high-value properties. This means you can invest in premium real estate assets, even with a small budget. You can own a piece of a luxury property without spending millions. PropiChain goes beyond traditional property scouting. Its metaverse platform enables global buyers and sellers to connect seamlessly. Investors can host virtual tours, showcase properties, and network with clients across the globe. For example, a real estate agency can attract international buyers through immersive virtual property tours, increasing its promotional reach. Presale Benefits: Act Now Before Stage 3 Hits The current presale price of PropiChain is $0.011, but this is the lowest price you’ll ever see for the token. Once Stage 3 begins, the price will jump to $0.023, a 109% increase. Early investors can double their money before the token even hits exchanges. A $500 investment at $0.011 could grow to $1,045 by Stage 3 and up to $250,000 if it achieves the 50,000% growth as adoption rises. With a supply cap ensuring scarcity, the potential for price growth is immense. Why PropiChain is Different Unlike other altcoins, PropiChain solves real-world problems with practical applications. Its AI technology reduces risks and boosts returns, while fractional ownership democratizes real estate investing. The metaverse aspect isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a powerful tool for global property promotion and sales. For example: A property investor can use AI to identify undervalued assets with high appreciation potential. Real estate agencies can host global virtual meetings and tours, boosting international sales without additional marketing costs. Sellers can tokenize their properties to access a broader pool of buyers, driving higher bids. These features streamline real estate management and increase profitability for all stakeholders. In addition, PropiChain’s smart contracts have undergone a BlockAudit security audit , ensuring robust protections for investors and users and the token is already listed on CoinMarketCap . Conclusion PropiChain is not just an AI altcoin; it’s a game-changer for real estate and a lucrative opportunity for investors. The presale price of $0.011 is your ticket to massive returns as the coin transitions to Stage 3 pricing at $0.023. Imagine the potential beyond that; if PropiChain mirrors Solana’s growth trajectory, early investors could see life-changing profits. This is the lowest PropiChain will ever be priced before it hits significant exchanges. Don’t miss out; secure your position before Stage 3 begins and watch your investment soar. The time to act is now because opportunities like this don’t come often.

Tuttle proposed the first-ever ETFs tracking 200% returns of the following tokens: Chainlink (LINK), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Melania (MELANIA), XRP (XRP), Bonk (BONK), Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Trump (TRUMP). The daily performance returns of these tokens will be tracked and generated through swaps, call options, and direct investments, per the filing. However, investors are at the chance of losing their entire capital should prices drop significantly due to the leveraged nature of these products. “Using leverage amplifies returns but also magnifies losses, with investors potentially losing their entire principal within a single trading day if the underlying asset’s value drops by more than 50%,” the filing warned. Although 50% drops are rare, altcoin markets are infamous for suddenly dropping 10% during times of market stress, as they did on Monday. A 10% slide would mean the ETFs drop at least 20%, before fees. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in an X post the filings were likely a test of what the Trump administration may allow. “This is a case of issuers testing the limits of what this SEC is going to allow,” Seyffart said. “I'm expecting the new crypto task force (led by @HesterPeirce) to likely be the lynchpin in determining what's gonna be allowed vs what isn't.” “A 2x Melanie ETF (sic) before a 1x Melania ETF has been filed. That is unusual,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas noted . Balchunas added the ETFs could technically be out in April unless explicitly disapproved by the SEC as these were an “Act 40” filing — which allows for potential trading if not disapproved within the review period due to its structured process for review and approval of investment products.",Markets,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|DOT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-28 07:31:45

As per the agreement, KuCoin faces monetary penalties of more than $297 million, which includes a forfeiture of $184.5 million and a fine of $112.9 million. KuCoin will also be suspending its US market activities for two years. Founders Michael Gan and Eric Tang will relinquish $2.7 million and withdraw entirely from the company’s leadership under the terms of a deferred prosecution deal. KuCoin’s AML and KYC Lapses Court documents reveal that KuCoin was established around September 2017 and has grown into one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, serving over 30 million customers with billions in daily trading volume. From its inception until March 2024, KuCoin served about 1.5 million U.S. users and earned at least $184.5 million in fees from them. As a money transmitter, KuCoin was required to follow the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires maintaining a sufficient anti-money laundering (AML) program and performing know-your-customer (KYC) verifications. Despite its obligations and significant US presence, the Department of Justice said that KuCoin failed to establish an adequate KYC program. Until July 2023, the platform did not require users to provide identifying information, and KuCoin employees publicly stated on social media that KYC was optional, even responding to posts from US-based customers. In August 2023, KuCoin introduced mandatory KYC for new customers and existing users who wanted to use its services actively. However, the platform did not enforce these requirements on existing users who only sought to withdraw or close positions, which was a compliance requirement. Additionally, the Department of Justice added that KuCoin failed to register with FinCEN as a money-transmitting business and did not submit any mandatory suspicious activity reports. Commenting on the development, the US Attorney Danielle R. Sassoon said, “For years, KuCoin avoided implementing required anti-money laundering policies designed to identify criminal actors and prevent illicit transactions. As a result, KuCoin was used to facilitate billions of dollars worth of suspicious transactions and to transmit potentially criminal proceeds, including proceeds from darknet markets and malware, ransomware, and fraud schemes.” KuCoin’s Statement Despite regulatory challenges in the US, KuCoin assured that its operations in other non-restrictive markets remain unaffected. Meanwhile, in a statement to CryptoPotato , Gan described the settlement as “a favorable outcome” and announced that KuCoin’s chief legal officer, BC Wong, will assume the role of CEO. He also mentioned that the Justice Department dropped all charges against himself and Tang after meeting certain conditions and stated that the latest resolution brings clarity to the crypto exchange.

The third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is struggling to hold on to the $3 valuation as criticism regarding the centralization of its ledger technology mounts. The situation has added complexity to the ongoing debate around whether or not it could potentially be added to the much-hyped US crypto reserve in the future. Ripple Technology Czar Dismisses Centralization Concerns Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has defended the platform’s ledger (XRPL) and argued that its extensive structure and decentralization mechanism defend it against price manipulation. He stated that this was just another ploy by naysayers to discredit the widely successful cryptocurrency and its rapidly reviving fortunes. XRP Cite Centralization Fears Yet Again Critics, led by Bitcoin maximalists, believe that the innate centralization of Ripple’s ledger makes it vulnerable to organizational influence. Pierre Rochard, the Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, tweeted that the company could directly manipulate the XRPL software, adjust escrow locks, or flood the market with additional XRP. Rochard argued that XRP uses a simple consensus algorithm rather than a rigorous Proof of Work (PoW) regime like Bitcoin. As a result, there are fewer validators than Bitcoin, and there is no incentive to maintain the ledger’s integrity, which Ripple’s higher-ups can easily manipulate. Ripple’s Storied Past This is not the first time Ripple has been accused of centralization. The controversial digital asset has been criticized for this approach for the better part of the 10 years of its existence. Fiercely loyal Bitcoin users see Ripple as a corporate distraction that has nothing to do with blockchain or even decentralization and brings nothing to the table. Will XRP be Part of the US Strategic Crypto Reserve? Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also dismissed these concerns and stated that the company is in a good position to take advantage of the pro-crypto stance of the new Donald Trump administration. He also cited Trump’s policy of promoting American blockchain firms, which could pave the way for XRP to be included in the strategic reserve asset announced by Trump on his campaign trail. While the debate around its inclusion in the reserve continues, Ripple’s digital currency has been doing extremely well in the last few months, rising 600% in the previous few months. The recent 10% fall from its 7-year high of $3.3 can mostly be attributed to the recent slump in the crypto market that has wiped out $1 billion in derivatives in the last 24 hours alone.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-28 07:34:51

His plan includes imposing higher tariffs on imported goods, withdrawing from an international corporate tax agreement, and introducing significant tax cuts designed to strengthen domestic production. Tariff Hikes on Key Industries Trump’s proposal centers on increasing tariffs on products like steel, aluminum, copper, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. These tariffs, which he revealed would exceed the previously proposed 2.5% rate, aim to encourage U.S. manufacturers to bring production back home.

The Chinese AI model has grabbed the attention of the entire Web3 community , especially the cryptocurrency community, for the way it has outperformed US-based AI projects with its attractive quality of cost-effectiveness. However, recent reports suggest that fake tokens and imposter sites are exploiting the low-GPU model’s rising popularity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Here is everything you need to know about these scams and the challenges of combating them. Read on! DeepSeek’s Popularity Gives Rise to Fake Tokens What most people don’t know is that DeepSeek neither has any official token nor any connection with crypto. It is true that the success of DeepSeek has grabbed the attention of the crypto community, and most of its members are willing to be a part of this growing Chinese model. It is learned that scammers are primarily targeting those who have no in-depth idea about how the crypto sector actually functions. According to data from the security firm BlockAid, at least 75 fake DeepSeek tokens have been created on Ethereum and Solana so far. How Scammers Fool Crypto Traders Scammers primarily use two methods. The first method is that they release fake tokens in order to exploit traders’ eagerness to be a part of DeepSeek. The second method is that they create importer sites. These sites demand users to connect their wallets. The moment a wallet is connected, they drain it completely. If you do enough fundamental analysis before entering any market, you can easily identify and avoid any potential scam. Scam tokens pretending to be DeepSeek have increased Source : BlockAid. Trump’s Meme Coin Adds Credibility to Scams The releases of $TRUMP and $MELANIA have indirectly benefited scammers , as they has created a feeling that most major projects are preparing to issue tokens. Platforms Fight Back, But Challenges Remain Certain platforms, like Uniswap and DexScreener, have successfully installed filters to fight fake tokens. Experts doubt the effectiveness of the measures taken by them to combat fake tokens, as new scams appear constantly. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : AI Coin Bloodbath! DeepSeek’s Low-Cost Models Trigger Market Panic , Decentralisation vs. Regulation Debate This development has brought the topic of decentralisation back to crypto forums. Importantly, many in the crypto community are against the idea of interfering with decentralised systems even if it is to make these systems scam-free. The rise of scams tied to DeepSeek’s popularity highlights the need for vigilance in the crypto scape. While platforms fight to eliminate fake tokens, traders must remain cautious. Verifying project legitimacy and staying informed are key to avoiding these traps.

According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, Tuttle has filed for ten 2x leveraged ETFs, covering assets like XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), Litecoin ( LTC ), Chainlink ( LINK ), Cardano ( ADA ), Polkadot ( DOT ), BNP, Bonk ( BONK ), and the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) and Melania ( MELANIA ) tokens. Unlike traditional spot ETFs that mirror the underlying asset’s performance one-to-one, leveraged ETFs aim to amplify returns, offering investors the potential to achieve twice the daily performance of the tracked assets while also increasing risk exposure. With this filing, Tuttle became the first U.S.-based asset manager to file for leveraged ETP tracking Chainlink, Cardano, Polkadot, BNP, and Melania Meme tokens. Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the filings are “unusual,” as many of the proposed funds lack even a standard ETF. However, he said that since these are filed under the 40-act framework, they could potentially start trading by April unless the SEC disapproves them. Referring to the recent filings for TRUMP and Dogecoin ETFs from REX Shares, Balchunas reminded his followers that these products have not been withdrawn, which could indicate the SEC’s openness to exploring crypto-focused ETFs further. “Will be interesting to see where the SEC draws a line (if at all) and why,” he wrote.

With crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce at the forefront of this transition, the agency has already launched a dedicated crypto task force to streamline policies and reduce regulatory ambiguity. Market pundits believe the new SEC could redefine the regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs, with the potential to open doors for a wider array of digital asset products. Seyffart described Tuttle’s filing as a bold move to test the “limits” of the SEC under its unwinding regulatory approach. To be very clear here. This is a case of issuers testing the limits of what this SEC is going to allow. I'm expecting the new crypto task force (led by @HesterPeirce ) to likely be the lynchpin in determining what's gonna be allowed vs what isn't — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 27, 2025 The success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has inspired asset managers to experiment with new products in the ETF market. On Dec. 20, the SEC granted “accelerated approval” to Hashdex and Franklin Templeton’s Bitcoin and Ethereum index ETFs for trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market. Meanwhile, Bitwise Asset Management has registered a statutory trust for a Dogecoin ETF with Delaware’s Department of State, marking an initial step toward the fund’s potential launch.

The cryptocurrency recently saw its price lose the $1 mark, descending below $0.90 on Monday morning. Despite the drop, some market watchers shared a positive outlook for ADA, asserting that a rebound to $1.30 could be around the corner. Related Reading: XRP Price To $5.85: Analyst Reveals Why The New Week Will Be ‘Dynamic’ Cardano Holds Key Higher Timeframe Support Cardano, alongside the rest of the market, ended the week with a Sunday bleeding, registering seven consecutive red candles yesterday afternoon. The market pullback continued Monday morning, with Bitcoin (BTC) losing the $100,000 support for the first time in over a week. As the market correction persisted, ADA’s price lost the $0.90 support, hovering between the $0.85-$0.89 range before recovering. Almost two weeks ago, Cardano bounced from the $0.90 support to reclaim the $1 resistance. During this jump, the cryptocurrency surged to its 2025 high but failed to break past the $1.18 resistance level, sending ADA into a downtrend. Since then, the altcoin has failed to turn the $1 resistance into support, hovering between $0.95-$1.02. The recent drop sent Cardano to a two-week low price and back to its end-of-year range of $0.83-$0.95. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency’s price remains above crucial levels, as some market watchers noted. AMCrypto highlighted that after its 5% recovery from today’s low, ADA was back to its 2-day support level. To the analyst, there is “no need to panic” if Cardano holds the $0.80 support zone. This zone was 2024’s Q1 high, and it has served as a key higher timeframe level, fueling the altcoin’s rally once it has been turned into support in 2021 and late 2024. AMCrypto noted that “For alts to retest major support levels during a bull run is a good sign.” ADA To Reclaim $1 Soon? Other analysts shared similar predictions, suggesting that Cardano’s run would be determined by its next price move. Carl Runefelt stated that “despite the market correction, ADA is still holding on to this massive bullish pennant.” The analyst pointed out that ADA’s chart displays a 2-month bullish formation that targets $1.9 if it breaks out. However, he noted that the first target is the local top of $1.30. Runefelt explained that “if the support holds, we could see a bullish breakout at some point.” Meanwhile, ADA trader Sebastian considers that Cardano needs to close the day above $0.95. He stated it “would be amazing for ADA if this last daily candle turns green” and closes within the symmetrical triangle. Related Reading: Ready To Rocket? Dogecoin Chart Hints At Major Gains Ahead Previously, Sebastian noted that ADA’s “painful consolidation might soon be over,” as the cryptocurrency was “running out of space within this symmetrical triangle and might break out soon.” To the trader, If Cardano gets “back in the chart,” then the recent breakdown will “be busted and will likely result in a pump to the upside.” As of this writing, ADA is trading at $0.90, an 8% decline in the last 24 hours.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 120,600 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may be following in the footsteps of its 2015 market cycle. Should the similarities stay true, Martinez thinks that Bitcoin is now in a position to launch a violent upside surge. “Bitcoin is showing striking similarities to the 2015-2018 cycle. Historically, it was around this point when BTC went parabolic.” Source: Ali Maritnez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, it appears he’s suggesting that Bitcoin may be in the midst of a final leg down before sparking a big upside burst. While the trader is bullish on BTC, he predicts that the next leg up will likely take Bitcoin to its market cycle top based on the Wyckoff Method – an investment and trading strategy developed by stock trader Richard D. Wyckoff to spot market cycle tops and bottoms. Martinez thinks that the incoming Bitcoin rally could push BTC to around $200,000 before holders systematically unload their coins. “According to the Wyckoff Method, Bitcoin BTC could be approaching its final leg up before entering the Distribution Phase.” Based on the Wyckoff Method, the Distribution Phase is the final stage of a bull market where investors offload accumulated coins at high prices, marking the cycle top of an asset. It’s also the prelude to a new bear market. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $101,853.

XRP and Solana (SOL) holders are flocking to OFFICIALMAGACOIN, with analysts comparing its growth potential to the early days of crypto’s biggest names. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Taking Over 1. Explosive Early Adoption Raising $1 million in minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is proving to be a high-demand asset, attracting XRP and SOLANA holders who recognize its massive potential. 2.

DOT: Known for interoperability but outpaced by the excitement surrounding this exclusive token. Your Next Opportunity Is Here XRP and SOLANA holders aren’t missing out—neither should you.

Trump, who also signed executive orders regarding cryptocurrencies, is also waiting for the US Senate to approve his appointments for critical positions. US Senate Confirms Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary! At this point, the first news came. The US Senate confirmed Donald Trump's nominee for US Treasury Secretary, billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. The Senate confirmed Scott Bessent on January 27 by a vote of 68-29, with 16 Democrats supporting Bessent's nomination. Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent will replace current Treasury Secretary and former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and will have sway over fiscal policy, financial regulation, international sanctions and overseas investment as US Treasury Secretary. Scott Bessent says he will pursue pro-crypto policies, end CBDC talks, and FinCEN oversight. The crypto-pro-conservative Bessent will also help develop a crypto regulatory framework and consider the creation of a “strategic national digital asset stockpile” as part of a presidential working group formed last week. Bessent’s confirmation by the Senate was welcomed by the cryptocurrency community, with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse congratulating Bessent on his X account, saying: “Congratulations to our newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent! He will be a great leader for Americans. I am confident he will implement common sense economic policies and work with the Administration and Congress to grow tech and crypto innovation in the United States.” *This is not investment advice.

Trump Coin, launched just a few days ago, also has not shown much promise, leading early investors to start selling their holdings. Among all the meme coins in the market, Panshibi stands out as the most promising investment opportunity. It is one of the biggest rising coins set to launch soon. DOGE ETF Filings Is Not Enough DOGE coin and Solana started the last week of January with a 10% drop in value after a $770 million liquidation of the cryptocurrency market. Some days back, there was a 6% drop in the price of the DOGE coin even after the DOGE ETF filings, which was supposed to raise the coin’s value. This DOGE coin news is concerning to investors who have been waiting for the chance to get a great return. As of this writing, DOGE trades for $0.3225, having dropped 9% in value in the last 24 hours. Many DOGE investors are now in search of a new project with a promising future. Panshibi is turning out to be the number one choice for these investors, as it is tipped to explode as the biggest meme coin in 2025. SHIBA Inu Continues To Drop Despite A High Burn Rate SHIBA Inu has seen a rapid rise in burn rate in the last 24 hours. This burn rate has exceeded over 800% with over 6 million SHIBA Inu tokens cleared in circulation. Following this enormous burn rate, the value of SHIBA Inu is expected to have taken a positive turn but this hasn’t been the case. Right now, SHIBA Inu price has seen a 9% drop in value in the last 24 hours and now trades for $0.00001786. Also, erasing the SHIBA Inu imagery from the Director Of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) website contributed to the fall in the value of the DOGE coin. SHIBA Inu Investors are becoming less optimistic despite the significant rise in the burn rate of this coin and won’t miss out on the chance to bet on a more promising coin like Panshibi. TRUMP Sees A Rapid Fall Following Launch of A Rival Coin A few days before the inauguration of Donald Trump as the president of the United States, Trump coin was released into the crypto market. After Trump was launched, many crypto enthusiasts made a quick investment and got great returns. However, some days later, Trump’s wife released her own coin, the Melania coin, and this caused the value of the Trump coin to decrease significantly, causing a lot of investors to lose a lot of money. The current price of Trump coin is around $26.70 with a 7.8% decrease in value in the last day. Panshibi Coin Is Set To Be The Biggest Asia-Inspired Coin Panshibi is a growing cryptocurrency project that is going to hit the market soon. The goal of this project is to combine three different communities: Asia, Memecoins, and Panda. With the use of Pandas, Panshibi hopes to build a strong network of memecoin enthusiasts using components like AI and social-Fi. Holders of Panshibi will be members of a community where they can compete in different tasks and earn tokens. During the period of presale, the value of Panshibi is expected to rise by 1200%. Also, on the day of launch, the value of the coin is predicted to see a 145,000% rise. This makes Panshibi one of the best coins to invest in 2025. Investors are expected to get a massive return on investment. The best time to invest in this coin is now. To show transparency and safety, Panshibi has completed a full smart contract audit, and was passed without any problem. Therefore, apart from being a valuable coin, Panshibi is also a safe coin to place your bet on without fear of any fraudulent activities. Conclusion Panshibi has been predicted to become the front-runner of the meme coins market in 2025, surpassing other coins like DOGE, SHIBA Inu, and Trump. It is believed to be the largest Asian inspired meme coin to hit the market soon.

Meanwhile, experts predict that Rollblock ($RBLK) could hit $10 as this promising P2E presale token has seen unprecedented growth in recent weeks and looks set to 100x this year. Rollblock ($RBLK) Blockchain Upstart Takes On The Gaming Giants Rollblock ($ RBLK ) recently hit a brand-new high of $0.052 after blasting through stage 9 of its oversubscribed presale offering. The Rollblock platform is currently live and generating massive revenue from over 7,000 fully immersive gaming experiences and a recently launched sports prediction league. Rollblock signups experienced a record 600% surge in December, as more than $1.75M in wagered bids were placed across the Rollblock platform. This growth is on track to double in January. Demand is sky-high for the $RBLK presale, as investors seek to capitalize on this growth by investing in its Ethereum-based token. $RBLK represents a unique opportunity in crypto as, unlike most gaming tokens, it has a hard cap of 1 billion coins and so cannot be inflated away to infinity. Rather, each week its supply will come down thanks to a revenue-sharing scheme that uses 30% of the platform’s profits to buy $RBLK, burning 60% of these tokens and allocating the remaining 40% to stakers who can earn a generous yield. Selling will be very far from the minds of long-term holders, many of whom are already up by more than 350% from their initial investment. This could cause Rollblock to surge to $10 in the coming bull run. Solana ($SOL) Copes With Trump Volume Spike Solana has been incredibly volatile lately, spiking to a new height of $293 recently, before correcting to $225. Currently, the Solana price has bounced to $233 but may fall further depending on the wider market. Solana recently got the presidential nod of approval after President Donald Trump chose the Solana chain to launch his hugely popular meme coin. With the prospect of a Solana ETF just around the corner, 2025 is shaping up to be hugely bullish, and the Solana chart could soon be painting a four-figure price if current adoption continues. Chainlink ($LINK) Integrates Across Blockchains As Dominance Continues Chainlink has also fallen today, losing 6.5% to reach $23.6. However, Chainlink is still green on the monthly time frame, with a 10% monthly candle looking especially bullish for future Chainlink price action. Support for Chainlink looks strong at $18, although market makers may try to move the price below this level to flush out any long positions in the days to come. Chainlink is currently leading the market with 12 integrations recently announced across 10 different blockchains, including Arbitrum and Base. Chainlink could easily reach $100 this cycle given this string of partnerships. Rollblock Will Outperform In 2025 Bitcoin holders will continue to rotate into the Rollblock ($RBLK) presale at $0.052 as this represents such a huge opportunity. Solana and Chainlink may well rally from here, but only Rollblock offers such massive disruption at a tiny fraction of their market caps. A coming supply crunch is inevitable and will stun many in the markets. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

The Ripple CEO confirmed owning BTC, ETH, XRP, and other altcoins. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple , has shared his views on the divisive issue of maximalism within the crypto industry.

Gan published a farewell message on KuCoin’s blog highlighting his achievements as the company’s leader, including growing the exchange from scratch to a user base of 38 million. According to the outgoing CEO, KuCoin has grown into one of the world’s leading exchanges, playing a significant role in advancing the possibilities of blockchain technology. Details of the DOJ Settlement In the meantime, Gan considers the terms of the resolution between the DOJ and himself favorable, noting that the government agency has agreed to drop all the charges against him and Tang.

However, 1Fuel is getting the most attention, as the DeFi coin is dubbed the next big crypto asset. Analysts say 1Fuel presale is a golden opportunity for investors to gain about 200% profit, and now may be the best time to get in before the token skyrockets. PEPE Eyes Change In Price Direction In The Coming Months PEPE has endured prolonged bear pressure this month, dipping by over 30%. This bearish rally came after PEPE hit a $0.00002825 all-time high in early December. The meme coin is now about 55% down from its peak price, trading at $0.00001245 currently. PEPE is currently struggling to defend its key support level at $0.00001348, as any further slip could see PEPE drop drastically. Future projections are also not looking great for PEPE, as investors are actively pursuing alternative investments. Crypto experts say PEPE struggling may continue in February, but the dip could be a good buy for long-term PEPE holders. Bonk Battles Meme Dip But Analysts Expect A Gradual Upward Reversal BONK is another one of the numerous meme coins battling bear pressure. BONK has moved -25.42% in the past week, dropping to $0.0000249. This is below BONK’s critical support level at $0.000030 and about 60% below its $0.000059 peak price. However, analysts say BONK could return to the $0.000030 price zone this week, and may attempt $0.000040 by February. BONK initially tested the resistance around $0.000040 this month, but failed to breach it. But, analysts think BONK’s next attempt could be successful. BONK holders are still hopeful, as they expect the meme ecosystem to recover soon. 1fuel Shows Clear Signs Of An Early Uptrend As The Presale Nears A New Milestone Experts are increasingly convinced that 1Fuel could be among the cryptocurrencies that’ll blow-up in 2025. The budding token is already taking the market by the storm, capturing the attention of major investors. The presale has now sold 150+ million tokens, raising close to $2 million. 1Fuel’s early presale progress could be the beginning of something big. Analysts’ projections suggest investors can gain up to 300% from joining the presale now, while the token has the potential to yield 100x soon. The DeFi coin could be one of the most profitable exchange tokens in 2025. The 1Fuel platform is expected to attract lots of users with its unique one-click technology and cold storage solution. These features allow for seamless cross-chain trading and secure asset storage. The platform will equally resolve the issue of high transaction fees as well as security vulnerabilities or data breaches. 1Fuel is built to provide users what they’ve been missing from DeFi and this could see it outperform other DeFi projects. The project’s promising prospect makes it one of top crypto assets to consider purchasing currently. Experienced investors say the token’s low price is one not to miss. Thus, joining the presale in February or before could be a profitable decision.

Currently, though, SUI is priced at $5.01, with a market capitalization of $15.08 billion. This is leading some SUI investors to shift their focus to a new upcoming altcoin, Rexas Finance (RXS), priced at $0.175 in its 11th presale stage. Given its impressive features and growth trajectory, RXS has the potential to grow 20x-30x over the next two months. Here Are Some Reasons Why Sui Investors are Taking Notice of Rexas Finance Tokenization Framework Rexas Finance is changing the game with its asset tokenization framework. This allows individuals to own fractional real-world assets such as real estate and commodities and trade them on the blockchain. Traditional finance and blockchain can now finally converge. The RXS token, for example, offers unique features that many investors are seeking, such as liquidity for previously illiquid assets and investment in crypto with tangible use cases. This places RXS far ahead of its competitors like Sui. Features Driving Investor Confidence Rexas Finance aims to decentralize financial markets, and as such, it does not include speculative tokens. The RXS ecosystem has been carefully crafted with the intention of scaling and sustainability. Staking Rewards: Its staking program offers strong incentives, such as long-term passive income-earning tokens. 22.5% of all staked tokens are allocated for this purpose. Liquidity Allocation: Allocating 15% for liquidity helps smooth trading activity while decreasing volatility, which is extremely important in attracting institutional investors. Safety Enhancement: RXS has passed the most recent CertiK audit, which was a key step in boosting confidence among the most skeptical investors. All these factors are painstakingly crafted to ensure stability and growth, making RXS appealing to Sui investors seeking diversification opportunities. Promotion for Community Building – $1 Million Giveaway Under the remarkable facets of Rexas Finance is the $1 million giveaway, where 20 lucky winners will be rewarded 50,000 worth of RXS tokens each, which promotes community interaction and brings fortune to the freshest users. It speaks volumes about the project’s efforts toward user base loyalty, among the most essential aspects of quick adoption. For Sui investors, whose focus is more on innovation, RXS’s focus on community development is a strategic change. The ongoing presale confirms vigorous market interest in the new altcoin, as over $38.8 million has been collected, and 412 million tokens have been sold. Why RXS Grabs Attention When Compared to Sui Sui’s ecosystem is great in terms of scalability and transaction throughput, which is perfect for developers. However, the price and market cap are much higher, making it harder for retail investors who want significant short-term gains. RXS, on the other hand, has a low entrance price of $0.175, which can help attract investors poised to take advantage of an exponential growth opportunity. Also, Sui invests in and excels in technology but lacks core tokenomics and real-world applications like RXS. This disparity is why Sui investors are turning to Rexas Finance to better utilize their investments. The Projected Growth of Rexas Finance (RXS) The presale performance of Rexas Finance greatly increases its growth as a project. This, along with the shift toward launch predicted by much of the industry, will likely lead to pricing stability and even growth due to increased utility, the asset tokenization model attracting institutional partnerships, and increasing demand for RXS tokens. The highly anticipated marketing plans, such as the million-dollar giveaway, have already positioned RXS to gain the favor of institutional and retail investors. Also, remember the carefully planned, structured token distribution to keep supply and price balanced. For these reasons, analysts anticipate that RXS could increase to $3.50 or even more within two months of being listed. This is the ROI 20x-30x SUI investors are currently on the hunt for. Conclusion Sui (SUI) is thriving in the blockchain niche market, but its reduced price and short-term growth opportunities mean investors are looking for other options. Rexas Finance (RXS) has also made a strong argument due to its novel tokenization approach, community-driven initiatives, and investor-oriented features. Currently in presale for $0.175, RXS is affordable enough for retail investors while still providing the scalability and utility that institutions seek. With the push the project is gaining, the potential growth is astounding. After changing market areas, 20x-30x in the next two months makes RXS one of the best alternatives for massive-cap SUI and other high-cap coins.

(Tokyo: 3350), a fast-growing company through its Bitcoin treasury, has announced a bold plan to strengthen its BTC strategy in the coming two years. After achieving remarkable results in 2024, Metaplanet has announced plans to accumulate 10k Bitcoins by the end of 2025. Additionally, the company has set a goal of accumulating 21k Bitcoins by the end of 2026. “The market has recognized Metaplanet as Tokyo’s preeminent Bitcoin company, and we are seizing this momentum to solidify our position as a global leader. Our vision is to lead the Bitcoin renaissance in Japan and emerge as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. This plan is our commitment to that future,” Simon Gerovich, Representative Director of Metaplanet, noted. Key Highlights of Metaplanet’s 2025-2026 Bitcoin Plan Having attracted major global investors, such as Capital Group with over $2 trillion in assets under management (AUM), Metaplanet now plans to scale further its share sale programs to raise more funds. In the first phase dubbed the ‘21 Million Plan’, Metaplanet intends to issue 21 million shares via moving strike warrants to raise around ¥116.65 billion. “We don’t measure performance in fiat currencies like the yen or the dollar—our benchmark is Bitcoin itself. Our mission is to maximize Bitcoin per share for our shareholders. Bitcoin is not just an asset; it’s the exit strategy. We’re here to accumulate and lead, not sell,” Dylan LeClair, Director of Bitcoin Strategy at Metaplanet, noted. As a result, the company now aims to achieve a 35 percent BTC Yield per quarter throughout 2025.

According to analyst Andrew Kang, who has over 354k X followers, Official Trump ( TRUMP ) likely hit its bottom at $25 on Jan. 27. He noted that this marks a drop of approximately 68% from its all-time high of $73.43, reached on Jan. 19, just one day before Donald Trump’s inauguration. The analyst based his analysis on a 4-hour TRUMP/USDT chart, which showed a bottoming structure and reversing momentum, with TRUMP finding support at $25. Additionally, Kang believes the meme coin had held a relatively low market cap for a token linked to U.S. President Donald Trump. “Still barely $6b market cap for a brand more known than Ethereum,” the analyst noted. Market commentator ‘Captain Faibik’ echoed a similar opinion, noting that TRUMP has formed a bullish pattern that might likely end its downtrend. TRUMP has broken above the upper boundary of the falling wedge pattern | Source: X/CryptoFaibik On the 4-hour chart he shared, TRUMP appears to have broken above a falling wedge pattern, a signal of a strong bullish reversal in technical analysis. The trader now expects the meme coin to rebound by around 105% from $27, the level at which it broke above the pattern. Launched on Jan 17 by Trump as a homage to himself days ahead of his inauguration, the meme coin rallied to its all-time high of $73.43 in roughly 48 hours, while its market cap surpassed $14.5 billion. However, it has since dropped roughly 60% to stabilize over the $25 support level, while its market cap stood at $5.8 billion, positioning it as the 31st largest altcoin in the market.

Rising open interest typically indicates growing market participation and bullish sentiment, suggesting that new money is flowing into the TRUMP market and reinforcing the ongoing upward price movement. Whales have also taken an interest in TRUMP over the past few days after previously offloading holdings , whales have returned to TRUMP, rotating funds from other assets into the memecoin. According to crypto market commentator MartyParty, a whale who previously bought $23.4 million worth of TRUMP and sold the tokens at the peak for $38 million has started accumulating the meme coin again. On-chain tracker Whale Watch flagged several large transactions in the past 24 hours. Notably, an ARC whale and an ACT whale bought $371.41k and $12.92k worth of TRUMP tokens, respectively. Earlier, another whale was seen buying $29.6 million worth of the meme coin from crypto exchange Crypto.com. (See below.) https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1882939080238936420 Another positive indicator supporting the bullish narrative around TRUMP is its Relative Strength Index on the 1-day chart, which stood at 39, close to hitting oversold levels. At this level, assets often experience a potential reversal as buyers step in, driving the price upward.

In order to do this smoothly, Binance will halt deposits and withdrawals of Cardano ( ADA ) tokens on the same day beginning from 20:45 UTC. Binance announced that trading for ADA tokens will not be suspended during the upgrade process. All technical requirements of the upgrade will be completed by Binance so that users can upgrade seamlessly. This upgrade is intended to improve the functionality of the Cardano network, and Binance’s support demonstrates its commitment to providing an optimal user experience. Users are recommended to prepare for temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals and keep an eye on for further updates.

The new hard fork allows anyone who holds ADA to contribute to the network’s decision-making. The Plomin hard fork is meant to turn the Cardano blockchain into a fully decentralized governance model where ADA holders can either vote directly or allow another person, known as a delegated representative (DRep), to vote in their place. This upgrade is named after the late Matthew Plomin , who was the CEO of USDM, Cardano’s stablecoin.

It will also help ensure that Cardano is set for smoother upgrades in the future. Just four days prior, on Jan. 24, Cradano launched the Fineqia FTSE Cardano Enhanced Yield ETN at the Vienna Stock Exchange. This exchange-traded note, which is listed with the ticker YADA, allows investors to get indirect exposure to ADA’s price movements while generating yield from the use of the ADA across different yield-bearing DeFi protocols. With the introduction of this ETN, more traditional investors now have an accessible way to participate in Cardano’s ecosystem and the broader DeFi market without directly engaging with blockchain technology.

Check out some of the possible factors that may have fueled the pump. What’s Driving the Surge? Ripple’s native token took a major blow on January 27, with its price dropping from over $3.10 to below $2.80 in a matter of hours. The downturn was most likely caused by the overall market crash, which negatively affected countless overleveraged traders. Today, though, the landscape looks quite different, with many of the leading cryptocurrencies charting substantial gains. XRP is among the top performers, with its valuation rising by approximately 12% on a 24-hour scale and currently trading at around $3.11 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko The market’s resurgence is not the only factor potentially fueling the asset’s rally. Another important reason could be Ripple’s latest expansion move on US soil. The company secured key Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in New York and Texas. Such permits allow Ripple to access a licensed version of the cross-border payments solution in America, where transactions are managed end-to-end by the firm on behalf of the customer. Commenting on the matter was Joanie Xie, Managing Director of North America at Ripple: “We’re continuing to see more interest from financial institutions to crypto businesses that want to unlock the benefits of crypto and blockchain for faster, cost-efficient and 24/7 cross-border payments. With years of experience working in both crypto and with financial institutions, Ripple is well-positioned to support companies who are ready to take advantage of the current landscape .” Last but not least, we should mention the whale activity. According to the popular X user Ali Martinez, such large investors have purchased 120 million XRP (worth more than $370 million at current rates) during the recent price dip. Those actions reduce the token’s circulating supply and could trigger a rally (assuming demand heads north or keeps steady). The whales’ buying spree may also encourage smaller players to hop on the bandwagon, thus injecting fresh capital into the ecosystem. Bonus: XRP Exchange Reserve The amount of XRP coins stored on cryptocurrency exchanges is also worth noting . While the figure registered a substantial spike in mid-January, over the past few weeks it has been on a downfall . This could be interpreted as a bullish sign, suggesting a possible shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods and, hence, reduced immediate selling pressure.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has won a major victory, setting a legal precedent in the fight against crypto-related tax fraud. In December 2024, Frank Richard Ahlgren III was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $1.1 million for evading taxes on his crypto sales. In a Jan. 27 blog post , blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said the ruling marks the first time the tax watchdog has secured a conviction for tax fraud solely involving digital assets. “Beyond the IRS, the case also represents a significant win for the Department of Justice and justice ministries worldwide.” Chainalysis The case is tied to Ahlgren buying a $4 million house in Park City, Utah, using profits from his Bitcoin ( BTC ) sales. The New York-headquartered firm says Ahlgren’s methods were pretty elaborate: he sold millions in BTC using tools like CoinJoin mixers, Wasabi Wallet, peer-to-peer services, and even structured cash deposits to hide earnings. He also adjusted his tax filings to show a lower value for his crypto. You might also like: Detroit to accept crypto payments for taxes and city fees The history of Ahlgren’s on-chain activity vs Bitcoin price | Source: Chainalysis However, investigators still tracked down Ahlgren’s crypto transactions across multiple wallets and exchanges. Per Chainalysis, his wealth came from a 2015 purchase when he bought 1,366 BTC for about $676,170. “Although Ahlgren thwarted the authorities for a time from performing some calculations, his conviction and sentencing illustrate how on-chain tax evasion is traceable and has real-world consequences.” Chainalysis Meanwhile, Senator Ted Cruz from Texas is getting ready to challenge a new IRS crypto rule using the Congressional Review Act. The rule forces decentralized crypto exchanges to collect customer info, like names and addresses, and send tax forms to users. As crypto.news reported earlier , Cruz, along with Senators Cynthia Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Tim Sheehy, is pushing to repeal what Republicans call the “midnight rules” of the Biden administration. These regulations were finalized late last year, and the CRA gives Congress until mid-May to overturn them. The CRA allows resolutions to bypass Senate filibusters, needing only majority votes in both chambers to pass.

The most notable of these are Trump's own token TRUMP and Dogecoin (DOGE), while Tuttle Capital Management has recently filed 10 new cryptocurrency ETF applications with the SEC. Accordingly, Tuttle Capital Solana has applied for 10 leveraged crypto ETFs, including XRP and TRUMP and BONK. These ETFs could offer investors new opportunities to increase their exposure to popular cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, while also offering the first ETF products for Cardano, Polkadot, and lesser-known altcoins like TRUMP and BONK. The altcoins referenced are: XRP, Solana (SOL), TRUMP, Litecoin (LTC), MELANIA, BONK, BNP, Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK) and Polkadot (DOT). As you may recall, last week, for the first time, ETF applications were made for TRUMP, BONK and Dogecoin. Related News: JUST IN! Spot ETF Application Filed for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Two Surprise Altcoins in the US! Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said: “Tuttle Capital has filed for 10 different leveraged cryptocurrency ETFs, including a bunch of memecoins and altcoins that don’t yet have ETPs. This is the first US ETP application for Chainlink, Cardano, Polkadot, BNP and… Melania. “To be very clear here. This is a situation where issuers are testing the limits of what the SEC will allow. I expect the new crypto task force (led by Hester Peirce) to probably play a key role in deciding what will and will not be allowed.” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the Tuttle Capital applications were unusual. Balchunas noted that the ETFs were filed under the 1940 Act and therefore could open for trading in April if the SEC does not reject them: “The 2x Melanie ETF was filed before the 1x Melania ETF. This is unusual. There were also initial filings for Chainlink, Cardano, Polkadot, BNP. Also keep in mind that these applications are covered by the 1940 statute, so in theory, it depends on what the SEC decides in April. They could be out and about in business in April. “It will be interesting to see where the SEC draws the line and why. It's been a week since the DOGE and TRUMP filings and they haven't retracted.

Canadian Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining giant HIVE Digital is set to acquire Bitfarms ‘ 200 MW hydro-powered mining site in Paraguay, boosting its mining power to 25 EH/s by September. The power pump represents more than a 400% increase from its current capacity of 6 EH/s, HIVE revealed in a Jan. 28 press release . The facility, called Yguazú, will be developed in two phases. The first phase — which is already 80% complete — is set to go live by Q2, adding 6 EH/s, while the second one — expected by August — will contribute another 6.5 EH/s using Bitmain S21+ hydro-cooled ASICs. “HIVE’s enhanced operational capacity in Paraguay will total 300 MW upon completion of this acquisition, bringing its global capacity, including existing facilities in Canada and Sweden, to 430 MW by Q3 2025.” HIVE Digital You might also like: HIVE Digital acquires 6500 ASIC miners, starts Paraguay facility construction The $56 million deal includes a large power station and all its infrastructure. Per the press release, HIVE will pay $25 million upfront, with the rest paid over the period of six months. The project will be funded using HIVE’s cash and crypto holdings. HIVE will also cover $19 million in deposits and construction costs to finish the site. With the acquisition, HIVE doubles down on its plan to achieve 3% of the global Bitcoin mining network, said HIVE’s executive chairman Frank Holmes. Amid the news, HIVE shares rose 5% in pre-market trading, just the next day after a 10% drop, which was part of a broader sell-off among Bitcoin mining firms. The decline was reportedly linked to market concerns over rumors about an advanced AI startup emerging in China.

The average gain for the second month of the year is 15.6%. Moreover, only two Februaries over the past twelve years have been months of decline, namely in 2014 and 2020. The asset remained flat in February 2018 and 2023, both bear market years. February 2013 saw the largest gain, with a 62% surge over the month, while the second-highest was in 2024, when BTC surged by 43.5%, climbing from $42,580 to $62,560. A Bullish Bitcoin February February 2016, 2017, and 2021 were also bullish for BTC prices, with gains of 20% to 37%. Additionally, 2025 is a post-halving year, and these have all seen positive price action in February. If BTC manages to scrape just the average performance from the past twelve years next month, it could reach a minimum of $118,000. Source: Coinglass The month of March has also historically been good for Bitcoin prices, especially in recent years, with gains in five out of six months since 2019. However, January has not been so productive for the largest cryptocurrency, with a roughly even split between gains and losses for the month historically. The asset is up around 8.5% so far this month, currently trading around $103,000 following a dip to $98,000 on Monday. This is higher than its January average of 3.7%. Ethereum Gains in February February has been even better for Ethereum prices, historically, with an average increase of 17% since 2017. For the past six consecutive years, ETH has jumped in February, the largest gain coming in 2024 when it climbed over 46% from $2,280 to end the month at $3,380. March has also been favorable for ETH, but this January is shaping up to be the fourth one to see a decline. Ethereum has fallen more than 5% since the beginning of the month and is currently trading at around $3,200. If it can match the average performance from the previous Februaries, ETH prices could climb to $3,750, but this would still leave it within the range-bound channel where it has been stuck for the past six weeks. A repeat of performance in February 2024 could see ETH surge to $4,700, however.

Announced on January 27 by the Department of Justice, the settlement requires KuCoin to forfeit $184.5 million and pay an additional $112.9 million fine, bringing the total penalty to nearly $300 million. As part of the agreement, KuCoin’s founders, Michael Gan and Eric Tang, will step down from all operational roles and forfeit $2.7 million. The company has also agreed to withdraw from the U.S. market for two years while undergoing compliance improvements. KuCoin Fails to Comply KYC Measures KuCoin faced accusations of lacking basic compliance measures, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, which are critical to preventing illicit activities like money laundering. Until July of last year, KuCoin reportedly did not require customer identity verification, a practice openly acknowledged by employees on social media. The Justice Department highlighted that KuCoin also failed to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a legal requirement for financial service providers in the United States. In response to the settlement, Michael Gan stated the constructive nature of the resolution and maintained that neither he nor Tang had engaged in fraudulent or criminal behavior. KuCoin’s Chief Legal Officer BC Wong will assume the role of CEO as the company seeks to stabilize its global operations. Effects in the Crypto Industry Despite the U.S. exit, KuCoin assured users in other markets that its services remain unaffected and that the exchange has strengthened its security and compliance framework. KuCoin’s settlement follows a similar regulatory crackdown on BitMEX earlier this month, which was ordered to pay $100 million for non-compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations. The regulatory scrutiny of crypto exchanges continues to escalate, with U.S. regulators reportedly collecting over $19 billion from legal settlements involving crypto firms as of October last year.

He pointed out on January 27, via X, that “$766.45 million in short positions will be liquidated if Dogecoin DOGE rebounds to $0.35,” implying that bearish traders stand on precariously thin ice. Massive Dogecoin Short Squeeze Incoming? A look at the up-to-date liquidation heatmap from Coinglass shows hefty short positions clustered between roughly $0.339755 and $0.34368. Coinglass data shows $464.8 million at $0.339755, $534.79 million at $0.34054, $503.97 million at $0.341325, $433.04 million at $0.34211, and $325.29 million at $0.34368, bringing the total to around $2.26 billion in potential forced liquidations. That figure underscores the magnitude of a possible short squeeze should DOGE climb above that tight range. Coinglass describes its heatmap as a way “to predict where liquidation levels are likely to initiate,” and has also underscored that “liquidations play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market” because they can influence rapid price swings when traders with large leveraged positions are forced to close out. Related Reading: Ready To Rocket? Dogecoin Chart Hints At Major Gains Ahead Coinglass emphasizes the value of understanding “high liquidity areas,” since they can serve as magnet zones where big players, sometimes referred to as whales, seize the opportunity to execute sizable trades. Traders often jump on liquidation clusters at advantageous prices, which then paves the way for sharp reversals. In the case of Dogecoin, that magnet zone is now sitting just below $0.35. Martinez’s analysis of DOGE aligns with the broader technical picture, which suggests the token may be at a make-or-break juncture. Since December 8, when Dogecoin briefly surged to $0.4834, the price action has been defined by a descending trendline. Although DOGE broke above this line on January 15, 2025—indicating a potential bullish shift—broader market volatility on January 26 quickly dragged it back below. The result is a scenario in which the descending line, now around $0.335 to $0.34, stands as a formidable barrier. A successful breach of that zone could be pivotal, especially given the sheer concentration of shorts that Coinglass has identified just above it. Should DOGE rally enough to pierce that level, traders holding short positions may be forced to cover quickly, and that wave of buying pressure can rapidly accelerate an upward move. Related Reading: Think Dogecoin Has Topped Out? Two Factors That Say ‘No Way’ Meanwhile, DOGE remains above the crucial 0.382 Fibonacci retracement near $0.313, a support level that prevented further downside during the latest market sell-off. The next technical support lies deeper on the chart, near $0.212 (0.236 Fibonacci retracement), where traders will be watching closely for any sign of weakening momentum. On the upside, the 0.5 retracement at $0.394 remains a key pivot. A sustained recovery above that threshold might spark greater bullish confidence, with potential resistance emerging again around the 0.476 to 0.592 region if Dogecoin can regain enough force.

The firm's diversified financial services, including margin lending and structured products, amplify returns. Despite a net loss, Galaxy's strong liquidity position, asset management business, and diversification provide stability amid crypto market volatility. There are volatility risks associated with its leverage strategy and as traditional financial institutions proposing crypto products. Still, increasing institutional interest in crypto and higher liquidity, thanks to the possibility of being listed on the Nasdaq, are positives for investor sentiment. Since I last covered Galaxy Digital Holdings ( BRPHF ) in July last year, it has risen by over 90%. At that time, I had a Hold position because of short-term volatility, and from $13.74, the stock indeed dropped to $8.30 by August before subsequently appreciating. Moreover, it outperformed Bitcoin by more than 125% last year, largely helped by the November 5 election, as charted below. Data by YCharts This may be because of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment likely to encourage wider institutional BTC adoption, leading to better revenues for this diversified financial services firm with investments in Bitcoin mining. Also, a potential Nasdaq listing could greatly improve its visibility. Thus, after highlighting the risks, this thesis aims to paint a bullish case due to Galaxy's leveraged exposure to crypto gains leading to a multiplier effect on the stock price. Highlighting its Leveraged Exposure to Bitcoin's Gains It offers leveraged products as part of its Global Markets business. These include collateralized loans, which allow clients to borrow against their digital assets, including Bitcoin. This enables Galaxy's clients to leverage their holdings for additional capital without needing to sell their assets for dollars. Additionally, Galaxy offers structured products that combine loans with derivative risk management solutions for leveraged exposure to Bitcoin while managing associated risks. Also, by providing customized debt capital financing secured by BTC miner treasuries and infrastructure assets, Galaxy indirectly increases its exposure to Bitcoin. The counterparty trading business generated $54 million in sales in the third quarter of 2023 (Q3), a 117% increase quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by higher derivatives volumes and increased lending activity. This was achieved despite a slowdown in trading volumes broadly caused by BTC prices decreasing by 7% in Q3 compared to Q2. Company presentation (s201.q4cdn.com) Looking at the fourth quarter, BTC has now surged to over $100K, suggesting better trading revenues. Continuing on a positive note, with a loan book size of $863 million, Galaxy's leverage with a debt-to-equity ratio of around 0.4x (863M/2.1B) appears manageable given its equity capital was $2.1 billion at the end of Q3. Moreover, given its total liquid assets were $1.5 billion, the loan book coverage comes to around 1.7x ($1.5B/$863M). This signifies that even with leverage, Galaxy's liquid assets provide a strong cushion as long as BTC prices hold up. Moreover, similarly to leveraged stocks like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), Galaxy has experienced amplified returns compared to its underlying asset during bullish market conditions as shown in blue below, namely during 2021. Data by YCharts However, the above deep blue chart also exhibits a high degree of volatility. Faces Volatility Risks Because of Exposure to Leverage and Mining Shifting to caution, only $475 million of the liquid assets consist of cash and stablecoins with most tied to net digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) which are volatile. This implies that in a crypto market downturn, these assets could lose value, reducing liquidity and increasing the relative size of its loan book. Additionally, this is a non-profitable company, with a net loss of $54 million reported in Q3. This is partly explained by its mining business bearing the brunt of increasing mining difficulty, while rewards plummeted by 50% following April's halving event. As a result, its total mining revenue decreased by $5.6 million sequentially, while the average marginal cost to mine increased by $15.5K to $38K per Bitcoin. Company presentation (investor.galaxy.com) Thus, while its stock benefits both from its leveraged exposure to BTC and as a miner when asset prices go up, this double exposure may entail a high degree of stock volatility if the crypto market were to suffer from a plunge. This was the case in 2022 when the Fed raised rates aggressively as shown in the above chart. Consequently, depending on the amount of loans tied to floating rates, monetary policy staying higher for longer means interest expenses are not likely to decline. This may be the reason why it suffered from more volatility than Bitcoin or the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ( QQQ ) around December 19 (as highlighted in brown) when the Fed proceeded to a hawkish cut, or reduced rates by 25 basis points while signaling that further cuts may take longer than the market expected. www.seekingalpha.com Still, I believe the asset management business plays a stabilizer role and there is also diversification into AI. The Stabilizer Role of the Asset Management Business and Diversification This business grew by only 2% QoQ in Q3 with $4.6 billion in AUM as shown below with $250 million inflows, a result of lower asset prices compared to Q2, but growth could receive an acceleration in Q4 thanks to increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrency investment products following Bitcoin's recent rally. Thus, the firm is likely to earn substantial performance fees in case of strong demand for its passive and active ETFs, as its managed funds become attractive vehicles for investors seeking exposure to digital assets without direct ownership risks. Company presentation (s201.q4cdn.com) Thinking aloud, by providing a relatively stable revenue stream compared to the more volatile trading and mining segments, the asset management business could help absorb the adverse impact of Bitcoin price fluctuations on the company's financial results. Moreover, Galaxy has strategically positioned itself in HPC infrastructure and the firm's initiatives to integrate AI technologies have enhanced its service offerings and could receive a boost from the new administration deregulating AI , or making it easier for businesses to invest and develop super smart apps. Thus, as a result of its diversified revenue streams and ability to attract a broader client base, investor confidence has been boosted, contributing to the stock's robust performance. Looking forward, with the positive market sentiment around regulatory developments, there is likely to be a "" crypto renaissance"" . More Crypto-Friendly Regulators may accelerate the transition to the Nasdaq Thus, after the election of the crypto-friendly President, the landscape of the industry is rapidly evolving, particularly in light of anticipated regulatory changes, especially at the SEC (Security and Exchange Commission). Furthermore, the new administration is moving fast as evidenced by the repeal of the Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) which has hindered FIs (financial institutions) from entering the crypto space. Instead, the U.S. regulator has introduced SAB 122, which allows FIs to manage clients’ crypto holdings. This could facilitate broader participation from established banks and could unleash a wave of institutional investment in cryptocurrencies because with more traditional players entering the market, there is an expectation that substantial capital will flow into the industry. Ultimately, this inflow could drive up prices by fostering innovation, namely creating new crypto-based products to attract both retail and institutional investors. For Galaxy, a better regulatory environment also increases the likelihood of being listed on the Nasdaq. For investors, in addition to a lawsuit filed against it by BitGo on claims of wrongfully terminating a merger agreement between the two in 2022, Galaxy’s listing was also delayed by the crypto regulatory environment in the U.S. being more stringent than in Canada. Things are now different as the complaint was subsequently dismissed by a court and regulatory hurdles are being removed as part of a strategy to turn America into the "" crypto capital of the planet"". To this end, a potential listing on the NASDAQ will provide Galaxy access to a broader pool of investors in the United States, where interest in crypto is high . Moreover, the Nasdaq is one of the world’s most liquid markets, offering higher trading volumes, implying better market efficiency, and potentially attracting more traders. Company presentation (s201.q4cdn.com) Also, it should enhance Galaxy’s visibility and credibility among international investors, synonymous with a higher valuation multiple. Now, since I last covered the stock, the share price has increased by 100% while its forward price-to-sales ratio increased by 125%, or from 2x to 4.5x . This is higher than the median for the financial sector of 2.98x, indicating strong market confidence. Even then, it deserves better considering a potential alignment with peers trading on U.S. exchanges, like Coinbase ( COIN ) which boasts a forward P/S of 12.55x . Deserves Better Despite Competitive Risks Therefore, assuming a re-rating to a forward P/S of 5.5x, or an increase of 22% to narrow the gap with its U.S.-listed peer leads to a target of $27.67 (22.68 x 1.22) based on the current share price of $22.68. To justify this bullish case, dollar-backed stablecoins which formed $203 million of its liquidity at the end of Q3 as shown below received a boost from President Trump's recent executive order. The aim seems to promote the development and growth of stablecoins, possibly encouraging their use as reliable alternatives for payments and money transfers. investor.galaxy.com Moreover, in addition to its diversified revenue streams (asset management and trading), Galaxy operates both as an HPC infrastructure play and a Bitcoin miner, somewhat similar to Core Scientific ( CORZ ) whose forward P/S is 8.74x , which means that with a targeted P/S of 5.5x, I am moderately bullish for Galaxy. The reason is there are risks. First, the company must grow its operating segments strongly to justify higher multiples, but the problem is its strategy to partner with other companies may face challenges as, encouraged by more crypto-friendly regulations, FIs like banks may get more involved in the digital asset marketplace, undermining Galaxy's ability to keep its moat. To address this challenge, it may need to spend more marketing dollars to maintain its competitive edge, thereby impacting profits. This may be why the stock dived by more than 5% after President Trump's executive order called for a working group to make policy recommendations on digital assets to his administration on January 24. www.seekingalpha.com Therefore, trading activities could suffer as less stringent regulations encourage the emergence of new competitors, but with crypto potentially being adopted more widely, its asset management business should benefit. Also, its cost to mine of $38K per BTC remains much lower than the market average of $49.5K , auguring well for the profitability of the mining business. Finally, while there are volatility risks relating to its uses of leverage, the ingredients are present for this diversified FI to continue outperforming Bitcoin as it manages to get listed on the Nasdaq.",COIN|BRPHF|GLXY:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-28 09:31:03

How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Robots on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Robots by entering its contract address (CA) – 9yuANCwHs443YpCDnUr2GfSkDSTxUweQL1m2vMaYnTT5 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 09:36:00

Just a day after his inauguration, he signed an Executive Order titled Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Finance Technology, aiming to boost the growth of digital assets and blockchain technology. This move is part of a broader strategy, which includes three key executive orders focused on cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and advancing technology. China’s DeepSeek is a new AI threat and Trump is in no mood to lose the booming AI sector with his executive orders largely based on the AI sector showing his commitment towards innovation and technology. In his first week in office, President Trump signed three Executive Orders relevant to AI and Crypto: REMOVING BARRIERS TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE https://t.co/Owix5lQAiO STRENGTHENING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP⁰IN DIGITAL FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) January 27, 2025 A Clear Focus on Crypto Trump’s Executive Order highlights the importance of digital assets in driving innovation and economic growth. It sets out several key priorities: Supporting blockchain networks, mining activities, and self-custody of digital assets. Strengthening the global position of the U.S. dollar by promoting stablecoins. Providing clear and fair regulations for the crypto industry, with well-defined rules for oversight. In a major shift, Trump also revoked former President Biden’s 2022 crypto-related Executive Order, directing the Treasury Department to update its policies to align with the new market demands. The New Crypto Task Force To turn these plans into action, Trump established the President’s Working Group of Digital Asset Markets. This task force will be led by Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks, known as the “Crypto Czar,” with Bo Hines serving as Executive Director. The group includes top officials from the Treasury, SEC, CFTC, and Homeland Security, who will work together to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The newly formed Working Group on Digital Asset Markets is moving quickly to overhaul U.S. crypto regulations. By February 22, 2025, agencies like the Treasury, DOJ, and SEC must identify all existing crypto-related rules, guidance, and orders to evaluate what the federal government has done so far. By March 24, 2025, these agencies will recommend whether to keep, modify, or scrap these regulations. By July 22, 2025, the Working Group will present a comprehensive report proposing a federal framework for digital assets. This will include rules for stablecoins, market structure, consumer protection, and risk management. The group will also evaluate creating a national digital asset stockpile using lawfully seized cryptocurrencies, though no immediate plans for a Bitcoin reserve are mentioned. Trump’s Executive Order also bans federal agencies from creating or promoting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), reflecting the administration’s stance that CBDCs threaten personal liberty. What It Means for Crypto Trump’s pro-crypto stance signals a major shift in U.S. policy. Trump’s administration is making bold moves to fulfill campaign promises, including firing Gary Gensler, ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0, and defending self-custody. With clear deadlines and a focus on innovation, the new policies aim to position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-28 09:37:46

OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is quickly emerging as a standout, providing investors with the chance to turn a modest investment into substantial returns. With its innovative approach, strong presale performance, and exclusivity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is setting a new standard in the crypto space. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Stands Out Explosive Presale Success: OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM has already demonstrated its potential by raising over $1 million in mere minutes during its presale. This level of interest and confidence from investors highlights the coin’s appeal and positions it as a formidable competitor against more established cryptocurrencies. Exclusivity Drives Value:Unlike Bitcoin or Solana, which are available on numerous exchanges, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM can only be purchased through its dedicated platform. This exclusivity not only creates a sense of urgency but also helps maintain the token’s scarcity, increasing its potential for high returns. How OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Compares to Others Bitcoin (BTC):The market leader, known for its stability and established presence, but with limited potential for the explosive growth seen in newer tokens like OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM. Solana (SOL):A high-performing blockchain platform, but its widespread availability on major exchanges dilutes the exclusivity that drives significant price spikes. Ethereum (ETH):A cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, offering stability but not the rapid returns of emerging coins like OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM. The Time to Act is Now OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM has already proven its potential through its record-breaking presale. Investors who seize this opportunity early stand to benefit as demand continues to rise and the token supply shrinks. With a focus on exclusivity, scarcity, and growth, this platform could very well redefine what’s possible in cryptocurrency investments.

However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly gaining momentum, leaving the established tokens in its wake. With investors flocking to OFFICIALMAGACOIN , this new crypto is proving to be the ultimate opportunity for turning $500 into $500K. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Talk of the Market 1. Proven Investor Demand In its record-breaking presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised $1 million in minutes. This overwhelming response is a testament to its appeal and potential, putting it in a league of its own compared to slower-growing assets like SOL and INJ. 2. Exclusive Availability Ensures Early Growth Unlike BTC and SOL, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM. This focused distribution strategy has created a sense of urgency, giving early investors an edge as prices rise. 3. Momentum Backed by Scarcity As the token supply shrinks and demand rises, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is proving to be a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Investors are capitalizing on this momentum to secure their share before the market fully catches on. How It Stacks Up Against Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): The market leader, but its mature position makes 500K returns unlikely compared to early-stage tokens like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Solana (SOL): A strong contender in scalability but lacks the exclusivity and explosive growth potential of this new token. Injective Protocol (INJ): A promising DeFi solution, but it hasn’t generated the same investor excitement or presale success. Act Now Before It’s Too Late With its record-breaking presale, limited availability, and increasing momentum, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is delivering results that other tokens simply can’t match.

The total crypto market cap gained over 3 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $3.67 trillion on Tuesday, January 28, during the mid-European trading session. With the leveraged crypto market having cooled down in the past few days, Ethereum price led the wider altcoin industry in a relief rally. According to the latest market data, ETH price gained over 4 percent in the last 24 hours to trade at about $3,203 at the time of this writing. Ethereum Whales Not Fully Convinced The Ethereum network has experienced major ups and downs regarding the demand from whale investors. The approval of spot ETH ETFs in the United States played a significant role in the mainstream adoption of Ether. After registering an impressive cash inflow in mid-December 2024, the US spot Ether ETFs have experienced lower demand in the recent past. Apart from BlackRock’s ETHA, which registered a net cash inflow of about $20.6 million, the rest of the US spot Ether ETFs registered either net cash outflow or zero flow on Monday. Meanwhile, on-chain data analysis provided by Glassnode shows that 13 mega whales, each holding over 10,000 ETH, joined the network during the past 24 hours. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Donald Trump’s Pro Crypto Executive Orders: A New Dawn for U.S. Digital Asset Policy , All Is Not Lost The Ethereum core developers, led by co-founder vitalik buterin vitalik buterin Vitalik Buterin is a professional programmer and Co-Founder of Ethereum.

Moreover, Ethereum’s DeFi space has the leading total value locked (TVL) of about $63 billion and a stablecoins market cap of over $116 billion in the layer one ecosystem.

Furthermore, several changes will be effected for validators, such as Lido DAO (LDO), through increasing the base staked ETH units. Midterm Expectations for ETH Price According to a popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen , Ethereum’s price is likely to drop below $3k to retest the support level above $2,300 before kickstarting the next major bullish leg. Ahead of the first Federal Reserve Interest Rate decision for 2025, Cowen highlighted that the ETH/BTC pair is likely to bottom if Quantitative Easing (QE) begins. However, the short-term bearish sentiment for Ether price could be invalidated if the altcoin successfully closes above the resistance range between $3,870 and $4k. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The project’s innovative token burn mechanism creates a deflationary environment, enhancing scarcity and driving long-term value. With the current price sitting at just $0.000038, Arctic Pablo is in its El-Dorado phase, offering investors an incredible opportunity to get in at a low entry point before prices increase further. The project has already raised over $500,000, and with its unique approach, Arctic Pablo (APC) is quickly becoming one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. Meanwhile, ChillGuy has seen a massive 50% surge, driven by viral meme culture and increasing interest in its token. Social media platforms like TikTok and Twitter have been buzzing, making it one of the most talked-about meme coins. On the other hand, SPX6900 has surged by an eye-popping 49,447% over the past year, climbing ahead of major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although its massive growth is attracting attention, SPX6900 lacks real-world value, relying solely on speculative trading. Despite this, its explosive momentum cannot be ignored, placing it alongside Arctic Pablo and ChillGuy as some of the most talked-about tokens today. Arctic Pablo’s Token Burn Mechanism: Boosting Scarcity and Value Arctic Pablo (APC) has introduced a groundbreaking token burn mechanism that adds significant value to its project. This unique feature ensures that unsold tokens from each presale phase are permanently eliminated, creating scarcity and increasing the potential for higher value. As Arctic Pablo progresses through various stages, the tokens left unsold will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment. This innovative approach not only enhances the project’s sustainability but also bolsters investor confidence by ensuring long-term value. With token burn transactions recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo’s burn mechanism is set to fuel its value in the coming months. If you’re looking for the best new meme coin to invest in for the short term , this deflationary strategy is a game-changer. By limiting the token supply, Arctic Pablo is creating an ideal environment for price appreciation. As the burn process continues and fewer tokens are available, the value of each token is expected to rise. Early investors can expect significant returns as the presale progresses. Don’t miss out on this unique opportunity to be part of a meme coin that redefines market scarcity! Arctic Pablo’s Presale: Grab Your Tokens Before It’s Too Late The Arctic Pablo presale has been unlike any other. Instead of the typical presale stages, the project has taken a creative approach by linking each phase to a new location on its adventurous journey. Currently, Arctic Pablo is in its fifth phase, exploring the mythical land of Snowy Shores. This phase sold out in under four days, showcasing the project’s growing demand and excitement. The price of $0.000038 is an incredible entry point, and with the presale progressing, early investors have a rare opportunity to secure tokens before the price hits $0.0008 in its final phase. With over $500,000 already raised and the project on track to raise even more, Arctic Pablo is generating excitement and proving to be one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term. The projected ROI of over 20,918% from the sixth phase to launch price makes this presale one to watch closely. As the project moves forward, the price of APC tokens will increase with each new location, so securing your investment at this early stage is critical for maximizing returns. Get in now while the price is still at $0.000038 and enjoy the adventure as Arctic Pablo’s journey unfolds. ChillGuy’s Viral Meme Surge and Market Momentum The “Chill Guy” meme has taken over platforms like TikTok and Twitter, gaining traction among meme enthusiasts and investors alike. This viral meme culture has translated into a surge in interest for the associated cryptocurrency, CHILLGUY. As the meme gains popularity, the token has experienced increased trading volumes, reflecting a positive shift in market sentiment. In addition, CHILLGUY’s recent listing on major exchanges like MEXC and KuCoin has made it more accessible to a broader audience, fueling its 50% price surge. While the price appreciation is impressive, it’s important to approach this cryptocurrency with caution, as meme coins are known for their volatility and reliance on short-lived trends. Despite this, the increased market engagement surrounding ChillGuy shows its potential for quick gains, but investors should proceed with research and risk management in mind. SPX6900: A Meme Coin with Unbelievable Growth SPX6900 has made an impressive mark on the meme coin scene, boasting a jaw-dropping 49,447% surge over the past year. This remarkable growth has left even heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum behind, attracting attention from traders and speculators. In the last month alone, SPX6900 has risen by 120.66%, showing strong momentum and a solid track record of positive trading days. However, SPX6900’s massive growth comes with a caveat. The coin lacks real-world utility and is primarily driven by hype and speculation. Despite its success in the market, it doesn’t have the infrastructure or a roadmap like more established projects, which means it remains a high-risk investment. While its rapid gains may seem appealing, it’s important for investors to carefully assess the potential risks before diving in. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Leads the Charge in Meme Coin Innovation Arctic Pablo , with its exciting presale, innovative token burn mechanism, and unique journey, stands out as the best new meme coin to invest in for short-term growth. While ChillGuy’s viral meme surge and SPX6900’s impressive rise have made waves, Arctic Pablo’s creative approach to scarcity and community engagement is setting it apart. The presale has already raised significant funds, and with the potential for massive ROI, now is the perfect time to get involved. Don’t miss out on Arctic Pablo’s journey to new heights, and secure your tokens before the price rises further. Stay ahead of the curve by investing in Arctic Pablo now, and watch as it continues to captivate the meme coin community and deliver exceptional returns.

Jupiter (JUP): Solana’s Decentralized Exchange Aggregator and Governance Token Jupiter (JUP) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator within the Solana ecosystem. It compiles liquidity pools from various DEXs to offer users optimal prices for token swaps, enhancing efficiency and reducing slippage. Jupiter has expanded its services to include perpetual futures trading, decentralized stablecoin management, and the LFG launchpad, which supports new projects on Solana. JUP is the native governance token of the Jupiter network. Holders can stake or lock their tokens to participate in governance decisions, such as liquidity planning and token issuance, while earning yield. By addressing price discrepancies across different DEXs, Jupiter aims to improve the decentralized finance (DeFi) experience on Solana. The potential of Jupiter’s technology lies in its ability to streamline DeFi operations through enhanced liquidity and pricing. Individuals interested in the Solana ecosystem may consider Jupiter’s functionalities when evaluating JUP’s prospects in the current market cycle. Dogecoin: From Internet Meme to Cryptocurrency Phenomenon Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 as a fun alternative to more traditional digital currencies. It features the Shiba Inu dog from a popular internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum limit and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a light-hearted project, Dogecoin quickly gained a following due to its friendly image and approachable community. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged, placing it among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with a total value exceeding $50 billion. This rise was fueled by social media activity and interest from public figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s technology is based on Litecoin and uses a proof-of-work system for mining. Its widespread recognition and active community contribute to its ongoing presence in the cryptocurrency market. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to attract attention due to its unique origins and the influence of its supporters within the crypto community. Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, enabling the development of decentralized finance applications, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano distinguishes itself through its environmentally sustainable approach, utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism for energy efficiency, in contrast to the energy-intensive proof-of-work model. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to 1 million transactions per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. Considering its scalability, sustainability, and advanced technology, Cardano has potential in the cryptocurrency market. In the current market cycle, its focus on energy efficiency and high transaction speeds may appeal to users and developers. Solana (SOL): A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. It distinguishes itself with architectural choices aimed at faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Unlike some platforms, Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions, relying instead on its high-capacity network to handle scalability. The SOL coin holds value as it underpins the operation of the Solana ecosystem, enabling users to access a suite of projects on the platform. By rewarding network supporters, it incentivizes participation and development within the network. Solana’s approach aims to attract developers and investors interested in high-activity products and services. The attractiveness of the coin in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market conditions, technological developments, and adoption rates within the blockchain community. Conclusion JUP, DOGE, ADA, and SOL remain strong, but XYZVerse (XYZ) leads as the pioneering all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and aiming for significant growth through community-driven efforts.

This time, though, it fell below $100,000 and dropped to a multi-week low of under $98,000, leaving millions in liquidations . Nevertheless, the bulls stepped up once again and helped the asset recover a big portion of its losses. Earlier today, BTC jumped to $103,000, but it is now slightly below that level.

Former BOJ policymaker Sakurai believes the central bank may ultimately target a 1.5% rate, reflecting Japan’s robust economic growth and steady inflation prospects. BOJ Eyes 1.5% Rate Hikes The Bank of Japan recently raised short-term interest rates to 0.5%, marking the highest level in 17 years. This move shows the central bank’s confidence in Japan’s growing economy, rising wages, and steady inflation, which support its plan to normalize monetary policy. However, a recent survey conducted by the poll of 45 experts found that 56% expect the next rate hike, likely to 0.75%, in July. September was the second choice, with 18% predicting it, while 9% believe it could happen as early as June. Some economists even speculate that the BOJ might raise rates to 1.5% within the next two years. Mixed Reactions on BOJ’s Hike Governor Kazuo Ueda, who has led three rate hikes since taking office, is expected to proceed cautiously to avoid market disruptions. Analysts believe that Japan’s strong economy, stable price growth, and broader wage increases give the central bank room to gradually raise rates. However, opinions on the BOJ’s communication strategy remain divided. While 23% of analysts appreciated its transparency before the January meeting, 32% felt its messaging could have been clearer. What Next? The BOJ’s next policy meetings in March and April will provide further insights into its plans. With inflation and growth remaining on track, a rate hike to 0.75% by mid-year seems likely, setting the stage for an eventual rise to 1.5%. For now, the BOJ is taking a cautious but firm approach to unwinding its long-standing easy monetary policies.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-28 09:53:21

Word that the AI model built by Chinese startup DeepSeek is superior to its American counterparts has made the US markets and AI industry see red. Not only is DeepSeek the most resource-efficient AI model the world has seen, but it outperforms the likes of ChatGPT 4o, Claude, and Llama. And that isn’t even the most scary part. DeepSeek offers superior results at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. While OpenAI has been raising $18B with the goal of plowing it into massive data centers and other infrastructure, DeepSeek has built a super-efficient model for a mere $5.5M. This single move has shattered the myth that AI is a capital-intensive domain reserved for the big players. AI Tokens Take a Tumble Investors are worried that DeepSeek’s cost-effective model could disrupt the current AI landscape, leading to increased competitive pressure on established players. This has resulted in a negative sentiment towards tech stocks and cryptos, particularly those heavily invested in AI. As a case in point, AI leader Nvidia was the worst-hit company on NASDAQ yesterday. Its shares fell by 17%, the worst one-day fall to date. This wiped off $593B in the company’s market cap, the highest capitalization loss ever for a Wall Street company. AI crypto tokens also experienced the impact of the DeepSeek saga. The AI category on Coingecko is down 6% in the last 24 hours, with AI agent coins losing 11% and AI agent launchpads losing 24.6%. After a hit like this, it’s going to take some real self-reflection to get the AI agent market back on track. Moving ahead, it’s possible that only tokens with a notably streamlined and elegant approach will attract investment. Cue MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . What Is MIND of Pepe ($MIND)? $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that monitors, participates in, and propels meme coin discussions and interactions on various social media platforms. Through listening, collaborating, and learning, it forms its own conclusions and delivers real-time actionable insights for $MIND token holders. The $MIND AI agent comes as the answer to the information overload in the crypto space, which makes it difficult for the average investor to identify the best assets to invest in. $MIND – a self-evolving AI agent, solves this through hive-mind analysis. Why Should You Invest in $MIND? $MIND is a streamlined AI token project that provides token holders with early access to insights, opportunities, and trends. The $MIND presale is currently live and has already raised $4.1M so far. You can buy the token from the official presale website for just $0.0032144 right now. However, the next price increase is set to take place in less than 2 days, meaning this may be the lowest price you’ll ever get $MIND for. Moreover, since it’s still early days for the presale, investors can choose to stake their holdings and earn a sizable reward of 537% APY. The developers have reserved 15% for staking rewards. 20% of the token supply has been kept aside for marketing, which is going into building a strong community of $MIND holders. The project already has around 14K followers on X and an active Telegram community . Another 10% of the supply is reserved for listing and 30% for long-term project development. All in all, this is sound tokenomics. The $MIND presale has attracted a lot of investors (both retail and whales), and if it proves AI agents can be lean, mean, and profitable machines, could turn out to be the next 100x meme coin . Interested? All you need to do to buy $MIND is head over to MIND of Pepe’s official presale website , connect your crypto wallet, and buy the number of tokens you want. Ensure you have enough funds for gas fees, though. If you need further assistance, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy $MIND .

The integration, Orbs’ tenth Liquidity Hub deployment across diverse blockchain networks, is set to give SwapX users access to additional deep liquidity pools and new trading tools. Optimized DEX trading Orbs’ Liquidity Hub is powered by L3 technology designed to optimize decentralized exchange ( DEX ) trading. By aggregating liquidity from on- and off-chain sources alike, the hub ensures better execution prices, improved capital efficiency, and enhanced cybersecurity , offering protection against threats such as miner extractable value (MEV). The collaboration is also significant for Orbs as it introduces its Liquidity Hub to Sonic for the first time. Able to handle 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) and boasting sub-second finality, Sonic has managed to position itself as a leader in decentralized finance ( DeFi ), a status further corroborated by the new integration. Orbs’ Liquidity Hub, on the other hand, operates by layering enhanced functionality over existing automated market maker (AMM) structures, leveraging on-chain solver auctions and decentralized application programming interfaces (APIs) to aggregate liquidity efficiently. By enabling third-party solvers to compete for swap requests, it likewise ensures optimal price discovery through a blend of AMM liquidity and private inventory. Additionally, it allows market makers and professional traders to contribute bids via decentralized APIs, providing better execution for traders while maximizing returns for liquidity providers. Promoting SwapX as the leading Sonic DEX Ran Hammer, Vice President of Business Development at Orbs, called Sonic one of the most promising new chains and expressed excitement for the possibilities open by the new integration: “We’ve been collaborating with SwapX for over a year, and I’m absolutely thrilled to see our partnership come to life. Sonic is one of the most innovative and promising new chains in the space, and with Orbs L3 powering SwapX, we’re excited to witness its exponential growth and the groundbreaking advancements it will bring to DeFi.” As the leading DEX on Sonic, SwapX already allows for advanced liquidity management. However, by integrating Orbs’ Liquidity Hub, it becomes capable of tapping into aggregated liquidity sources beyond its native pools. With Sonic’s expanding ecosystem and Orbs’ technology now powering SwapX, the new integration promises some noteworthy developments in enhanced liquidity and DeFi as a whole.

Jim Cramer, known as a contrarian indicator in the cryptocurrency community, expressed his support for BTC. The famous name added that one should own Bitcoin, but not the largest publicly traded Bitcoin owner, MicroStrategy. “I have Bitcoin, you should have Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a great thing to have in your portfolio. It's a good thing for your portfolio. But it's not good for your MicroStrategy portfolio.” Jim Cramer, known as a contrarian indicator in the market, shared his comments about Bitcoin and MicroStrategy, which also attracted the attention of the community. Some users have pointed out that Cramer’s words could benefit MicroStrategy bulls and Bitcoin bears in the coming weeks, citing his reputation as a contrarian indicator. Cramer’s shares and preferences tend to move in opposite directions in the long term, and historically the opposite is often the case. *This is not investment advice.

According to the 19b-4 form, the ARK Bitcoin and 21Shares Ethereum ETFs will now be allowed to process creations and redemptions in-kind rather than in cash only. All other representations will remain unchanged. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store Inc., explained that individuals (retailers) will not be able to do in-kind creations and redemptions. Only authorized participants (APs) will have access to the service. Cboe awaits US SEC approval of proposed rule change Cboe files 19b-4 to permit in-kind creations & redemption on BOTH the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF & 21Shares Core *Ethereum* ETF… pic.twitter.com/lQklURfNbU — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) January 27, 2025 The Cboe BZX Exchange Inc. submitted its 19b-4 filing with the U.S. SEC on January 27. In the proposed rule changes, both ARKB and CETH will allow the creation and redemption of ETF shares using Bitcoin and ETH rather than in cash. A crypto commenter suggested that this approval will create a more orderly market and enable “more surface area” between the ETFs and the rest of crypto. The regulator previously dismissed similar applications for two proposed spot Solana ETFs, prompting their exclusion from Cboe’s official listings. As per the 19b-4 filing, the Bitcoin Trust will create or redeem its shares in-kind by transferring Bitcoin in blocks of 5,000 shares based on the quantity of Bitcoin attributable to each share of the Trust at the Trust’s NAV. Conversely, the ETH Trust will create or redeem shares in-kind through transfers of Ether in blocks of 10,000 shares based on the quantity of ETH attributable to each share of the Trust at the Trust’s NAV. Authorized participants will deliver Bitcoin or ETH to create shares and receive Bitcoin or ETH when redeeming shares. Except for these proposed changes, the Cboe filing suggested that all other representations in Bitcoin ETP Amendment No. 5 and ETH ETP Amendment No. 2 will remain unchanged. The representations will also continue to constitute continuing listing requirements and both Trusts will continue to comply with the requirements of Rule 14.11(e)(4). Additionally, the exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If approved, the proposed changes will remove barriers and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market. The exchange also believes that the proposed rule change will not raise new regulatory concerns. Cboe tests US SEC limits with proposed in-kind transactions Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said this was a case of ETF issuers testing the limits of what the U.S. SEC will allow under the new administration following the agency’s recent shift away from cash-only models. He added that he expects the new crypto task force led by Hester Peirce to be the “linchpin” in determining what will be allowed and what will not. Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said that it will be interesting to see where the U.S. SEC draws the line (if at all) and why. He predicted that trading under the new changes could be launched as soon as April if no objections come from the regulators. According to Seyffart, approval of the proposed in-kind transactions means that ETFs will be able to trade even more efficiently than they already did theoretically because “things could now be streamlined.” He opined that ETFs should have been allowed to process in-kind transactions from the “get-go,” although Democratic U.S. SEC Commissioners were against it. “ The main point is that the In-kind model is way more streamlined with less steps and less parties involved (and its how the vast majority of ETFs operate).” – James Seyffart Top degen Dominic CK said Cboe’s proposal is a bullish signal for institutional adoption and market maturity. The exchange does not believe the proposed rule change will impose any unnecessary burden on competition.

Is $300 the Next Stop? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Solana price has successfully retested its important support level, resulting in it surpassing the $240 mark. With this, the Solana token is back under the limelight of top investors and institutes as the crypto market highly anticipates a Solana ETF launch announcement in Q1 2025. Amid such volatility in the cryptocurrency market , will the Solana price maintain its positive inflow and head toward a new ATH in the coming time? In this article, we bring you the possible short-term market trends and Solana price analysis! SOL Coin Price Records Increased Volatility! The price of Solana has jumped over 7% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $8.497 billion. Moreover, this altcoin has added 23.16% over the last 30 days and has a YTD return of +24.16%. This indicates an increase in the bullish sentiment. TradingView: SOL/USDT Considering the long-term prospects, the rising adoption and launch of more fundamentally strong projects in the Solana ecosystem could drive its price toward a new high. Moreover, a fundamentally strong upgrade/improvement in the Solana Network Congestion could also act as a catalyst in the SOL price surge. Solana Technical Sentiments The Simple Moving Average (SMA) has experienced a bearish convergence in the daily time frame. This highlights an increase in the selling-over-buying pressure for the altcoin in the cryptocurrency market. On the other hand, the RSI indicator has maintained its value above the neutral point despite its average trendline recording a negative crossover. This suggests mixed-price action for the 05th largest crypto token by market capitalization this week. Will SOL Price Reach $300? If the Solana price holds its value above its important support level of $237.50, this could result in the Solana price retesting its immediate resistance level of $250. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for it to head toward its upper high of $270. However, if the bears outrun the bulls, the SOL coin price could break down its important support trendline and plunge toward its lower support of $210 in the upcoming time.

The Ripple executive said that the code that node operators run decides everything and not the firm. There is no limit to the changes that a person can make to the XRPL network. David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Ripple, addressed concerns about the company’s influence over the XRP Ledger’s governance. Ripple issues the third-largest digital asset by market capitalization, XRP. In a recent online discussion, Schwartz clarified that Ripple has no involvement in the main governance process of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which is managed by node operators. Responding to questions on X, Schwartz explained that the XRPL’s governance relies on the code node operators run. This code dictates the state changes permitted on the network. When a user asked who controls what a code node can or cannot do, Schwartz reiterated that the code itself sets all the rules. No. The primary governance mechanism is the code node operators choose to run. That's what determines what state changes are or aren't allowed. — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 27, 20… The post Ripple CTO David Schwartz Clears the Air on XRP Ledger Governance appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Cryptocurrency|Ripple (XRP)|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|WALLET|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-01-28 11:23:52

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Utility tokens like Solana and Remittix are gaining traction among savvy investors as they prioritize real-world applications over hype-driven meme coins. Table of Contents Solana forecasted to hit the $1000 mark Remittix steps out as crypto’s new super coin Shiba Inu might see a 1.5x increase in January Dogecoin’s lack of real-world use dissuades crypto whales Why utility tokens are smarter crypto investment strategies Investors are actively searching for the most outstanding options as the crypto market enters its mid-cycle. Even though meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are still widely used, utility tokens like Solana and Remittix are becoming more and more popular because of their practical uses and promising future. Are utility tokens the smarter pick for this cycle? Solana forecasted to hit the $1000 mark Solana is currently trading at $225, continuing its upward trajectory having seen a 21% increase in just one month. Analysts forecast that it will reach $1,000 by the middle of 2025 as its ecosystem grows and more developers use its platform. This strong technical performance places Solana above key moving averages, signaling potential for even more growth. Remittix steps out as crypto’s new super coin Investors who are interested in the practical application of Blockchain Technology should be looking into Remittix (RTX). By merging the ease of traditional finance with the speed of blockchain, this cutting-edge platform is enriching the $183 trillion global payment market. Remittix offers seamless cross-border transactions under a system known as PayFi. Consider the ease of sending $700 in cryptocurrency to a relative in another country and they receive exactly $700 in their local currency without having to deal with hidden fees and exchange rate losses. That’s what Remittix delivers. Its flat-fee methodology, which supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, guarantees consistent and economical payments. Remittix has generated over $8.3 million and is currently trading at $0.0418 in its presale phase. It is expected to provide enormous returns, possibly 25 times during the presale and up to 1,500% after launch. It is evident from certified smart contracts and locked liquidity that Remittix blends crypto investment strategies with blockchain technology to achieve remarkable growth.

Analysts predict that it will hit a price of $0.00003 by the end of January 2025. Indicators like a strong RSI and a golden cross support this claim at the moment. Nonetheless, market sentiment and hype play a major role in Shiba Inu’s growth. Although its ecosystem has grown to encompass decentralized applications, it still lacks the usefulness of coins such as Remittix and Solana. Perhaps Shiba Inu isn’t the best choice for long-term investors who value sustainable approaches. Dogecoin’s lack of real-world use dissuades crypto whales The cryptocurrency community still adores Dogecoin , the first meme coin. When Elon Musk tweets about it, its value frequently soars, which shows its dependence on outside hype. Although Dogecoin has had its sporadic moments of bullish activity, its lack of substantial use cases makes it a risky choice. While some traders may enjoy short-term gains, Dogecoin doesn’t offer the same level of real-world application or security as Solana or Remittix. Why utility tokens are smarter crypto investment strategies Purpose is the key distinction between utility tokens like Solana and Remittix and meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin in this cycle. Meme coins are dependent on social media attention and market movements, whereas utility tokens are grounded in blockchain technology and fulfill practical purposes. While its ecosystem has grown with initiatives in decentralized applications, its lack of significant utility beyond the meme coin niche limits its long-term appeal compared to utility tokens like Solana and Remittix. Leading the way in innovation, Solana’s robust blockchain ecosystem is crucial for web3 and DeFi projects. Meanwhile, Remittix addresses a practical problem, costly international payments, with a fast and transparent solution. These tokens offer more stability and long-term potential, aligning well with thoughtful crypto investment strategies. For anyone serious about growing their portfolio, utility tokens stand out as the better choice. Remittix, in particular, combines the speed and efficiency of cryptocurrency with the reliability of traditional finance, offering a balanced approach to modern payments.

XRP led gains among crypto majors with a 12% surge, while Cardano’s ADA, BNB Chain’s BNB, Solana’s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) zooming as much as 9%. Ether (ETH) gained 4.5%, while overall market capitalization rose 3%. BTC rose nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, easing losses from Monday which saw over $1 billion in futures liquidations and an 8.5% decline in the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) at peak. Large liquidation events often present a market buying opportunity, as CoinDesk noted on Monday , as they can signal an overstretched market that indicates a price correction has occurred, among other factors. As such, TRUMP tokens were up 12% to lead gains among midcaps, or tokens below a $5 billion market cap. Part of the gains in majors came as Tuttle Capital filed the first-ever 2x leveraged ETFs in the U.S. on Monday, proposing products that would return 200% of the daily price performance of nearly all major tokens, plus BONK, TRUMP and MELANIA. Monday’s nosedive was largely attributed to breakthroughs from China’s DeepSeek, whose model was shown to outperform AI giant OpenAI’s, all while being built on a budget of $6 million and a fraction of the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that OpenAI uses (it recently closed a $6.6 billion round with a valuation of over $157 billion). However, some traders state that DeepSeek’s breakthrough is among a bunch of factors that may impact bitcoin and crypto markets in the near term. “Initial fears about DeepSeek presented a buying opportunity for crypto as the industry isn't in direct confrontation with the Chinese AI firm,’ Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Instead, founders of crypto projects that use AI can integrate DeepSeek's open-sourced model into their projects for more efficiency and enhanced innovations.” “However, there are still choppy waters ahead as this week is heavy with macro data releases from US agencies, including the FOMC, and earnings reports from major companies such as Apple, Meta, and ASML. We remain optimistic for Bitcoin in the long term, as policies are shaping up to be very beneficial for the crypto industry's growth in the U.S. and abroad,” Ruck added. Traders expect no indications of a rate cut at the two-day FOMC meeting scheduled for Jan. 28 to Jan. 29, which has typically impacted bitcoin prices as investors either prefer or move away from risk assets. Meanwhile, Singapore-based QCP Capital provided astrological cues as part of a larger Tuesday market update. “As we approach the Year of the Snake, the market’s twists and turns remind us of the wisdom, adaptability, and resilience this zodiac symbolizes - qualities that will be essential as we navigate 2025’s challenges and opportunities,” the firm said in a broadcast. There may be truth to that gospel, as CoinDesk reported Monday .

Does He Have Bitcoin and Ethereum?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ripple-ceo-reveals-us-national-reserve-ideas-and-portfolio-does-he-have-bitcoin-and-ethereum/,"While it is eagerly awaited whether a Bitcoin reserve will be created in the US, discussions continue about adding other altcoins besides BTC. At this point, while Donald Trump gave the green light to include other altcoins in the reserves besides Bitcoin, Ripple CEO Bard Garlinghouse explained his ideas on the national reserve. Accordingly, Brad Garlinghouse said he supports the idea of a US digital asset reserve that covers multiple tokens, not just Bitcoin (BTC) or XRP. Sharing from his X account, Ripple CEO said that if a digital asset reserve is to be created, he thinks it should be diversified and not just a single token. Noting that he has several other cryptocurrencies in his portfolio besides XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum, Garlinghouse said: “I have a few thoughts on maximalism… Let me say this as clearly as I can: The crypto industry has a real chance of achieving our common goals if we work together instead of tearing each other apart. This is not a zero-sum game and never will be. I own XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, among a few others. We live in a multi-chain world, and I advocate for equal opportunities, not one token competing against another. “If a government digital asset reserve is going to be created, I believe it should be representative of the industry, not just one token (be it BTC, XRP or something else). The reserve should be diversified.” As the reserve debate continues, Polymarket data shows that the probability of Donald Trump announcing a Bitcoin reserve within his first 100 days is only 19%. Some thoughts on maximalism… let me say this as clearly as I can – the crypto industry has a real shot, here and now, to achieve the many goals we have in common, IF we work together instead of tearing each other down.

Unlocking the Best Prices in DeFi: Jupiter’s Impact on Solana Jupiter is making a name for itself as one of the most popular decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators in the Solana ecosystem. By compiling different liquidity pools, Jupiter ensures users get the best prices for their token swaps, enhancing efficiency and saving costs. Over time, Jupiter has expanded its functionality into areas like perpetual futures, decentralized stablecoin management, and its new LFG launchpad, helping Solana projects hit the ground running. In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), price discrepancies across various DEXs can lead to users not getting the best value in transactions. Jupiter addresses this problem by aggregating resources from multiple liquidity pools on Solana, guaranteeing the best asset prices. This makes it an attractive option for users looking to optimize their trades. With market trends favoring efficient and user-friendly platforms, Jupiter’s innovative approach and expanding services position it well in the current cycle. Compared to other aggregators, Jupiter’s broad functionality and commitment to improving the DeFi experience set it apart, offering significant potential for growth. Solana: The Fast Lane of Blockchain Innovation Solana is a blockchain platform that puts speed and scalability at its core. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it offers a foundation for decentralized applications, or dapps. What sets Solana apart is its unique architecture designed for faster transactions and flexibility in development. Developers can use multiple programming languages, making it accessible and versatile. At the heart of Solana’s ecosystem is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL is crucial for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The potential of Solana lies in its approach to scalability without compromising on security. Unlike others, it doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions. This makes it attractive for developers looking to build high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, SOL has gained attention due to its high-capacity network and the growing ecosystem of projects built on it. While the cryptocurrency market is volatile, Solana’s technological strengths and active development community position it as a noteworthy player among blockchain platforms. Conclusion Jupiter’s (JUP) success on Solana (SOL) paves the way for XYZVerse (XYZ) to redefine memecoins, uniting sports fans for massive growth and cultural impact.

39609395,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55774,1738063707,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple’s Push for XRP Inclusion in U.S. Crypto Reserve Sparks Debate,https://timestabloid.com/ripples-push-for-xrp-inclusion-in-u-s-crypto-reserve-sparks-debate/,"The possibility of establishing a U.S. crypto strategic reserve has sparked intense discussions within the cryptocurrency community, with Ripple’s native token at the center of the controversy. Ripple has been vocal about its ambitions to position the token as a key component of such a reserve. However, opinions within the industry remain deeply divided. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed optimism about the asset’s potential inclusion , aligning the company’s goals with the current administration’s emphasis on promoting American innovations. According to Garlinghouse, incorporating assets like XRP alongside Bitcoin would be consistent with efforts to support U.S.-based companies and technologies. Industry Pushback and Criticism Despite Ripple’s efforts, many industry leaders are skeptical of XRP’s suitability for a U.S. crypto reserve. Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, has been one of the most vocal critics. Selkis advocates for Bitcoin as the sole cryptocurrency fit for such a reserve, citing its decentralized nature, reliance on energy-backed mining, and dominant global position as critical factors. He also criticized Ripple’s lobbying efforts , accusing the company of aggressively promoting the token despite concerns about its centralized distribution and the large volume of XRP held by Ripple. Adding to the conversation, Charles Hoskinson , founder of Cardano, struck a more neutral tone. While he acknowledged Ripple’s efforts, he suggested that Bitcoin should be the primary focus for a government-backed crypto reserve. This cautious approach reflects the broader hesitation among industry leaders about moving beyond Bitcoin when considering digital assets for a strategic reserve. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Government Interest and Potential Considerations The U.S. government has shown interest in exploring the feasibility of a digital asset reserve. A working group has been tasked with evaluating the concept. Bitcoin initially dominated early discussions, however, attention has recently shifted toward other assets, including XRP and Solana, particularly those marketed as “American-made” technologies. Ripple’s lobbying efforts have drawn both support and criticism. Advocates argue that including a diverse range of digital assets could strengthen the foundation of a U.S. crypto reserve. However, critics warn that prioritizing assets like XRP could undermine the initiative’s credibility. Riot Platforms and other Bitcoin-focused advocates have expressed concerns that Ripple’s push for inclusion may detract from Bitcoin’s proven stability and decentralization. A central point of contention is Ripple’s substantial control over its native token, XRP. The company reportedly holds above 50% of the total token supply, raising questions about its decentralization and suitability for a government reserve. Critics argue that this level of control creates potential conflicts of interest and undermines the decentralization principles often central to cryptocurrencies. The debate highlights broader divisions within the crypto industry about the future of digital asset adoption in government frameworks. While Bitcoin remains the frontrunner due to its established track record and global recognition, Ripple’s campaign to include XRP has brought alternative perspectives into the conversation.

After a week of accumulation, the fund’s holdings are at record levels. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the Trump family DeFi fund, keeps acquiring Ethereum (ETH) during market dips. ETH is now the biggest holding for the fund, mostly held liquid and partially used for staking. The latest purchase was for $10M to buy another 3,247 ETH during the latest price dip. The purchase arrives after the fund previously spent $20M to acquire 3,001 ETH and 95 WBTC over the weekend. World Liberty Fi expanded its ETH holdings rapidly in the past week. | Source: Arkham Intelligence The new ETH purchase comes soon after a whale bought WLFI tokens valued at $10M for Tether (USDT). The inflow of whale funds, possibly from other crypto projects and platforms, is bringing WLFI closer to its sales target. For now, the token remains locked, with the potential to be held for at least a year. Speculations range from WLFI forever remaining a locked voting token, to being unlocked once there is enough regulatory clarity. After a week of buying the dip, World Liberty Fi owns 59.389M ETH, with another 19.40K stETH for passive income. The fund’s portfolio has expanded to $394M based on Arkham Intelligence reporting, after buying a mix of WBTC, LINK, and other relatively older coins and tokens. WLFI even added TRON (TRX) in a series of purchases. Alternative data pin the portfolio at $405.39M , with a small recent gain of 1.54%. World Liberty Fi holds most of its proceeds and additional investments in ETH, despite pessimism after the recent price dip. | Source: Spotonchain World Liberty Fi aims to preserve the value of its assets, while participating in the Ethereum ecosystem. ETH is also the most widely received token for buying WLFI, with almost constant inflows. While the fund did not launch its initial target of raising $300M, it has still built a sizeable crypto portfolio, by adding funds beyond the inflow of investor purchases. The fund has already sold 23.37B WLFI tokens out of a target for 25B. Despite the ongoing retail activity, most of the WLFI sold went to whale investors and to the directed buying of Justin Sun as one of the fund’s biggest backers. World Liberty Fi buys despite ETH pessimism World Liberty continued accumulating ETH despite the token’s sliding value against Bitcoin (BTC). The fund times the purchases to buy dips and corrections, despite ETH dominance near a historically low range. ETH decreased its dominance to as low as 10.2%, as traffic shifted to other networks, especially Solana. ETH traded at $3,193.33, within its usual range, currently looking at expectations of a traditionally strong Q1. The asset retains its utility and value locked, but gets questioned on real-time economic liveliness as trading and DeFi shift to other chains. The fund turned into a long-term holder, while carrying unrealized losses for most of its history. However, most of the selected assets in the portfolio are recovering, and World Liberty Fi is within $10M of breaking even. The fund is a relatively conservative investment and much smaller in its impact compared to the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme token. World Liberty Fi bets on the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem The Ethereum DeFi ecosystem still locks in over $63B in total value, including LidoDAO’s staked ETH. Uniswap V3 is still the key DEX smart contract, while Aave remains the top lending protocol. World Liberty Fi will work as an instance of Aave V3, locking up a part of Aave’s earnings potential. Currently, it is unknown when World Liberty Fi would launch its vault, but the success may be tied to the overall performance of Ethereum-based DeFi. Aave itself locks more than $18B in its vaults, carrying collaterals from other projects like the Sky Ecosystem and Ethena. The size of World Liberty Fi would be a fraction of that market, depending on collaterals and activity allowed. If the performance of Aave is taken into account, World Liberty Fi could become a fee producer for its lending activity. Aave posted earnings for January at $8.75M, even after paying out $3.7M in token incentives. Based on Token Terminal data, Aave-based lending is one of the leading fee-generating apps, which may grant World Liberty Fi an earnings-positive status.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen significant changes recently. Over six months, it surged 147.22%. In the last week, it dipped 12.93%, and over the past month, it remained stable with a slight decline of 0.29%. Currently, DOGE trades between $0.31 and $0.38, reflecting market volatility. The price is close to its 10-day simple moving average of $0.32 but below the 100-day SMA of $0.35, indicating potential upward movement. The Relative Strength Index is at 15.15, suggesting the coin is oversold. The stochastic indicator is low at 12.39, signaling a possible price reversal. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.009866 but could improve with increased buying. DOGE faces resistance at $0.42. If it breaks this level, it could climb to the next resistance at $0.49, a potential gain of over 20%. On the downside, support is at $0.29, and a drop to $0.22 would be a decrease of about 29%. Based on the data, there’s potential for DOGE’s price to rise if it overcomes resistance levels. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a notable price decline recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 12.61%. Over the last month, it fell by 18.10%. However, looking at the past six months, SHIB saw an 8.10% increase, showing some long-term strength. Currently, SHIB trades between $0.00001801 and $0.00002116. The nearest support level is at $0.00001694. If the price dips below this, it might reach the second support at $0.00001379. On the upside, the closest resistance is at $0.00002324. Breaking this could push the price to the next resistance at $0.00002639. Technical indicators suggest more downward pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 16.08, indicating oversold conditions. The Stochastic indicator is at 14.11, also pointing to an oversold market. The MACD level is negative at -0.0000005355, signaling bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00001838, slightly below the 100-day SMA of $0.00001985. If SHIB can hold above the support levels, there’s potential for a rebound. Otherwise, the price may continue to fall.

While NFT trading volumes have plummeted by nearly 20% according to DappRadar, Getgems believes Telegram’s 950 million monthly active users could be the key to reigniting interest in digital collectibles. Unlike some NFT projects that focus solely on speculative trading, Getgems emphasizes practical utility. The marketplace sees Telegram’s digital assets—like Usernames and Anonymous Numbers—as pivotal in demonstrating the value of NFTs. These digital identifiers have already achieved significant traction, with Usernames generating 72 million Toncoin in trading volume and Anonymous Numbers accounting for 24 million Toncoin. At current TON prices of around $5, this translates to a combined market activity of approximately $480 million. NFT-Powered Telegram Gifts Telegram’s continued blockchain integration is seen as a major step forward for Getgems. In October 2024, the platform introduced Gifts, a feature allowing users to send custom animated congratulatory messages. Telegram has since integrated these Gifts with the TON blockchain, offering users the ability to convert them into NFTs. The new feature has been met with enthusiasm, as Telegram CEO Pavel Durov revealed that over 20 million Gifts had been acquired by users. Getgems anticipates that this development will further boost interest in Telegram-based NFTs by making them more accessible and appealing to mainstream audiences. Pre-mint trading for these NFTs already demonstrated strong demand, with the market reaching a $1 million trading volume and a $10 million market capitalization before full integration. Getgems remains hopeful that Telegram’s blockchain-powered features will set the stage for greater adoption and continued innovation within the NFT space. Betting on Long-Term Utility While the broader NFT landscape struggles, Getgems is doubling down on its belief that Telegram’s tools can drive widespread adoption. The company views Telegram as a natural fit for NFTs , offering seamless integration with everyday digital experiences rather than focusing on speculative trading or gambling. Despite a turbulent year, Getgems sees a future where blockchain-backed digital collectibles find meaningful use cases, proving that the NFT market’s potential is far from over.

RLBK, BGB, and ALGO",https://nulltx.com/according-to-chart-analysis-these-altcoins-are-bringing-enormous-gains-rlbk-bgb-and-algo/,"Looking to cash in on the next big altcoin wave? Chart analysis points to three tokens that are turning heads and delivering huge gains—RLBK, BGB, and ALGO. While BGB and ALGO are leading the market with their positive market price fundamentals and growth projections, Rollblock is also making waves with its innovative GambleFi casino and advanced revenue-sharing model. As momentum builds rapidly during its public presale, RLBK is quickly becoming the top choice for anyone seeking substantial returns in this bull market. This article explores why this investment opportunity is worth considering! Transform your gambling experience with Rollblock’s amazing AI-powered platform AI is becoming integral to every industry, including cryptocurrency, and Rollblock is at the forefront of this transformation. Rollblock has successfully integrated AI into the DeFi world, quickly establishing itself as a major player. Rollblock is an AI-powered DeFi gaming platform with a GambleFi casino that’s easy to use. With over 7,000 games, as well as virtual experiences and sportsbooks, users can bet on one of the biggest Web3 varieties from anywhere in the world. Unlike traditional gaming platforms, Rollblock offers full transparency for wagers and outcomes. Last December, Rollblock saw $1.75 million in wagers, and January is expected to surpass that figure. In contrast to BGB and ALGO, which employ a one-directional revenue distribution system, Rollblock uses an advanced revenue-sharing model that prioritizes its users. Through this model, 60% of Rollblock’s profits are burned, and the rest are given as staking rewards to RBLK holders. Combining entertainment with financial opportunity, Rollblock offers a unique experience for users. It ensures fairness and transparency by using blockchain for secure transactions. Rollblock recently scaled SolidProof’s smart contract audit, assuring investors and players of a well-rounded ecosystem. BGB shows potential to be a top-earning altcoin BGB traders seem to be feeling pretty confident these days and for good reasons. Over the past month, BGB has had 17 green days out of 30, resulting in a solid 57% win rate. This has prompted analysts to predict a potential 0.82% price rise for BGB. Some analysts even believe that BGB could possibly reach $7.23 by February 23, 2025. With the 50-day simple moving average at $5.13 and the 200-day SMA at $2.12, these BGB price predictions look very likely. ALGO impresses investors with bullish growth In just two months, ALGO has made a remarkable comeback in the bull market, significantly improving the fortunes of its holders. ALGO not only bounced back from the $0.10 mark in early November but did so in a big way. From a technical perspective, ALGO is currently in a bull flag pattern. As long as ALGO’s prices remain above the local support level of $0.30, there’s a good chance buyers will push the price higher. This push might even make ALGO break past $0.50 and reach new highs of around $0.60. Conclusion Based on their market chart data, BGB, ALGO, and the new Rollblock are amazing representatives of the fascinating profit-earning opportunities the crypto industry offers. Rollblock, in particular, features impressive market trends that are attracting investors seeking a reliable and stable ecosystem. Now is the ideal time to buy RBLK, as it is currently available at an affordable presale price of $0.052. Invest in RBLK today!

The disrupting surge in token inflows from IntelMarkets’ ongoing presale has shifted the attention to its million-dollar milestone. So far, the project has raised $7.5 million in presale stage 9 and is poised for more gains in the near term. Ripple’s XRP ETFs Triggers Rally: Approval Soon? CoinShares joins a growing list of firms seeking approval for XRP ETFs. Notable asset managers, including Bitwise, WisdomTree, 21Shares, Rex Osprey, ProShares, and Canary Capital, have submitted competing applications. In addition to single-asset XRP ETFs, Bitwise and Grayscale have also proposed multi-asset ETFs that include XRP. While the SEC has acknowledged these multi-asset proposals, it has not yet addressed the XRP-exclusive filings. The XRP community remains hopeful that the SEC will approve at least one XRP-focused ETF by the end of 2025. Optimism has been fueled by the pro-crypto stance of the newly inaugurated U.S. administration. President Donald Trump has appointed industry-friendly figures to key positions, including Paul Atkins as the SEC’s new chairman. Atkins is widely expected to advocate for clearer regulations and a resolution to pending crypto-related cases. The outcome of the SEC’s ongoing lawsuit against Ripple remains a critical factor in XRP’s regulatory landscape. Cardano Sees Minor Price Correction Amid AI Crypto Hype In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez shared the amount of Cardano tokens offloaded by whales in the past week. This is based on the change in the wallet holdings of those who own between 100 million and 1 billion coins. It is worth mentioning that addresses holding tokens of such magnitude are called whales. These entities are deemed significant as other market participants often watch their movements. Due to their substantial holdings, crypto whales often wield significant influence over the market and prices. Historically, prices of assets tend to move in the direction of these large investors (prices rise during whale accumulation and dip during whale sell-offs.) According to Martinez, the Cardano whales trimmed their holdings in the past week, offloading more than 180 million ADA tokens in the process. This sell-off is equivalent to around $185 million at the current market price. While determining the exact rationale behind the latest whale movement is difficult, it is not unusual for whales to lock in profits, especially after a price surge. While Cardano’s price correction took a hit amid the recent plunge, investors are exploring other emerging projects like IntelMarkets to experience AI-powered trading.

However, as 2025 unfolds, DTX Exchange is quickly stealing the spotlight. With its innovative decentralized trading platform and a rapidly growing community of over 550,000 members, DTX has already surpassed many memecoins in terms of hype, momentum, and utility. Currently in its final presale round, with $13 million raised, DTX is positioning itself as one of the most promising projects to watch in 2025. Could this be the next breakout crypto to outshine Solana memecoins? Dogwifhat (WIF) Struggles as Critical Support Fails Once a rising star in the memecoin world, Dogwifhat (WIF) has faced significant headwinds after its November highs. The token has experienced a steady decline, erasing much of its earlier gains. Trading at $1.08, WIF has broken below its previously critical support zone at $1.25, raising concerns of further downside. Source: Tradingview Market sentiment is leaning bearish, as the failure to hold support has led to increased selling pressure. Analysts warn that a sustained drop below $1.00 could trigger panic among investors, potentially driving the price even lower. However, should WIF manage to reclaim the $1.25 level, it could reignite bullish momentum and provide a glimmer of hope for recovery. Despite its struggles, WIF maintains a market cap of $1.08 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $254 million, showing it remains actively traded. Additionally, its loyal community and speculative appeal keep it in the spotlight. Yet, as projects like DTX Exchange gain traction by offering tangible utility and long-term growth potential, WIF faces mounting competition in the market. Solana Price Struggles: Drops Below $230 Amid Market Pullback Solana (SOL) has faced significant downward pressure, trading at $221.75 after a sharp decline from its previous high of $240.39. Over the past week, SOL has dropped 11.81%, highlighting bearish sentiment in the market. Despite this, Solana remains a leading Layer-1 blockchain, showcasing robust scalability and network activity. Source: Tradingview The recent launch of a Donald Trump-themed meme coin had initially driven increased decentralized exchange (DEX) activity on Solana, emphasizing the blockchain’s efficiency. However, the price retracement reflects broader market corrections and profit-taking by investors. Key support levels at $229 and $210 are now critical for Solana to maintain its market position. Should it fail to hold above these levels, further downside could push the price below $200. Conversely, a recovery and consolidation above $250 would reignite optimism for Solana to reattempt the $300 resistance level in the longer term. DTX Exchange: 200,000 TPS and 10x Growth Potential While memecoins like WIF rise and fall with market sentiment, DTX Exchange is proving that utility and innovation are the real drivers of sustained success. Powered by the VulcanX blockchain, DTX achieved an industry-leading 200,000 TPS in its testnet, outpacing competitors and setting new benchmarks for scalability. The platform’s Phoenix Wallet, now downloaded by over 330,000 users, offers seamless multi-asset management, including support for stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets. This comprehensive approach has earned DTX a rapidly growing community, which now exceeds 550,000 members globally. The DTX Token is currently priced at $0.16 in its final presale round, with analysts projecting a 440% gain upon listing. With $13 million raised, the presale has attracted both retail and institutional investors eager to be part of what could be one of the most impactful blockchain projects of 2025. Why DTX Is Outpacing Memecoins and Major Blockchains DTX’s rise is a testament to its focus on utility, scalability, and community engagement. Unlike WIF, which relies heavily on hype, or Solana, which is leaning into memecoin activity, DTX offers a robust platform designed for long-term growth. Its ability to bridge traditional and decentralized finance makes it a unique player in the blockchain space. By addressing real-world trading and financial needs, DTX is carving out a niche that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Market Outlook As the crypto market matures, DTX Exchange stands out with its aim to address scalability and cross-asset integration—key gaps in current blockchain ecosystems. Unlike speculative trends dominating other projects, DTX’s focus on real-world utility positions it to capitalize on the rising demand for decentralized trading solutions. With its presale nearing completion and institutional interest increasing, DTX is poised to reshape the crypto market in 2025.

With bullish signals and robust DeFi dominance, Ethereum’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. Meanwhile, another ERC-20 token, DTX Exchange (DTX) , is creating a buzz with its groundbreaking hybrid trading platform, offering unmatched features like 1000x leverage and non-custodial wallets. Let’s find out how. ETH’s Path to $6,000: Can It Break Resistance Levels? Ethereum price bullish trajectory continues to draw attention. Recent analysis has revealed positive signs, such as rising patterns and inverted head-and-shoulder formations, indicating an upward trajectory ahead. Notably, cryptocurrency expert Ali (@ali_charts) claimed that “the most important support for Ethereum $ETH is from $3,066 to $3,160, while the most important resistance ranges from $3,360 to $3,450.” These signs, along with significant investor purchases and low MVRV ratios, indicate that Ethereum price may soon see substantial gains. Observing the optimistic trends, industry experts forecast possible Ethereum price goals that might begin at $3,800 and, if the momentum continues, rise to $6,000 by 2025. DTX Exchange: A Game-Changer for DeFi and Beyond DTX Exchange (DTX) is a fresh entry into the market and has already taken the DeFi world by storm with its revolutionary technology and high returns. It is an upcoming exchange platform that makes use of a hybrid approach to bring the best components of decentralized and centralized exchanges on a single unified platform. This platform has state-of-the-art infrastructure and a wide variety of trading features, aiming to provide traders with opportunities that they never had before. This includes over 1000x leverage margin and a distributed liquidity pool that ensures each trader gets opportunities to optimize their capital. Furthermore, it is supposed to be the first crypto-native platform that will offer over 120,000 commodities. These will include stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, ETFs, forex, and a lot more. It will also be the first platform that will exclude the KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations, prioritizing every user’s privacy. DTX Exchange recently introduced its non-custodial Phoenix Wallet, providing a safe and secure solution for users to safeguard their assets. Traders and investors get complete authority over their private keys and their digital assets in case of any security breach. 100x Returns Ahead? Analysts Are Bullish on the DTX Exchange The ongoing presale of DTX Exchange (DTX) presents an excellent opportunity to get on the ground floor of such a revolutionary platform and be one of its early backers, having governance rights and other perks of having access to exclusive trade features. The presal,e despite being launched not long ago, has already raised over $12.9 million in funding. This reflects clearly on the massive hype surrounding this upcoming project. Each DTX token is currently available for only $0.16 at the eighth stage of the presale. Analysts are predicting a listing on a tier-1 exchange for this ERC-20 token, DTX, in the second quarter of the year 2025. This listing is anticipated to give this project a major boost that can generate over 100x returns for all of its investors.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has now responded to the criticism, defending XRP’s potential role while denouncing the divisive nature of maximalism in the crypto space. A Call for Unity The Ripple exec took to X on Monday, stressing the need for collaboration within the crypto industry, which he described as a “multichain world.” His post read: “The crypto industry has a real shot to achieve common goals if we work together instead of tearing each other down. This is not, and never will be, a zero-sum game.” Claiming he has always advocated for a level playing field instead of pitting tokens against each other, Garlinghouse let it be known that apart from XRP, he holds multiple other assets, including BTC and ETH. He also stated his belief that if the U.S. government created a digital asset reserve, then it should represent the entire industry rather than just one token. “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress,” he added, expressing relief at its waning influence in the community. However, his message did not go unchallenged, meeting resistance from Bitcoin maxis, who accused him of hypocrisy and corporate maneuvering. Michelle Weekly, a BTC advocate and crypto company exec, responded harshly, claiming the Ripple CEO did not represent anything good or new in the industry. “Maximalism is not the enemy, you are the enemy,” she declared, alleging that Ripple had lobbied against Bitcoin’s inclusion in U.S. reserves and supported unfavorable regulatory measures during the previous administration. Trump Executive Order Sparks Debate The controversy comes amid broader discussions on whether the United States should establish a digital asset reserve and, if so, which cryptocurrencies to include. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to explore the inclusion of various cryptocurrencies in the national stockpile. This move set BTC proponents and the rest of the crypto industry against each other. Messari founder Ryan Selkis was among the loudest voices against coins like XRP and Solana becoming a part of the reserve, calling it “toxic” and insisting on BTC being the only representative. Strike CEO Jack Maller also posted a video on X where he addressed what he called Ripple’s “anti-Bitcoin agenda.” He argued that Bitcoin’s unique attributes as a decentralized asset make it the only viable candidate for a strategic stockpile. “Bitcoin, as a decentralized network, represents freedom and resilience. XRP, on the other hand, is centralized and corporate-controlled. Including it in any U.S. reserve would undermine the principles of economic sovereignty,” said Maller.

Sponsored by State Senator Wendy Rogers and Representative Jeff Weninger, the bill marks a key step toward making Arizona the first state to officially hold digital assets as part of its public funds. The term “public funds” includes assets managed by the state treasurer and retirement systems. With a 5-2 committee vote in favor, the bill now moves to the Senate Rules Committee before a full Senate vote. A National Race for Bitcoin Reserves Arizona’s progress comes at a time when other states are also planning to explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This push is partly driven by the crypto industry’s strong lobbying efforts, which spent $5.9 million supporting pro-crypto candidates in Arizona alone. President Trump’s earlier promises to create a federal Bitcoin reserve added momentum to this trend, though his recent executive order has raised doubts about federal involvement. Regardless, states like Wyoming and Oklahoma are following Arizona’s lead, exploring similar Bitcoin reserve bills. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Donald Trump’s Pro Crypto Executive Orders: A New Dawn for U.S. Digital Asset Policy , New Leadership Boosts Crypto Optimism The confirmation of Scott Bessent as U.S. Treasury Secretary has further fueled optimism in the crypto space.

You do not pay per request,” the firm explained in a Jan. 27 blog announcement .

The new tokens will be distributed as staking rewards.

At the time, Voorhees explained that Venice aims to offer users an alternative to the increasingly centralized and censored AI offerings of major tech firms like OpenAI or Anthropic.

Leading the recovery among major cryptocurrencies is XRP, up 11%, followed by SOL with a 7% increase. AI coins, hit hard on Monday, are posting gains of as much as 4%. Risk sentiment is likely being supported by skepticism surrounding the claims of Chinese tech startup DeepSeek, which asserts it spent only $6 million to develop its competitor to ChatGPT. Critics speculate the figure omits costs associated with earlier research and experimentation on architectures, algorithms and data. Additionally, a concept rooted in the Jevons Paradox suggests that advancements in efficiency often lead to increased usage rather than reduced consumption, leading to net positive growth in the industry. That's good news for bitcoin and the broader crypto industry because they align with the narrative of U.S. exceptionalism, particularly given President Trump's crypto-friendly stance and plans to establish a strategic digital asset reserve. Speaking of the strategic reserve, Arizona lawmakers have advanced a bill that would permit government entities or public funds to invest up to 10% of their capital in bitcoin and other digital assets. The broader outlook remains bullish, with on-chain data pointing to capitulation of weak hands and continued accumulation by large investors. ""According to CryptoQuant data, the share of investors with a balance of at least 1,000 BTC who purchased coins in the last 155 days increased from 43% to 60%, reflecting the emergence of large players amid optimistic sentiment,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at the FxPro. QCP Capital expects this week to test BTC's correlation with equities, particularly as a favorable regulatory environment offers potential support. Stay alert!

In such a volatile scenario, many traders are consolidating their portfolios. Many altcoins are experiencing corrections as many trades are liquidated. In such market situations, most savvy investors start to consolidate their holdings with presale projects with the highest potential. This is a much safer and more reliable option to earn high gains once the project launches. IntelMarkets (INTL) is getting a rise in interest as more investors flock to stage 9 of its presale. INTL tokens are being snapped up as it gets closer to its launch date. Since several market experts foresee both PEPE and Cardano prices struggling with bear forces in the current conditions, IntelMarkets (INTL) is all set to yield high returns to its investors.

PEPE traded between a high of $0.00002154 and a low of $0.00001247. The market volume is up by 100% as traders seem to be going for wide scale liquidation, and the market cap is down by 17%. Source: CoinMarketCap Community sentiment is bullish, and the dip seems to be breaking through all lower resistance levels. The $0.00001500 range will prove crucial as once PEPE broke through, it dropped deeply. Right now, the $0.00001200 range will prove crucial to stop a further drop. Cardano Price Loses $1 Support Cardano’s price chart turned bloody as the ADA token dropped below the $1 psychological price. Cardano’s price traded at a high of $1.09 and a low of $0.87 over the past week as markets went red. Source: CoinMarketCap ADA’s market volume is up by almost 94% and the market cap is down 11% while community sentiment is bullish. The daily and weekly Exponential Moving Averages give a sell signal while the Relative Strength Index is at neutral for both these periods. Combined with the rising market volume, it seems that ADA’s price will be moving toward recovery very soon.

As Bitcoin targets $150k, Yeti Ouro gains momentum with 147m tokens sold in its presale, combining blockchain and Play-to-Earn gaming. Table of Contents BTC poised for $150k as market sentiment strengthens Yeti Ouro: A promising altcoin in the market Amid the market’s intense focus on Bitcoin’s rally toward $150,000, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is making waves having already sold more than 147,000,000 tokens in its presale. With presale tokens selling at a discount attracting early supporters, the project is building momentum as it combines blockchain innovation with an exciting Play-to-Earn gaming ecosystem. BTC poised for $150k as market sentiment strengthens Bitcoin maintains consistent strength and recently reached nearly $105,000, surpassing the $100,000 milestone earlier during the year. Analysts project that Bitcoin price will advance on an upward trajectory while exceeding $150,000 by the closing of 2025. The positive outlook for Bitcoin ownership is supported by institutional integration alongside scarce coin offerings and encouraging economic parameters. Glassnode’s data shows Bitcoin’s Mayer Multiple stands at 1.37, which confirms the asset remains well below the overbought range. Historical Bitcoin price rallies occur when this metric remains below 2.4. The asset currently trades at a level that is 35% higher than its 200-day moving average while exhibiting powerful upward price movement. Institutional investors are strongly influencing these trends. According to Larry Fink, who leads BlackRock, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin could reach $700,000 as more financial institutions and hedge funds invest 2–5% of their total holdings into it. However, the analysts at Aquinas Wealth Advisors have forecasted that Bitcoin price could surge to $130,000 by 2025 when more institutions embrace the cryptocurrency. Moreover, for Bitcoin to continue with the upward trend, it needs to hold some important levels, the $100,000 in question being the most critical. Going above $108,231 might open the way to new record highs; the next significant level is $150,000. Source:X Yeti Ouro: A promising altcoin in the market Yeti Ouro, a community-driven cryptocurrency project, has already sold an impressive 147,000,000 tokens during its ongoing token presale, allowing Stage 2 of the presale to reach 45.1% completion. The presale offers participants unique perks on all purchases during this stage, with each YETIO token priced at $0.017. This early success demonstrates a strong interest in the project’s vision and tokenomics structure. The project also prioritizes security and transparency, a recent audit from SolidProof, a trusted name in blockchain security is a testament to that. The Yeti Ouro project aims to build an ecosystem that blends financial empowerment with engaging blockchain-based experiences. The presale provides an opportunity for investors to support the project’s development, including the upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game, YetiGo, built on Unreal Engine 5. The game promises fast-paced action and unique player rewards, appealing to both gamers and blockchain enthusiasts. A recent YouTube video is going viral, suggesting Yeti Ouro to be the next 100x meme coin. According to the white paper, Yeti Ouro aims to list decentralized and centralized platforms after the presale based on its strategic map. Future phases are staking, yield farming, and the public beta of YetiGo. With a large and strong community base and partnerships with the cryptocurrency industry, Yeti Ouro is positioning itself as a unique player in the cryptocurrency space, offering utility and entertainment to its supporters.

Metaplanet, known as Asia's MicroStrategy and following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy in accumulating BTC, announced its goal of accumulating 10 thousand Bitcoins by the end of 2025 and 21 thousand Bitcoins by the end of 2026. Metaplanet also announced that it raised 116 billion yen ($745 million) by issuing 21 million shares via 0% discount strike options to increase its Bitcoin holdings. At this point, Metaplanet has made the largest Bitcoin-focused capital raise in Asian stock market history. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich stated that the issuance is part of the company's “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only” strategy. “The market has recognized Metaplanet as Tokyo’s leading Bitcoin company, and we are using this momentum to solidify our position as a global leader. Our vision is to lead a Bitcoin renaissance in Japan and emerge as one of the largest institutional Bitcoin holders globally. This plan is our commitment to that future. The latest share issuance is also in line with the company’s plans to continue increasing its bitcoin holdings amid the yen’s depreciation and Bitcoin’s all-time high. We do not measure performance in fiat currencies like yen or dollars; our yardstick is Bitcoin itself. Our mission is to maximize Bitcoin per share for our shareholders.

In an interview with the Paul Barron Network, Yusko revealed that Morgan Creek Capital does not own any XRP tokens, citing a lack of demand for the asset from their partners. XRP and Institutional Demand He explained that Morgan Creek Capital’s investment strategy focuses on digital asset infrastructure, emphasizing projects with significant adoption and utility. While the firm holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin and a smaller portion of Ethereum and Solana, XRP has not been included in its portfolio. According to Yusko, this is due to minimal interest in the token among key funding and development groups. He also mentioned that other tokens, such as Dogecoin, fall into the same category of low demand and limited adoption. He stressed that his company prioritizes platforms with active development and use cases, stating that XRP has not shown enough traction among the groups they engage with to warrant an investment. Despite its current exclusion, Yusko outlined the circumstances under which the asset could be added to Morgan Creek Capital’s portfolio. He stated that the firm would only consider investing in the token if it gains significant adoption within the banking sector, particularly as a replacement for the SWIFT payment system. This adoption would include endorsements or usage by major financial institutions such as JPMorgan and Bank of America . Yusko acknowledged that Ripple has marketed its native token as a solution for the financial industry. Nevertheless, he questioned whether sufficient lobbying or adoption efforts could make this vision a reality. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Concerns About Centralization One of Yusko’s main criticisms of this asset is its perceived lack of decentralization. He emphasized that Bitcoin remains a superior alternative due to its decentralized architecture and well-established network. XRP’s centralization issues were a key reason why XRP and Stellar (XLM) were excluded from Morgan Creek’s cryptocurrency index fund. Yusko also expressed skepticism about Ripple’s lobbying efforts to promote XRP as part of a multi-asset crypto reserve . He argued that such initiatives could undermine Bitcoin’s position as the most reliable foundation for digital asset reserves. Ripple’s Response to Criticism As reported by Times Tabloid, Ripple has been criticized for its alleged lobbying against a Bitcoin-focused reserve. CEO Brad Garlinghouse, however, has defended Ripple’s actions, stating that their efforts aim to increase the likelihood of a diverse cryptocurrency reserve that includes multiple tokens. Garlinghouse has positioned Ripple’s strategy as aligned with broader industry goals, emphasizing the importance of fostering innovation across different digital assets. While Yusko has outlined a clear path for reconsidering the token, his stance reflects broader concerns within the cryptocurrency industry about the asset’s centralization and its ability to compete with Bitcoin.

With the former thesis in mind, where are the discount levels to buy $DOGE, $PEPE, and $WIF? $DOGE at strong horizontal support Source: TradingView Of all the memecoins, $DOGE is still very much the leader, ranked 8th by market capitalisation, it is also probably the best positioned from a technical analysis perspective, compared to any of its nearest competitors. As can be seen in the weekly chart above, $DOGE is positioned above the strong $0.31 horizontal support, and is also knocking at the door of $40.337, which could soon also become support. If this level can indeed be flipped into support, the next target would be the 0.5 Fibonacci at $0.39, and then the 0.618 Fibonacci at $0.47, which is only just below the local high. Did $PEPE touch bottom? Source: TradingView $PEPE, one of the other more successful memecoins, arguably touched bottom on Monday during the Deepseek-inspired crypto downturn. While there could still be more downside price action, and even a descent to horizontal support at $0.0000099, this could be a good place to start building a position. $WIF at last-ditch support Source: TradingView Unlike the two previous memecoins, Dog Wif Hat (WIF) looks extremely problematic. There are charts with earlier price action than the Binance weekly chart above, but the last ditch support level at $1.08 remains the same. If this level gives out, a rapid descent to $0.34 would likely follow, and the bull market would then very probably be over for $WIF. For anyone interested in a high-risk bet, buying here, or at support, with a very tight stop loss could come good if the market is ready to turn.

Pepe investors betting on low entry point for massive returns Pepe Coin investors are now looking to replicate their past successes by betting on another low-entry token that has the potential for massive returns. The idea of investing a modest amount, such as $340, and turning it into $30,000 is becoming an attractive prospect once again. This new token, priced under $0.015, shares similar characteristics to PEPE, which saw tremendous gains last year. Investors who missed out on earlier opportunities are now eyeing this fresh contender, hoping it could replicate the rapid rise in value that propelled PEPE Coin.

From a technical analysis standpoint, it appears to be in a strong position compared to its closest rivals. The weekly chart above shows $DOGE positioned just above a robust $0.31 horizontal support, and it's approaching the $40.337 level, which might soon become another support level. Should this level be transformed into support, the subsequent targets would be the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.39, followed by the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.47, just under the recent high.

Rexas Finance (RXS): Realising the Next Step in Asset Tokenization Currently, Rexas Finance is leading in asset tokenization, allowing retail investors to invest in otherwise inaccessible high-end luxury components like real estate by purchasing tokenized fractions. A market construct previously controlled by institutions is now democratized, and RXS is suited for the average investor. Rexas Finance’s presale was successful, selling 414 million tokens and raising $39.1 million. Moving on to the 11th stage, RXS tokens are sold at $0.175, marking a huge difference from stage 1, where they were set at $0.03. Such improvement across stages reflects the trust and optimism the market has in Rexas as a long-term investment. Rexas Finance has also conducted a $1 million giveaway to celebrate its early backers and aid in user engagement alongside the already granted utility. Twenty participants selected by the company will be given $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, which is bound to create even more interest. Thanks to its listings on the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms and the CertiK audit of its website, Rexas Finance is positioning itself for enduring growth. While the present price is affordable due to its originality, evidence points to an impressive performance from the token in the upcoming market cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin That Keeps on Surprising Us Dogecoin, trading at $0.3219 with a market capitalization of around $47.51 billion, continues to amuse the crypto community. It has evolved greatly from being a joke to a serious business opportunity. Analyst Cephii claims Dogecoin will likely reproduce the same success it enjoyed in 2021 when the doge soared over 1100% in value within a week after the US presidential inauguration. According to Cephii’s research, Dogecoin might soon enjoy another rally, easing DOGE’s ascent. Kevin, a Dogecoin analyst, is extravagantly bullish about the currency, pegging it to $4 within this cycle. This perspective is supported by DOGE's strong devotion and its use case in retail transactions. For many investors, Dogecoin offers high returns at low risk. Its past performance and current market stance multiply the returns greatly for anyone seeking massive portfolio growth. XRP: The Cryptocurrency That Seems Poised for Another Breakout Cross-border financial transactions have always been a pain point due to the fees involved. This area, which Ripple focuses on, has enabled Ripple to gain the support of numerous institutional investors. XRP, priced at $2.45, has a market cap of $140 billion, making it one of the largest coins. Analysts remain optimistic about XRP's future. Peter Brandt, an established price chart analyst, expects the price of XRP to hit approximately $8.70. He says this is due to the expected surge in its accessible market cap, which he claims could reach almost $500 billion. Brandt bases his opinion on the flag pattern present in the XRP currency chart and states that it is likely to resolve in the upcoming six weeks, potentially leading to a spike in price. The ongoing legal battles with the SEC are also expected to clarify the broader implications and relevance of Ripple's currency. Investors will likely become more confident as the case draws closer to an end, adding bullish pressure to XRP's price. Ripple’s extensive reach and bullish sentiment make it easier for investors to decide whether to invest in this token, which would facilitate better and faster payments. Considering all the milestones Ripple has reached, the coming months in the cryptocurrency market should be interesting. Bonk (BONK): The Meme Coin on the Rise Bonk, currently at $0.00002494 and with a market valuation of $1.90 billion, is starting to receive ample attention as the next hot meme coin. Like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Bonk has gained a large and viral fanbase that will likely propel its price upward. Bonk’s price tag is significantly low, and the cost of entry is also very reasonable, which attracts small-scale investors. The growing community and wider adoption trend could propel Bonk, rewarding early champions handsomely. For investors keen on memes, Bonk can be an option to ride the meme coin trend, though speculation is a major factor. In terms of investment volatility, this coin will be a relatively secure buy considering its low price, making it suitable for crypto asset diversification. Conclusion Rexas Finance , Dogecoin, Ripple, and Bonk are low-risk altcoin cryptocurrency assets. Each has the potential to turn a small investment into significant wealth. RXS has carved its niche with tokenization, DOGE thrives from memes, XRP appeals to institutions, and Bonk encapsulates the meme coin economy's aesthetic appeal. With practical, real-world usage and a successful presale, Rexas Finance is a strong candidate for exponential growth. Dogecoin's persistence suggests further potential for gains, while Ripple’s technical patterns hint at a major breakout. Bonk offers a playful yet promising investment for meme coin enthusiasts. These four cryptocurrencies provide a solid foundation for multiplying a $300 investment tenfold to $30,000. With the next bull cycle just around the corner, the time to act is now.

Among these are some relatively low-risk altcoins such as Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Bonk (BONK), which appear to have a solid chance of substantial growth, even with modest investments. These digital currencies stand out due to their solid market presence, unique applications, and optimistic forecasts, positioning them well for significant returns. Rexas Finance (RXS): Leading the Charge in Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance is at the forefront of asset tokenization, enabling individual investors to participate in high-end luxury assets like real estate by acquiring tokenized shares. This market, once exclusive to institutions, is now open to everyday investors, with RXS being an ideal choice. The successful presale of Rexas Finance saw 414 million tokens sold, raising $39.1 million. Now in its 11th stage, RXS tokens are priced at $0.175, a significant rise from the initial stage price of $0.03. This growth across stages indicates the market's confidence and optimism in Rexas as a viable long-term investment. To further engage users and celebrate early supporters, Rexas Finance launched a $1 million giveaway. Twenty winners will receive $50,000 in RXS tokens, likely boosting interest further. With listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and a CertiK audit of its platform, Rexas Finance is positioning itself for sustained success. Although the current price is still accessible due to its novelty, signs suggest that the token will perform impressively in future market cycles. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Ever-Surprising Meme Coin Dogecoin, with a trading price of $0.3219 and a market cap of roughly $47.51 billion, continues to entertain and intrigue the crypto world. What started as a joke has turned into a serious business opportunity. Analyst Cephii suggests that Dogecoin could replicate its 2021 success when it surged over 1100% in just a week following the U.S. presidential inauguration. Cephii's analysis indicates another rally could be on the horizon, aiding DOGE's rise. Kevin, another Dogecoin analyst, is optimistic, forecasting a $4 price within this cycle. This outlook is backed by DOGE's dedicated community and its growing use in retail transactions. For many, Dogecoin offers substantial returns with minimal risk, making it an attractive option for those looking to significantly grow their portfolios. XRP: A Cryptocurrency Ready for a Major Move Cross-border transactions have long been burdened by high fees, an issue Ripple aims to solve, earning it the backing of numerous institutional investors. XRP, priced at $2.45 with a market cap of $140 billion, ranks among the largest digital currencies. Analysts remain hopeful about XRP's potential. Veteran chart analyst Peter Brandt predicts XRP's price could reach around $8.70, driven by an expected increase in its market cap, potentially soaring to nearly $500 billion. Brandt's forecast is based on a flag pattern in XRP's chart, which he believes will resolve in the next six weeks, possibly leading to a price surge. The ongoing SEC legal battles are also expected to shed light on Ripple's broader implications, likely boosting investor confidence as the case progresses, adding upward pressure to XRP's price. Ripple's widespread influence and positive sentiment simplify the decision for investors considering this token, facilitating faster and more efficient payments. With all of Ripple's achievements, the next few months in the crypto market promise to be exciting. Bonk (BONK): The Emerging Meme Coin on the Rise Bonk, currently priced at $0.00002494 with a market cap of $1.90 billion, is gaining traction as the next big meme coin. Like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Bonk has amassed a large, viral following that could drive its price higher. Its low price and affordable entry cost appeal to small investors. The expanding community and increasing adoption could propel Bonk, offering substantial rewards to early adopters. For meme coin enthusiasts, Bonk presents an opportunity to capitalize on the meme coin trend, though it remains speculative. With relatively low investment volatility, Bonk is a secure option for diversifying crypto assets. Conclusion Rexas Finance , Dogecoin, Ripple, and Bonk are low-risk altcoin cryptocurrency assets.

According to the official, the public engagement will occur through scheduled roundtables in the next few months. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has initiated public engagement through its acting chair, Caroline Pham. According to the announcement, the body will hold scheduled public roundtable discussions involving crypto space leaders and market participants to reshape crypto policies in America.

According to the announcement, the commission aims to address key issues in markets such as affiliated entities, prediction markets, and conflicts of interest in evolving trends and market structures. “The CFTC will get back to basics by hosting staff roundtables that will develop a robust administrative record with studies, data, expert reports, and public input. A holistic approach to evolving market trends will help to establish clear rules of the road and safeguards that will promote US economic growth and American competitiveness.” ~ Caroline Pham, acting chair of the CFTC The commission will schedule roundtable discussions with industry leaders and market participants in the following months to allow the commission to collect data and opinions. The roundtable discussions are set to encourage collaboration among the various stakeholders to gather insights, inform regulatory frameworks, and ensure transparency in policymaking. The announcement also detailed that the commission’s acting chair renewed calls for public engagement last year to promote transparency in the commission when implementing policy changes in the derivatives markets. The roundtable proposal comes just a week after CFTC commissioners voted for Pham as the regulator’s acting chair after U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Trump has yet to nominate his preferred candidate as the commission’s chair. The former CFTC chair, Rostin Behnam, stepped down from his official role on January 20 but will remain in the commission until February 7. In one of his final statements , Behnam urged the incoming legislatures to curb the gaps in digital assets. Donald Trump’s administration promised to make America the global crypto hub ahead of foreign adversaries such as China. While speaking at the Bitcoin Conference 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump promised the crypto community that industry rules would be written by “those who love your industry, not hate your industry.” In this regard, Trump vowed to create a “bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council.” Trump begins regulatory reforms for the crypto industry As part of these developments, Trump promised to fire former SEC chair Gary Gensler, who resigned on January 20. Gensler was well known in the industry for aggressive enforcement actions against crypto participants and organizations. Trump’s appointments in key regulatory roles also show that his administration is shaping up to bring a new approach to crypto. He appointed pro-crypto candidate Paul Atkins to replace Gensler as the new SEC chair. Trump recently ordered the establishment of a digital asset working group to promote new recommendations around cryptocurrencies. The order also involved exploring the creation of a national crypto stockpile for the U.S. Treasury as part of fulfilling his promises to the crypto community. The anticipation is that the U.S. will set the pace for other countries to also consider making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset. Countries such as Russia, Poland, Germany, and Hong Kong have already initiated discussions about adopting the digital asset. The Trump effect has caused a ripple effect among lawmakers. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century passed the House of Representatives in May 2024 and is expected to go to the Senate for a vote. The bill clarifies the United States securities and commodities regulator’s roles in regulating crypto and could play a key role in the growth of digital assets in America.

Volgens hem zou een nationale digitale asset reserve niet beperkt moeten blijven tot BTC, maar ook altcoins zoals XRP en Ethereum moeten omvatten. Dit zou de hele cryptosector ten goede komen en samenwerking stimuleren in plaats van rivaliteit. In dit artikel gaan we dieper in op de impact van een gediversifieerde crypto reserve en welke crypto hier mogelijk van kunnen profiteren. Crypto reserve: Meer dan alleen Bitcoin? Brad Garlinghouse, de CEO van Ripple, heeft onlangs zijn standpunt gedeeld over de discussies rondom het plan van de Amerikaanse overheid om een nationale digitale asset reserve te creëren. Wat begon met Bitcoin is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een breder initiatief dat andere crypto, zoals XRP, omvat. Dit heeft geleid tot een levendige discussie binnen de cryptowereld, met uiteenlopende meningen over het opnemen van meerdere crypto in de reserve. Ondanks de groeiende aanwezigheid van Ripple in de VS, blijft Garlinghouse zich inzetten voor een multichain toekomst en samenwerking binnen de cryptosector. “De crypto-industrie heeft nu de kans om onze gezamenlijke doelen te bereiken, maar alleen als we samenwerken in plaats van elkaar neer te halen,” stelde hij in een bericht op X. Some thoughts on maximalism… let me say this as clearly as I can – the crypto industry has a real shot, here and now, to achieve the many goals we have in common, IF we work together instead of tearing each other down. This is not, and never will be, a zero-sum game. • I own… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 27, 2025 Garlinghouse gaf aan dat hij zelf XRP, BTC en ETH bezit, wat zijn overtuiging in een multichain toekomst illustreert. “Ik heb altijd gepleit voor een gelijk speelveld waar tokens niet tegen elkaar worden uitgespeeld,” voegde hij toe. Hij benadrukte dat maximalisme – de overtuiging dat slechts één crypto dominant moet zijn – nog steeds een obstakel vormt voor de groei van de industrie. Volgens hem begint deze gedachtegang gelukkig minder populair te worden. Onder zijn leiderschap is Ripple in gesprek gegaan met toezichthouders om te zorgen voor een duidelijk juridisch kader voor de adoptie van XRP als digitaal reserve-asset. Garlinghouse benadrukte dat een nationale reserve de hele industrie zou moeten vertegenwoordigen, en niet slechts één specifieke munt. ‘Als er een digitale asset reserve door de overheid wordt gecreëerd, vind ik dat deze gediversifieerd moet zijn. Het zou niet om één token moeten gaan, of dat nu BTC, XRP of een ander is,’ verklaarde hij. Hieruit rijst dan ook de vraag: wat betekent dit voor de toekomst van crypto? Bitcoin-reserve opent deuren voor altcoins De mogelijke invoering van een Bitcoin-reserve door de Amerikaanse overheid is al bullish nieuws voor Bitcoin. Maar als ook andere altcoins, zoals Ethereum en XRP, worden opgenomen in deze reserve, kan dit de altcoin markt een enorme boost geven. Veel altcoins zouden hiervan kunnen profiteren. Het is daarom interessant om te onderzoeken welke opkomende crypto mogelijk de grootste voordelen kunnen behalen. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) De eerste presale die lijkt te kunnen gaan profiteren van een mogelijke crypto reserve is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE). Dit enorm succesvolle meme coin project is geïnspireerd op het virale personage Pepe the Frog en biedt daadwerkelijke waarde aan tokenhouders. Wall Street Pepe heeft als doel kleine handelaren en investeerders een krachtige tactische voorsprong te geven door hoogwaardige marktinzichten en analyses te bieden. Historisch gezien hebben institutionele spelers betere middelen gehad om veelbelovende kansen vroeg te signaleren, wat nieuwere en kleinere marktdeelnemers op een groot nadeel zet. Making calls. Numbers go up. Getting it done. 🐸⚔️ pic.twitter.com/di6kxYJjLU — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 27, 2025 Door WEPE tokens te bezitten, sluit je je aan bij de ‘WEPE Army’ – een exclusieve trading community met directe toegang tot geselecteerde marktalerts, geavanceerde crypto-analyses en alpha calls die verborgen parels in de cryptowereld belichten. De presale van Wall Street Pepe heeft al meer dan $62,4 miljoen opgehaald. De huidige tokenprijs is $0,0003665, maar de presale eindigt over minder dan 19 dagen – wat betekent dat de prijs naar verwachting snel zal stijgen zodra WEPE op grote crypto-exchanges wordt gelanceerd. Naar de officiële website van Wall Street Pepe Solaxy (SOLX) De tweede presale die naar onze mening potentie heeft, is Solaxy (SOLX). Ondanks Solana’s reputatie voor razendsnelle transacties en extreem lage kosten, heeft zware handelsactiviteit het netwerk af en toe tot het uiterste belast. Solaxy introduceert de eerste layer 2 solution voor Solana, waarmee transacties off-chain worden verwerkt voordat ze gebundeld en afgehandeld worden op het hoofdnetwerk van Solana. Deze aanpak vermindert effectief de belasting op Solana en zorgt ervoor dat de blockchain soepel blijft werken, zelfs tijdens pieken in handelsvolumes. Veel whales hebben het potentieel van dit idee al herkend, aangezien Solaxy meer dan $15,6 miljoen heeft opgehaald via de presale van SOLX—de native cryptocurrency van Solaxy, die gebruikt zal worden om transactiekosten op het netwerk te betalen. Daarnaast biedt Solaxy een staking pool voor SOLX, met een APY van 253% per jaar. Voordat het de volgende fase van de presale ingaat, kunnen vroege kopers nog steeds SOLX bemachtigen voor slechts $0,001618. Naar de officiële website van Solaxy Best Wallet (BEST) Een andere presale die veel handelaren met interesse volgen, is de virale Best Wallet Token (BEST). Dit is de utility- en ecosystem-token van een crypto wallet die veel meer biedt dan alleen het opslaan van tokens. Best Wallet biedt ook staking, swapping, directe presale-investeringen en nog veel meer—all via één smartphone-app. Daarnaast heeft het een speciale sectie ‘Upcoming Tokens’ waar je nieuwe presales kunt ontdekken. Recente vermeldingen in deze sectie zijn onder andere Pepe Unchained (PEPU) en Catslap (SLAP), die beide enorme winsten hebben geboekt na hun marktintroductie. Quests are better with friends. 🫡 Refer your crew to Best Wallet, stack $BEST together, and flex those rewards. They win, you win, everyone eats.

De presale van BEST heeft al meer dan $8,4 miljoen opgehaald, wat de positieve sentimenten rondom het Best Wallet-ecosysteem laat zien. Daarnaast biedt BEST een hoge staking-APY van meer dan 210%, wat op dit moment tot de hoogste in de markt behoort.

One project gaining significant attention is Lightchain AI (LCAI) , which combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to create a transformative platform for decentralized applications (dApps). With its presale raising $13.2 million at a price of $0.005625 per token, Lightchain AI is rapidly becoming a favored choice for investors seeking high-growth potential in 2025 and beyond. Ethereum - Strong but Facing Competition Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space remains unchallenged due to its extensive ecosystem, which powers decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. The transition to Ethereum 2.0 has enhanced its scalability and energy efficiency, making it more sustainable and attractive to developers and enterprises. However, Ethereum’s high transaction fees, also known as gas fees, continue to be a barrier for many users, particularly smaller investors. Additionally, the emergence of new blockchain projects offering lower costs, faster speeds, and specialized features is creating a competitive landscape. As Ethereum matures, some investors are diversifying their portfolios by exploring innovative platforms like Lightchain AI . Lightchain AI - Attracting Ethereum’s Top Investors Lightchain AI stands out as a revolutionary blockchain project designed to address critical challenges in scalability, privacy, and real-world utility. A defining feature of the platform is its predictive AI-powered transaction scheduler, which ensures optimal efficiency by dynamically prioritizing and processing transactions based on network demand. This innovation eliminates bottlenecks and enhances the performance of dApps, making it an appealing option for developers. The project also introduces a data privacy assurance layer, which leverages advanced encryption and secure processing protocols to protect sensitive user information. This focus on privacy makes Lightchain AI particularly suitable for enterprises handling critical data, such as healthcare providers and financial institutions. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s adaptive staking mechanism incentivizes network participation by adjusting rewards based on user engagement and network activity. This ensures a robust and decentralized ecosystem while providing consistent value to its stakeholders. Why Investors Are Moving from Ethereum to Lightchain AI The shift from Ethereum to Lightchain AI among top investors is driven by the latter’s ability to deliver solutions tailored to modern blockchain needs. While Ethereum offers a general-purpose platform, Lightchain AI’s integration of AI and blockchain unlocks new possibilities for efficiency, scalability, and innovation.

The project also features a data privacy assurance layer, utilizing robust encryption and secure processing methods to safeguard sensitive user data. This emphasis on privacy renders Lightchain AI especially appealing to businesses dealing with sensitive information, like healthcare providers and financial services. In addition, Lightchain AI’s adaptive staking mechanism motivates network participation by adjusting rewards according to user involvement and network activity. This fosters a strong and decentralized ecosystem while ensuring continuous value for its supporters. Reasons for the Shift from Ethereum to Lightchain AI The movement from Ethereum towards Lightchain AI by leading investors is influenced by the latter’s capacity to offer solutions tailored to contemporary blockchain demands. While Ethereum provides a general platform, Lightchain AI’s fusion of AI and blockchain opens up new avenues for efficiency, scalability, and creative innovation. Lightchain AI’s presale achievement is another aspect that strengthens investor trust. The $13.2 million accumulated so far indicates strong interest and widespread acknowledgment of its potential to revolutionize the blockchain sector. Experts anticipate that Lightchain AI’s growth path could surpass Ethereum’s in certain applications, especially in industries that require cutting-edge AI-driven solutions. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",More News,EN,0,0,ETH|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-01-28 13:39:45

MicroStrategy holds around 471,107 BTC , worth over $46 billion. The company’s stock price is often influenced by BTC’s volatility, but it remains subject to additional market dynamics unrelated to the cryptocurrency. Cramer highlighted this complexity, cautioning investors about the indirect nature of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure. Cramer’s Evolving Crypto Stance Cramer’s relationship with digital assets has been anything but consistent. Back in December 2022, following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, he publicly declared that he had sold off all his crypto holdings and warned investors to avoid the space entirely. In October 2023, Cramer doubled down on his skepticism, predicting a sharp downturn for Bitcoin and voicing concerns about its long-term viability. However, by January 2024, the host made a notable shift in his outlook, describing BTC as a “technological marvel” that had staged a remarkable comeback. He acknowledged its resilience despite ongoing regulatory resistance, remarking that the cryptocurrency is “here to stay.” Market Update and Bitcoin Resilience At present, BTC is trading just around $102,800 after a slight decline driven by market reactions to the Chinese AI venture DeepSeek, which negatively impacted tech stocks, including Nvidia. Despite these fluctuations, Bitcoin has maintained its position as a leading investment option for many. MicroStrategy shares have also remained near their all-time highs, with pre-market trading placing the stock at $347.92. While some investors continue to see the company as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, Cramer’s advice underscores the simplicity and clarity of holding the cryptocurrency directly. Whether Bitcoin or MicroStrategy will prove the better bet over time remains to be seen, but for now, Cramer appears to be firmly in Bitcoin’s corner.

Private After almost three years of development, AnchorWatch has rolled out its product — a collaborative bitcoin multisig vault that comes with an insurance policy. The company has created what it calls a Trident Vault, which utilizes smart contracts on Bitcoin to enable features like timelocks, multisig quorums and spending conditions, and AnchorWatch insures the bitcoin protected by these vaults as a Lloyd’s of London Coverholder . The combination of this technology plus world-class level of insurance helps protect AnchorWatch clients from risks related to theft, kidnappings, fraud or catastrophic events. It’s a level of protection that no Bitcoin company has offered to date. “We identified that insurance in the Bitcoin space was totally lacking,” AnchorWatch co-founder and COO Becca Rubenfeld told Bitcoin Magazine. “There are a few risks that technology can’t mitigate — like really sophisticated wrench attacks , a customer dying with their keys or even AnchorWatch being a bad actor — and we were able to plug those holes with the insurance.” The market has been primed for a product like this, as Rubenfeld and her team have been fielding a host of inquiries and requests for its product since the company opened its doors for business last month. And it’s ironic that Rubenfeld has found her niche in the Bitcoin industry in helping people and institutions secure and insure their bitcoin stacks, especially considering it was the fact that she didn’t see bitcoin as much more than a speculative tool that led to her meeting her co-founder at AnchorWatch, Rob Hamilton. The Origins Of AnchorWatch Rubenfeld and Hamilton first interacted in group chat rooms on the social media app Clubhouse in late 2020. “We met in Clubhouse Bitcoin rooms,” recounted Rubenfeld. “I was just trying to get trading alpha, and there were these guys in the rooms who were like the who’s who of Bitcoin. They ran Bitcoin companies, and they were core devs and cultural personalities. We were all just hanging out during the quarantine,” she added. “Everybody was starved for human connection, and we became friends. I got orange-pilled this way very quickly.” During this time, which Rubenfeld fondly refers to as her “masterclass in Bitcoin,” she first heard Hamilton discussing the need for bitcoin insurance. “Rob was just ideating and realized that he knew how he would build the tech to do that self-custody insurance,” said Rubenfeld. The likes of American HODL and Jason Williams urged Hamilton to build the product and were two of its first investors. Rubenfeld joined the cap table soon after, but quickly noticed that she had the capability to help Hamilton in other ways. “He was very busy building his MVP (minimum viable product), and I was like ‘Okay, Rob, so, just make sure to make a pitch deck, and you need a pro forma, and you need to do some forecasts, and, by the way, do you know much about insurance?’” explained Rubenfeld. Before long Rubenfeld began to complete these tasks and many others for Hamilton while he focused on coding. In doing so, she harnessed the skills that she’d gained during her years working in corporate for companies like Starbucks, Target and American Eagle. At first, she came on as a volunteer, but after pulling two all-nighters during her first week helping Hamilton, she realized she’d found a calling. “We were working very closely together, talking all day about the vision,” recalled Rubenfeld. “It was so intense and so much fun, and it was just kind of a change I was looking for compared to the work I’d been doing. So, after a little over a week, I told him, if we wanted to do this together, I would leave Starbucks and join full time. He was in, and so I joined as co-founder and COO a few days later,” she added. From that moment, Rubenfeld and Hamilton worked relentlessly — for almost three years. “We were in this office heads down 12 plus hours a day every single day,” said Rubenfeld. “Luckily, our investors remained patient as we went from zero to one.” The AnchorWatch Product As mentioned, AnchorWatch’s product enables its customers to manage and protect their bitcoin through a unique multisig setup for which AnchorWatch themselves holds some of the keys, while insuring said bitcoin with the backing of LLoyd’s of London, one of the largest and most reputable insurance companies in the world. Rubenfeld broke the product down in greater detail: “At the highest level, we are distributing custody of Bitcoin amongst multiple keys over time,” she explained. “With the timelocks, it allows you to have a standard way to manage your Bitcoin where the customer holds keys and AnchorWatch holds keys, but we're both required signers, which makes it a unique form of collaborative custody,” she added. “But then over time, additional ways to spend the Bitcoin become available, which enables disaster management and inheritance procedure assurances.” In other words, this timelock technology, which utilizes Bitcoin’s miniscript , allows for clients to access their bitcoin using different combinations of keys over time, which is useful if keys are lost, stolen or destroyed or become unavailable because of death or employee changes at company. And AnchorWatch is only required to sign the transaction so long as the customer continues its insurance policy with the company. If the customer chooses to cancel the policy, AnchorWatch can return the bitcoin to the originally agreed upon bitcoin address. AnchorWatch itself can never unilaterally control a customer’s bitcoin, and if AnchorWatch were to disappear, the vault can eventually be controlled by the customer’s keys alone once the policy ends. The flexibility to protect customers against many perils at the same time is the advantage of building with miniscript and embedding it with insurance. The insurance policies, which start at 0.55% of the value of a clients’ bitcoin holdings annually, cover amounts of bitcoin ranging from $250,000 to $100 million. “What’s unique about the product is that while you have an insurance policy and we, via Lloyd's of London, have financial liability, we have a key and we're a required signer,” explained Rubenfeld. “So, either we can sign in combination with the customer or, in the case of a customer death or a sophisticated wrench attack, then we could eventually sign in combination with a recovery institution,” she added. “But when your insurance policy ends if you don’t choose to renew with us, the vault can be controlled by the customer’s keys alone, as programmed into the bitcoin timelocks — all this is programmed at the protocol level, so it's verifiable on chain.” Initial Clients After launching in late December, the floodgates opened and potential clients began getting in touch. “The early response has been very, very strong,” said Rubenfeld. “Something like 180 people have reached out to inquire.” Rubenfeld also noted that the initial interest is coming from a mix of U.S.-based retail and commercial customers, though it skews heavier toward retail customers. Some are insuring their entire bitcoin holdings, while others are segmenting their bitcoin between multiple custody methods and are insuring a portion. “The typical retail customer is securing 5-15 bitcoin,” shared Rubenfeld. “80% of those who have signed up for the service are protecting between $300,000 and $3 million worth of bitcoin, and we’re in the process of working through underwriting on several large customers with much larger policies.” Rubenfeld assured me that AnchorWatch is prepared to handle larger accounts, and that she’s excited to be bringing AnchorWatch’s product to market at a time when corporate bitcoin strategies are becoming more popular. She expects to be getting calls from such clients as AnchorWatch establishes itself. “They’ll watch from afar for a little bit just to confirm that they're comfortable about how things are going before they make a move,” said Rubenfeld. “But we've had some large commercial clients reach out, and in some cases, they've got thousands of bitcoin, and they might be starting with a $10 million policy. So, they're just insuring a little bit, as they make sure that they're happy as customers. We enjoy this process and we feel confident as we serve them,” she added. “They've stated that if they're happy next year, they would move more bitcoin over to Trident to be covered.” The Ultimate Protection Rubenfeld believes that both AnchorWatch’s retail and corporate clients alike will find AnchorWatch’s services to be invaluable as it not only protects the clients’ bitcoin, but potentially even the clients themselves. “We’re an insurance company, but we’re actually protecting people,” explained Rubenfeld. “By the nature of both the technology and the insurance, which protects against wrench attacks, we are actually keeping people safe. Being an AnchorWatch customer disincentives wrench attacks, because, one, it’s incredibly hard to pull off a wrench attack with the way the vault is constructed, and, two, even if the attacker does pull off an attack the stolen bitcoin becomes the insurer’s property,” she added. “We have the resources of Lloyd's of London behind us and we're an insurance company:, we're going to be here for a hundred years, so we're going to hunt you forever.” Rubenfeld went on to explain how attackers wouldn’t have to just successfully pull off the heist, but never make a mistake in managing the stolen bitcoin until the day they die (which is tough considering that Bitcoin is a public ledger). Rubenfeld believes that this will lead to a trend in which clients willfully disclose that they’re an AnchorWatch customer (something AnchorWatch would never do on their behalf without their permission) as a means to dissuade attackers from even trying to steal from them. “I think what will happen is people will want to say, ‘Hey, I'm an AnchorWatch customer — don't even try it,’” said Rubenfeld proudly. “And so we take our work very seriously — we feel like we are protecting people, which is our mission.”",Business|AnchorWatch|Multisig|Insurance|miniscript,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-01-28 13:46:52

These include a pro-crypto US administration, the possibility of no tax on capital gains on US-based cryptocurrencies, and a viral TRUMP meme coin. Volatility has affected DOGE rivals, but it has also been resilient. Positive sentiment could be because the Department of Government Efficiency bill has been signed into law, and its website features the DOGE logo. Meme coins have been in the news because of the TRUMP coin, but it is becoming more noticeable that DOGE and the others are merely speculative assets, and their prices are rising and falling because of hype or lack of hype. This is compared to a token like DTX, which is backed by real-world utility and that will help surge its price once it is listed. Dogecoin Price Looking Ahead at $0.4 Dogecoin's price reclaimed $0.38 last week, and the DOGE logo on Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) website seems to have excited traders. Intense speculation and breakout towards $0.4 is imminent for the Dogecoin price. As Trump works towards modernizing the American financial system, the coincidental use of the name DOGE is sparking widespread speculation. There has been no formal announcement that there is a formal connection between Dogecoin and the department, but the Dogecoin price rose 5.2% within 24 hours of the executive order’s signing. Investors still await clarity, but the meme coin market is rife with activity, and we expect a new ATH for the Dogecoin price this year. Traders are optimistic and have held positions since September with 200% in unrealized gains with the DOGE token. There is very contained selling pressure, and the Dogecoin price has long-term bullish prospects due to growing institutional-sized investment inflows. DTX Exchange Surges Ahead The Dogecoin price surge of 2021 was historical. DTX Exchange is currently on that trajectory, and it is expected that its token will be listed at $0.2, but the price will shoot to $1 and then $2 in no time. This is because the token is powered by the DTX Exchange, a multi-asset trading platform set to revolutionize the global trading ecosystem. The DTX network has uncommon usability and unmatched security. It will let users trade fiat and crypto assets on one seamless platform and offer trading bots and AI trading tools to assist traders. DTX offers up to 1000x leverage, which means an investment of $100 can give access to liquidity of $100,000. This will enhance the high-stakes trading experience and make asset management easier for traders. DTX holders also have governance rights and can influence future product offerings, and large DTX holders are also offered profit sharing. It has a robust community at its back and is working to welcome more users. Currently, more than 400,000 downloads have been made for its non-custodial digital wallet, Phoenix Wallet, which supports over 10,000 assets. Key Takeaways Early investors of the DTX presale bought the token at $0.02; they have already made a 700% profit as the token is now at $0.16. DTX is the breakout star of 2025, and its revolutionary approach to trading will democratize centralized finance and make decentralized finance more approachable. DTX will redefine the global financial landscape, and for investors looking to diversify their portfolios, DTX is the best bet for low-entry positions in utility-based crypto tokens.

Despite its initial hype, the token’s lack of real-world utility has made it vulnerable to the industry’s shifting tides. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI is emerging as a favorite among serious investors, offering a compelling alternative through its seamless fusion of AI and blockchain technology. With a focus on innovation and sustainability, Lightchain AI is paving the way for long-term growth, capturing attention as a stable and promising contender in the crypto space. Melania’s Coin- Rapid Decline in Investor Confidence Melania Trump's cryptocurrency, $MELANIA, has experienced a significant decline in value since its launch. After peaking at $13.73, the coin's price plummeted by over 74% to $2.46, and as of now, it is trading at approximately $2.39. This sharp downturn mirrors the performance of the $TRUMP coin, which also faced substantial losses following the introduction of $MELANIA. Analysts attribute these declines to the speculative nature of meme coins, which often lack intrinsic value and are driven by market hype.

While DOGE’s meme-fueled hype has traders buzzing about its unpredictable swings, a seismic shift is underway. Savvy investors are chasing explosive gains elsewhere, and DTX Exchange is leading the charge, skyrocketing over 770% for its earliest backers. This meteoric rise eerily mirrors DOGE’s legendary 2021 rally, sparking whispers of a new altcoin giant. This disruptive force built on lightning-fast Layer 1 blockchain tech is designed to redefine trading efficiency and scalability. As DOGE’s price dances on the edge of uncertainty, DTX’s rapid adoption and institutional-grade infrastructure attract traders hungry for real ROI. Is history repeating itself? With DTX’s early gains rivaling DOGE’s glory days, crypto insiders are betting big on this dark horse. This post shares valuable insights. Analysts Speculate if the Dogecoin Price Could Recover Soon? Dogecoin was a crypto underdog in its early days. Thanks to viral meme culture and Elon Musk’s constant tweets, it skyrocketed to $0.74 in 2021. Those glory days feel like a distant memory now. Today, DOGE hovers around $0.3, down by 20% this week, moving farther away from its peak. Unlike projects with DeFi ecosystems or smart contracts, DOGE’s value still hinges on social media buzz and Elon’s whims. Notably, the coin’s loyal fans haven’t given up, hoping for a $0.74 comeback. However, experts believe hitting that target would require more than memes; DOGE needs real-world utility. While DOGE treads water, projects like DTX Exchange are rewriting the playbook, combining viral energy with actual innovation. Why Experts and DOGE Whales Bet on DTX Exchange’s Post-Presale Pump While Dogecoin faces uncertainty, big players are making moves, quietly shifting their stacks into DTX Exchange . This viral project has showered early backers with 770% gains, thanks to its utility and urgency. DTX aims to revolutionize trading. It takes a hybrid approach, blending the speed of a centralized exchange (Say, Coinbase) with the security of Decentralized Finance. This innovative feature will be powered by VulcanX, a lightning-fast layer-one blockchain that can process 200,000 transactions per second. While DOGE relies on Elon Musk’s tweets and meme magic, DTX solves real problems: slow trades, fragmented markets, and sketchy custodians. The project also introduces a decentralized custodial wallet in which only you control your assets and can move them independently. The real frenzy is in its $0.16 presale, which has already raked in over $13 million as whales pile in. Rumors swirl that once DTX hits major exchanges like Binance in 2025, that price could explode to $10 or higher—a 10,000% moonshot that would eclipse Dogecoin’s 2021 rally. As DOGE whales chase gains from Dogecoin, they’re also betting on something more significant: the future of trading. Dogecoin had its moment, but DTX could usher in an era where you can trade all sorts of assets without any bottleneck. The DTX Exchange’s presale is in its final round, and DTX tokens are being scooped at lightning speed. So, if you missed Doge at $0.05, this new viral project offers you a chance at redemption. Don’t miss out on DTX’s bullish prospects to the upside today. DTX Exchange Might Outshine Dogecoin’s Legacy This Q1 2025 The crypto world thrives on déjà vu! DTX Exchange’s 770% presale surge is reminiscent of Dogecoin’s 2021 rally. However, they offer different perspectives on value and growth. Dogecoin rode memes to stardom, and it delivered fantastic gains. Meanwhile, DTX is sprinting further and faster. It is a tech-powered titan that merges different assets under one hub, backed by a hybrid blockchain. Dogecoin’s historic rally was undoubtedly spectacular, but DTX’s hybrid innovation makes it a notable contender in the altcoin space. Experts aren’t speculating “if” but how “high” this new project will explode. So, it’s time to buckle up and align with what could be the best altcoin of the year.

On January 28, 2025, Bracket unveiled its flagship strategy management platform, ushering in Phase II of its product roadmap. The Launch of Bracket’s Flagship Platform Bracket’s new platform delivers a sophisticated approach to DeFi strategy management, allowing users to deposit brktETH into professionally managed strategy vaults. The platform connects ETH and LSTs to the most compelling yield opportunities on-chain and offers users a secure and transparent way to maximize their potential gains and enhance collateral efficiency. These vaults generate enhanced yields through a combination of ETH’s native returns, aggregated staking block rewards, and additional incentives such as Bracket’s [BARS] tokens and LRT points. The first ETH+ vault is open for deposits until February 3, providing brktETH holders a limited window to participate in this initial phase. brktETH serves as the central asset of the platform. This non-rebasing token is backed by a treasury comprising a diverse range of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), including prominent assets like stETH, rETH, and eETH. brktETH is a unique digital asset that accumulates value through a rising conversion rate, as opposed to the more traditional approach of increasing the total supply of tokens. Such a design fosters fungibility and improves collateral efficiency for DeFi participants. Bracket’s journey began with the Phase I launch in July 2024, which introduced staking opportunities for supported LSTs and LRTs. During this phase, early adopters earned rewards and incentives that set the stage for the platform’s evolution. This initial stage laid the groundwork for Phase II, which gives brktETH holders access to professionally curated strategies and seamless redemption options. After an initial five-day period, brktETH holders can redeem their tokens for an equivalent value of underlying treasury assets, which include Ethereum ($ETH, $wETH), Lido Staked ETH ($stETH, $wstETH), Rocket Pool ETH ($rETH), Ether.fi ETH ($eETH, $weETH), Kelp Restaked ETH ($rsETH), Stakestone ($STONE), and Coinbase ETH ($cbETH). As for assets with minimal balances, they will be automatically converted into supported tokens to streamline user experience. Future Prospects and Vision Liquid staking has quickly evolved as a prominent asset class in DeFi, but its growth has been hindered by fragmented liquidity and the lack of fungibility among LSTs. brktETH seems to become a universal collateral solution that makes assets move seamlessly between strategies. With one unified token, Bracket’s team reduces friction and makes things easier for users. The platform also stands for security and transparency through features such as Policy-Managed Wallets, detailed reporting, and adherence to strict investment mandates. These measures safeguard users’ funds while maintaining clarity on strategy execution. Mike Wasyl, CEO of Bracket, described the launch as a decisive moment for the platform. “Phase II takes us closer to our vision of creating a secure, user-friendly platform where DeFi participants can maximize their yields without compromising transparency or safety,” he pointed out. Bracket’s team plans to deepen the utility of its brktETH token and introduce more strategy vaults, expanding the range of supported assets. The team focuses on enhancing user interaction through a more intuitive platform interface to create a unified and secure ecosystem.",Information,EN,0,0,ETH|RPL|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-28 14:00:00

ETH+ integrates ETH’s native rewards, aggregated staking block rewards, and bonus incentives, including Bracket’s proprietary [BARS] tokens and LRT points, allowing users to customize their strategies. Inaugural ETH+ vault doors will be open from January 28 to February 3. brktETH and Bracket Phase II Bracket’s movement towards Phase II started in July 2024, with the Phase I rollout that enabled users to stake LSTs and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) and benefit from Bracket’s point-based rewards system. As such, Phase I laid the foundation for Phase II and brktETH, a non-rebasing token envisioned as the core asset on the platform and means of enhancing the fungibility and utility of LSTs and LRTs. Backed by assets such as stETH, rETH, and eETH, brktETH value is established relative to ETH via a rising conversion rate, not based on token supply. The token also serves as a universal collateral, streamlining the movement of assets across strategies, while the platform relies on Policy Managed Wallets , clear investment mandates, and transparent reports to safeguard user assets. This addresses liquidity fragmentation, enables DeFi users to move assets between strategies, and improves collateral efficiency. As for the redemption options, users can exchange brktETH for an equivalent value of underlying assets after an initial five-day lock-up, including Ethereum ($ETH, $wETH), Lido Staked ETH ($stETH, $wstETH), Rocket Pool ETH ($rETH), Ether.fi ETH ($eETH, $weETH), Kelp Restaked ETH ($rsETH), Stakestone ($STONE), and Coinbase ETH ($cbETH).

SSV 2.0 will be the most ambitious project for the SSV Network, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk, and will bring based applications (bApps) to Ethereum. “Based” applications, especially “based rollups,” are a new type of technology attracting the attention of Ethereum developers as it allows for better interoperability while improving the security of networks on top of Ethereum. Based rollups specifically can be seen as a solution to the many layer-2 networks on Ethereum today, which have caused much fragmentation across the space. By leveraging “based” technology, those protocols or applications can “base” their security and execution operations off of Ethereum’s layer-1 validator set. Currently, layer-2 networks use “sequencers” to order transactions and post those back to Ethereum. The issue with sequencers today is that they remain to be a centralizing component and can be a single point of failure. By using the validators from the layer-1 to do the execution and security work, networks can avoid the downfalls of using centralized sequencers. Furthermore, Ethereum developers agree that based rollups allow for better interoperability in the network. Ethereum ecosystem members have gathered over the last few weeks to find ways to solve this issue, and based rollups are seen as a major breakthrough for that. Now the SSV Network will also tackle these issues by bringing applications with based technology to Ethereum. According to the SSV team, bApps gain “security directly from the L1 instead of utilizing different tokens like in current restaking models, making them more Ethereum-aligned and not exposing Ethereum or its validators to cascading risks.” As part of that, the DAO is suggesting to turn the SSV Network into a bApp. “Transforming the SSV Network from a DVT-powered staking infrastructure into a multidimensional network for the based economy will necessitate an evolution of SSV tokenomics,” the team shared. (DVT, or distributed validator technology, refers to a type of tech that allows an Ethereum validator to run on multiple nodes simultaneously.) “This announcement marks a transformative leap for bootstrapping Ethereum security, addressing the growing demand for Layer 1 (L1)-anchored interoperable solutions - as seen with base sequencing and based validator commitments - amid increasing ecosystem fragmentation,” the SSV team said in the press release.

Privacy protocols have been a dubious wager in the digital asset space, but there are positive signs. The shielded pool on ZCash has grown by nearly 50% since last May. On-chain usage is low and borderline concerning. Daily active addresses are at multi-year lows and ZEC's network value to transactions ratio is at a 28-month-high. Cryptocurrencies have been large beneficiaries of speculative price gains since the election of President Donald Trump in the United States. In the time since Trump's inauguration on January 20th, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is roughly flat while other assets have shown a bit more volatility: Data by YCharts Privacy coins like Monero ( XMR-USD ) and ZCash ( ZEC-USD ) have seen opposite moves with XMR rallying by 7% and ZEC falling by 5%. In light of a crypto-friendly executive order released on January 23rd, there have been additional developments in the United States that I view as generally positive for privacy coins specifically. Tornado Cash Sanctions On January 21st, a US Court in Texas overturned sanctions against mixing protocol Tornado Cash (TORN-USD). In addition to the native token of the protocol exploding in price following the news, there have been calls from some in the industry for the president to pardon Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm and developer Alexey Pertsev. Despite being sanctioned by OFAC on accusations of money laundering, Tornado Cash has continued to function and has even seen growth in the total value locked in the protocol: Tornado Cash TVL (DefiLlama) At $534 million in TVL, Tornado Cash is the 62nd ranked 'DeFi' app by value locked and is far and away the largest privacy-themed application in the DeFi space. TVL growth aside, developers have gone inactive and usage fell off a cliff right after OFAC sanctions in 2022: Tornado Cash DAUs (Token Terminal) Prior to sanctions, Tornado Cash was used by several hundred wallet addresses per day. That number has fallen below 50 each of the last three months. From where I sit, there are interesting potential parallels between Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm and Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht. Given the latter's recent pardon and the overturned OFAC sanctions, there is some credence to the idea that privacy coins will gain more acceptance in the broader digital asset landscape. Privacy Coins: A Long Way To Go Data by YCharts I've written about privacy coins before on Seeking Alpha and have generally held a bullish view of ZCash in particular. There is no question ZEC has performed quite terribly over the last five years and anyone who bought the coin on my March 2022 'buy' call is regrettably underwater. Not only is ZEC down since that time, but the opportunity cost of buying ZEC rather than BTC in 2022 is self-evident in the chart above. This has been disappointing to say the least. However, I maintain that the initial vision of peer-to-peer cross-border payments with distributed ledger technology requires privacy to truly come to fruition. Privacy is a clear shortcoming of networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Monero - while aiming for privacy by default - lacks a fixed supply and utilizes what I view as inferior technology to ZCash. That hasn't stopped XMR from vastly outperforming ZEC over the last several years. ZCash has been plagued by 'bad news' for the better part of three years: Bloated blockchain from a spam attack in 2022 ECC Layoffs in 2023 Exchange delistings Generally poor wallet UE Zooko Wilcox leaving his role as ECC CEO in late 2023 Highly combative US regulatory regime in the post-FTX era One of the large reasons why I like ZCash over other attempts at on-chain privacy is the zero-knowledge technology. The key to the success of ZCash remains growth in the user base and the shielded ZEC pool. The question is, do we have that story? ZCash On-Chain Metrics After stagnating at about 1.3 million ZEC in the shielded pool for roughly a year between May 2023 and May 2024, there has been a clear move higher in ZEC coming into the shielded pool since last summer: Shielded ZEC Pool (Blockchair) At 1.9 million ZEC in the pool, about 13% of the circulating supply is now shielded and shielded pool growth is approaching 50% since May 2024. The more ZEC in the pool, the better privacy in ZCash ultimately can be. Importantly, the increased ZEC in the shielded pool has to be accompanied by increased usage. The latter of which is simply not happening to a strong enough degree: 30 Day Average, DAAs ( Coin Metrics ) The 30 day average active address count for ZCash is currently below 3k. In my time covering ZEC, this is the lowest level of usage I can recall seeing. This is particularly concerning when compared with competing privacy coin Dash ( DASH-USD ) which generally averages somewhere between 45-55k active addresses on a daily basis. On transacted value, ZCash is slightly stronger than Dash. Over a 30-day rolling average, ZCash is currently doing about $5 million in daily USD transfer volume. This is more than that of Dash, but both networks are a drop in the bucket compared to larger chains. 30 Day Average NVT Ratio ( Coin Metrics ) Perhaps most concerning though is ZEC can't even claim to be cheap based on a network value to transactions ratio. This takes the market capitalization of the coin and divides it by the annualized dollar value transacted over the network. ZEC spent most of 2023 and 2024 having one of the lowest NVT ratios of the legacy proof-of-work payment coins. That is no longer the case as ZEC's 256 NVT ratio is the highest multiple it has traded since September 2022. Closing Thoughts There are positive signs both in the regulatory world and in ZEC's growth in the shielded pool. In addition to court challenges that directly impact privacy protocols on-chain, there is language in President Trump's recent executive order about preserving self-custody and censorship resistance in peer-to-peer transactions. Each of which are crucial to the success of on-chain utility. For years, my view has been that the missing piece in real adoption of P2P crypto payment networks globally is privacy functionality. Like Tornado Cash, ZCash has seen usage deteriorate despite growing TVL/Shielded ZEC. I view that as generally indicative of an average crypto user that either isn't overly concerned with privacy or is flat out not willing to use protocols and networks that may be out of favor with authorities. Thus, ZCash is a largely speculative network that is home to a largely speculative asset. That asset has historically performed abysmally compared to the bigger coins in the space. Narratives generally drive this market and while privacy coins could certainly get a second look with an improving regulatory environment in the United States, betting on such an outcome should probably not be viewed as an 'investment.' Rather, a calculated risk in what is a larger portfolio that includes both real and digital assets. As a trade, ZEC can be feast or famine. I wouldn't rule out higher prices, especially in a broad alt-coin push. But longer term, I think ZEC is a hold.",XMR-USD|DASH-USD|ZEC-USD,EN,0,0,ZEC|BLOCKCHAIN|XMR|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-28 14:00:00
39613305,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=684738,1738072800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin Finally Turns $100K Into Support – Ready To Rally Higher?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-finally-turns-100k-into-support-ready-to-rally-higher/,"Bitcoin experienced a rollercoaster start to the week as the cryptocurrency dipped 5% below the critical $100K mark, only to recover and climb back above it. Monday’s price action highlighted the ongoing volatility in the market, leaving investors divided on Bitcoin’s next move. Some analysts are calling for a surge above the all-time high (ATH), while others warn of a potential continuation of the recent decline. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised To Test $2,800 Support Level If Market Downtrend Persists – Analyst Market sentiment remains mixed, with uncertainty dominating investor decision-making. However, Bitcoin’s resilience above the $100K level has sparked renewed optimism among bulls. Top crypto analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis, highlighting that Bitcoin has now turned $100,000 into a support level after two previous failed attempts. Jelle’s insights suggest that the psychological barrier has become a strong foothold for Bitcoin, setting the stage for potential upward momentum. As the market continues to watch for Bitcoin’s next move, the $100K level is now a critical zone to monitor. Whether Bitcoin surges toward a new ATH or faces another test of this support will likely shape the broader market narrative in the coming days. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim and hold $100K is a key indicator of its strength in this volatile phase. Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid Volatility Bitcoin has faced massive volatility since the start of the year, with price movements dominated by speculation and uncertainty. Despite these fluctuations, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, maintaining key demand levels and establishing new support zones. Analysts believe this could pave the way for a significant breakout in the coming weeks, with many eyeing an upward move toward new all-time highs (ATH). Top crypto analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the importance of Bitcoin’s recent price action. According to Jelle, “After two failed attempts, it looks like the third time is a charm indeed.” The $100,000 level, once a formidable resistance, has now turned into a solid support. This critical development underscores bullish momentum and sets the stage for a potential rally. Jelle noted that this shift in support indicates that bulls are gaining strength, positioning Bitcoin to rise higher and challenge its ATH. The broader market sentiment reflects cautious optimism. While uncertainty remains a driving force, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $100,000 signals strong investor confidence. The cryptocurrency’s recent stability at these levels suggests it may be primed for a decisive move upward. Analysts and investors are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s next steps, as reclaiming and holding above ATH would solidify its long-term bullish trajectory.

If Bitcoin successfully challenges its ATH, it could mark the start of a new phase of growth, reinforcing its dominance as the leading cryptocurrency. As the market watches closely, Bitcoin remains the focal point of investor speculation and bullish expectations. Trading Between Key Liquidity Levels Bitcoin is currently trading at $102,900, having secured strong support above the critical $100,000 level. This psychological barrier has become a key focal point for market participants, with bulls showing resilience in defending it after recent volatility. The ability to hold this level suggests the potential for further upward momentum in the short term. For bulls to confirm a continuation of the uptrend, BTC must hold above $100,000 and push above the $105,000 mark. Breaking this next significant resistance level would likely trigger renewed bullish momentum, attracting fresh buyers and potentially paving the way for a massive rally. Such a move could see BTC retest its all-time high and even venture into price discovery territory. However, the stakes remain high. A failure to sustain support above $100,000 could lead to a deeper consolidation phase, dampening market enthusiasm. This would likely result in a retest of lower demand zones, with traders closely watching for signs of further weakness.

The company's transition from Bitcoin mining to scalable computing models offers better margins and predictable results, along with rapid revenue growth. Bit Digital's strong balance sheet, with significant liquidity and no debt, supports its ambitious expansion plans in the data center business. The stock is undervalued compared to hybrid miners, with potential for significant upside if it holds $2.90 and breaks out of its ascending wedge pattern. Monday’s bloodbath in tech stocks took a number of names with it while much of the US market was actually higher on the day, as China's DeepSeek has the world questioning the AI trade. This bifurcation is extraordinary – particularly given the magnitude of some of the moves we saw – but it also means that some of these moves may have created great buying chances. One such name that is very near key support, but also has a strong outlook fundamentally, is Bit Digital (BTBT). The stock was down almost 16% on Monday, bringing key support into view once again against what looks like a strong fundamental backdrop. I’m therefore initiating Bit Digital with a Buy rating. The line in the sand As with many charts, Bit Digital has a very clear line in the sand. From a bullish perspective, I think you can be constructive on any price above $2.90. That was the low in October, then again in November, and then again in December. We saw $2.99 on Monday before a significant amount of buying late in the day, so that line is critically important. StockCharts The PPO shows rapidly improving medium-term momentum, albeit below the centerline. The RSI has been weak for months now, as it has failed on its last three attempts to crest 50. That’s not a good sign, so an early warning that Bit Digital may be starting its next rally phase is the RSI cresting 60. On the weekly chart, I think it looks much better. StockCharts We have an ascending wedge pattern that’s been forming for almost two years now, so any breakout of that should portend a massive move. For now, the PPO and price action make me think the odds are in favor of an upside breakout, but we’re talking about almost $6 to get that breakout, which is a long way up from here. Until further notice, this wedge provides buy and sell points that are pretty clearly defined. Transition away from Bitcoin fuels upside potential Bit Digital I think often gets lumped in with Bitcoin miners, and it does do that, to be fair. But this business is more about its computing model than Bitcoin in my view, and it should be valued as such. Investor presentation The company’s Bitcoin mining is a secondary thing at this point as management has been focused on building out capacity in the first two buckets in this graphic. These provide more scalability, better margins, and more predictable results than Bitcoin mining over the long-term, so Bit Digital is diversifying in this way. Seeking Alpha The company’s revenue is exploding higher, rising a projected 138% in 2024, 54% this year, and 66% next year. Obviously, a lot has to go right for these figures to come to fruition, and the last three revisions have been down. But we’re looking at an extremely rapid growth here even if Bit Digital doesn’t get all that close to these values. This is a very small company, so its ability to fund its expansion is key. However, Bit Digital’s balance sheet looks to me like it can fund the company’s expansion plans, which is key for the growth story. Investor presentation There’s no debt here, and as far as I can tell, no need to take on any in the near future. There’s roughly $75 million of Bitcoin, $106 million in cash, and about $87 million of Ethereum. For a company with a market cap of $459 million, that’s a lot of liquidity. The below is an example of a transaction that’s attractive for Bit Digital as it builds out computing capabilities. Investor presentation This one was $46 million, generating ~$2 million in annual revenue per MW, which is currently fully leased for 4 MW. There’s enormous expansion capacity, however, so its transactions like this that build out the potential for explosive revenue growth for Bit Digital that we looked at above. Of course, there’s risk this doesn’t come to fruition, but this is a small cap, growth-stage company so risk is the name of the game. The company believes it has 288 MW of capacity in the pipeline, with letters of intent covering about a third of that. Investor presentation We can see the current bucket in the donut chart is a very small sliver of the total so I’ll reiterate the risk again. A bet in Bit Digital is a bet this capacity comes on line and is used by customers; none of this is guaranteed. The data center business has very high margins so in the event most or all of this capacity comes on line down the road, Bit Digital’s revenue will be several multiples of what it is today. That’s the bet here, and it’s a bit binary if I’m honest because without it, Bit Digital doesn’t have much for investors. That’s because the mining business is way too small to justify the current valuation. Investor presentation Bit Digital mines Bitcoin, exchanges some of it for Ethereum, which it then stakes, and then reinvests the yield from that to more miners. It’s an interesting process and Bit Digital is making it work, but it’s only mining 165 Bitcoin per quarter, which is an annual run rate of ~$65 million in revenue. That’s fine, but the data center business is much more interesting. This is where it comes together It seems Bit Digital’s shares are being assigned a lower valuation than perhaps they should be, which is where the opportunity arises. To be clear, Bit Digital’s shares are unbelievably volatile, with one-month call options showing ~190% volatility. That’s about 15X the S&P 500, so it’s extreme. But if you can stomach that kind of thing, there’s opportunity. Investor presentation Management thinks the stock is valued at about one-third that of hybrid miners, which in my view is the closest group to Bit Digital’s business. It should not be valued like a pure data center company, nor should it be valued like a pure Bitcoin miner. If we look at enterprise value to revenues for the selected group, we can see that it does indeed appear Bit Digital is cheap. TIKR It’s about half the valuation of WULF and CORZ on this measure, and with massive growth in the pipeline for BTBT, it certainly looks cheap to me. The bottom line here is that short-term, it needs to hold $2.90. Assuming it can do that, I like the stock to make another run at the top of its current trading range, and perhaps later this year, breakout of the ascending wedge. For now, I’m sticking a Buy rating on Bit Digital.",BTBT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MINING|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-28 14:02:23

However, development is on a worrying trajectory. The rise of DeFi, along with other verticals such as gaming, NFTs, and meme coins, has created a growing demand for block space. The proliferation of new blockchains and Layer 2 platforms aims to meet this demand, but with liquidity and users increasingly fragmented , the user experience and networking benefits end up becoming degraded. If the sector continues on this trajectory, DeFi will increasingly struggle to attract new users as the overwhelming choice and lack of clear differentiation become off-putting. The need to navigate multiple interfaces with different requirements for wallets, onboarding, or login credentials also creates friction, acting as a further deterrent. Moreover, increasing fragmentation could even drive away existing users. With lower liquidity on any given chain, trading becomes inefficient and risky, with a higher chance of slippage and increased costs resulting from navigating multiple chains and protocols for different activities such as lending, trading, or staking. Papering over the cracks Those within the ecosystem are well aware of these challenges, and many solutions have emerged to mitigate them. Bridges and aggregators can enable users to transact more easily across chains, but they also introduce additional friction, potentially more costs, and points of vulnerability that can be exploited by hackers. Token derivatives, also known as wrapped tokens, can reduce the need to transact across chains, but low liquidity can result in unreliable pricing that deviates heavily from the underlying asset. Furthermore, the recent legal furor between Coinbase and wBTC issuer BiT Global over the former’s delisting of wrapped Bitcoin underscores the risks involved with using wrapped assets issued by centralized entities. Ultimately, solutions such as bridges or token derivatives are Band-Aid fixes that increase fragmentation without any sustainable benefits for users. In a noisy market where projects are increasingly sinking into obscurity due to their inability to stand out, which projects are managing to find their USP? Platform launches are a regular occurrence these days, but one Layer 2 announcement of recent months packs some serious brand credentials. Soneium is the Layer 2 blockchain built on the Optimism Foundation’s OP Stack infrastructure by none other than Sony. In a sector where it’s still relatively novel to see legacy brands take such a substantial leap of faith, Soneium stands out for its Sony brand credentials. Which is one factor that makes the launch of SONEX , an AI-powered DEX built on Soneium, particularly interesting. However, SONEX isn’t relying only on Sony’s brand power to make a mark in DeFi. As a DeFi aggregator, it takes a multifaceted approach designed to appeal to users from beginners to advanced traders. A fresh approach for broad appeal Leveraging the technical capabilities of Soneium, SONEX promises to deliver improved transaction speeds, security, and user accessibility. Traders benefit from multi-chain support that aggregates assets and liquidity from across the blockchain ecosystem into its modular protocol. This liquidity facilitates SONEX’s position as an all-in-one DeFi solution. Trading is enhanced by alpha hunting features enabled by AI agents that offer personalized insights into markets and trends, enabling traders to optimize their strategies and flattening the learning curve for newer traders. With Sony as one of the leading brands in global entertainment, it’s hardly surprising that Soneium and its ecosystem, including SONEX, are positioning themselves in the same domain. SONEX ultimately envisions DeFi services that are integrated and aligned with entertainment applications, such as incorporating gaming and GameFi mechanics into financial products to make it easier and more engaging to use blockchain technology. Such features aim to appeal to a wider global audience beyond those who would typically use DeFi and blockchain applications. SONEX’s mainnet launch on January 28 follows a successful seed raise of $1 million from investors, including Outliers Fund and Flow Traders, among others. The project was also one of just 32 projects selected from over 1,700 applications for the Soneium Spark incubation program. While the pace and scale of DeFi innovation have been impressive, the sheer pace at which things have developed seems to have dwindled into the territory of diminishing returns. Perhaps a fresh approach, leveraging the multifaceted entry points to DeFi with the boost of a legacy brand association, could help to reverse the trend and create a smoother and more engaging experience for users. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As the largest NFT marketplace on Sui, TradePort streamlines and enhances NFT trading across multiple blockchain networks, which currently include Sui, Aptos, NEAR, Movement, and Stacks. Walrus Protocol, which launched its Testnet in October of 2024, stores and delivers large unstructured data files, including rich media content, audio files, video, images, and PDFs, from any Web2 or Web3-based source. These large files, known as blobs, are stored quickly and efficiently by Walrus, whose storage is resilient, scalable, programmable, and secure. Walrus’s public Testnet and its forthcoming Mainnet are served by Sui as the coordination layer. “Initially, decentralized storage may sound like a concept you’ve heard of before,” said George Danezis, Chief Scientist and Co-Founder of Mysten Labs. “But on a smart contract platform like Sui, storage is capable of logic and programmability, which is a complete game-changer.” “Object-based NFTs rise far above what the NFTs of the 2022 boom were able to achieve,” said Daniel Fritsche, Co-Founder of TradePort. “Thanks to their innate structure, Sui and other Move chains enable dynamic and composable NFTs, which dramatically open up the possibilities of NFT use cases. Add in programmable storage, and the attached NFT metadata becomes just as dynamic and responsive. This is only possible on a performant storage network like Walrus.” In addition to existing NFT metadata, all data from TradePort’s NFT collections released via their launchpad will be stored on Walrus. TradePort will be one of the first partners to store data on Walrus Mainnet, which will be launched in the near future. Users who are interested in learning more about Walrus can visit Walrus.xyz .

Yet, the path of development raises concerns. As DeFi expands, alongside sectors like gaming, NFTs, and meme coins, the demand for blockchain space intensifies. While new blockchains and Layer 2 platforms aim to fulfill this need, the increasing fragmentation of liquidity and users leads to a decline in user experience and network advantages. If this trend continues, DeFi may find it harder to draw in newcomers due to the overwhelming choices and the lack of clear distinctions. The necessity to manage various interfaces, each with its own wallet, onboarding, or login requirements, adds complexity and serves as a further obstacle. Additionally, the ongoing fragmentation might even alienate current users. Reduced liquidity on individual chains makes trading less efficient and riskier, increasing the likelihood of slippage and raising costs as users navigate through multiple chains and protocols for varied activities such as lending, trading, or staking. Concealing the Issues Those within the DeFi ecosystem recognize these issues, prompting several solutions to emerge. Bridges and aggregators can facilitate cross-chain transactions, but they also bring extra complexities, potential costs, and vulnerability points that hackers might exploit. Wrapped tokens, or token derivatives, help minimize cross-chain transactions, but low liquidity can lead to price discrepancies far from the actual asset value. The recent legal dispute between Coinbase and wBTC issuer BiT Global over the delisting of wrapped Bitcoin highlights the risks of relying on wrapped assets from centralized entities. Ultimately, solutions like bridges or token derivatives are temporary fixes that exacerbate fragmentation without providing lasting benefits to users. In a crowded market where projects fade into obscurity due to a lack of differentiation, which ones are successfully highlighting their unique selling points? Platform launches have become routine, but a recent Layer 2 announcement stands out due to its significant brand influence. Soneium, a Layer 2 blockchain built on the Optimism Foundation’s OP Stack by Sony, brings notable brand recognition. In an industry where such bold moves by legacy brands are rare, Soneium distinguishes itself with Sony's backing. This is one reason why the launch of SONEX , an AI-driven DEX on Soneium, is particularly noteworthy. However, SONEX doesn't solely rely on Sony's brand to make an impact in DeFi. As a DeFi aggregator, it adopts a comprehensive strategy tailored to attract both novice and experienced traders. An Innovative Strategy for Widespread Appeal Harnessing Soneium's technical strengths, SONEX aims to offer enhanced transaction speeds, robust security, and better user access. Traders benefit from multi-chain support that consolidates assets and liquidity from across the blockchain landscape into its adaptable protocol. This liquidity positions SONEX as a comprehensive DeFi solution. Trading is improved through AI-driven alpha hunting features that provide personalized market insights and trends, allowing traders to refine their strategies and easing the learning process for beginners. With Sony as a global leader in entertainment, it is not surprising that Soneium and its ecosystem, including SONEX, aim to establish themselves in the same field. SONEX envisions integrating DeFi services with entertainment applications, such as incorporating gaming and GameFi elements into financial products, making blockchain technology more accessible and captivating. These features are designed to attract a broader audience beyond typical DeFi and blockchain users. Following a successful seed round of $1 million from investors like Outliers Fund and Flow Traders, SONEX’s mainnet launch on January 28 promises to be significant. The project was also among 32 selected from over 1,700 applications for the Soneium Spark incubation program. While DeFi's pace and scale of innovation have been remarkable, the rapid development seems to have reached a plateau, yielding diminishing returns. Perhaps a novel approach that leverages multifaceted entry points into DeFi, supported by a legacy brand, could help reverse this trend and offer a more seamless and engaging user experience. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours and currently trades around $103,339. The crypto market had plummeted over 6% thanks to the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) model that triggered panic in the market. Tech stocks tanked, dragging crypto down with it. Ethereum (ETH) has also rebounded and is up almost 2% as it looks to reclaim $3,300. Ripple (XRP) is up nearly 6% and is trading around $3.12, while Solana (SOL) is up 4.25% as it looks to reclaim $250. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Chainlink (LINK) , Cardano (ADA) , Toncoin (TON), Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable gains. The crypto market cap is up nearly 1.50% and is currently at $3.51 trillion. Markets Crash After Concerns About DeepSake The cryptocurrency market suffered a spectacular collapse on Monday, declining nearly 7% to $3.38 trillion. Traditional stock markets and tech stocks also witnessed a dramatic collapse due to the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model being considered a viable option against ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted below $100,000, falling to a low of $97,906 before recovering to reclaim $100,000. Altcoins and smaller tokens suffered even bigger losses, with XRP losing nearly 14% and Solana (SOL) dropping 11% before recovering some losses. The drop in crypto mirrored weakness and volatility in equity markets, with tech stocks leading the decline. Bitcoin and tech stocks have become increasingly intertwined following the launch of ETFs that purchase the asset and Donald Trump’s support for the industry. Both actions led to a significant jump in the prices of crypto assets. However, traders have shrugged off President Trump’s executive order to support crypto, stating the industry had already priced in the move, and current prices already reflected the move. Additionally, concerns about DeepSeek and its impact on tech stocks added to the grim mood in crypto on Monday. A report by QCP Asia stated, “The Chinese LLM poses a potential threat to US equity markets by disrupting US AI dominance with their cost efficiency and groundbreaking open-source technology. Now the question is how will Trump retaliate?” SEC’s Broader Crypto Argument Challenged Investor speculation about the SEC’s plan regarding its appeal against rulings in the Ripple case after James Murphy responded to Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Aldertoy. Aldertoy shared comments from Judge Orrick, who presided over the SEC vs Kraken case. “The SEC refers to these assets as the ‘Kraken-Traded Securities.’ As I made clear in my previous order, I will not entertain any theory of liability when the SEC asks this court to treat the crypto assets themselves as though they are securities. I am considering the theory that those crypto assets, once sold/traded/exchanged on the Kraken Trading Platform, are investment contracts that form the basis for securities. I will warn the SEC once more to be careful of this distinction.” In response, James Murphy stated, “The SEC is taking positions in litigation that we know Commissioner Hester Peirce and acting Chair Mark Uyeda disagree with. These cases need to be terminated. With extreme prejudice.” Judge Orrick’s observations align with Judge Torres, who stated that crypto assets are not securities. Judge Orrick will apply the Howey Test to determine whether the exchange or sale of crypto assets on Kraken constitutes an investment contract. The judge also did not entertain the SEC’s argument that crypto assets be classified as securities. The comments from a US Federal Judge underscore acting Chair Mark Uyeda’s efforts to rein in the SEC’s crypto litigators. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler strengthened the SEC’s legal enforcement division, promoting several key crypto litigators to senior positions. Gensler could have instructed these litigators to continue challenging crypto classifications despite the SEC’s overhaul. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market suffered a sharp pullback on Monday triggered by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model. The new model rattled markets and plunged them into the red, pulling the crypto market down by nearly 7%. DeepSeek also led to a significant decline in major AI coins and the traditional market as tech stocks tumbled. Several companies fell over 4%, including key players like Qualcomm, Nvidia, ARM, and others. Many in the industry fear DeepSeek could impact the market share of existing companies in the AI landscape. While the markets have recovered today, some analysts worry this could be the beginning of an even deeper pullback and urged investors to buy the dip. Geoffrey Kendrick, the Global Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered Bank, warned of a potential 20-30% correction thanks to markets having overzealous expectations from Donald Trump’s executive order and a strategic reserve. Markets expect more declines this week, with several US big tech companies set to report their earnings and the Federal Reserve January meeting minutes set to be released on Wednesday. Meanwhile, analysts from LondonCryptoClub called the selloff a knee-jerk reaction to a headline event. “The Deepseek FUD [fear, uncertainty, doubt] is a classic shoot first, ask questions later. Flushes like these amidst a still constructive fundamental macro story that typically mark local lows in a bull trend.” BTC has seen considerable price action since last week, encountering volatility, local lows, and a new all-time high. The flagship currency slipped below $100,000 for the first time since Donald Trump took office but has since reclaimed the $100,000 level. BTC encountered considerable volatility last weekend, dropping over 2% to $101,434. The price rallied on Monday as BTC surged to a new all-time high of $109,312. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $102,408, ultimately registering an increase of 0.86%. Buyers retained control on Tuesday despite facing selling pressure, and BTC registered a rise of 3.57% and settled at $106,059. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, dropping 2.21% to $103,715. Source: TradingView Volatility returned to the market on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, BTC rose to an intraday high of $106,903 and fell to an intraday low of $101,296 before settling at $104,004. Buyers attempted to move past $107,000 on Friday as BTC rose to an intraday high of $107,038. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level, and the price dropped to $104,784. Market sentiment changed on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal decline before dropping over 2% on Sunday to settle at $102,655. Prices collapsed on Monday as markets were rattled by the emergence of DeepSeek, with tech stocks tumbling. As a result, BTC plummeted to a low of $97,766. However, buyers bought the dip, pushing BTC back above $100,000 and the moving averages to $102,064. BTC has recovered during the ongoing session and is up 0.61%, trading around $102,723. Analysts were worried BTC could see a deep correction and plummet below $90,000 after the formation of a double-top pattern. However, BTC has managed to stay above the neckline, preventing such a scenario for the time being. If buyers retain control, BTC could reclaim $105,000 and look to move beyond $107,000. The MACD is signaling bullish, but sentiment has waned since the weekend. Meanwhile, the RSI is currently at 54, above the neutral zone. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to recover after Monday’s dramatic collapse, which saw the altcoin plummet to an intraday low of $3,020, as bulls barely managed to keep the price above $3,000. ETH has struggled to push above the 20-day SMA since slipping below it last weekend. Despite facing significant selling pressure, ETH started the previous week positively, rallying to an intraday high of $3,453, briefly going above the 20-day SMA. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell below the 20-day SMA to settle at $3,280, registering an increase of just over 2%. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as ETH rose 1.45% to $3,327. ETH could not move past the 20-day SMA and fell back in the red on Wednesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,242. Buyers returned to the market on Thursday as ETH rose almost 3% and settled at $3,339. Source: TradingView Friday saw initial bullish momentum as ETH surged to an intraday high of $3,427. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell by 0.89%, slipping below the moving average and settling at $3,309. ETH could only register a marginal increase on Saturday before dropping 2.55% on Sunday to end the weekend at $3,232. Prices collapsed on Monday as ETH plummeted to an intraday low of $3,020 before recovering to settle at $3,183. The current session sees ETH marginally up as it looks to reclaim lost ground. However, ETH has struggled to build momentum as a disagreement between the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum community weighs the price down. Indicators also point to a bearish tilt, with the RSI currently at 43, below the neutral zone. The MACD has also flipped to bearish, indicating sellers have the upper hand for now. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) plummeted to an intraday low of $220 on January 27, tanking nearly 12% as markets collapsed. SOL has been experiencing significant volatility since last weekend, surging to an intraday high of $295 before stalling and dropping to $252 on Monday, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 4%. Volatility and bearish sentiment persisted on Monday as sellers thwarted an attempt to push toward $300. As a result, SOL dropped over 4% and settled at $241. Despite growing selling pressure, SOL registered an increase of 3.48% on Tuesday, settling at $250. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL rose nearly 3% to $257. Source: TradingView However, it lost momentum on Thursday, dropping 1.62% and settling at $253. Volatility returned to the market on Friday as SOL surged to an intraday high of $270 before losing momentum and settling at $253, registering only a marginal increase. The price rose 1.17% on Saturday before registering a significant drop on Sunday to end the weekend at $240. The current week began with markets deep in the red. Unsurprisingly, SOL dropped as well, falling to an intraday low of $220 before recouping some of the losses and settling at $235. The current session sees SOL up 1.41% as buyers look to reclaim $250. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) started the previous week on a positive note, surging to an intraday high of $3.36. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $3.10, ultimately registering an increase of nearly 4%. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as XRP rose 2.33% to $3.17. XRP could only register a marginal increase on Wednesday before dropping almost 2% on Thursday and settling at $3.11. Bearish sentiment persisted on Friday as sellers attempted to drive XRP below $3. However, buyers prevented a decline, and XRP settled at $3.09 after a marginal decline. Source: TradingView XRP reported a mixed weekend as it registered a marginal increase on Saturday before dropping nearly 3% on Sunday and settling at $3.02 to end the weekend on a bearish note. Selling pressure registered a substantial rise on Monday as XRP plummeted to an intraday low of $2.65, slipping below a key support level and the 20-day SMA. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $3 and settle at $3.05, registering an increase of 1.14%. The current session sees buyers retain control, with XRP up 1.51% and trading around $3.10. If buyers retain control, XRP could look to push towards $3.40. On the other hand, sellers will look to retake control and drive the price below $3. The MACD flipped to bearish over the weekend, indicating increased selling pressure. However, sentiment could flip if buyers retain control. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) slipped below a key support level over the weekend as selling pressure intensified. TIA had struggled to push above the 20-day SMA since dropping below it last weekend, dropping to an intraday low of $4.46 by Sunday. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday after a failed recovery, as the price dropped to an intraday low of $4.37. TIA recovered on Tuesday, rising over 6% despite considerable selling pressure and settling at $4.89. However, TIA could not move past the 20-day SMA and fell back in the red on Wednesday, dropping 4.48% to $4.67. Sellers retained control on Thursday, registering a marginal drop and dropping to $4.63. Source: TradingView Buyers attempted a move past the 20-day SMA on Friday as TIA rose to an intraday high of $4.82. However, with sellers active at this level, the price fell back, dropping 2.10% to $4.53. TIA registered a marginal increase on Saturday as buyers attempted to prevent a drop below a key support level. Buyers were overwhelmed on Sunday as TIA slipped below the support level, dropping nearly 5% to $4.34. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as TIA fell over 7% to $4.03. The current session sees TIA marginally down as sellers look to drive the price below $4. Looking at the MACD, we can see that it has flipped to bearish, indicating that sellers have the upper hand. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) has struggled over the past few sessions and is down nearly 8% over the past week as it struggles to reclaim lost ground. ARB plummeted almost 9% last Sunday, ultimately settling at $0.698. Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as ARB surged to an intraday high of $0.759. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $0.698. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising nearly 4% to $0.722. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday, falling just over 3% to $0.70. Buyers returned to the market on Thursday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $0.720 before dropping 2.89% and slipping below $0.70 to settle at $0.699 on Friday. Source: TradingView ARB registered a marginal increase on Saturday but fell back into the red on Sunday, falling 3.57% to $0.67, as sellers attempted to overwhelm a key support level. On Monday, ARB slipped below the 200-day SMA and its support level, falling to an intraday low of $0.604 before recouping some losses and settling at $0.643. The current session sees ARB marginally down as sellers look to drive the price below $0.60. Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis Filecoin (FIL) has been trading in the red since failing to push above the 20-day SMA on Monday despite surging to an intraday high of $5.46. Buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and FIL ultimately settled at $5.09 after an increase of 2.47%. Buyers retained control on Tuesday despite selling pressure as FIL rose 3.16% to $5.25. However, sellers prevented a move past the 20-day SMA, and FIL fell nearly 5% on Wednesday to slip below $5 and settle at $4.99. A recovery on Thursday saw FIL reclaim $5 and settle at $5.06. Source: TradingView However, selling pressure returned on Friday as FIL dropped 0.99% to settle at $5.01. ARB registered a marginal drop on Saturday to slip below $5 and settle at $4.99. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday after sellers prevented a move past the 20-day SMA. As a result, FIL dropped nearly 3% and settled at $4.85. FIL slipped below the 200-day SMA and a key support level on Monday as macroeconomic factors dragged the market down. The price dropped to an intraday low of $4.37 before recovering to settle at $4.65, just above the support at $4.60. The current session sees FIL marginally down as buyers and sellers attempt to establish control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Is this the start of the bear season? Despite current market conditions and top altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) underwhelming, they are primed for a comeback, making now a great time to accumulate. Meanwhile, crypto whales have been showing significant interest in the new DeFi crypto DTX Exchange (DTX) . This new cryptocurrency intersects traditional and decentralized finance, aiming to reshape the $10 billion global crypto trading landscape. Ahead of its listing on Tier-1 exchanges and projected 55x upswing, experts have hailed it as the best new crypto to invest in. DTX Exchange (DTX): Investors Anticipate 55X Upswing DTX Exchange (DTX) is the latest altcoin being stockpiled by whales—perhaps the next big thing. Its attraction spans a bullish narrative and huge growth prospects, earning shouts of the “best presale to invest in.” Its listing on Tier-1 exchanges is scheduled for Q1 and there might not be a better crypto pick. Its debut is among the most anticipated as it enters the final ICO stage. A whopping $12.9 million has been raised in early funding, with a token priced at $0.16 in the eighth round of the ICO. At the launch price of $0.20, a 25% gain is anticipated. But there is more. Industry experts project a 55x upswing after going live on Tier-1 exchanges like Bybit and Uniswap, capturing huge whale interest. Also driving interest is its bullish TradFi-DeFi narrative. At the crossroads between decentralized and traditional finance, it will combine the best elements of centralized and decentralized finance—a hybrid trading platform. Its one-stop platform will allow the trading of thousands of asset classes, including stocks, ETFs, forex and crypto, positioning it among the new DeFi projects to watch and as a strong contender against Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA). Shiba Inu (SHIB): Is a Bounce Near or Further Downswings? The crypto market’s poor performance continues, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) among the biggest losers. The leading ETH memecoin and top crypto coin retail around $0.000019, posting a 5% decline in the past week. Its performance over a month is even more disappointing—a 10% downturn. With selling pressure not easing off, further downsides aren’t out of the question. Key technical indicators like the 20-VWMA and 9-HMA hint at lower price levels—sell signals. However, the neutral Bull Bear Power indicates a bounce might be on the cards. At the same time, investors are drawing confidence from the several bullish Shiba Inu price predictions—a top crypto to invest in. According to CW8900, a leading expert on X, SHIB has to break the falling wedge pattern for a rally toward $0.00004 in the near term. GoldenAgeFin, another expert, targets $0.00018 this cycle. Despite this, whales have been betting more on the new DeFi crypto DTX Exchange (DTX). Cardano (ADA): Dip or Rip? Cardano (ADA), a popular Layer-1 crypto, tumbled alongside the broader crypto market. After losing the $1 support, it hovers around $0.95, with a 4% downturn in the past week. But what is next? On the one hand, technical indicators like the 9-HMA and the MACD Level (12, 26) point to further dips, while the Cardano price trading above the 100-SMA and 100-EMA are bullish signals. However, considering catalysts like the first strategic US crypto reserve and fairer crypto regulations and policies under the Trump administration, a bounce is on the horizon. Further, crypto analyst Cchester believes Cardano (ADA) will peak around $1.5, although not ruling out a downturn. Ashley_baby942, also buzzing with optimism, targets $5 this cycle, positioning Cardano (ADA) among the best cryptos to invest in. However, DTX Exchange (DTX) might be the better bet this cycle, given the projected 55x jump in value post-launch. DTX Exchange (DTX): Primed for Higher Upswings Than Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) With plenty of room to run as an emerging cryptocurrency, DTX Exchange (DTX) might be a better crypto pick than underwhelming large caps like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA). A projected 55x jump in value draws retailers and whales, contributing to the presale selling out fast. Moreover, it is primed to reshape the global trading industry via a hybrid model—a trailblazer.

As the largest NFT marketplace on Sui, TradePort streamlines and enhances NFT trading across multiple blockchain networks, which currently include Sui, Aptos, NEAR, Movement, and Stacks. Walrus Protocol, which launched its Testnet in October of 2024, stores and delivers large unstructured data files, including rich media content, audio files, video, images, and PDFs, from any Web2 or Web3-based source. These large files, known as blobs, are stored quickly and efficiently by Walrus, whose storage is resilient, scalable, programmable, and secure. Walrus’s public Testnet and its forthcoming Mainnet are served by Sui as the coordination layer. “Initially, decentralized storage may sound like a concept you’ve heard of before,” said George Danezis, Chief Scientist and Co-Founder of Mysten Labs. “But on a smart contract platform like Sui, storage is capable of logic and programmability, which is a complete game-changer.” “Object-based NFTs rise far above what the NFTs of the 2022 boom were able to achieve,” said Daniel Fritsche, Co-Founder of TradePort. “Thanks to their innate structure, Sui and other Move chains enable dynamic and composable NFTs, which dramatically open up the possibilities of NFT use cases. Add in programmable storage, and the attached NFT metadata becomes just as dynamic and responsive. This is only possible on a performant storage network like Walrus.” In addition to existing NFT metadata, all data from TradePort’s NFT collections released via their launchpad will be stored on Walrus. TradePort will be one of the first partners to store data on Walrus Mainnet, which will be launched in the near future. Users who are interested in learning more about Walrus can visit Walrus.xyz .

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also argues in his statements that the reserve should not consist of just a single token, but should include various tokens such as Bitcoin and XRP. XRP Has More Advantages Compared to Bitcoin! As strategic reserve discussions continue, Omni Network co-founder Austin King argued that XRP should also be included in the US reserve. King noted that XRP has an advantage over Bitcoin that justifies its inclusion in the US strategic reserve. At this point, the Omni Network founder listed why XRP could be a valuable choice for US reserves and its advantages over Bitcoin in terms of functionality. King first argued that including only Bitcoin in the US crypto reserve would limit the utility of BTC. According to the famous name, while Bitcoin was designed to serve as a decentralized store of value, XRP was created specifically to modernize and improve the financial system. Secondly, Bitcoin prioritizes decentralization, which leads to slower transaction speeds, while XRP focuses on high performance, which makes it a more practical option for onboarding financial institutions, according to King. At this point, Austin King shared a video of Ripple former CTO Stefan Thomas explaining the advantages of XRP compared to Bitcoin to support his claims about XRP Bitcoin. Thomas stated in this video that XRP is 1,000 times faster than Bitcoin in terms of transaction confirmation times, XRP has more predictable and cost-effective transactions, Bitcoin transactions cost several dollars or more, but XRP transactions only cost a fraction of a cent. After all this comparison, King argued that XRP could provide more value for the strategic reserve than Bitcoin. Diversity is Necessary! The Omni Network founder finally argued that diversifying the reserve would be more beneficial, stating that including only Bitcoin would limit the reserve to a single use case that functions as digital gold. King said that American politicians also think like him: “Including only BTC would limit the reserve to only one use case for crypto. Including other assets like XRP would allow the reserve to leverage all crypto use cases. Blockchains will offer much more than just digital gold. We have the potential to create an open financial foundation for the world, but you need a high-performance network like XRP to make it happen. “I'm not the only one who sees this. It's increasingly clear that lawmakers in the United States share the same view.” Approaching $200,000,000,000 in market cap $XRP is one of the top assets being considered for the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. However, most people are missing the real reason why it might be included. Here's what $XRP brings to the table that $BTC does not: pic.twitter.com/GlzQF8vQVi — Austin King (@0xASK) January 28, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

33767162,[object Object],1738078222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,FOMC Preview: What Crypto Investors Should Expect From The Upcoming Meeting,https://bitcoinist.com/fomc-preview-crypto-investors-should-expect/,"As markets await the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) decision on January 29, crypto investors find themselves at a critical juncture. Following the first ever crypto executive order by US President Donald Trump and yesterday’s DeepSeek price crash, macroeconomics are once in the focus. Crypto Market FOMC Preview Crypto analyst Byzantine General (@ByzGeneral) has identified a consolidation range between $90,682 and $108,388 for Bitcoin. He anticipates limited movement prior to the FOMC meeting, citing three potential scenarios for how the market might respond once the Fed concludes its discussions: “Like I said in my thread yesterday, we’re really just consolidating between this range ($90,682 – $108,388). And I expect nothing material to happen until Wednesday FOMC. And then there are 3 possibilities with only 2 outcomes…FOMC surprise dovish -> break out of range, FOMC neutral -> chop in range for longer, FOMC hawkish -> chop in range for longer” Crypto market participants often interpret a dovish stance —one that signals or enacts interest rate cuts or an extended pause—as supportive of risk-on assets, including Bitcoin and crypto. A surprise dovish tilt could be the catalyst for breaking the current trading range, according to Byzantine General. A neutral or hawkish outlook, on the other hand, might mean an extended period of sideway price movement. In their assessment, banking giant ING laid out the broader macroeconomic context that could influence the Fed’s decision and projections for 2025. According to ING: “Federal Reserve set for an extended pause. After 100bp of rate cuts the Fed has signalled it needs evidence of economic weakness and more subdued inflation prints to justify further policy loosening. President Trump ’s low tax, light-touch regulation policies should be good news for growth, while immigration controls and trade tariffs provide upside risk for prices, suggesting we could have a long wait for the next cut.” The December FOMC saw a 25bp rate cut, but the subsequent commentary suggested a slower and more gradual path of easing for 2025, potentially totaling just 50bp for the year. ING points out that strong economic performance and persistent inflation pressures provide less incentive for the Fed to lower rates quickly. The bank also highlights a lingering possibility that the Fed may even adopt a more hawkish tone than it has publicly acknowledged so far: “In fact, the risk is that the Fed is actually more hawkish than they indicated… However, with President Trump having just won re-election and his policy plans differing so starkly from President Joe Biden’s, Fed Chair Jay Powell acknowledged that some felt the need to incorporate the potential policy shifts into their December 2024 projections ahead of time. However, not all did and since his inauguration, there has been little sign of any moderation in Trump’s key policy thrust.” ING’s economists further note that market participants largely expect no policy change on January 29, while the bank itself previously anticipated a March rate cut—an event it now sees as increasingly unlikely: “That means no change to monetary policy is a certainty on 29 January and it makes our previous call of a March rate cut look unlikely – currently just 6bp of a 25bp move is discounted by financial markets.” However, ING still forecasts three rate cuts for 2025, hinging on a gradual cooling of the labor market and moderating wage pressures. They emphasize that rising Treasury yields, higher borrowing costs, and a stronger dollar could combine to tighten financial conditions, ultimately forcing the Fed’s hand later in the year: “Therefore we take the view that the Fed may need to push harder and cut rates a little further than currently priced by markets, but that is more likely to be a second half of 2025 development.” On the balance sheet reduction ( quantitative tightening , or QT), ING sees the Fed possibly ending QT in 2025 if excess liquidity shrinks to levels below what the central bank deems comfortable. The bank pegs $3 trillion in reserves as a critical threshold: “We are currently at US$3.5tn. So we’re comfortable. At the same time, the reverse repo balance is running at US$125bn, and if that were to hit zero, then we’d hit some degree of tightness. That’s close, as QT is running at US$60bn per month. QT may have to end by mid-2025 based on a simple extrapolation of this.” Regarding currency markets, ING suggests that the dollar could retain its strength if the Fed remains cautious about easing: “December’s FOMC meeting certainly added support to the dollar bull run… it is hard to see the January FOMC event risk being read more dovishly… We doubt the Fed is ready to push back against those market expectations. This should keep dollar rate spreads relatively wide and argues that the FOMC will not be the reason the dollar corrects lower.” With President Donald Trump starting his second term, questions about the Fed’s independence have resurfaced. Historically, Chair Jerome Powell has deflected suggestions of political influence: At the upcoming FOMC meeting, Powell can be expected to dodge questions about the Fed’s independence and the potential impact by Trump. The President, however, has been explicit about his views on interest rates. When asked if he expected the Fed to listen to his demands for rate cuts, Trump responded: “I would make a strong statement.” After being asked if he expects the Fed to listen, he answered “Yeah.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.45 trillion.",Crypto News|altcoins|bitcoin|bitcoin news|crypto|crypto news|cryptocurrencies|FOMC|FOMC Preview|US Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-28 15:30:22

Technical analysis of the Bitcoin price action on the weekly candlestick timeframe shows that the leading cryptocurrency is on the path to a price target of $117,000. An analyst on the TradingView platform has outlined a detailed roadmap for Bitcoin’s journey to this $117,000 price target, highlighting a series of key price zones and market cycles to watch out for. Momentum And Resistance Levels On The Way To $117,000 Technical trend analysis shows that Bitcoin has been trading in an ascending channel in a weekly candlestick timeframe since Q4 2024, with the price steadily climbing within the channel. As demonstrated in the chart below, the most recent 7-day candlestick is bearish, pushing Bitcoin to retest the midline of this ascending channel. This bearish movement reflects temporary selling pressure but aligns with the broader pattern of corrections within an overall uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Above $100,000 Renews Hope, Analyst Reveals The Cycle Top A rebound is expected from here, which would send Bitcoin on another move toward the upper trendline. Interestingly, a move toward the upper resistance zone puts the price target around $117,000, marking a significant milestone for Bitcoin. Nonetheless, there remains a potential downside risk, and the journey to $117,000 is not expected to be linear. According to the analyst, Bitcoin may witness a pullback to the zone between $95,000, $97,000, and $100,000, which may act as a consolidation region before Bitcoin resumes its upward trajectory. This zone coincides with previous support levels and trendlines, further solidifying its significance as a critical area for accumulation and stability. The Harmonic Fibonacci projection tool also suggests the pullback to the range between $97,000 and $95,000 could form a “healthier setup” for a sustained rally. Furthermore, temporary resistance near $108,000 could also slow Bitcoin’s climb. This level is even more notable, considering the fact that it is the current all-time high that would need to be surpassed. The overall long-term structure remains bullish even with the potential pullback, with higher highs and higher lows forming on the roadmap to $117,000. Bitcoin’s Market Cycles Across Multiple Timeframes The analyst also looked into Bitcoin’s market cycles across different timeframes. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is currently in Cycle 2, which the analyst describes as a phase with little buying momentum. Entering at the current level carries a higher risk, and Cycle 1 would need to return for an entry point. The weekly timeframe also reflects Cycle 2 at the top of the chart. This placement often transitions into Cycle 3, which could lead to significant price movement either upward or downward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Officially Enter Into Greed Territory, Is This Good Or Bad For Price? On a two-week timeframe, Cycle 1 is present but is also positioned at the top, which is also not a good entry point. However, the removal of a recent sell signal suggests that the immediate risk of Bitcoin dropping below $97,000 has diminished, but is not totally over. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,700 and is up by 4% in the past 24 hours.

Ver posted a video on the social media platform X claiming to be the victim of “lawfare.” “As I’m filming this, this might be my very final moments of freedom. By later tonight in Spain I could very well be in a Spanish prison on my way back to the United States to face life in prison, up to 109 years. Not because I’ve done anything wrong, but because of my activism within cryptocurrency. But there are some people who hate America. They’ve used lawfare against people who are spreading American ideals. And if there’s anybody who knows what it’s like to be the victim of lawfare for spreading American ideals, it’s Donald Trump. They’re doing the exact same thing to me that they’ve done to you.” Ver, an early Bitcoin ( BTC ) investor who later decided to support the BCH fork, was arrested in Spain in late April at the direction of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). He faces multiple charges, including mail fraud, tax evasion and filing false tax returns. Despite renouncing his United States citizenship in 2014 after obtaining citizenship in Saint Kitts and Nevis, authorities say Ver should have filed tax returns that reported capital gains from the sale of his worldwide assets, including his Bitcoin, and reported the fair market value of his assets. It remains unclear whether Trump will be receptive to Ver’s plea: Elon Musk, the president’s highest-profile supporter, argues that the BCH pioneer shouldn’t receive a pardon. “Roger Ver gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.” Ver was a vocal “big-blocker” in the Bitcoin Blocksize War who wanted to increase BTC block sizes to enable cheaper, faster transactions. “Small blockers” like Blockstream chief executive Adam Back argued that Bitcoin’s original 1MB-sized blocks kept the network decentralized. Ver claims that propaganda, possibly from US intelligence agencies, was spread to trick people into believing it was important to keep the BTC block sizes small.

This projection comes amidst increasing interest in the project, as it blends artificial intelligence and blockchain technology in a way that has the potential to disrupt multiple industries. While established players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have garnered attention with their memecoin status, Lightchain AI is carving out a niche with its focus on scalability, efficiency, and cutting-edge AI solutions. This combination makes it one of the most promising altcoins for long-term growth. As the presale gains momentum , many investors are watching closely, anticipating massive returns. Could Lightchain AI be the next major cryptocurrency to outperform the competition and achieve the $1 target by 2025? Only time will tell, but the signs are promising. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the factors driving this projection and why Lightchain AI is worth paying attention to. Why An AI-Focused Cryptocurrency Has Massive Potential AI-focused cryptocurrencies like Lightchain AI are gaining significant attention due to their ability to integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, a combination that offers immense potential for scalability and efficiency. Traditional cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are primarily focused on decentralized financial transactions. In contrast, AI-driven projects can revolutionize industries by enabling real-time decision-making and automation directly on the blockchain. This blend of AI’s advanced computational power with the security and transparency of blockchain creates new opportunities for innovation and problem-solving, particularly in sectors that require large-scale data processing. With its innovative approach, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a key player in this space, attracting the attention of investors who are looking for next-generation blockchain solutions. The utility of AI in cryptocurrency has the potential to significantly disrupt the market, making these projects prime candidates for high returns in the years to come. Road to $1: Factors Driving Lightchain AI’s Growth Lightchain AI's path to $1 is driven by several key factors that set it apart in the competitive cryptocurrency market. One of the most significant drivers is its innovative combination of blockchain and AI technologies, allowing for more efficient and scalable solutions. By leveraging AI, Lightchain AI can optimize decentralized applications, enabling faster decision-making and automated processes, which is crucial for handling large data sets. Another important factor is its robust presale success , with growing investor confidence in its potential to disrupt existing blockchain systems. The project’s clear vision for real-world applications and its ability to address current market challenges position it for strong adoption. Additionally, the continued development of its platform and the strategic partnerships it forms will further enhance its value proposition. With these factors in play, Lightchain AI is on track for significant growth, potentially reaching the $1 mark in the coming years. How To Invest In Lightchain AI Investing in Lightchain AI is a straightforward process, especially as its presale progresses with increasing momentum. To get started, you'll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that supports Ethereum (ETH) or USDT, as these are the accepted payment methods for purchasing Lightchain AI tokens during the presale. After setting up the wallet, visit the official Lightchain AI website, where you'll find detailed instructions on how to participate in the presale. You'll need to connect your wallet to the presale platform and select the amount of tokens you wish to purchase. As the presale continues, early investors can benefit from discounted token prices, with the potential for significant returns as the platform grows. Additionally, staying updated on any announcements from Lightchain AI regarding its progress and roadmap will help ensure that you're making informed decisions as an investor. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-01-28 15:33:17

Terra Luna Classic ( LUNC ) dropped to a low of $0.00007045 this week, marking its lowest level since August 2024 and a decline of 55% from its December highs. According to LUNCMetrics , the network surpassed the 400 billion burn milestone this week. Over 400.6 billion LUNC tokens have been incinerated so far, with the trend continuing. In the last seven days alone, 1.45 billion tokens were burned, leaving 6.5 trillion coins still in circulation. Terraform Labs, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2024, remains the largest contributor to token burns, having destroyed over 259 billion tokens as part of a U.S. court order tied to its bankruptcy proceedings. Binance has burned over 70 million tokens, while DFLUNC, LunaticsToken, and MEXC are among the next major contributors. In theory, burning reduces the circulating supply of a cryptocurrency, which could increase its price by making the remaining tokens rarer. You might also like: Will LUNC recover as Terra Classic burn and staking accelerates One reason for LUNC’s price decline is the increasing number of holders selling their coins.

Despite its struggles, it remains a significant player in the crypto industry, with a market cap of over $450 million. LUNC price technical analysis LUNC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Terra Luna Classic peaked at $0.0001793 in December before crashing by over 57% to $0.000076. The coin has broken below the ascending trendline connecting the lowest levels since August 2024. Terra Classic’s 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages have also made a bearish crossover. It also formed a head and shoulders chart pattern, while oscillators like the Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have continued falling. Given these factors, the LUNC price is likely to continue its downtrend, with the next key target being $0.000050, its lowest point in 2024.

Here’s the Truth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The arrival of a new technological firm has disrupted market dynamics and started an industry-changing transformation. The Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek generated widespread attention after its rapid ascent. As its success grew, the stock market dramatically dropped, and major tech companies, including Nvidia, bore the brunt of this change. In the face of market turbulence, Ozak AI is an unseen participant, achieving notable growth. Its presale attracted many investors, as the price surged from $0.001 to $0.003 in its third presale stage. The Rise of DeepSeek DeepSeek exploded onto the market by launching its AI model R1, which achieved the top free app rating position on Apple’s US App Store. DeepSeek has quickly risen in market popularity since its efficient development process used $5.8 million when compared to OpenAI’s billion-dollar expenditure for development. Industrial leaders are split over whether it is appropriate to use AI efficiently to create superior models because of unresolved skepticism among executives about this approach. DeepSeek’s initial launch caused widespread market capitalization losses that affected all market segments. The stock value of Nvidia, a significant AI specialist suffered a historic single-day market capitalization drop following a 17% decrease. Crypto coin values tracked market declines when Bitcoin prices dipped below $100,000. DeepSeek’s launch to the market has created sweeping uncertainty about future financial resources and possible operational disturbances between businesses.

They are Tron, Solana, and the new DeFi project Remittix. Tron and Solana have strong track records. Also, they seem to hold great promise for 2025. Many analysts believe they could rise by up to 300%. Meanwhile, a new project, Remittix (RTX), is gaining attention. Some analysts think RTX could jump by 30,000%. This is likely because it is still in its early stages. It has a unique approach to payments and a strong plan for growth. As such, many now see RTX as one of the best crypto to buy. Tron (TRX): Can It Keep Moving Up? Tron aims to make content sharing more direct. It looks to cut out big companies like YouTube and Facebook. Instead of using a middleman, users can share content and get paid directly. Tron is also known for handling large amounts of stablecoin transactions. It moves billions of dollars in USDT transfers every day. Low fees and high speed make it a strong option for payments. This works especially for people who want to send money across borders. TRX has held its value better than many other cryptos. Experts believe it could gain up to 300%. However this depends on if the overall market rises. This dependence is not very appealing to investors. People are looking for more guaranteed rewards. This is what makes ICOs the better choice. It also explains why investors are trooping to Remittix. Solana (SOL): A Top Performer with More Potential Solana has become one of the most important projects in crypto. It is known for its fast transactions and low costs. This has kept Solana on the rise and is fast becoming the top altcoin. Recently, SOL reached a new milestone. It hit an all-time high price of $294.85 on January 19, 2025. This incredible feat shows that Solana is still in its prime. The chain is home to DeFi apps, NFTs, and other projects that need high-speed transactions. A major reason for Solana’s potential growth is its increasing adoption. More people are using it for different applications, which increases demand for SOL. If the overall market turns bullish, analysts predict SOL could gain 200-300% next year. Remittix (RTX): The Best Crypto to Buy for Massive Gains? While TRX and SOL are solid projects, Remittix is getting attention for a different reason. It is focused on solving real problems in global payments. Sending money across countries can be expensive and slow. Banks and traditional services charge high fees, and transfers take days to process. Remittix offers a faster and cheaper way to send money. Users can send crypto, and the recipient gets the money directly in their bank account. This cuts out middlemen and reduces costs. Because of this, many believe RTX has the potential to grow much faster than older projects. Investors are also paying attention to RTX’s security. The liquidity pool and team tokens are locked for three years, meaning sudden sell-offs are less likely. Also, the smart contract has been audited. This means that Remittix is more secure than most ICOs. RTX is still in its presale phase. Early investors can get in before it lists on major exchanges. After the presale, it will be available on Uniswap and other trading platforms. If it gains wide adoption, its current price of $0.0418 could skyrocket. The Remittix ICO has already raised over $9 million. This is an incredible feat. It shows the presale is beyond hype. It is really making progress and tokens are selling out fast. Some experts predict RTX could gain as much as 30,000%. The potential for growth is much higher than TRX or SOL. This has made RTX one of the best crypto to buy for investors looking for big returns. But for those looking for high-growth opportunities, Remittix stands out. It solves a major problem in cross-border payments, giving it real-world value. Because it is still new, it has much more room to grow than TRX and SOL. If adoption increases as expected, its DeFi coin price could see massive gains. This makes RTX one of the best crypto to buy for those looking for a chance at life-changing returns.

Both Tron and Solana boast impressive histories, and they are seen as having significant potential for 2025, with the possibility of increasing by as much as 300%. On the other hand, Remittix (RTX), a newcomer, is capturing attention. Some experts suggest RTX might experience a 30,000% surge. Its early-stage status, innovative payment solutions, and robust growth strategy are likely reasons for this optimism. Consequently, RTX is emerging as a top choice for cryptocurrency investment. Tron (TRX): Will Its Upward Momentum Continue? Tron is designed to enable more direct content sharing, aiming to eliminate the need for large companies like YouTube and Facebook. By removing intermediaries, users can share their content and receive direct compensation. Tron is also recognized for processing massive amounts of stablecoin transactions, handling billions in daily USDT transfers. Its low fees and quick processing make it an attractive choice for cross-border payments. TRX has maintained its value more effectively than many other cryptocurrencies. Experts speculate it could see up to a 300% increase, contingent upon a market upswing. This market dependency isn't very enticing for investors. Many are seeking more assured returns, which is why ICOs are more appealing. This trend explains the growing interest in Remittix. Solana (SOL): A Leading Performer with Room to Grow Solana has solidified its place as a crucial player in the crypto world, renowned for its fast transaction speeds and low costs. These features have fueled its rise, making it a leading altcoin contender. Recently, SOL achieved a significant milestone by reaching an all-time high of $294.85 on January 19, 2025. This remarkable achievement highlights Solana’s continued prominence. Its blockchain supports DeFi applications, NFTs, and other projects requiring swift transactions. Solana’s growth potential is bolstered by its increasing adoption, as more users leverage it for various applications, driving demand for SOL. Should the market turn bullish, analysts foresee a potential 200-300% gain for SOL next year. Remittix (RTX): Could It Be the Top Crypto for Massive Returns? While TRX and SOL are well-established, Remittix is drawing attention for different reasons. It's dedicated to addressing real-world challenges in global payments. International money transfers are often costly and slow, with banks and traditional services charging high fees and taking days to process transactions. Remittix introduces a quicker and more cost-effective way to send money. Users can transfer crypto, and recipients receive funds directly in their bank accounts, bypassing middlemen and reducing costs. This advantage leads many to believe RTX could grow more rapidly than established projects. Investors are also drawn to RTX for its security measures. The liquidity pool and team tokens are locked for three years, minimizing the risk of sudden sell-offs. Additionally, the smart contract has been audited, ensuring Remittix is more secure than many ICOs. Currently, RTX is in its presale phase, allowing early investors to participate before it becomes available on major exchanges. Post-presale, it will be listed on Uniswap and other trading platforms. If adoption increases, its presale price of $0.0418 could soar. The Remittix ICO has already amassed over $9 million, an impressive accomplishment that demonstrates the presale is not just hype but genuinely progressing, with tokens selling rapidly. Some specialists forecast a potential 30,000% rise for RTX, offering far greater growth potential compared to TRX or SOL. This makes RTX a top choice for investors seeking substantial returns. For those on the hunt for high-growth opportunities, Remittix stands out by addressing a significant issue in cross-border payments, providing tangible value. Being a newer project, it has more room for expansion than TRX and SOL. If adoption increases as anticipated, its DeFi coin price could see massive gains, positioning RTX as a prime investment for those seeking transformative returns.

39616963,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=664224,1738079153,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39616963.jpeg,"No, president Xi Jinping isn’t trying to get back at America with DeepSeek",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/president-xi-jinping-america-deepseek/,"This might hurt you to know, but China’s president Xi Jinping really isn’t as calculating as we’ve been made to believe. He might be “evil” at times, but he isn’t some mastermind that can actually do anything to America, otherwise he would’ve a very long time ago. Why now, when the sitting US president Donald Trump is so infatuated with him? Realistically, China is not as powerful a threat to America. It never has been. A Hangzhou hedge fund, not the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), built DeepSeek, and that’s where the entire “Xi’s revenge” theory falls apart. Sure DeepSeek R1, the AI model that started yesterday’s uber-insane frenzy, was designed to compete with giants like OpenAI and Anthropic, but its origins don’t point to government directives or some grand geopolitical chess move by President Xi Jinping. Crypto elite Arthur Hayes tore into the propaganda in a post on X today, asking , “Why didn’t a big Chinese corporate or a government-funded project create DeepSeek? Why was it some random Hangzhou hedge fund?” He then added a jab at the CCP’s well-known disdain for hedge funds, describing how frustrating it is to trade Chinese markets compared to their Western counterparts. Arthur summed up the situation: “This doesn’t sound like the way China likes to innovate.” DeepSeek R1 challenges AI’s power structure DeepSeek’s R1 competes with the likes of OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Meta’s LLaMA while being built with older Nvidia chips, the kind the US still allows to be exported to China under sanctions. That alone destroys the myth that cutting-edge AI requires cutting-edge GPUs. DeepSeek’s creators allegedly did it with less, and it worked. For years, tech giants have operated on the assumption that more money equals better AI. DeepSeek just tore that assumption apart. According to Arthur, this proves that “money isn’t always the barrier to entry in AI anymore.” Smaller companies can now build competitive AI models without needing to match Google’s or Microsoft’s spending sprees. But the real shocker? DeepSeek made parts of the R1 model public. It’s not entirely open-source, but it’s open enough for smaller companies to use it on their own servers. Nvidia, the king of AI chips, saw its stock drop 17% after R1’s release. But the entire market crash is still so absurd to me. Do investors not realize that DeepSeek quite literally needs Nvidia to survive? There is no competition here, one cannot exist without the other. So how does it make sense to abandon the lifeline for the shiny new toy? The CCP’s role? Minimal, if any Whichever way you look at it, DeepSeek is not something that would fit into Beijing’s agenda. China’s regulators, meanwhile, are busy pushing insurers to pump money into the stock market to stabilize equity prices. A Jan. 28 report from the Financial Times said China asked state-owned insurers to allocate 30% of new policy premiums into stocks. Whether this will actually happen remains to be seen. Regardless, this effort has no connection to DeepSeek or its creators. Western media hasn’t helped the narrative. They’ve labeled R1 “Chat(Xi)PT,” implying the model is nothing more than a propaganda tool. It’s an easy and quite hilarious jab, but it misses the point. Even if Xi had a role in this—and there’s no evidence he did—the focus wouldn’t be on “revenge.” Beijing is more interested in controlling narratives, censorship, and maintaining its image than in retaliating against America. DeepSeek’s openness, no matter how limited, will never get any support from Mr. Xi. Beijing prefers secrecy and control, and they’ll do anything to have it. This is why DeepSeek’s developers had to censor any information related to Xi. Check out my test run with it just now. DeepSeek Testrun These guys are likely scared for their lives having invented this thing because if you look at the video below, the AI is visibly fighting the censorship, but failing, which is good. Because Xi is not someone any Chinese person dreams of messing with. document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dCsAYJUk0GFVl7i_.mp4 As Arthur pointed out: “Once you start to question, your mind goes to dangerous places.” The implications of DeepSeek’s success extend to the broader economy. US markets, trading at 230% of GDP, are historically overvalued. If investors lose confidence in these markets, where will the capital gains taxes come from? Arthur speculated that deficits could balloon to 7%, 8%, or even higher by 2028 if the market rotation happens. But not everyone is panicking. Nvidia, despite its bad day, still holds a strong position in the market. Its proprietary coding language, CUDA, remains the standard for AI development. While R1 proves you can do more with less, Nvidia’s best chips are still valuable for leaner, more efficient models. Wall Street’s Jim Cramer said today, “I am glad you all are satisfied with Deepseek. Can it be the next model? I think the thing is hallucinating like mad. I see the same thing I always see: our inferiority complex vs. the PRC, how much smarter and better they are. Same old, Same old, “We are idiots; they are smart… Yeah, yeah, sure, sure”",OP-ED|DeepSeek,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-28 15:45:53

It has announced a partnership with blockchain data provider SonarX to create new crypto indexes using onchain metrics and other digital asset data as demand from institutional investors for deep crypto insight continues to rise. Kristen Mierzwa, head of digital assets at FTSE Russell explained, the project would “better serve the needs of our institutional client base.” For all intents and purposes, this cooperation is a giant step to bringing the traditional financial institution closer to the ever-growing cryptocurrency world. Onchain Metrics Powered Indexes The new indexes will utilize on-chain data to derive the intrinsic value of blockchain protocols together with other major fundamentals. It is a very similar approach to traditional finance, whereby fundamentally weighted indexes are used as benchmarks for investment funds. For cryptocurrencies, this will offer a more appropriate and data-driven way to look at market trends and asset performance. A spokesperson from FTSE Russell said the firm has seen growing interest in onchain data from institutional investors, which is crucial for the valuation of cryptocurrencies. Increasing Institutional Adoption Institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies has continued its solid uptrend, reaching a record in 2024. The spot Bitcoin ETFs gained significant traction as over $120 billion flowed into the asset class, while inflows into the spot Ether ETFs moved more slowly but briefly exceeded $3 billion during the back of 2024. Analysts believe institutional investments in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies will keep on growing in 2025. This is a trend reinforced by investment firms such as Galaxy Digital, which in turn predict Ether ETF inflows to exceed $5 billion in the first half of 2025. Broader Industry Trends FTSE Russell is not new to innovating in the digital asset space; in 2023, the firm partnered with Grayscale to launch index series related to cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms. Other financial giants, like Bloomberg, have also been extending their crypto offerings, adding more than 50 digital assets to their platforms . With this, FTSE Russell further fortifies its commitment to a bridge between traditional and digital finance for the evolving needs of the institutional client base and further positions cryptocurrencies for mainstream acceptance.",Blockchain|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-28 15:47:12

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple (XRP) are two of the top altcoins facing steep declines, losing more than 21% and 14%, respectively. As a result of the decline, holders of SHIB and XRP looking for other bullish alternatives have been buying the DTX Exchange (DTX) coin. $DTX is up by 700%, surging to $0.16 as its exchange trading platform looks to transform the crypto trading landscape with multi-asset support. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dips Hard, Risks Losing Key Support Like many top memecoins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top losers in the recent crypto market dip. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the Shiba Inu price has dropped by more than 21% on the weekly timeframe. As a result of the sharp price decline, the value of $SHIB is now hovering around the $0.0001800 support level. A drop below this level could mark a huge decline for the Shiba Inu coin. The popular crypto analyst and Shiba Inu activist, Shib Spain, has said that the memecoin is consolidating around this level. CryptoELlTES shares a similar sentiment, saying that the price of the memecoin could reach $0.000085171 soon. However, losing the $0.00001800 support could lead to a decline to $0.00001500 for the Shiba Inu token. Ripple (XRP) Dips Below $3, Where Will Price Go From Here? After its breakout rally to $3.4 in mid-January, the Ripple coin price has been on a freefall. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Ripple (XRP) has dropped back to $2.80, leaving investors to wonder where it will go next. The crypto analyst, Coinvo, has said that $XRP is pulling off the classic break and retest pattern. As long as it holds the range between $2.8 and $2.60 the uptrend remains intact. If this happens, then the Ripple price could bounce back to the $3.5 range. However, a drop below this key range could signal more decline towards $2.5 and possibly back to $2. However, a major Ripple news that could serve as a boost for the altcoin price to rise higher in the coming weeks is the potential launch of XRP ETFs. DTX Exchange (DTX) Defies Bearish Market, Pumps To $0.16 While the crypto market is facing its biggest drop this year, DTX Exchange (DTX) has been surging to new highs. The DeFi coin of the DTX Exchange, $DTX, surged to $0.16 amidst this downtrend, extending its gains to 700%. DTX Exchange has been trending upwards because of the massive potential investors perceive. DTX Exchange is the first hybrid trading platform in the crypto space with multi-market support. On the DTX Exchange, crypto traders will be able to buy, sell, and trade over 120,000 assets from the global financial markets. Anything from stocks to forex, metals, oil, ETFs, and commodities, will all be available on the DTX Exchange. The feature will be revolutionary in the crypto space and puts DTX in the $690 trillion OTC derivatives market. Because DTX Exchange operates in a market several times bigger than crypto, analysts believe that it will continue to outperform even the best altcoins. This has contributed to DTX Exchange onboarding over 400,000 and raising $13+ million while still in presale. As the exchange prepares to launch with the biggest potential seen in years, crypto experts believe the DTX coin can surge from $0.16 to cross $1 in Q1 2025. Why DTX Exchange Will Outperform Top Altcoins, SHIB and XRP Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple (XRP) might be two of the biggest cryptos, but they are small in comparison to the $690 trillion OTC derivatives market. With DTX Exchange being one of the most innovative DeFi projects tapping into this market, it has more growth potential than other cryptos. In addition, its smaller market cap means it can record higher gains than SHIB and XRP.

Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) sits around $0.00001786, analysts warn that if market conditions worsen, a dip could hit. Meanwhile, many are looking to a January superstar called Remittix (RTX), a PayFi project that’s already raised $8.4 Million With 385 Million tokens sold at $0.0406—and the next price pegged at $0.0418. Remittix (RTX) might be the safety net that Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders need if a full-blown sell-off occurs. Below is a closer look at the landscape, from why Shiba Inu (SHIB) could drop to how Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming the month’s top performer. Shiba Inu (SHIB): On the Brink of a Dip? For those who’ve stuck with Shiba Inu (SHIB) for its meme coin appeal and prior success, the looming SHIB Price Drop talk is unsettling. While supporters argue the coin’s massive community and ongoing developments could spur another run, critics say the hype has cooled off. With no major catalyst in sight, Shiba Inu (SHIB) might see traders exiting before a bigger decline. Of course, it’s also possible Shiba Inu (SHIB) will pull off another rally if a fresh wave of social media campaigns takes hold. But in an unpredictable market, many are hedging by spreading their bets, which is where Remittix (RTX) comes in. Remittix (RTX): January’s Standout So, how did Remittix (RTX) become the coin everyone’s buzzing about in January? Focused on cross-border remittances, Remittix (RTX) aims to offer lower fees and faster transactions than traditional banking. That everyday utility resonates with both new and seasoned investors. Some Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders, fearing a possible SHIB Price Drop, have moved part of their funds into Remittix (RTX), lured by the token’s strong start and upcoming price jump from $0.0406 to $0.0418. If the momentum holds, Remittix (RTX) might see an even bigger climb, which is exactly why some consider it the top crypto performer this month. Why Some SHIB Fans Are Hedging Dedicated Shiba Inu (SHIB) enthusiasts remember the coin’s past explosions in price, but they also know the rollercoaster can dip sharply. By hedging with Remittix (RTX), they’re betting that if a SHIB Price Drop happens, the potential gains from Remittix (RTX) might offset losses. If Shiba Inu (SHIB) rallies again, they still hold some SHIB. It’s a strategy that acknowledges the uncertainty in meme coins. If Remittix (RTX) delivers on cross-border use cases, these holders might see bigger gains than they’d get holding only Shiba Inu (SHIB). Future Outlook How will February look for both tokens? If Shiba Inu (SHIB) manages to break its slump, the price drop whispers might fade. On the other hand, if negativity spreads, an exit could push SHIB lower. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is on track for its next price increase, which might ramp up investor FOMO. If the token hits major exchanges or signs big partnerships, that could fuel even higher demand. Observers suggest both coins can coexist, but the mood definitely favors Remittix (RTX) at the moment. Conclusion While Shiba Inu (SHIB) watchers brace for a possible decline, a chunk of holders are turning to Remittix (RTX), the coin that seems unstoppable this January. With over $8.4 million raised, an upcoming price bump to $0.0418, and a push to revolutionize remittances, Remittix (RTX) might keep stealing the spotlight. Whether Shiba Inu (SHIB) can bounce back and defy the SHIB Price Drop rumors remains to be seen. But for now, it looks like many SHIB enthusiasts are spreading their bets—hoping that if SHIB does dip, Remittix (RTX) will continue its strong climb. That way, they might still end up winners even if the meme coin giant stumbles in the near term.

Why Panshibi Is Predicted By Top Crypto Analyst To Overtake Shiba Inu Marketcap In 2025,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/meme-coin-mania-why-panshibi-is-predicted-by-top-crypto-analyst-to-overtake-shiba-inu-marketcap-in-2025,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to captivate the crypto space with its history of rapid growth and community strength. Despite this, the recent Shiba Inu price struggles have prompted questions about its next potential breakthrough. This has shifted attention to the new viral meme coin - Panshibi ($SHIBI) . Panshibi is turning heads with its groundbreaking features and dynamic presale model. This has analysts predicting that $SHIBI has the potential to compete with Shiba Inu as the top cryptoinvestment in the meme coin market! Top crypto investments: Analysts bet on Panshibi to dominate the meme coin market in 2025 Panshibi is rewriting the rules for meme coins, combining innovation with community-driven features. Inspired by the iconic panda, Panshibi is quickly becoming a top crypto contender, attracting investors with its transparent approach and real-world utilities. At the heart of Panshibi is a dynamic ecosystem powered by the $SHIBI token. Unlike many meme coins, $SHIBI offers genuine value to holders through governance, staking, and exclusivity. You can participate in project decisions, earn up to 1,200% annual returns through staking, and gain access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. These features cater to investors seeking rewards, transparency, and long-term growth. With a focus on stability and trust, Panshibi has locked its liquidity pool for 10 years and team tokens for two years. Additionally, its smart contract has passed rigorous audits, further building investor confidence. With plans to list on major exchanges like Uniswap after the presale, Panshibi is ready to deliver on its promise of growth and security. This meme coin is gaining ground to outperform top memecoins like Shiba Inu as it positions as a top crypto investment in 2025. Shiba Inu price analysis: SHIB navigates uncertain territory Over the years, Shiba Inu has carved out a significant presence in crypto. With its Lead Developer boasting of Shibarium's success, SHIB has seen nearly 800 million transactions . This achievement solidifies its status, maintaining an $11 billion market cap and ranking 17th on CoinMarketCap . SHIB’s recent burn rate surge has also been impressive, rising by 1,014%. Over 43 million SHIB tokens were eliminated in January alone, signaling an effort to boost value. Despite these positive strides, the Shiba Inu price remains underwhelming, with the token struggling to hold ground. January recently saw SHIB’s price to the $0.0000200 price level. Analysts warn of continued price declines, citing a lack of momentum. Meanwhile, Panshibi is gaining steam and is on track to potentially surpass SHIB’s market cap by 2025. Shiba Inu price slumps while Panshibi promises massive growth potential As Shiba Inu price struggles to gain momentum, Panshibi is capturing the spotlight in its presale stage. Currently priced at $0.002 in Stage 1, $SHIBI has sparked massive interest, raising over $100,000 in less than 4 days. Panshibi’s presale employs a dynamic pricing model, with $SHIBI’s price set to increase with each presale stage. This presale will run for a further 56 days, during which $SHIBI will see a 1,200% price surge to $0.026 before listing on major crypto exchanges. This strategic structure, coupled with the platform’s innovative features and engaging ecosystem has analysts predicting a 145,000% price increase for $SHIBI post-launch.

The couple became famous, with Morgan also gaining attention for her rap persona, Razzlekhan. Just before she surrenders to prison, Morgan gave an exclusive interview to set the record straight about her role in the crime, which is depicted in the Netflix documentary The Biggest Heist Ever. Morgan expressed regret for her actions but defended her loyalty to her husband, stating she could have turned on him but chose not to. Besides, she is now suing Netflix for defamation, claiming the documentary misrepresented her story. Heather Morgan, alongside her husband Ilya Lichtenstein, was involved in the 2016 Bitfinex hack where Lichtenstein stole 119,754 Bitcoin. While Lichtenstein carried out the hack, Morgan helped launder the stolen funds by allowing her financial accounts to be used and setting up virtual currency exchange accounts to hide the money’s source. The couple, who lived in a $1.5 million apartment in FiDi, reportedly spent the stolen funds on gold and NFTs. In 2022, Morgan and Lichtenstein, dubbed the “Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde,” were arrested at their Manhattan home. Authorities found a bag of burner phones and a suspicious file on Lichtenstein’s computer. The couple pleaded guilty to money laundering a year later, with Morgan receiving an 18-month sentence and Lichtenstein getting five years, of which he has already served more than half. Despite her loyalty to her husband, Morgan expressed interest in befriending Caroline Ellison, the FTX executive who received a reduced sentence for cooperating with authorities. Morgan is unhappy with how her story is portrayed in Netflix’s The Biggest Heist Ever. Her attorney has sent cease-and-desist letters to Netflix, producer Library Films, filmmaker Chris Smith, and journalist Nick Bilton, accusing them of spreading defamatory statements about Morgan. Her lawyer, Serena Wu, stated they are exploring legal options but have started with these letters.",News|Crypto news|Hack,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-28 16:05:48

There was also a fresh report that the network is among the blockchains in discussion with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The MOVE token spiked as much as 20% to $0.89 on the news before paring some of the gains, still up 13% during the day at press time. The advance happened as World Liberty Financial, which is backed by President Donald Trump and his family, acquired a total of $2 million worth of MOVE tokens in several batches during the U.S. morning hours, with the first transaction occurring at 14:22 UTC, blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence shows. Adding to the gains was an X post by well-followed crypto sleuth dbnews at 14:48 UTC that Movement is one of the teams that discussed blockchain use for the government. Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur who is the head of the Department of Government Efficiency tasked with finding ways to cut government expenses, is reportedly exploring blockchain tech for operations including to track federal spending, secure data, make payments and manage buildings.

While investors eagerly await a final regulatory decision that could introduce Solana to traditional market platforms, two other developments are also making waves. XRP is holding strong near $3.12, signaling some stability in the face of past volatility. Meanwhile, Panshibi ($SHIBI) —a fresh and fun meme coin—continues to gather steam among crypto enthusiasts. Together, these stories shine a light on the evolving nature of digital assets and the variety of investment angles shaping 2025’s outlook. Solana (SOL) ETF: A Step Toward Accessibility Solana’s reputation for scalability and lightning-fast transactions has made it a top choice for developers seeking low-cost blockchain solutions. Now, the possibility of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) has triggered even more Solana ETF Excitement, drawing in traditional market participants who prefer a simpler route to crypto exposure. Instead of directly buying or managing SOL tokens, potential investors could use an ETF structure similar to well-known commodities or index funds. Such a fund would make it easier for pension funds, retail brokers, and everyday traders to access Solana, ultimately broadening the project’s reach. Even though final approval remains uncertain, Polymarkets estimates a 77% likelihood of a Solana ETF in 2025. This optimism rests on several factors: Solana’s established presence, its community’s ongoing support, and the network’s ability to handle high volumes of transactions. Analysts believe the ETF could significantly lift Solana’s market valuation if it receives a green light. XRP Near $3.00: Stable with Growth Potential Amid the anticipation around Solana, XRP remains a contender for investors focusing on well-known altcoins. Currently priced around $3.12 , XRP has found a zone of consolidation. Resistance is sitting near $3.50, while support holds in the $2.90-$3.00 range. This stability indicates that traders are still weighing their next moves, but it also highlights XRP’s potential to break out if market sentiment turns bullish. Factors influencing this could include regulatory progress, new partnerships, or Ripple’s payment solutions updates. Panshibi ($SHIBI) Launch: Capturing 2025’s Imagination Not all the action is confined to established coins or potential ETFs. Panshibi has emerged as a panda-inspired meme coin offering a playful mix of culture, community, and technology. From day one of its 60-day presale, the project garnered a fast influx of over $45,000, pointing to a potentially strong launch at its target price of $0.026. While many meme coins fizzle out, Panshibi sets itself apart by backing up its adorable branding with real substance. The team emphasizes transparency, security, and long-term utility. For instance, the liquidity pool is locked for 10 years, and team tokens are locked for two—key measures that help reduce the risk of sudden sell-offs. Additionally, $SHIBI includes intriguing features like AI-driven “social-fi” engagement, governance opportunities for token holders, and staking potential that can reach 1,200% APY. The smart contract has been audited by Coinsult, and ownership of the contract will be renounced once the presale concludes. These steps signal a desire to prioritize community governance and investor trust. Crypto enthusiasts who thrive on high-reward ventures may find Panshibi’s roadmap compelling, especially given the project’s momentum heading into 2025. In contrast to a more traditional token like XRP, Panshibi’s allure lies in the blend of fun, community spirit, and robust security. Conclusion From the Solana ETF Excitement to XRP’s $3.00 price consolidation and Panshibi’s energetic presale, each development showcases a unique facet of the crypto market. Solana might soon open new doors for traditional investors via an ETF, while XRP’s supporters await a potential break above $3.50. Meanwhile, Panshibi continues to gain traction among those who love meme culture but also crave reliability and long-term potential. No matter where your interests lie—blue-chip cryptos, cutting-edge blockchain solutions, or community-focused memecoins—the path to 2025 promises surprises and opportunities in equal measure.
