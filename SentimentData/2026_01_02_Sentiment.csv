Rather than presenting commentary on market conditions, Rector’s post focuses on personal and professional allegations, which he describes as a “necessary response” to a sustained misrepresentation, misconduct, and attempt to leverage his standing within the XRP community. Rector states that the decision to speak publicly was not made lightly. He positions the video as a defensive clarification intended to resolve confusion created by prior associations and to explain why he no longer maintains any professional alignment with Claver or related business entities. Addressing Jake Claver lies Part 1 pic.twitter.com/rmVMK3XtUH — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 31, 2025 Claims of Misrepresentation and Business Pressure According to Rector, the first issue centers on what he describes as false representations made to him by Jake Claver and Claver’s business partner, Max Avery. He explains that these representations were allegedly used to position him as a promotional conduit for private equity initiatives and for the firm Digital Wealth Partners. Rector maintains that his credibility within the XRP community was a key factor in these efforts, and that he was approached both to assist in capital formation and to formally join the business. Rector recounts interactions dating back to industry events in 2023 and collaborative meetings that brought together both communities. While these engagements initially appeared legitimate, he states that subsequent due diligence, supported by legal advisers with securities experience, led him to withdraw before any formal partnership was established. Concerns Over Fund Performance and Investor Discrepancies A second focus of Zach Rector’s video relates to performance claims surrounding Digital Wealth Partners funds. He highlights what he describes as inconsistencies between public statements made by Claver and private feedback received from investors. Rector suggests that these discrepancies raised serious concerns regarding transparency and accuracy, contributing further to his decision to disengage. Allegations of Community Manipulation and Legal History The third issue raised involves what Rector characterizes as manipulation of the XRP community through unsupported claims, exaggerated forecasts, and references to insider access and nondisclosure agreements. He argues that such narratives lack substantiation and serve to influence investor behavior without factual grounding. Rector further references a publicly accessible legal case involving Claver and payment platform VeryVend in the Western District of New York. He points to court filings in which Claver admitted to actions including registering a misleading domain, impersonating company communications, and fabricating wire transfer confirmations related to private equity fundraising efforts. Rector emphasizes that these admissions are part of the official record and were resolved through settlement.

He suggests that accountability and factual verification are essential within financial and crypto-adjacent communities, particularly where trust and reputation play a central role.

The move, signed into law by President Serdar Berdimuhamedov in late November and taking effect on January 1, 2026, marks a major policy shift for one of the world’s most closed and tightly controlled economies. Turkmenistan just passed a law legalizing crypto mining & exchanges from Jan 1, 2026, but under heavy licensing. #Regulation #Turkmenistan https://t.co/gmnAfFLDl0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 28, 2025 Turkmenistan Ends Crypto Ban With Central Bank in Charge Under the new “Law on Virtual Assets,” cryptocurrency mining and trading are now permitted , but only within a strictly regulated framework overseen by the country’s central bank. Digital assets are brought under civil law, and a licensing regime has been introduced for exchanges, custodial services, and mining operations. However, the legislation is explicit that cryptocurrencies will not be recognized as legal tender , currency, or securities, and cannot be used to pay for goods or services inside the country. The structure of the law reflects Turkmenistan’s broader economic and political model. All miners, whether individuals or companies, must register their equipment and operations with authorities. Exchanges are subject to mandatory know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules , anonymous wallets are prohibited, and advertising is tightly restricted. Credit institutions are barred from offering crypto services, and regulators retain the authority to halt operations or void token issuances if deemed necessary. The central bank is also empowered to authorize specific distributed ledger systems, effectively steering activity toward permissioned and closely monitored networks. The decision comes after years of a near-total ban on crypto activity. Before the law was signed, mining and trading were illegal, and authorities periodically raided unregistered operations and seized equipment. Despite that, an underground crypto community existed, operating through VPNs, peer-to-peer platforms , and covert mining setups to bypass internet restrictions and enforcement. Reliable data on the size of that community was scarce, but projections suggest that by the end of 2026, Turkmenistan could have nearly 500,000 cryptocurrency users, representing about 6.4 percent of the population, as activity moves into the legal sphere. Abundant Energy Meets Fragile Grid in Turkmenistan’s Crypto Bet Energy availability is one of the factors drawing attention to Turkmenistan’s policy change. The country has abundant natural gas reserves and produces more electricity than it consumes, with installed generation capacity exceeding 5.4 gigawatts against peak domestic demand of around 4.3 gigawatts. Low energy costs could, in theory, make the country attractive for energy-intensive crypto mining. However, analysts note that the main challenge lies in the electricity grid itself. Much of the transmission and distribution infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era and suffers from frequent outages, inefficiencies, and power quality issues. While generation capacity is sufficient, the lack of grid stability raises questions about whether large-scale, industrial mining can operate reliably without substantial private investment in dedicated infrastructure and power conditioning systems. The new crypto framework also sits against the backdrop of Turkmenistan’s fragile currency environment. The national currency, the Turkmenistani manat, remains the only legal means of payment, and the government maintains strict controls to protect it. The official exchange rate has long been fixed at around 3.5 manat to the U.S. dollar, while a much weaker rate reportedly exists on the black market, reflecting devaluation pressures and capital controls. Official inflation data is limited, but high inflation is widely suspected, contributing to informal dollarization for savings and larger transactions. By banning crypto as a payment method, authorities appear intent on preventing digital assets from competing with the manat or weakening monetary control.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin now urgently advocates for dApp ecosystem development as the critical solution to prevent future technological catastrophes. His recent statements on social media platform X highlight a growing concern within the cryptocurrency industry about eroding decentralization principles for mere convenience. The dApp Ecosystem as Societal Safeguard Vitalik Buterin’s analysis connects directly to the November Cloudflare incident. This infrastructure failure demonstrated how centralized systems create single points of failure. Consequently, Buterin argues that decentralized applications must evolve beyond financial tools. They should become foundational infrastructure for modern society. The Ethereum founder specifically emphasizes that dApps operating without external pressures offer superior resilience. Historical context supports Buterin’s position. Major internet outages have increased in frequency and impact over the past decade. For instance, Amazon Web Services experienced significant disruptions in 2021 and 2023. Similarly, Google Cloud Platform faced service interruptions affecting millions of users. These events collectively illustrate the vulnerability of centralized models. Recent Major Infrastructure Outages and Their Impacts Provider Date Duration Estimated Impact Cloudflare November 2024 ~3 hours 20% of global websites AWS US-East-1 December 2021 ~7 hours Thousands of services Google Cloud March 2023 ~4 hours Major apps and APIs Microsoft Azure June 2022 ~6 hours Enterprise services globally Technical Independence Through Decentralization Buterin identifies a troubling trend within the cryptocurrency sector. Many projects increasingly rely on traditional cloud providers. This dependence contradicts the fundamental principle of decentralization. Therefore, the Ethereum founder urges developers to regain technical independence. He suggests that convenience should not compromise core blockchain values. Several key characteristics define truly resilient dApp infrastructure: Distributed Architecture: No single entity controls the entire system Censorship Resistance: Operations continue despite external pressures Transparent Governance: Clear, community-driven decision-making processes Fault Tolerance: Continued operation despite component failures Expert Perspectives on Infrastructure Evolution Industry analysts echo Buterin’s concerns about infrastructure centralization. Dr. Sarah Chen, infrastructure researcher at Stanford University, notes that internet architecture has become increasingly concentrated. “We’ve moved from distributed academic networks to commercial oligopolies,” Chen explains. “This concentration creates systemic risks that decentralized technologies could mitigate.” Blockchain architect Marcus Rodriguez adds practical insights. “Building resilient dApps requires rethinking traditional development approaches,” Rodriguez states. “Developers must prioritize decentralization at every layer, from data storage to computation.” His team recently published a framework for evaluating dApp decentralization across seven critical dimensions. Ethereum Network Enhancements for Predictability Buterin’s proposal extends beyond philosophical arguments. He suggests concrete technical improvements for the Ethereum network. Specifically, the introduction of gas fee futures products could enhance transaction cost predictability. This development would benefit both developers and users. Moreover, it represents a practical step toward infrastructure maturity. The gas fee mechanism on Ethereum has evolved significantly since the network’s launch. Initially, simple auction dynamics determined transaction costs. However, EIP-1559 introduced a base fee mechanism in 2021. This change improved fee predictability but didn’t eliminate volatility entirely. Consequently, futures products could provide additional stability for dApp operations. Comparative analysis reveals how different blockchain networks approach fee predictability: Ethereum: Market-based fees with base fee mechanism Solana: Fixed fee structure with priority fees Avalanche: Dynamic fees based on network conditions Polygon: Layer-2 solution with reduced fee volatility Implementation Challenges and Solutions Transitioning to dApp-based infrastructure presents significant technical hurdles. Scalability remains a primary concern for decentralized systems. Additionally, user experience often lags behind centralized alternatives. However, recent technological advances offer promising solutions. Layer-2 scaling solutions, for example, dramatically improve transaction throughput. Zero-knowledge proofs represent another breakthrough technology. These cryptographic methods enable verification without revealing underlying data. Consequently, they enhance both privacy and scalability. Several projects now implement zk-proofs for various dApp functionalities. This development marks substantial progress toward practical decentralization. Interoperability standards also facilitate dApp ecosystem growth. Cross-chain communication protocols enable applications to operate across multiple networks. Therefore, they reduce dependence on any single blockchain. The Ethereum community actively develops standards like ERC-3668 for cross-chain functionality. These efforts collectively advance Buterin’s vision of resilient infrastructure. Conclusion Vitalik Buterin’s call for dApp ecosystem development addresses a critical vulnerability in modern technology infrastructure. The November Cloudflare outage demonstrated how centralized systems endanger global connectivity. Therefore, decentralized applications must evolve into resilient societal infrastructure. This transition requires technical innovation, philosophical commitment, and practical implementation. The Ethereum network’s proposed enhancements, including gas fee futures, represent important steps forward. Ultimately, a robust dApp ecosystem could prevent future infrastructure catastrophes while preserving the internet’s original decentralized vision. FAQs Q1: What exactly happened during the Cloudflare outage mentioned by Buterin? The November 2024 Cloudflare outage lasted approximately three hours and affected about 20% of global websites. This incident resulted from a configuration error in Cloudflare’s global network, demonstrating how centralized infrastructure creates single points of failure that can disrupt essential online services worldwide. Q2: How can dApps prevent infrastructure failures better than traditional systems? Decentralized applications distribute operations across multiple independent nodes rather than relying on centralized servers. This architecture eliminates single points of failure, ensures censorship resistance, and continues functioning even when individual components fail, providing superior resilience compared to traditional centralized systems. Q3: What are gas fee futures products that Buterin mentioned for Ethereum? Gas fee futures would be financial instruments allowing users to hedge against Ethereum transaction cost volatility. These products could lock in future gas prices, providing predictability for dApp developers and users while potentially stabilizing the network’s economic model through derivative markets. Q4: Why is the cryptocurrency industry becoming more centralized according to Buterin? Many blockchain projects increasingly rely on traditional cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud for node hosting and development tools. This dependence creates centralization vulnerabilities that contradict blockchain’s fundamental decentralization principles, often sacrificed for development convenience and short-term cost savings. Q5: What practical steps can developers take to build more resilient dApps? Developers should implement distributed storage solutions like IPFS, utilize multiple blockchain networks through interoperability protocols, design fault-tolerant architectures, participate in decentralized governance, and prioritize transparency in all system operations to create genuinely resilient decentralized applications.

The company stated that the issue was limited to this specific version and did not affect its mobile applications or other platforms. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT estimated that user losses totaled approximately $7 million. The incident gained attention after several users reported missing funds shortly after interacting with the affected extension version. Investigation Ongoing as Thousands of Wallets Identified On December 28, Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen said the company was still investigating the incident and working to verify affected users. According to Chen, the team has identified 2,596 wallet addresses connected to the issue so far, while roughly 5,000 refund requests have been submitted. Chen noted that a significant number of submitted claims were either duplicates or potentially fraudulent. To address this, Trust Wallet is cross-referencing multiple data sources to confirm legitimate cases before issuing compensation. Preliminary findings suggest the incident may have involved malicious interactions or unauthorized access linked specifically to the browser extension environment, rather than a direct breach of Trust Wallet’s core systems. Browser-based wallets are generally more exposed to phishing attempts, malicious scripts, and compromised extensions, which can lead to private key or signing vulnerabilities if users unknowingly approve harmful transactions. Trust Wallet emphasized that the exploit did not stem from its mobile applications and reiterated that the issue was isolated. The company said resolving verified claims and publishing a full technical breakdown of what occurred remain top priorities as the investigation continues.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-01 20:11:52

Meanwhile, posts on X linked the drop to dilution, index risk, and a shrinking NAV premium, despite Strategy still holding about $59 billion in Bitcoin versus a roughly $46 billion market cap. Benchmark Reiterates Buy on Strategy, Keeps $705 Target for 2026 Investment bank The Benchmark Company has reiterated its buy rating on Strategy, maintaining a $705 price target tied to 2026 expectations, according to reports circulating on Wednesday. The note continues to frame Strategy primarily as a bitcoin-focused treasury company, rather than a traditional software valuation story. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said the price target reflects Strategy’s large and growing Bitcoin holdings and the firm’s capital structure, which amplifies exposure to long-term bitcoin price movements. As a result, the research treats Strategy shares as a proxy for bitcoin performance, with added leverage from equity and debt instruments used to fund acquisitions. While several crypto news platforms reported the reiteration on Wednesday, the analysis itself does not appear to be newly issued. Instead, the coverage references a Benchmark research note first published in early December and resurfaced at the start of the new year. No changes to the rating or price target were disclosed, and Benchmark did not announce a revised forecast. Strategy, remains one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. Consequently, its stock has continued to attract investor attention during periods of heightened focus on corporate bitcoin treasury strategies. Strategy Shares Slide as Market Cap Falls Below Bitcoin Holdings Shares of Strategy have dropped sharply over the past six months, underscoring how quickly market narratives can reverse for bitcoin-focused equities. According to price data shown on a widely shared chart, Strategy stock fell from about $457 to roughly $152, a decline of nearly 66%, erasing an estimated $90 billion in market value over the period. In a post on X, a market commentator said the sell-off went beyond bitcoin’s broader pullback. Instead, the post pointed to equity dilution, index-related risks, and a collapse in Strategy’s net asset value premium as the main drivers of the decline. As the premium compressed, investors appeared to reassess how much they were willing to pay above the company’s underlying bitcoin holdings. Despite the steep drop in its share price, Strategy’s balance sheet remains largely unchanged. The company still holds about $59 billion worth of bitcoin, based on prevailing market prices cited in the post. By contrast, Strategy’s equity market capitalization stands near $46 billion, implying that the stock now trades below the value of its bitcoin reserves. The gap between asset value and market capitalization highlights the role of investor sentiment in pricing bitcoin-heavy companies. While Strategy’s holdings stayed intact, shifting expectations around leverage, dilution, and index exposure appear to have reshaped how the market values the stock, leaving the same balance sheet viewed through a very different psychological lens.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-01 20:14:20

This resulted in slowing the rollout of a key claims verification tool tied to the incident. Trust Wallet chief executive Eowyn Chen said the extension became unavailable after the company encountered a Chrome Web Store bug while attempting to release a new version. Some may have noticed that the @trustwallet Browser Extension is temporarily unavailable on the Chrome Web Store. We hit a Chrome Web Store bug while releasing a new version that includes a feature to help reimbursement claimants submit verification codes from their extension… — Eowync.eth (@EowynChen) December 31, 2025 The delayed update was meant to introduce a verification feature designed to help victims of the Christmas Day hack confirm wallet ownership and submit reimbursement claims securely. Chen said Google has acknowledged the issue and is escalating it internally, while warning users to stay alert for fake or impersonated versions of the extension circulating online. Attackers Exploited Fake Trust Wallet Update to Steal Funds The outage comes as Trust Wallet continues to manage the fallout from a security breach that began unfolding in late December. On December 25, the company confirmed that a malicious version of its Chrome browser extension , version 2.68, had been distributed through the Chrome Web Store outside its normal release process. The compromised extension allowed attackers to access sensitive wallet data and execute unauthorized transactions, leading to millions of dollars in losses. Multiple Trust Wallet users experienced unauthorized fund outflows on Thursday due to a new browser extension theft. Losses are estimated to surpass $6 million. #TrustWallet #CryptoTheft #TrustWalletTheft https://t.co/mchzwWAHK3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 26, 2025 Trust Wallet’s internal investigation shows that only users who installed version 2.68 and logged into their wallets between December 24 and December 26 were affected. Mobile app users, users on other extension versions, and those who installed or logged in after December 26 were not impacted. The company said it identified 2,520 wallet addresses that were drained during the incident, with roughly $8.5 million in assets linked to 17 attacker-controlled wallets. The wallet, though, noted that some of those attacker addresses also targeted wallets unrelated to Trust Wallet. Security researchers later confirmed that the malicious build appeared legitimate and passed Chrome’s review process but contained hidden code capable of extracting recovery phrases. Several users said simply importing a seed phrase into the extension triggered immediate fund outflows across multiple blockchains. Trust Wallet Cleans Up Extension Hack; Flags Rise in Fake Compensation Scams Trust Wallet traced the breach back to a wider supply chain attack known as Sha1-Hulud, which surfaced in November and affected multiple companies through compromised developer tooling. The company said exposed GitHub secrets and a leaked Chrome Web Store API key allowed the attacker to upload the malicious extension directly, bypassing internal approval checks. In response, Trust Wallet rolled back to a clean release, published version 2.69, and disabled compromised publishing credentials. It also declared a voluntary reimbursement scheme, which they promised to all those people who were found to be victims. On December 29, it opened a formal claims process , where users are asked to provide wallet addresses, transaction hashes, and identifying information via an official support portal. In its response to over 5,000 claims, the company indicated that it has been inundated with claims, given that the number of verified affected wallets is much lower, and it is a cause of concern that there could be duplicate or fake claims. It is the cause of that discrepancy that led to the creation of another verification mechanism that was supposed to be provided with the next update of the browser extension, but was delayed by the Chrome Web Store problem.

The analyst projected three potential scenarios for Bitcoin in 2026. The first scenario, which carries the highest probability, suggests that if rate-cut expectations persist throughout 2026, “Bitcoin is likely to trade within a broad $80,000-$140,000 range , with $90,000-$120,000 as the core zone.” The second scenario, with medium probability, indicates that if recession risks intensify, the resulting deleveraging and ETF outflows could push Bitcoin below $80,000, with movement toward the $50,000 range conceivable. The third scenario, carrying low probability according to XWIN Research, proposes that if Fed easing expectations materialize early and ETF inflows stabilize, Bitcoin could extend toward $120,000-$170,000, with higher levels possible only under multiple favorable conditions. Currently, a range-bound structure remains the most plausible baseline for 2026, subject to reassessment as structural data evolves. This aligns with current sentiment from traders on Kalshi prediction market who project Bitcoin hitting a high of $121,000 this year, suggesting a range between the current $80,000 levels and $120,000 is highly plausible in 2026. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Healthy Mid-Cycle Correction The weekly Bitcoin chart shows a mature bull market that has entered a healthy corrective phase rather than a structural breakdown. After bottoming in 2023 following a deep 77% bear-market drawdown, Bitcoin rallied strongly through 2024 and into 2025, eventually topping near the $120,000-$125,000 region. The subsequent pullback of roughly 37% mirrors past mid-cycle corrections and has thus far respected higher-timeframe support. The most crucial level on the downside is the $67,000-$70,000 zone, which previously functioned as a major consolidation base and breakout region. Source: TradingView Provided this support maintains on a weekly closing basis, the long-term bullish structure remains intact. On the upside, the $105,000 region represents the key resistance Bitcoin must reclaim to signal bull trend resumption. A decisive weekly close above $105,000 would likely open the way for broader recovery toward $121,000 and potentially new highs later in 2026. Until that reclaim occurs, Bitcoin may continue consolidating between the $70,000 support and $105,000 resistance, with the higher-timeframe bias remaining bullish provided the macro support zone isn’t lost.

Recent analysis of Bitcoin options market data reveals sophisticated institutional players are implementing income-generating strategies that may inadvertently suppress Bitcoin’s price potential while simultaneously reducing market volatility. This development represents a significant maturation phase for cryptocurrency markets as traditional finance methodologies increasingly intersect with digital asset trading. Bitcoin Covered Calls: The Institutional Income Strategy Covered call strategies represent a sophisticated options trading approach that institutional investors have adapted for cryptocurrency markets. Essentially, this strategy involves holding spot Bitcoin while simultaneously selling call options against that position. The call options give buyers the right to purchase Bitcoin at a predetermined price within a specific timeframe. Meanwhile, the seller collects premium income from these option sales. Several factors have driven institutional adoption of Bitcoin covered calls: Declining cash-and-carry yields falling below 5% annually Attractive income potential offering 12-18% annual returns Risk management benefits in volatile cryptocurrency markets Portfolio diversification for traditional investment firms This institutional activity has created a measurable impact on Bitcoin’s market structure. According to cryptocurrency derivatives data from major exchanges including Deribit and CME Group, the consistent selling of call options has contributed to declining implied volatility throughout 2025 contracts. Volatility Compression in Bitcoin Markets Bitcoin’s implied volatility metrics provide compelling evidence of how covered call strategies are reshaping market dynamics. Implied volatility represents the market’s forecast of likely price movement and serves as a crucial indicator for options pricing and risk assessment. Throughout 2025 contracts, Bitcoin’s implied volatility has experienced a notable decline from approximately 70% to around 45%. This volatility compression reflects several interconnected market developments: Time Period Implied Volatility Level Market Interpretation Early 2025 Contracts ~70% High uncertainty, speculative positioning Mid-2025 Contracts ~55% Increasing institutional participation Current 2025 Contracts ~45% Mature options market, covered call prevalence The declining volatility trend indicates that consistent selling pressure from covered call strategies has reduced overall market uncertainty. However, market analysts note this compression creates a complex trading environment where price breakouts face systematic resistance from option-related selling activity. Countervailing Market Forces and Price Discovery Despite the suppressing effect of covered call strategies, Bitcoin markets demonstrate robust countervailing forces that maintain trading equilibrium. Significant buying demand for call options continues to offset institutional selling pressure, creating a dynamic marketplace where multiple strategies interact. Furthermore, demand for put options—which provide downside protection—remains consistently strong, indicating sophisticated risk management across institutional portfolios. This options market activity reflects broader cryptocurrency market maturation. Institutional capital now pursues volatility-based profits through sophisticated derivatives strategies rather than simple directional bets. The resulting market structure features reduced extreme volatility while potentially limiting explosive upside moves that characterized earlier Bitcoin market cycles. Historical Context and Market Evolution Bitcoin’s options market has evolved dramatically since the launch of regulated derivatives products in recent years. Initially dominated by retail speculation and directional betting, institutional participation has transformed market dynamics through 2024 and into 2025. This evolution parallels developments in traditional financial markets where options strategies became increasingly sophisticated over decades. Several key developments have facilitated this institutional adoption: Regulatory clarity in major financial jurisdictions Infrastructure development including custody solutions Risk management tools tailored for cryptocurrency Educational resources for institutional investors Market analysts compare current Bitcoin options activity to early stages of equity options markets, where covered call strategies similarly gained prominence among income-focused investors. This historical parallel suggests Bitcoin markets may experience continued options strategy diversification as institutional participation deepens. Impact on Bitcoin Price Discovery Mechanisms The proliferation of covered call strategies influences Bitcoin’s price discovery process through several interconnected channels. First, consistent call option selling creates technical resistance levels at strike prices where significant option volume concentrates. Second, the income generated from premium collection reduces pressure for immediate price appreciation among institutional holders. Third, volatility suppression affects algorithmic trading systems that respond to volatility signals. These dynamics create a more predictable but potentially constrained trading environment. Bitcoin’s price movements may exhibit reduced frequency of extreme volatility events while facing systematic resistance at key technical levels corresponding to options activity. Market participants must now account for options-related flows alongside traditional supply-demand factors when analyzing Bitcoin price action. Institutional Portfolio Implications For institutional investors, covered call strategies offer compelling risk-adjusted returns in cryptocurrency allocations. By generating consistent income through option premiums, institutions can improve portfolio yield while maintaining Bitcoin exposure. This approach particularly appeals to pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies with specific return requirements and risk parameters. However, these strategies involve trade-offs that institutions carefully evaluate. The opportunity cost of capped upside potential must balance against premium income and volatility reduction. Sophisticated institutions typically implement dynamic covered call approaches that adjust strike prices and expiration dates based on market conditions and outlook. Market Structure Analysis and Future Projections Current Bitcoin options market structure reveals a maturing ecosystem where multiple participant types interact through sophisticated strategies. Retail traders, proprietary trading firms, hedge funds, and traditional asset managers now employ diverse approaches ranging from simple directional bets to complex volatility arbitrage. This diversity contributes to market efficiency while creating unique dynamics like the covered call effect on price ceilings. Looking forward, market analysts project several potential developments: Strategy diversification beyond basic covered calls Cross-asset correlations with traditional markets Regulatory developments affecting derivatives trading Technological innovations in options execution These developments will likely further integrate Bitcoin into global financial markets while potentially altering the relationship between options activity and spot price dynamics. Market participants must continuously monitor options market metrics alongside traditional analysis to understand evolving Bitcoin price drivers. Conclusion Bitcoin covered call strategies represent a significant development in cryptocurrency market evolution, potentially creating subtle ceilings on price appreciation while reducing overall volatility. This institutional activity reflects broader market maturation as sophisticated derivatives strategies become increasingly prevalent. While potentially limiting explosive upside moves, these developments contribute to market stability and institutional participation. Bitcoin’s options market dynamics will continue evolving throughout 2025, requiring market participants to adapt their analysis frameworks to account for derivatives-related flows alongside traditional factors. The interplay between covered call strategies and Bitcoin price discovery mechanisms represents a crucial area for ongoing market observation and analysis. FAQs Q1: What exactly are Bitcoin covered call strategies? Bitcoin covered call strategies involve holding spot Bitcoin while selling call options against that position. This approach generates premium income for the seller while potentially limiting upside if Bitcoin’s price rises above the option strike price. Q2: How do covered calls potentially limit Bitcoin’s price upside? When institutional investors consistently sell call options at specific price levels, they create selling pressure if Bitcoin approaches those levels. This activity can establish technical resistance that suppresses price breakouts, effectively creating a ceiling on upward momentum. Q3: Why are institutional investors using covered call strategies for Bitcoin? Institutions pursue covered call strategies primarily for income generation (12-18% annual returns), volatility reduction, and risk management. These approaches offer attractive risk-adjusted returns compared to declining yields from other cryptocurrency strategies. Q4: What does declining implied volatility indicate about Bitcoin markets? Declining implied volatility from 70% to around 45% for 2025 contracts suggests reduced market uncertainty and increased institutional participation. This volatility compression reflects more sophisticated trading strategies and potentially more stable price action. Q5: How does options market activity signal Bitcoin market maturation? Sophisticated options strategies like covered calls, robust put option demand for hedging, and institutional participation all indicate maturing markets. These developments mirror evolution in traditional financial markets and suggest Bitcoin is becoming more integrated into global finance.

56703111,650677,1767299420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56703111.jpeg,XRP Army Rift: Zach Rector Accuses Jake Claver Of Misleading The Community,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-army-rift-zach-rector-jake-claver/,"A loud internal fight is spilling out across the XRP Army, with Zach Rector accusing Jake Claver of using high-certainty price narratives, most notably the “$100 XRP by end of 2025” call, to pull attention, credibility, and capital from the community. Rector released a two-part video series on Dec 31, aimed at “addressing Jake Claver’s lies.” Claver, the CEO of Digital Ascension Group, ist one of the louder XRP bulls . While the $100 XRP call by Jan. 1, 2026 clearly failed, Rector argues that the miss wasn’t just a bad call, it was the certainty and urgency behind it, sold into a community that has spent years marinating in catalyst talk, NDA hints, and timeline debates. The $100 XRP Call Rector said he has challenged the $100 XRP claim throughout 2025 and was surprised Claver continued doubling down into the final days of the year. In Rector’s telling, the problem is not prediction-making, he said he has missed targets too, but the way extreme outcomes were marketed as near-certain, with the implication of privileged information. He played a clip from Claver’s live show after Rector criticized the $100 call. When confronted, Claver did not concede, instead implying he may “know something.” “If I was going to pivot, should have pivoted by now,” Claver said in the clip Rector quoted. “Unless I know something. Why wouldn’t I? … We’ll see what ends up happening by the end of the year. We’ll see where the price is. And I think the results will speak for themselves.” Rector argued that this kind of messaging: NDA-coded, “trust me” signaling becomes a lever inside XRP culture, where many holders have learned to treat timelines and insider claims as tradable narratives. Rector calls this behaviour “manipulation,” saying Claver’s “business model is so reliant upon that manipulation” that he “can’t back out now.” Addressing Jake Claver lies Part 1 pic.twitter.com/rmVMK3XtUH — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 31, 2025 Serious Allegations Rector’s sharper allegations go beyond price talk and into what he described as XRP-focused funds offered through Digital Wealth Partners (DWP). He claimed the community has sent “so much XRP” into Claver’s orbit and that there is “a massive discrepancy from what he’s saying publicly and what investors are telling me privately.” “Jake and his scheme, his business has grown so big they’ve taken in so much XRP from our community,” Rector said. “There’s a massive discrepancy from what he’s saying publicly and what investors are telling me privately.” Rector said he has received fund reports and performance updates and claimed he is not sharing them publicly out of concern about retaliation, alleging investors have been warned not to share reporting and that reports are being watermarked with timestamps. He also made a specific performance claim: “one of the funds… has been losing money all year,” he said, adding it “lost over 4% on the year,” before fees, including “AUM fees of 2% in some cases.” Addressing Jake Claver lies Part 2 pic.twitter.com/rYkmJ1jsfr — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 31, 2025 Rector’s broader point was that XRP holders are being asked to accept a “ trust me bro relationship ” around returns, even as he says he has not heard from any investor who can confirm “payments and distributions coming out” in a way that matches the marketing. To explain why he views the trust gap as serious for XRP holders, Rector leaned on a prior legal dispute involving Claver and Digital Ascension. Rector said the case is public record and described it as “VeriVend versus Jacob Levi Claver and Digital Ascension Group” in the Western District of New York. He read from what he described as court filings and emphasized that the allegations and admissions, as he presented them, involve fabricated wire confirmations and impersonation. “This is a serious deal,” Rector said, arguing the behavior he described should matter to XRP holders being asked to trust performance claims, NDAs, and time-sensitive narratives. He urged viewers to review the “answer to the complaint,” which he said includes admissions such as registering a VeriVend-related domain and fabricating purported wire transfer confirmations. Rector also said the case settled, pointing to a “mediation certification” dated Feb. 12, 2025. He claimed, separately, that Claver paid the opposition in XRP to settle, an assertion Rector stated as a confirmation. Rector framed his goal as containment rather than escalation, saying he wants the community “to stay together” and “not be divided,” but he also laid down an explicit remedy: third-party verification. “I want a third-party audit of those funds,” he said, arguing that absent audited financials he will not trust performance reporting tied to XRP strategies.

This dramatic European banking job cuts scenario, driven by aggressive artificial intelligence adoption, signals the most profound workforce transformation in the sector’s modern history. According to a pivotal Morgan Stanley report detailed by the Financial Times, 35 major lenders could shed roughly 10% of their combined personnel. The relentless push for operational efficiency, now supercharged by AI, is compelling institutions to shutter physical branches and automate core functions at an unprecedented scale. The Scale and Scope of European Banking Job Cuts Morgan Stanley’s analysis provides a sobering quantification of the coming change. The projected loss of 200,000 positions represents a critical inflection point for an industry long defined by human intermediation. This workforce reduction is not a vague future possibility but a concrete strategic plan now taking shape in boardrooms across the continent. The report specifically highlights that back-office operations, risk management frameworks, and regulatory compliance departments will face the deepest cuts. These areas, often described as the unglamorous “guts” of banking, involve vast amounts of data processing and pattern recognition—tasks where advanced algorithms demonstrably outperform humans in both speed and accuracy. Consequently, banks are targeting staggering efficiency gains of up to 30%, a figure that makes the substantial upfront investment in AI technology a compelling business case. The Global Context and Early Movers This transformative wave extends far beyond European borders, establishing a clear global trend. In October, Goldman Sachs warned its U.S. employees of impending job cuts and a hiring freeze extending through 2025. This directive is part of the firm’s comprehensive “OneGS 3.0” initiative, which aims to embed AI across its entire operation, from client onboarding to complex regulatory reporting. Several European institutions are already translating strategy into action, providing a preview of the broader industry trajectory. ABN Amro: The Dutch lender has publicly announced plans to reduce its workforce by a fifth before 2028. Société Générale: The French bank’s CEO has issued a stark warning, declaring that “nothing is sacred” in the pursuit of technological efficiency and modernization. These early moves confirm that the analysis is not merely theoretical. They represent a tangible, ongoing restructuring of how banks organize labor and technology. A Cautionary Voice on Talent and Fundamentals Despite the overwhelming momentum toward automation, influential voices within finance urge a measured approach. A JPMorgan Chase executive quoted in the Financial Times report raised a significant long-term concern. The executive warned that an over-reliance on AI for analytical and decision-making tasks could prevent junior bankers from learning fundamental financial principles and critical thinking skills. This knowledge gap might create a future talent deficit, potentially haunting the industry during complex, non-standardized crises where human judgment remains paramount. This perspective introduces a crucial counterpoint to the pure efficiency narrative, emphasizing the need for a balanced transition that preserves institutional knowledge and expertise. Historical Precedents and Economic Impact The banking sector has undergone several waves of technological disruption, yet the scale and speed of this AI-driven shift are unprecedented. Previous automations, like the introduction of ATMs and online banking, changed customer interactions but often created new, different roles within banks. The current AI revolution, however, primarily targets high-skill, white-collar positions previously considered secure. The economic ripple effects of cutting 200,000 jobs across Europe will be substantial. These are typically well-paying roles concentrated in major financial hubs like London, Frankfurt, and Paris. Regional economies reliant on banking employment could face significant challenges, while national governments may need to reconsider policies on workforce retraining and social safety nets. The transition demands a coordinated response from industry leaders, policymakers, and educational institutions to manage the societal impact. Projected AI-Driven Banking Workforce Impact (2026-2030) Region Projected Job Reduction Primary Areas Affected Reported Efficiency Target Europe 200,000+ Back-office, Risk, Compliance ~30% United States Significant (e.g., Goldman Sachs freeze) Client Services, Reporting Not Disclosed Global Trend Accelerating Middle-office Functions 20-40% Industry-wide The Path Forward: Reskilling and Strategic Adaptation The narrative is not solely about job elimination. Forward-thinking banks are simultaneously investing in large-scale reskilling programs. The goal is to transition existing employees into new roles that leverage human skills like complex problem-solving, client relationship management, and ethical oversight of AI systems. Positions in AI governance, data strategy, and cybersecurity are likely to see growth. The ultimate success of this technological transformation will hinge on the financial industry’s ability to manage human capital with the same sophistication it applies to financial capital. Banks that navigate this shift effectively will likely achieve a powerful competitive advantage through lower costs and enhanced service capabilities. Conversely, those that fail to support their workforce through the transition may face operational instability and reputational damage. Conclusion The Morgan Stanley analysis crystallizes a definitive trend: the European banking sector stands on the brink of a decade defined by profound workforce transformation. The planned European banking job cuts of 200,000 positions by 2030 underscore AI’s role as the primary driver of efficiency and restructuring. While the promise of 30% efficiency gains is a powerful motivator for executives, the human and operational challenges are immense. The contrasting views between aggressive automation advocates and cautionary voices on talent development highlight the complex balancing act ahead. As algorithms take on more analytical work, the industry must deliberately cultivate the irreplaceable human skills of judgment, empathy, and innovation. The banks that thrive will be those that view AI not just as a tool for cost reduction, but as a catalyst for reinventing the value of human expertise in the financial world. FAQs Q1: Which banking jobs are most at risk from AI automation? A1: Jobs involving repetitive data processing, pattern recognition, and standardized reporting are most vulnerable. This includes many roles in back-office operations, risk analysis, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and basic financial reporting. Positions requiring high-level strategic advice, complex negotiation, or personal client trust are less immediately susceptible. Q2: Is this trend of job cuts unique to European banks? A2: No, this is a global phenomenon. The report focuses on Europe, but major U.S. institutions like Goldman Sachs have announced similar AI-driven restructuring and hiring freezes. Banks worldwide are pursuing automation to remain competitive, suggesting a sector-wide redefinition of the workforce. Q3: What is the expected timeline for these 200,000 job cuts? A3: The Morgan Stanley analysis projects these reductions will occur between now and 2030. Some banks, like ABN Amro, have already announced specific multi-year plans, indicating the process is already underway and will accelerate through the latter half of the decade. Q4: Will AI create new jobs in banking to replace those it eliminates? A4: Yes, but likely not in equal number or with the same skill profile. New roles will emerge in areas like AI model validation, data ethics, cybersecurity for AI systems, and hybrid positions that manage AI tools. The net effect, however, is projected to be a significant overall reduction in traditional banking roles. Q5: How should banking professionals prepare for this AI-driven change? A5: Professionals should focus on developing skills that complement AI, such as advanced problem-solving, client relationship management, understanding regulatory frameworks for technology, and learning to work alongside AI tools as a supervisor or interpreter. Proactively seeking training in data literacy and digital fluency is also highly advisable.

On-chain data, later reinforced by his public remarks, shows a deliberate concentration of capital into specific DeFi protocols he believes are positioned to outperform as liquidity conditions evolve. Ethereum Was Sold, Not Abandoned Blockchain data shows that over a two-week period, Hayes reduced his Ethereum exposure by selling a total of 1,871 ETH, valued at roughly $5.53 million at the time of execution. This was not an isolated transaction, as the ETH sales were followed closely by a series of DeFi purchases, indicating that Ethereum was used as a funding source rather than an asset he was exiting on conviction grounds. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Reach $1 In 2026? Analysts Reveal What To Expect This pattern aligns with Hayes’ broader view of Ethereum’s role in the market. ETH increasingly serves as foundational infrastructure and productive collateral, while much of the incremental return potential has migrated to protocols that sit closer to yield generation and cash-flow activity. Hayes had already signaled this thinking earlier, having trimmed ETH exposure in August, making the recent sales part of a continuing reallocation rather than a sudden reversal. Hayes later reinforced the rationale publicly, stating that his portfolio was rotating out of ETH and into “high-quality DeFi names,” based on the expectation that these assets could outperform in an environment of improving fiat liquidity. The speed and coordination of the trades suggest a clear macro-driven move rather than tactical speculation. The Thesis Behind Pendle, Lido DAO, Ethena, And Ether.fi Purchases Following the ETH sales, Hayes redeployed capital across four DeFi protocols, each targeting a different segment of the Ethereum financial stack. Initial purchases included 961,113 PENDLE worth about $1.75 million, reflecting exposure to yield tokenization and on-chain fixed-income markets. He also acquired 2.3 million LDO valued at roughly $1.29 million, positioning into liquid staking infrastructure that continues to play a central role in Ethereum’s staking economy. Related Reading: What Happens If The Bitcoin Price Closes 2025 In The Red? Analyst Answers Additional allocations went to Ethena and Ether.fi, with Hayes buying 6.05 million ENA for approximately $1.24 million and 491,401 ETHFI worth about $343,000. Minutes later, on-chain trackers reported follow-up purchases, showing Hayes doubling down on two positions. He added an additional 4.86 million ENA valued near $986,000 and 697,851 ETHFI worth roughly $485,000, pushing total DeFi deployment well beyond the original allocation. The structure of these buys matters. Pendle targets yield markets, Lido anchors staking liquidity, Ethena focuses on synthetic dollar mechanics, and Ether.fi captures emerging restaking yield. Together, they form a solid exposure to yield, capital efficiency, and infrastructure-level adoption rather than narrative-driven trades. Hayes’ actions underscore a consistent message: Ethereum remains the base layer, but he sees the strongest risk-adjusted opportunities in the DeFi protocols that actively convert ETH into productive, revenue-linked assets.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-momentum-shift-analyst-says-stop-crying-pay-attention-heres-why/,"An XRP-focused analyst, Steph Is Crypto, in a recent post, discussed XRP’s evolving price structure, urging market participants to “Stop crying and pay attention!” Rather than emphasizing sentiment or long-term narratives, the analyst centers the discussion on observable chart data, highlighting signs that momentum conditions may be changing after an extended period of downside pressure. The analysis is based on the XRP/U.S. dollar daily chart, where price action has remained under a descending trendline for several months. This trendline reflects a consistent pattern of lower highs, reinforcing the broader corrective structure that has defined XRP’s recent performance. However, the analyst suggests that while price remains constrained, internal momentum indicators are beginning to diverge from the downward trajectory. $XRP momentum shift. Stop crying and pay attention! pic.twitter.com/XPxrr9dU8y — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 31, 2025 Price Action and Structural Context On the daily timeframe, XRP continues to trade below key resistance levels, with price compressing near the lower boundary of its recent range. The descending trendline drawn across prior swing highs remains intact, indicating that the general trend has not yet reversed. Despite this, the compression of price action near this trendline is presented as a noteworthy development, particularly when evaluated alongside momentum metrics. Steph Is Crypto emphasizes that price structure alone does not provide the full picture. Instead, the analysis encourages traders to compare price behavior with indicator movement, suggesting that the relationship between the two is becoming increasingly misaligned. MACD and RSI Indicate Momentum Divergence The attached charts highlight the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator forming higher lows, even as price action continues to trend downward. This divergence is commonly interpreted by technical analysts as a sign that selling pressure may be weakening. The MACD histogram appears to be stabilizing, while the signal and MACD lines show early signs of convergence from deeply negative territory. In parallel, the Relative Strength Index on the daily chart displays a similar pattern. While RSI remains below the neutral 50 level, it has been gradually trending upward from previous lows. This upward slope suggests improving momentum conditions, even though XRP has yet to register a decisive price breakout.

One response highlighted the belief that many holders underestimate the long-term value proposition of XRP , suggesting that short-term price targets may fail to reflect broader expectations. This comment supports the divide between traders focused on near-term price action and those maintaining long-term conviction regardless of interim volatility. Overall, Steph Is Crypto’s analysis does not claim that a reversal is already confirmed. Instead, it presents technical evidence that momentum conditions are shifting beneath the surface.

56704616,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257894,1767302711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Federal Reserve Poised for Crucial Rate Hold in January as Liquidity Pressures Mount,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-january-rate-hold-liquidity/,"BitcoinWorld Federal Reserve Poised for Crucial Rate Hold in January as Liquidity Pressures Mount WASHINGTON, D.C., January 2025 – Financial markets now overwhelmingly anticipate the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rate stance during the upcoming January policy meeting. This expectation follows revealing minutes from December’s Federal Open Market Committee gathering that highlighted growing concerns about systemic liquidity. Consequently, analysts predict the central bank will prioritize liquidity management tools over immediate rate adjustments. Federal Reserve Interest Rates Decision: January’s Critical Juncture The Federal Open Market Committee convenes on January 27-28 for its first policy meeting of 2025. Market participants currently assign an 85.1% probability to a rate hold scenario, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. This tool analyzes futures market data to gauge expectations. The minutes from December’s meeting revealed committee members actively discussed preemptive measures to address liquidity concerns. These discussions focused particularly on potential Treasury bill purchases and repo facility expansions. Historical context illuminates the current situation. The Federal Reserve began its current tightening cycle in March 2022 to combat inflation. Subsequently, it raised the federal funds rate eleven times over twenty months. However, the central bank paused rate hikes in September 2024 as inflation showed signs of moderation. Now, the committee faces different challenges centered on financial system stability rather than purely inflationary pressures. Liquidity Management Takes Priority Over Rate Cuts The December FOMC minutes contained a significant revelation. Committee members noted that current liquidity pressures are building faster than during the 2017-2019 quantitative tightening period. Quantitative tightening refers to the Fed’s process of reducing its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature without reinvestment. This process naturally drains liquidity from the financial system. To counteract these pressures, the Fed is considering purchasing approximately $220 billion in short-term Treasury bills. Additionally, it might expand its repurchase agreement (repo) facility. This facility allows primary dealers to borrow cash from the Fed overnight using Treasury securities as collateral. An expansion would provide more reliable short-term funding to markets. Key measures under consideration include: Short-term Treasury bill purchases totaling $220 billion Expansion of the overnight repurchase agreement facility Potential adjustments to the discount window operations Enhanced communication about liquidity provisions Expert Analysis on Monetary Policy Direction Former Federal Reserve economists and market strategists provide crucial context. Dr. Eleanor Vance, who served on the Fed’s research staff from 2015-2022, explains the current approach. “The Fed appears to be separating its inflation fight from its financial stability mandate,” she notes. “By using balance sheet tools for liquidity while holding rates steady for inflation, they’re employing a dual-track strategy.” Market data supports this analytical perspective. The spread between overnight index swaps and Treasury bills has widened significantly in recent weeks. This widening indicates increased funding stress in short-term markets. Furthermore, bank reserve levels at the Fed have declined to approximately $2.8 trillion from their 2022 peak of $4.3 trillion. This decline creates operational challenges for financial institutions. Federal Reserve Policy Tools Comparison Tool Primary Purpose Current Status Federal Funds Rate Control inflation and economic growth Likely on hold at 5.25-5.50% Treasury Purchases Provide system liquidity Under consideration for $220B Repo Facility Ensure overnight funding stability Potential expansion discussed Balance Sheet Runoff Normalize Fed’s securities holdings Continuing at $95B monthly pace Market Implications and Economic Consequences Financial markets have responded cautiously to these developments. Treasury yields have shown increased volatility, particularly at the short end of the curve. The two-year Treasury note yield has fluctuated between 4.2% and 4.6% over the past month. Meanwhile, equity markets have priced in the high probability of a January pause. However, they remain sensitive to any signals about future policy direction. The banking sector faces particular scrutiny. Regional banks especially depend on stable funding markets. Their net interest margins have compressed significantly during the tightening cycle. Now, potential liquidity support from the Fed could alleviate some pressure. Nevertheless, credit conditions continue to tighten according to the Fed’s own Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. Global central banks watch these developments closely. The European Central Bank and Bank of England face similar balancing acts. They must manage inflation while ensuring financial stability. International coordination on liquidity provisions has increased since the 2023 banking stress episodes. Central bankers frequently communicate through the Bank for International Settlements framework. The Historical Precedent: 2019 Repo Market Stress Current discussions echo events from late 2019. At that time, repo rates spiked unexpectedly due to technical factors and reserve scarcity. The Fed responded with temporary and then permanent repo operations. It also began purchasing Treasury bills to increase reserves. These actions successfully stabilized markets but signaled underlying fragility. Today’s situation differs in important ways. The Fed’s balance sheet remains much larger than in 2019. Additionally, regulatory changes have altered bank behavior. The Supplementary Leverage Ratio and liquidity coverage requirements influence how institutions manage their balance sheets. These factors complicate the Fed’s liquidity management calculations. Conclusion The Federal Reserve likely will hold interest rates steady at its January 2025 meeting. This decision reflects a strategic prioritization of liquidity management over immediate rate adjustments. The central bank’s consideration of Treasury bill purchases and repo facility expansion demonstrates proactive concern about financial system stability. Market participants should monitor the January FOMC statement closely for details on these liquidity measures. The Federal Reserve continues navigating complex trade-offs between inflation control and financial stability in an evolving economic landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the probability of a Fed rate hold in January? The CME FedWatch Tool indicates an 85.1% probability that the Federal Reserve will maintain current interest rates at its January 27-28, 2025 meeting. Q2: Why is the Fed considering Treasury bill purchases? The December FOMC minutes revealed concerns about liquidity pressures building faster than during the 2017-2019 period. Purchasing approximately $220 billion in short-term Treasurys would help maintain adequate system liquidity. Q3: How does this situation compare to 2019 repo market stress? While similar in some aspects, today’s context differs significantly. The Fed’s balance sheet remains larger, regulatory requirements have changed, and the economic backdrop involves different inflation dynamics. Q4: What tools is the Fed considering for liquidity management? Primary tools under discussion include short-term Treasury bill purchases, expansion of the repurchase agreement facility, and potential adjustments to discount window operations. Q5: How might this affect financial markets? A rate hold with complementary liquidity measures could stabilize short-term funding markets. However, it might also signal continued caution about inflation, potentially supporting longer-term Treasury yields.

Projects that are being eyed by investors looking at a combination of the above are Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano (ADA) might continue to see gains as its network fosters growth with an influx of developers and scalability in the long run. Ethereum continues to be the foundation of decentralized finance and, with its huge market cap, continues to offer steady growth. Lastly, Mutuum Finance is getting immense attention as the top cheap cryptocurrency to buy at present, available at merely $0.04 in presale phase 7. Cardano at Channel Support Cardano is resting on the lower boundary of its descending channel, which is a strong accumulation zone. ADA price chart depicts consolidation, and despite market fluctuations, support zone has been quite robust, indicating that the selling force on the price might be easing off. Price might return to the mid or upper part of the descending channel if positive momentum builds. However, while Cardano demonstrates potential for a rebound, stronger momentum is building in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.04. Ethereum Outlook Amid Institutional Interest Ethereum (ETH) is also making a comeback after the prediction of Tom Lee that price might reach $7,000-$9,000 in early 2026 due to structural demand. As stated by Tom Lee, it’s crystal clear that Ethereum is in the process of the liquidity reset due to the volatility that occurred during the liquidation of October. The adoption of Ethereum by institutions is rising, and it’s already being seen with BitMine investing $1 billion in ETH in just two days. As Ethereum is leading large cap assets toward potential recovery, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rises fast as the top cheap cryptocurrency to buy. MUTM Picks Up Pace During Presale Phase 7 One of the projects that are attracting more investors right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which is currently in presale. The cost of tokens has gone up to $0.04 in phase 7 given the very quick sellout of Phase 6. Time is running out fast to acquire MUTM at this price. A 500% price jump is expected as the token approaches its final presale stages and eventual market launch at $0.06. Early predictions show MUTM could easily be the next crypto to hit $1, which would see current investors reap massive gains in the next bull run. The project has already received $19.5 million from the presale, with 18,630 token holders taking part in this process. It is important to note that the current price of Phase 7 represents a rise of 300% over Phase 1, initially being $0.01. Taking part in the Mutuum Finance presale has been simplified by the ability to buy tokens via credit and debit cards with zero limits. This lowers the barrier for newbie investors who may not know how to navigate crypto wallets, making MUTM the best crypto to invest in right now. Leaderboard Incentives For the purpose of actively engaging the community, the Mutuum Finance platform has introduced a leaderboard that shows the Top 50 Holders ranking on a dashboard. For the first position on the daily buyer leaderboard, there is a bonus of $500 MUTM for the top-ranking investor. The only requirement is to have made a transaction within a 24-hour period resetting at 00:00 UTC. CertiK and Halborn Audits Mutuum finance has undergone security audits by Certik and Halborn, two of the biggest blockchain security platforms. On the Certik audit, the project scored a 95.0/100, showcasing a secure DeFi protocol. The most recent of the two audits was the one by Halborn, which was only recently completed. Following the audit, the MUTM team implemented the feedback and is now set for V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia testnet. The timeline for this launch will shortly be given by the team. This incentive structure brings to fore the functionality-focused development of the MUTM token. Additionally, factoring in its early stage of development, as well as impressive fundamentals, MUTM is identified as one of the best value-for-money DeFi tokens as well as a crypto to keep an eye on in 2026. Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) are seeing steady progress; however, the biggest opportunity exists within Mutuum Finance (MUTM), now priced at $0.04 during the Presale Phase 7.

Tether Has Purchased Another 8,888 Bitcoin In a new post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has shared the blockchain details of a Bitcoin transaction that the company made during the past day. With this transfer, the firm moved exactly 8,888.8888888 BTC from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex to its BTC reserve. Tether is a digital asset company best known for being the issuer of the stablecoin USDT. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that have their price pegged to a fiat currency and USDT, tied to the US Dollar, is currently the largest asset of this type in the world in terms of market cap . Tether has been maintaining a Bitcoin reserve since 2023, when it announced that it will regularly be allocating 15% of its net realized operating profits to the number one cryptocurrency as part of a new investment strategy. The company has since gradually been adding to the reserve, with the latest expansion announced by Ardoino corresponding to accumulation that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2025. At the time that the transaction shared by the Tether CEO occurred, the new coins were worth $778.7 million. This latest purchase has taken the company’s total holdings to 96,370 BTC, equivalent to more than $8.46 billion. For comparison, the second largest public Bitcoin treasury company, MARA Holdings, owns just 53,250 BTC ($4.68 billion). Thus, the firm’s BTC reserve is one of the largest in the world. Though, while Tether’s holdings are very significant, they still pale in comparison to Strategy, the largest corporate holder of the asset. Led by co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, the company has been accumulating the coin for years now, with the latest purchase coming just this Monday. This buy, involving 1,229 BTC, took the treasury firm’s total holdings to 672,497 BTC to cap off 2025. At the current exchange rate, this massive reserve is worth more than $59.1 billion. Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency sector have been experiencing a bearish phase since the top in October, but it would appear that this market shift hasn’t discouraged the likes of Tether and Strategy from accumulating more of the asset. The bearish momentum in the sector has also affected the stablecoins. As data from DefiLlama shows, the market cap of these assets was following an uptrend between 2024 and the last quarter of 2025. Since October, though, growth has flatlined. As mentioned before, Tether’s USDT is the most dominant stablecoin. It makes up for $187 billion of the $308 billion market cap attached to the sector. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $87,900, down 0.5% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Tether|Tether Bitcoin|USDT,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-01 22:00:31

This incident, involving the unauthorized creation of 150 million FLOW tokens, highlights the ongoing challenges of securing next-generation blockchain infrastructure and the complex balance between technical fixes and community consensus. Flow Foundation Hack Triggers a Phased Recovery Response The breach targeted the Flow blockchain’s unique dual-chain architecture. Consequently, the foundation’s initial technical response considered a network rollback. However, strong opposition from the decentralized community swiftly emerged. Therefore, the foundation pivoted to a more nuanced plan. This two-stage approach prioritizes network normalization first, followed by a permanent economic fix. Stage one has already seen the successful normalization of Cadence, Flow’s proprietary non-EVM smart contract language. Developers report that the core chain is now stable. Meanwhile, stage two focuses on the compromised Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility layer. The foundation aims to restore full EVM functionality within days. Crucially, the plan centers on burning the illicitly minted tokens rather than reversing the chain’s history. Anatomy of the $3.9 Million Blockchain Exploit Forensic analysis suggests the attacker exploited a vulnerability to mint 150 million FLOW tokens. This staggering figure represents approximately 10% of the total token supply. The hacker’s subsequent actions followed a familiar laundering pattern. Initially, the funds moved to a centralized exchange, widely suspected to be Binance. On that platform, the FLOW tokens were swapped for Bitcoin (BTC). Finally, the BTC was withdrawn, obscuring the trail. This sequence raises immediate questions for regulatory observers. The movement of such a large volume of illicit funds through a major exchange will likely trigger scrutiny. Specifically, compliance teams will examine the platform’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This event may serve as a case study for future regulatory actions in the digital asset space. Expert Analysis: The Rollback Debate and Governance Precedent Blockchain security experts note that the community’s rejection of a rollback is highly significant. A rollback, or chain reorganization, would have reversed transactions to a point before the hack. While technically feasible, such actions are philosophically contentious. They contradict the principle of immutability—the idea that blockchain transactions are permanent and unchangeable. “The decision to burn tokens instead of executing a rollback is a landmark moment for Flow’s governance,” explains Dr. Anya Sharma, a distributed systems professor at Stanford University. “It demonstrates that technical teams are yielding to decentralized community sentiment. This prioritizes long-term trust in the network’s neutrality over a short-term technical reset. However, the token burn must be executed flawlessly to prevent inflationary pressure on the remaining FLOW supply.” Comparative Impact on Flow’s Dual-Chain Architecture Flow’s design differs from single-chain networks like Ethereum. Its architecture separates transaction execution (Cadence) from EVM compatibility. The hack primarily affected the EVM chain, which is a bridge for Ethereum-based applications and assets. The table below outlines the status and function of each chain post-incident: Chain Primary Function Status Post-Hack Recovery Action Cadence (Non-EVM) Native smart contracts & NFTs Normalized & Stable Security audit completed EVM Chain Ethereum dApp compatibility Under Restoration Token burn & patch deployment This targeted impact allowed the core network to remain operational. Notably, major applications built on Cadence, including NBA Top Shot, experienced minimal disruption. The containment showcases a potential advantage of modular blockchain design during a security crisis. The Road to Restoration and Regulatory Repercussions The foundation’s recovery roadmap now enters its most critical phase. The planned token burn requires precise execution to remove the fraudulent supply from circulation. Simultaneously, engineers are patching the vulnerability that enabled the unauthorized minting. The broader ecosystem is watching closely, as the outcome will influence: Investor Confidence: A smooth recovery can demonstrate resilience. Developer Trust: Builders need assurance of network stability. Regulatory Attention: The exchange’s role may attract formal inquiries. Industry Standards: The response sets a precedent for handling large-scale exploits. Furthermore, the incident underscores the importance of robust, audited code—especially for bridges and compatibility layers that connect different blockchain environments. These cross-chain tools have become frequent targets for sophisticated attackers. Conclusion The Flow Foundation hack and its ensuing two-stage recovery plan present a real-time lesson in modern blockchain crisis management. By abandoning the contentious network rollback in favor of a community-endorsed token burn, the foundation is navigating a complex path between technical resolution and decentralized governance. The successful restoration of the EVM chain and the permanent removal of the illicit tokens will be the ultimate test of this strategy. This event not only stresses the perpetual need for advanced security in blockchain infrastructure but also highlights the growing power of community governance in determining the legitimate response to a major FLOW token security breach. FAQs Q1: What was the initial plan the Flow Foundation abandoned? The foundation initially proposed a network rollback, which would have reversed the blockchain’s transaction history to a point before the hack. The community strongly opposed this, leading to the current two-stage recovery plan. Q2: How does a token burn help recover from the hack? Burning the 150 million illicitly created FLOW tokens permanently removes them from circulation. This action aims to neutralize the inflationary impact of the hack and restore the token’s economic integrity without altering past transactions. Q3: What is the difference between Cadence and the EVM chain on Flow? Cadence is Flow’s native, non-EVM smart contract language, designed for high-performance applications like NFTs. The EVM chain is a separate compatibility layer that allows applications built for Ethereum to run on the Flow network. The hack primarily affected the EVM chain. Q4: Why does the hacker’s use of an exchange raise concerns? Moving $3.9 million in illicitly obtained funds through a centralized exchange triggers questions about that platform’s compliance procedures. Regulators may examine whether the exchange’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) systems effectively flagged or prevented the transaction. Q5: What are the potential long-term impacts of this incident on the Flow blockchain? Long-term impacts depend on the recovery’s success. A smooth resolution could demonstrate strong governance and technical resilience, building trust. A flawed recovery or further issues could damage developer and investor confidence, potentially affecting FLOW’s adoption and market value.

The list framed a future where stablecoins will rival global card networks, privacy tools will become a key competitive advantage, and crypto firms will move beyond trading as markets prepare for a possible rebound. The Main Story: A Vision Beyond Trading The firm’s detailed list framed 2026 as a pivotal year for maturing blockchain applications. A central theme is the evolution of stablecoins from a niche crypto tool into a core component of global finance. a16z suggested these digital dollars could trigger a long-awaited modernization of banking infrastructure, stating “the internet becomes the bank.” This implies a future where digital wallets and decentralized networks handle payments and wealth management at a scale rivaling traditional giants. Additionally, a16z identified privacy as “the most important moat in crypto.” This marks a significant shift in narrative, suggesting that the ability to conduct verifiable yet confidential transactions will become a primary feature attracting users, rather than just transparent speculation. This outlook arrived at a time when crypto markets are displaying unusual calm, with analytics from Santiment showing trading activity for major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has slowed to yearly lows, with many altcoins losing momentum at the tail end of 2025. Macro Signals Hint at Rotation Toward Crypto in 2026 While short-term interest looks muted, several analysts see conditions lining up for a stronger year ahead. For instance, market observers pointed to the Federal Reserve ending quantitative tightening and cutting rates three times in 2025, with further reductions expected in 2026. Lower borrowing costs and looser liquidity have historically favored risk assets, including digital currencies. Another analyst, Bull Theory, compared Bitcoin’s current pause to mid-2020, when gold and silver rallied first before capital later flowed into crypto. Precious metals are again setting records, which some view as a sign that liquidity may rotate next rather than exit markets. Altcoins, however, remain mixed. Solana (SOL) held near $126 through December even as spot trading slowed, though recent ETF inflows suggest institutions are still paying attention. Other large tokens, such as Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE), ended the year lower, reflecting limited retail interest. Against this backdrop, a16z’s focus on payments, privacy, and practical blockchain uses suggests the next phase may depend less on speculation and more on whether crypto can prove its value in everyday finance as 2026 unfolds.

XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are currently among the top assets to watch as potential best crypto to buy. With Bitcoin holding around $87.5K, most altcoins are still sitting more than 50% below their all-time highs. Bitcoin has effectively broken the traditional four-year cycle, so no one can say for sure what will happen next. Still, from a fundamental standpoint, SOL, XRP, and DOGE stand out as some of the most interesting choices going into the new year, and here is why. Ripple (XRP) Could Head To $8: Bank Analyst Predicts XRP just hit an eight-year low in terms of supply available on exchanges. Fewer coins on exchanges usually signal accumulation as price hits new lows. This long-term accumulation is mainly supported by ETFs, which have now recorded over $1.4B in inflows since launch. That represents almost 0.75% of the total supply in a couple of months. Analysts from banking giant Standard Chartered have predicted XRP could skyrocket more than 300% to over $8 in 2026, driven by demand from spot XRP ETFs and the regulatory clarity the asset now has. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. If that level holds, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 48, which leaves room for a short-term rally toward $2.20. Any sustained break below $1.80 would damage the bullish structure, and the $1.60 level becomes the critical support to watch on the downside. Solana (SOL) is The Top Chain In 2025 Solana is no longer an emerging chain. It ended 2025 as the top blockchain by revenue, pulling in over $1.4B and surpassing Hyperliquid, which ranked second. Solana was also the leading chain by DEX volume and ranked second only to Binance Smart Chain in active addresses in November, even though those months were among the weakest periods for the network. Source: Cryptorank Another major milestone that cannot be ignored is the approval of Solana ETFs. These are expected to drive fresh growth for the ecosystem, similar to what happened at launch, when SOL saw 21 straight days of inflows. With all of this happening while price continues to hold above its 18-month support, Solana could be setting up for explosive performance in 2026. Technically, SOL is currently still leaning bearish. Price is stuck inside a descending channel on the 4-hour chart, printing lower highs since the $145 peak and repeatedly tapping support around $117–$118. The fact that this support has held twice actually matters more than most people think. If Solana can break and hold above the $127.50–$130.50 zone, momentum could flip fast. That would open the door to $133 first, then a retest of the channel top around $139–$140. If it fails instead, $118 comes back into play, with $112 as the next deeper support to watch. If You Bet On Memecoins, You Bet On Dogecoin (DOGE) Memecoins were mostly dead in 2025. After starting the year strong with a Solana-led memecoin season, the Trump memecoin launch marked the turning point. That single event likely damaged retail trust in memecoins more than anything else, as the Trump token kept sliding and never recovered. Since then, sentiment has dropped to its lowest levels in years. Still, some believe memecoins always come back when nobody expects them. If you are one of those, then Dogecoin is the obvious pick. It is still the leader of the memecoin space and is currently down more than 62% year over year. Dogecoin price has been descending for a while now. It hit $0.12, which is a yearly low, and it is currently holding around that level. For now, this zone is acting as a demand floor, but repeated tests tend to weaken support. If sellers stay in control, the risk of a breakdown increases. On the upside, the $0.14 area stands out as a key resistance level. It lines up with prior consolidation and multiple rejection points. As long as Dogecoin stays below this zone, any upside move is likely corrective rather than a full trend reversal. A more meaningful bullish signal would only appear if price reclaims and holds above the broader $0.16 resistance band. That kind of move would signal a momentum shift and could open the door for a recovery toward $0.18 first, and potentially $0.20–$0.21, which matches the higher targets marked on the chart. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The High-Conviction Wildcard for 2026 While majors like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are rebuilding structure, some investors are looking further out on the risk curve. That is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) keeps showing up. Bitcoin Hyper just crossed a $30M milestone raised, a key psychological level that signals growing conviction from early buyers. The idea is simple but powerful: extend Bitcoin into a high-speed Layer 2 environment without sacrificing its brand or liquidity gravity. Built as a Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2, Hyper focuses on fast settlement, low fees, and smart-contract compatibility, opening the door for DeFi, payments, and yield strategies that native Bitcoin cannot handle efficiently today. Instead of competing with BTC, it is designed to scale Bitcoin usage. The reason some are paying attention now is timing. Presales that clear major funding milestones tend to see renewed interest as narratives rotate back to infrastructure plays. With Bitcoin holding near $87K and altcoins still depressed, capital is increasingly hunting for asymmetric setups tied to the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. Bitcoin Hyper is still early, still speculative, but the $30M raised mark suggests this is no longer flying under the radar. If Bitcoin-centric Layer 2 narratives take off in 2026, $HYPER could be one of the names traders circle next.

That’s the core argument from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc), who said Bitcoin futures volumes have been “cut in half since November 22,” dropping from $123 billion in daily volume to $63 billion. Futures, Not ETFs, Are Holding Bitcoin In Place The slowdown, he added, “partly explains the low volatility observed on BTC in recent weeks.” But the bigger point is relative scale: at $63 billion per day, futures still represent “nearly 20 times the volume of spot Bitcoin ETFs ($3.4B) and about 10 times spot market volumes ($6B),” according to the analyst. In other words, even if ETF outflows are real and visible, they may not be the dominant marginal force setting the tone. “Many continue to point to ETFs, which have experienced significant outflows in recent weeks,” Darkfost wrote. “While these outflows do contribute to selling pressure, futures markets clearly remain the dominant force in overall volumes.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Dump Is Over: On-Chain Data Just Flipped Darkfost pointed to net taker volume, a derivatives metric used to infer whether aggressive buying or selling is dominating, as a cleaner read on why price has struggled to trend. He framed it in conditional terms based on prior market behavior: “Each time net taker volume has turned negative, Bitcoin has entered a corrective phase. When this indicator moves into negative territory, selling volume dominates.” In his telling, the market has been living with that bias for months. Since July, net taker volume has “generally remained negative,” he said, with one notable interruption: “A noticeable slowdown occurred in early October, allowing Bitcoin to set a new all time high, but selling pressure quickly regained control. Today, selling volumes continue to dominate and have kept Bitcoin trapped in a range for about a month.” There is, however, a tentative improvement in the same dataset. Darkfost said futures-driven selling pressure has declined since early November, with net taker volume improving from around -$489 million to -$93 million. He described that as “a positive signal,” but not yet enough to change the regime. “Liquidity remains weak,” he wrote, adding that ETF and spot volumes are “still too limited to allow BTC to break out of its current consolidation phase.” Demand Is Key In a separate X post, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research Julio Moreno added a broader framing that shifts attention away from chart-based cycle narratives and toward demand dynamics. “Most are focusing on price performance to define a cycle, when it is demand what they should be looking to,” Moreno wrote. “Bitcoin demand is contracting on monthly terms and slowing down significantly on an annual basis (and about to get into negative territory).” Alongside the futures-driven explanation for Bitcoin’s stall, the selling pressure from long-term holders (LTHs) emerged in recent weeks as the main driver for Bitcoin lagging performance against the stock market and gold. As reported yesterday, the long-term holder selling appeared to have stopped, according to multiple on-chain commentators, with around 10,700 BTC transitioning into long term held coins. Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast In his latest post, leading Glassnode analyst CryptoVizArt argued the change is more about tempo than direction. “LTHs didn’t stop selling,” the analyst wrote, claiming LTHs “are still spending ~7.3k BTC/day (7D SMA) and still realizing <$200M/day in profit. What changed is the rate, not the behavior. This is a cooldown after months of heavy distribution, not a flip to pure accumulation.” Darkfost didn’t dispute that LTHs can be persistent sellers, but he emphasized a different lens. “LTHs never really stop selling in reality, but when we look at supply change, it gives a different picture,” he wrote. “It appears that their distribution has come to an end for now, meaning the amount of BTC maturing and transitioning into LTH status equals the BTC being sold by LTHs (STH buying).” At press time, BTC traded at $87,972.

So we asked the new GPT 5.2 to forecast prices for XRP, PEPE, and Shiba Inu in 2026, and the results were pretty interesting. Below is ChatGPT’s dual-scenario outlook, breaking down both the upside potential and the downside risks for each asset as January unfolds and 2026 gets underway. Ripple (XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Potential Rally Up to $8 ChatGPT predicts going into 2026 for the bull case. It makes it clear that the outlook is driven by post-lawsuit regulatory clarity, accelerating institutional interest, and expanding real-world payment adoption. Analysts expect this strong XRP performance to continue, aligning with ChatGPT AI predictions of a revisit to the $3 to $5 range heading into 2026. Source: ChatGPT There are three key levels to watch on the XRP chart right now. To keep the bullish structure intact, XRP needs to stay above $1.80 as we move into Q1. If that level holds, a move back toward the $2.00 psychological resistance is likely. With the RSI sitting around 48, there is still room for a short-term push toward $2.20. A clean break below $1.80 would weaken the setup, and then $1.60 becomes the main support level to keep an eye on. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView Strong Altcoins Market Could Rotate To Memecoins Like Pepe And Shiba Inu ChatGPT predicts the memecoin sector could finally revive if crypto enters a proper altcoin season. That would push investors back into risk-on assets and inject fresh liquidity into the sector. For PEPE, ChatGPT predicts a rally of over 200% from current levels. This is mainly driven by a community that has survived two cycles, along with rising trading volume and increased social engagement. This PEPE weekly chart shows price bleeding all the way back into the range lows after months of lower highs, which is usually where either a bounce starts, or the structure fully breaks. The range low zone has been tested multiple times now, so it is weak, but buyers are still defending it for the moment. As long as PEPE holds this base, the upside path is clear, first reclaiming the mid-range, then pushing into the range highs where heavy resistance sits. For Shiba, it is a different story. ChatGPT says it has one of the largest ecosystems and growing burn mechanics. That could help support the price going into 2026. On top of that, the long-awaited privacy upgrade could also drive new demand to the chain. Price-wise, ChatGPT predicts a potential rally of over 500% on the bullish side, while the bearish scenario points to a possible 70% drop if momentum stays weak. SHIB is still trending down, but the price is sitting on a demand zone that is holding for now. The bounce looks like relief rather than a trend flip, but sellers failed to make a new low. RSI near 46 shows neutral momentum, while MACD is flat, suggesting selling pressure is fading. Holding this level and reclaiming $0.00000754 opens a move toward $0.00000801, but losing support keeps the bearish structure intact. Maxi Doge Is Built For One Thing: Maximum Meme Exposure If 2026 really brings a fresh altcoin and memecoin rotation, then pure memes will outperform narratives, roadmaps, and promises. That is exactly where Maxi Doge comes in. Maxi Doge does not pretend to be an infrastructure or a utility play. It is a high-conviction memecoin designed for momentum, liquidity waves, and retail-driven upside when risk appetite flips back on. While large-cap memes like DOGE, PEPE, and SHIB grind through heavy resistance and legacy supply, Maxi Doge is positioned as a cleaner, earlier-stage play that can move faster when capital rotates down the curve. No complex tokenomics. No forced utility. Just a meme built for volatility, attention, and social-driven demand. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.4 million, while early backers are earning up to 71% APY through staking rewards. If memecoins do revive the way ChatGPT expects in a true altcoin season, Maxi Doge is the kind of asset that benefits most from that environment. High risk. High volatility. Pure meme energy.

The firm’s latest outlook, published in March 2025, anticipates major structural shifts in international payments, financial privacy, and practical blockchain utility, driven primarily by the maturation and adoption of dollar-pegged and other fiat-backed digital currencies. Stablecoins Transition from Niche to Core Financial Infrastructure a16z Crypto’s analysis positions stablecoins beyond their current role as a trading pair or a volatility hedge within cryptocurrency markets. Consequently, the firm envisions these digital assets evolving into a core settlement layer for global commerce. This transition hinges on several converging factors. First, regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions like the United States and the European Union has provided a more stable operating environment. Second, traditional financial institutions are now actively integrating stablecoin rails into their existing payment systems. Finally, technological advancements in blockchain scalability have reduced transaction costs and increased throughput to levels competitive with legacy systems. For instance, the total settled value on stablecoin networks has consistently rivaled that of established processors like Visa over recent quarters. This metric demonstrates their growing real-world utility. Furthermore, central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects worldwide are accelerating, creating a public-sector parallel that validates the digital currency model and often leverages similar technological foundations. The 2025 Landscape: Payments, Privacy, and New Use Cases The a16z report details three primary vectors for stablecoin impact this year. The most immediate is the transformation of cross-border payments. Traditional international wire transfers are often slow, expensive, and opaque. In contrast, stablecoin transactions can settle in minutes for a fraction of the cost, providing a compelling alternative for remittances and business-to-business payments. Major payment processors and fintech companies are already piloting these services for corporate clients. Secondly, the intersection of stablecoins and privacy-enhancing technologies is gaining traction. While transactions on public blockchains are transparent, new cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs allow users to prove solvency or the validity of a payment without revealing all underlying details. This development could enable compliant private transactions, a feature highly sought after by both individuals and institutions. Expert Analysis on the Macroeconomic Drivers Financial analysts point to broader macroeconomic trends supporting this shift. In regions with high inflation or currency volatility, dollar-denominated stablecoins offer a more accessible store of value and medium of exchange than physical dollars. This use case has seen significant organic adoption in several emerging economies. Additionally, the programmable nature of stablecoins unlocks novel financial applications, often called “DeFi” or decentralized finance. These include automated savings protocols, instant collateralized lending, and streamlined payroll systems that operate 24/7. The following table contrasts traditional and stablecoin-enabled systems across key metrics: Metric Traditional Cross-Border Payment Stablecoin Payment Settlement Time 1-5 Business Days Minutes to Hours Average Cost 3-5% + Fees Often Accessibility Requires Bank Account Requires Internet & Digital Wallet Transparency Low (Opaque Intermediaries) High (Auditable Public Ledger) However, the path forward is not without challenges. Regulatory compliance, particularly regarding Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules, remains a complex hurdle for widespread institutional adoption. Moreover, the stability of the stablecoins themselves relies on the credibility and transparency of their underlying asset reserves, a point of continued scrutiny by regulators and auditors alike. Conclusion The 2025 outlook from a16z Crypto underscores a transformative phase for digital assets, with stablecoins at the epicenter. Their integration into global finance is moving beyond theory into tangible application, driven by technological readiness, regulatory evolution, and clear market demand for more efficient financial infrastructure. While hurdles persist, the trajectory suggests that stablecoins will play an increasingly critical role in reshaping how value is transferred and stored worldwide, marking this year as a definitive turning point for the entire blockchain ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset, most commonly a fiat currency like the US Dollar. They achieve this stability by being backed by reserves of the pegged asset or through algorithmic mechanisms. Q2: Why does a16z Crypto believe 2025 is a pivotal year for stablecoins? a16z points to converging factors including clearer regulations, active integration by traditional finance, improved blockchain scalability, and growing real-world use cases in cross-border payments and decentralized finance, all reaching critical mass this year. Q3: How could stablecoins improve cross-border payments? They can significantly reduce settlement times from days to minutes and lower transaction costs by eliminating multiple intermediary banks, providing a faster, cheaper, and more transparent alternative for international money transfers. Q4: What are the main risks associated with using stablecoins? Key risks include regulatory uncertainty in some regions, potential de-pegging events if the issuer’s reserves are inadequate or not transparent, and the custodial risk associated with the platforms and wallets used to hold them. Q5: Are stablecoins the same as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)? No, they are different. Stablecoins are typically issued by private companies. CBDCs are digital forms of a country’s official fiat currency, issued and regulated directly by its central bank. However, the development of CBDCs often validates the broader digital currency concept.

Key Takeaways: Fed bond buying and lower rates could support Bitcoin in 2026. Clearer regulation and institutional demand remain long-term tailwinds. Gains are likely to be steadier, with fewer sharp rallies. Speaking on Schwab Network , Barhydt said the U.S. central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy. He pointed to early signs of renewed balance sheet support, describing the current environment as “quantitative easing light,” with the Federal Reserve stepping in to support demand for government debt. Fed Bond Buying, Falling Rates Could Lift Bitcoin in 2026 “We are seeing the Fed start to buy its own bonds,” Barhydt said. “Next year, demand for government debt is likely to fall alongside lower interest rates. That combination tends to be positive for all assets, including Bitcoin.” Beyond liquidity, Barhydt brought up regulatory clarity in the U.S. and rising institutional participation as tailwinds that could extend Bitcoin’s upside beyond a single cycle. In his view, lower rates paired with clearer rules could set the stage for several strong years across the digital asset market. Market expectations, however, suggest policymakers remain cautious in the near term. Data from the CME Group shows that just 14.9% of traders expect an interest rate cut at the January Federal Open Market Committee meeting, down from 23% in November, indicating that rate relief may take time to materialize. Last week, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan also said Bitcoin is likely to deliver steady gains over the next decade, but investors should not expect the kind of explosive year-on-year rallies seen in earlier cycles. Hougan described Bitcoin’s outlook as a prolonged upward trend marked by lower volatility and more measured returns. “I think we’re in a 10-year grind upward of strong returns,” he said. “It’s not spectacular returns, [but] strong returns, lower volatility, some up and down.” Bitcoin Seen Entering Accumulation Phase in Early 2026 Meanwhile, analyst Linh Tran believes Bitcoin entered a corrective phase in late 2025 after peaking near $126,000 and falling roughly 35% to around $80,000. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, she said this pullback reflects a structural shift in the market, with Bitcoin now driven less by retail speculation and more by macroeconomic conditions, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. As a result, the outlook for Q1 2026 depends more on fundamentals than cyclical hype. High interest rates remain a key constraint. With U.S. rates still in the 3.5%–3.75% range and expectations for easing pushed into the second half of 2026, liquidity conditions are unlikely to support a strong rally in early 2026. “When liquidity conditions have not yet improved materially, Bitcoin is unlikely to enter a strong growth phase driven purely by macro factors. Instead, the current monetary environment may keep the cryptocurrency trading in a cautious and stable manner,” Tran said. While spot Bitcoin ETFs hold more than $110 billion in assets, flows have become uneven, suggesting institutions are reallocating selectively rather than aggressively increasing exposure.

Bitlight is leading the gainers with a surge of more than 120%, while Collect on Fanable and Everlyn have also posted strong double-digit gains. On the downside, Lighter is the biggest loser among trending tokens, dropping more than 8% on the day. Meanwhile, several of the crypto industry’s most prominent figures saw their personal fortunes shrink sharply in 2025, as a violent market reversal in October wiped out gains accumulated earlier in the year. Several prominent crypto figures saw their personal fortunes shrink sharply in 2025, as a violent market reversal in October wiped out gains. #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/DwSrRA8Cfj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 1, 2026 Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, lost $2.6 billion over the past 12 months, reducing his net worth to $3.8 billion. Fed Liquidity and Lower Rates Could Support Bitcoin Gains in 2026 Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing U.S. monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into markets, according to Abra CEO Bill Barhydt. He said early signs of renewed Federal Reserve bond buying and falling interest rates, which he described as “quantitative easing light,” are typically supportive for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Beyond liquidity, Barhydt pointed to clearer U.S. regulation and growing institutional participation as longer-term tailwinds. However, near-term expectations remain cautious, with CME data showing limited confidence in an early 2026 rate cut, suggesting that supportive conditions may take time to fully materialize. Analysts broadly expect gains to be steadier rather than explosive. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan sees a long-term upward grind with lower volatility, while analyst Linh Tran said Bitcoin’s recent pullback reflects a shift toward fundamentals, macro conditions, and institutional flows. With rates still high and ETF inflows uneven, Bitcoin may remain in an accumulation phase early in 2026 rather than entering a sharp rally. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $87,789, showing a modest daily gain after stabilising toward the end of December. The chart shows that BTC previously fell sharply from October highs near $126,000 before finding support in the $85,000–$88,000 range, where price action has since compressed into a tighter band. Over the past several weeks, Bitcoin has largely moved sideways, suggesting a consolidation phase following the steep correction. If downside pressure returns, a break below the $85,000 area could expose BTC to further losses toward the $81,000–$80,000 zone, which stands out as the next major support. On the upside, a sustained move above $92,000 would be an early signal of renewed momentum, potentially opening the door toward $98,000 and higher resistance levels near $103,000. Ethereum is currently changing hands around $2,984, slightly outperforming Bitcoin on the day. The chart shows ETH declining steadily from September highs above $4,600 before forming a base near the $2,800–$2,900 region. Recent price action suggests ETH is attempting to stabilise after repeated tests of this support zone. In the near term, holding above $2,900 keeps Ethereum in a neutral-to-stable posture. A close above the $3,100–$3,200 range could signal a recovery phase, with potential upside targets near $3,400 and $3,600. Conversely, a drop below $2,800 would weaken the structure and could push ETH toward the next support around $2,600, where buyers previously stepped in during November’s sell-off. Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment remains cautious as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 31, keeping the market firmly in the fear zone. The reading shows little change from recent sessions, signaling continued uncertainty among investors, with traders largely waiting for clearer macroeconomic or policy signals before taking on additional risk. U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs closed the final trading day of 2025 in the red, with data showing net outflows of $348.1 million on Dec. 31, according to SoSoValue. The decline came despite the market remaining active, with total daily trading volume reaching $2.83 billion. Outflows were led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $99.05 million leave the fund, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $46.58 million in net outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC also continued to bleed assets, recording $69.09 million in outflows, while Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB posted $76.53 million in net redemptions. Despite the daily pullback, cumulative net inflows across U.S. BTC spot ETFs remain strong at $56.61 billion. Total net assets across the products stand at $113.29 billion, representing about 6.47% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs also ended the year under pressure, posting net outflows of $72.06 million on Dec. 31. Trading activity remained moderate, with $808.1 million in total value traded during the session. BlackRock’s ETHA led the outflows, seeing $21.51 million leave the fund, while Grayscale’s ETH product recorded $31.98 million in net redemptions. Fidelity’s FETH also posted smaller outflows of $2.22 million, reflecting broad-based caution across issuers. Cumulative net inflows into US ETH spot ETFs remain positive at $12.33 billion. Total net assets stand at $17.95 billion, accounting for roughly 5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, a U.S. federal judge threw out a crypto investor lawsuit against Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks, ending a case that tried to pin Voyager Digital’s collapse on celebrity-style promotion and team marketing.

Notably, the XRP fund differs from the spot XRP funds and will only seek to provide investors with income from the altcoin rather than provide spot exposure. Roundhill Files Form N-1A For XRP ETF Roundhill filed a post-effective amendment for its XRP Covered Call Strategy ETF, noting that the filing was intended to delay the fund’s effectiveness until January 29. In line with this, the fund could launch this month, unless another amendment delays its effectiveness. The potential launch of Roundhill’s XRP ETF could provide a major boost for the altcoin, as the fund offers another avenue for institutional investors to gain exposure to the token. Roundhill’s XRP fund differs from the spot XRP ETFs , as it doesn’t provide spot exposure to the altcoin. Instead, it seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price return of one or more ETFs that provide exposure to XRP and whose shares trade on a U.S.-regulated exchange. Basically, the fund tracks the performance of other XRP ETFs that provide direct exposure to the altcoin and doesn’t invest directly in the altcoin. Roundhill’s XRP ETF prospectus also revealed that the Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives through the use of a synthetic covered call strategy that provides current income. In tracking the price return of other XRP ETFs, the Fund isn’t just limited to spot XRP funds. It can also track the price return of ETFs that derive exposure to XRP through investments in exchange-traded futures contracts that utilize XRP as the reference asset. What The Filing Confirms For The Altcoin In an X post , crypto pundit Richard stated that Roundhill’s XRP ETF filing confirms that XRP is an approved underlying asset for regulated derivatives. He further remarked that this means that XRP-linked options are permissible inside an ETF wrapper and that risk committees, counterparties, and clearing structures are already signed off on. Richard also noted that covered-call ETFs don’t appear first and only come into play after an asset is legally and structurally accepted. Meanwhile, the pundit alluded to the fact that the sole purpose of the latest filing was to delay the effectiveness. He explained that this means that the product structure is complete, that approval is not the issue, and that timing is the variable. The pundit further stated that Roundhill isn’t trying to capture upside but is simply monetizing XRP’s volatility. As such, they have a different objective from the spot XRP ETFs, although the same asset and pipeline are involved for this Fund. Richard added that this is derivatives validation, not price discovery, a development he claimed occurs only when an asset is institutionally cleared. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.84, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Altcoin|Coinmarketcap|ripple|Roundhill|Spot XRP ETF|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-01 23:30:53

Backing a bullish Solana price prediction , a group of deep-pocketed wallets has quietly accumulated over $15.9 million worth of Solana-based DeFi tokens, even as prices continue to slide. Whales/institutions have been accumulating #Solana #DeFi tokens recently. Over the past 2 days, three wallets withdrew $15.9M worth of #DeFi tokens from exchanges, including: 7.39B $PUMP ($13.77M) 8.02M $CLOUD ($621K) 9.06M $KMNO ($539K) 1.33M $JTO ($521K) 3.05M $DRIFT ($479K)… pic.twitter.com/aOCl6CBkiw — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 31, 2025 According to Lookonchain , three wallets have been buying into five Solana ecosystem tokens: $PUMP, $CLOUD, $KMNO, $JTO , and $DRFT . These projects were among the hardest hit during the recent bear market, yet this coordinated move from institutional-level wallets suggests growing confidence that the bottom may already be in. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) has gained 2.8% in the past week and continues to consolidate just above the $120 level. The upcoming Alpenglow upgrade , expected in Q1 2026, is another reason traders are paying attention. With the potential to bring transaction speeds to near internet-level performance, whales may already be positioning for Solana’s next breakout. Solana Price Prediction: SOL is About to Reverse Its Downtrend – Can It Climb Back to $200? The daily chart shows that SOL has formed a falling wedge in the past weeks. The price encountered strong support at around $119 and is now retesting a structural resistance at $125. Source: TradingView If SOL rises above this mark, this could confirm the end of its downtrend as it would invalidate the token’s bearish price structure. Falling wedges are often seen as bullish trend reversal patterns, showing that buyers are quietly stepping in as the price gets squeezed tighter. These setups often lead to strong breakouts, and if Solana follows that path, it could push to $145 first, then possibly to $168 in the short term. With whales continuing to buy and momentum starting to shift, a full recovery might not be far off. While Solana meme coins have taken a back seat this cycle, one new presale is catching serious attention. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised over $4 million by bringing back the same kind of hype that helped Dogecoin shoot up 1000x in its early days.

However, one popular crypto trader just shared a bullish Dogecoin price prediction that sees the token bouncing strongly off a key area of support. Matt Hughes, a trader whose X account is followed by more than 47,000 users, recently shared an interesting chart where he identified a high-reward/low-risk setup within Dogecoin’s weekly chart. Risk/reward in the .11-.12 zone for $DOGE is incredible here.

Back in November 2024, the token rallied above $0.45 after hitting this support area as well. By setting up a stop loss order below $0.11 while establishing an ambitious target at around $0.45, this gives traders a 4.5:1 risk-reward ratio if DOGE starts to recover as the year begins. Historical patterns indicate that January has been a strong month for altcoins in previous years, meaning that meme coins could be getting ready to make a strong comeback. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE’s Volumes Rise as It Bounces Off $0.11 The daily DOGE chart shows that the selling pressure has been easing lately after DOGE declined below the $0.12 area. Source: TradingView.com The token has surged by 2.8% during today’s session, while trading volumes have gone up by 79% after briefly dropping below this key support. These volumes account for 6% of the asset’s circulating market cap, indicating that buying pressure is rapidly rising. Is DOGE about to make a big move? A move above $0.14 would confirm a bullish outlook for the top meme coin as it would invalidate its bearish price structure. This could set the stage for an explosive jump to $0.18 first, the 200-day EMA, and then to $0.27 in the near term. As meme coins show signs of a comeback, a new presale is gaining traction fast. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has already raised millions for its mine-to-earn platform, where anyone can start mining meme coins without needing any hardware. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Lets Anyone Mine Meme Coins with Zero Hardware Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is establishing a new paradigm by launching a fun game through which players can mine meme coins without needing to invest thousands of dollars in expensive equipment. The game allows you to set up a virtual server and fire up as many rigs as you want by simply buying $PEPENODE. Top miners on Pepenode will be eligible for airdrops of viral tokens like Pepe ($PEPE) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) , turning virtual mining into real meme coin rewards. To keep the ecosystem balanced, the project will burn up to 70% of all $PEPENODE used on upgrades, creating constant deflation and stronger token scarcity over time. With the game picking up steam and going viral across meme circles, demand for $PEPENODE is expected to skyrocket. The presale closes in just 6 days, so there’s still time to get in early before the mining starts. To join, visit the official Pepenode website and connect your wallet, such as Best Wallet .

While recent monthly price action has remained muted, a crypto analyst maintains that the meme coin’s broader technical trend has not been compromised. The analyst has projected that DOGE could eventually rally toward a long-term move beyond the $10 level. Dogecoin Bullish Structure Points Toward $10 On December 31, crypto market expert Olivier D Maximus posted on X that Dogecoin remains structurally bullish and could eventually cross $10. He noted that although price action has been slow and unimpressive, DOGE’s bullish framework continues to favor higher valuations in the long term. Related Reading: 7-Period Fractal Trend Says Dogecoin Price Is Headed To $10 He shared a new detailed chart analysis, indicating that DOGE’s monthly close generated little short-term excitement. However, he emphasized that the broader bullish framework remains intact, with attention now turning to what January may bring as the next decisive phase. Maximus pointed out that long-term structures often move quietly before big gains, and Dogecoin appears to be following this pattern. He stressed that patience is required when analyzing higher time frames, as monthly charts tend to capture macro trends rather than immediate volatility. In his view, the current consolidation does not invalidate Dogecoin’s upside thesis. The analyst’s chart showed Dogecoin trading within a clearly defined Ascending Channel that has held for several years. The meme coin’s price remains above the long-term rising support zone, reflecting higher lows over time. Additionally, multiple diagonal trend lines show that DOGE’s price has repeatedly corrected toward mid-channel support before resuming upward movement. These pullbacks appear controlled, reinforcing the possibility of a healthy long-term uptrend. Maximus has also spotlighted several ATH levels he expects Dogecoin to reach over time. The ascending channel seen on the chart points toward potential targets above $12, extending as high as $25. Moreover, the analyst has suggested that if Dogecoin maintains its structural integrity, future trends could push the meme coin into double-digit territory, making a surge from under $1 to $10 technically plausible. DOGE Enters Make Or Break Zone In 2026 In a separate X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price is currently trading within a Descending Triangle, with the price sitting at the tip of the pattern around $0.122. This level has been highlighted as a potential make-or-break point where a pullback or surge could determine Dogecoin’s next big move. Related Reading: What The Rise In Open Interest Means For The Dogecoin Price If price breaks above the upper boundary of the Descending Triangle, Trader Tardigrade predicts that Dogecoin could experience a breakout to the upside. He has set a target of around $0.132, representing a surge of approximately 8.2% from the current price level. On the other hand, if DOGE breaks below the lower boundary of the triangle, the meme coin could tumble further toward $0.116, representing a roughly 4.9% crash.

Bitcoin Apparent Demand Has Been Declining Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno has talked about Bitcoin cycles from a different lens. “Most are focusing on price performance to define a cycle, when it is demand what they should be looking to,” noted Moreno. Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case The analyst has gauged the “demand” for the cryptocurrency using the Apparent Demand indicator, which compares the daily miner issuance against the changes in the 1-year dormant supply. The first of these, the miner issuance, is the amount that miners are “minting” on the network every day by receiving block rewards. This metric essentially reflects the “production” of the asset. The 1-year inactive supply, on the other hand, can be thought of as the cryptocurrency’s “inventory.” Thus, the Apparent Demand basically compares the production of Bitcoin against changes taking place in its inventory. Below is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trends in the 30-day and 1-year versions of the Apparent Demand over the past decade. As is visible in the graph, the last few Bitcoin cycles have all transitioned into a bear market when the Apparent Demand has plunged into the negative region on both the monthly and yearly timeframes. In the current cycle, the 30-day Apparent Demand has plunged into the red zone recently, suggesting that the monthly demand for the asset has been negative. On the annual scale, the metric is still at a positive level, but its value has been following a downtrend. If this decline keeps up, it won’t be long before the indicator has dipped into the negative territory. Considering the pattern from the previous cycles, the current structure in the Apparent Demand is certainly looking bearish. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the yearly version of the metric will cross into the red zone or if it will rebound, signaling the return of demand. Spot demand isn’t the only way to measure Bitcoin demand these days. With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there has been some fresh off-chain demand coming into the cryptocurrency this cycle.

This strategic pivot, first reported by the Financial Times in late 2024, represents a direct challenge to the global sanctions regime. Consequently, nations and regulators worldwide are now grappling with the implications of digital currencies financing international arms transfers. Iran Cryptocurrency Weapons Strategy Unveiled The Defense Export Center (Mindex), operating under Iran’s Ministry of Defense, publicly announced its new payment framework. The agency explicitly stated its readiness to negotiate contracts for military equipment using digital currencies. This equipment notably includes armed drones, ballistic missiles, and naval vessels. Additionally, Mindex will accept barter arrangements and the Iranian rial. This announcement marks one of the first instances where a sovereign state has openly declared cryptocurrency as a payment method for strategic defense exports. Therefore, it sets a significant precedent in global finance and security. The Core Motivation: Bypassing Financial Sanctions For over a decade, Iran has operated under extensive Western sanctions, primarily from the United States and the European Union. These sanctions have severely restricted its access to the global financial system, specifically the SWIFT network. Traditional banking channels for multi-million dollar defense deals have been effectively closed. Cryptocurrency, with its decentralized nature and potential for pseudonymous transactions, presents a viable alternative. Analysts from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) confirm that digital assets offer a mechanism to circumvent traditional oversight. This development directly threatens the efficacy of long-standing economic pressure campaigns. Technical and Logistical Execution of Crypto Arms Deals Executing multi-million dollar weapons transactions via cryptocurrency involves complex logistical steps. First, the parties must agree on a valuation, typically pegged to a stablecoin like Tether (USDT) or to Bitcoin, to avoid volatility. Second, they must establish secure digital wallets, potentially using privacy-focused coins or mixers to obscure transaction trails. The decentralized nature of blockchain makes interdiction by sanctioning bodies exceptionally difficult, though not impossible. Chainalysis, a leading blockchain analysis firm, notes that while transactions are public, layering techniques can complicate tracking. The following table outlines the potential advantages for Iran in this model: Advantage Explanation Financial Access Restores access to a global pool of capital outside controlled banks. Transaction Speed Enables faster settlement compared to traditional, scrutinized wire transfers. Reduced Traceability Blockchain analysis can be countered with advanced obfuscation tools. Operational Deniability Provides a layer of plausible deniability for counterparties. Historical Context and Precedents Iran’s foray into cryptocurrency is not entirely new. The government has been exploring digital assets for several years to mitigate sanctions pressure. In 2022, Iran executed its first official import order using cryptocurrency, worth $10 million. Furthermore, the country has been actively developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). However, applying this technology to the defense sector represents a severe escalation. Previously, non-state actors and ransomware groups have used crypto for illicit financing. Now, a nation-state is adopting similar tactics for geopolitical leverage, blurring the lines between cybercrime and statecraft. Global Reactions and Regulatory Implications The international response has been one of deep concern. Officials from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have reiterated that sanctions compliance extends to the cryptocurrency space. They have previously sanctioned cryptocurrency addresses linked to Iranian ransomware operations. Meanwhile, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money-laundering watchdog, is likely to intensify its scrutiny of virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that could facilitate such trades. Key implications include: Tighter VASP Regulations: Exchanges may face stricter Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules for large transactions. Enhanced Blockchain Surveillance: Governments will likely invest more in forensic blockchain analysis tools. Diplomatic Pressure: Nations may push for international treaties governing crypto use in defense. Expert Analysis on Market and Security Impact Dr. Sarah Miller, a sanctions expert at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center, provides critical insight. “This move is less about the immediate volume of sales,” she explains, “and more about testing the resilience of the sanctions architecture. It signals to other sanctioned states like North Korea and Venezuela that a potential blueprint exists.” From a market perspective, large, opaque transactions could introduce volatility and reputational risk into the crypto ecosystem. Moreover, it forces a reckoning within the crypto industry about its role in global security versus financial innovation. The Future of Sanctions in a Digital Age Iran’s action fundamentally questions the future of economic statecraft. Traditional sanctions rely on controlling choke points in the centralized financial system. Cryptocurrency deliberately decentralizes those points. Going forward, sanctioning bodies must adapt their tools. Potential countermeasures could involve: Issuing sanctions directly against specific blockchain protocols or smart contracts. Mandating that miners and validators screen transactions against blacklisted addresses. Creating “whitelisted” digital asset networks for compliant institutions only. This arms race between financial privacy and regulatory oversight is now entering a profoundly consequential phase with direct implications for global stability. Conclusion Iran’s decision to accept cryptocurrency for military weapon sales marks a dangerous and innovative escalation in sanctions evasion. This strategy leverages the inherent features of digital assets—pseudonymity and decentralization—to finance the export of drones, missiles, and warships. While the immediate financial impact may be limited, the precedent is profound. It challenges the core mechanisms of international financial enforcement and signals a new frontier in geopolitical conflict. Consequently, the global community must urgently develop coherent and effective regulatory responses to ensure that cryptocurrency does not become the default tool for undermining international security frameworks. FAQs Q1: What specific military equipment is Iran selling for cryptocurrency? According to the Financial Times report, Iran’s Defense Export Center (Mindex) is offering advanced military hardware including unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), missiles, and naval assets like warships for sale, with cryptocurrency listed as an accepted payment method. Q2: Why is Iran using cryptocurrency for these sales? The primary motivation is to bypass stringent Western financial sanctions. Traditional international banking channels like SWIFT are blocked for Iranian entities. Cryptocurrency provides an alternative, decentralized payment rail that is harder for sanctioning governments to monitor and interdict. Q3: Is this legal under international law? While using cryptocurrency itself is not illegal, the sale of military equipment by Iran likely violates United Nations arms embargoes and specific national sanctions laws (e.g., from the U.S. and EU). Any entity engaging in such a transaction could face severe secondary sanctions from those jurisdictions. Q4: How can cryptocurrency transactions for weapons be tracked? Most cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on public blockchains. Specialized firms like Chainalysis use blockchain analysis to cluster addresses and identify patterns. However, sophisticated actors can use privacy coins, mixers, and chain-hopping techniques to obscure the trail, making full tracking challenging. Q5: What does this mean for the future of global sanctions? This move represents a significant test of the sanctions regime. It indicates that decentralized digital currencies could erode the effectiveness of traditional financial sanctions. In response, governments will likely push for stricter regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges and greater investment in blockchain surveillance technology to maintain enforcement capabilities.

This measurable change, reported on April 9, 2025, by data provider Alternative, signals a potential inflection point for digital asset traders worldwide who closely watch this barometer for clues about market bottoms and prevailing emotional trends. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s Rise to 28 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial quantitative gauge for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Operating on a scale from 0 to 100, it translates complex market data into a simple sentiment score. A reading of 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ often associated with panic selling and potential buying opportunities, while 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed,’ which can signal market tops and excessive speculation. The recent jump from 20 to 28 represents a significant 40% increase in the score, marking the most substantial single-day gain in several weeks. This movement away from the extreme fear threshold (typically below 25) suggests a moderation in panic, though the market remains firmly in negative sentiment territory. Historically, sustained periods in the ‘Fear’ zone (25-49) have preceded consolidations and gradual recoveries, making the current level a critical one for analysts to watch. The Multifactor Engine Behind the Sentiment Score Unlike a simple poll, the index employs a sophisticated, weighted model that aggregates data from six distinct sources to minimize bias. This methodology ensures the score reflects actual market behavior and organic interest rather than mere opinion. The calculation breaks down as follows: Volatility (25%): This component analyzes the magnitude of recent price swings, particularly for Bitcoin. High volatility often correlates with fear, while low volatility can indicate complacency or greed. Market Volume & Momentum (25%): The model assesses trading volume and current price momentum across major spot markets. Unusually high volume during downturns can amplify fear readings. Social Media (15%): Data miners scan platforms like Twitter and Reddit for the volume and sentiment of cryptocurrency mentions. A surge in negative commentary weighs the index down. Surveys (15%): Periodic polls of the retail and professional investor community provide a direct sentiment check, though this is the most subjective input. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap is a key metric. Rising dominance often signals a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful periods, as investors abandon altcoins for Bitcoin. Trends & Search Volume (10%): Google Trends data for core cryptocurrency search terms indicates retail interest. Spiking searches for ‘Bitcoin crash’ directly contribute to fear. The eight-point gain likely stemmed from improvements across several metrics, potentially including reduced volatility, a stabilization in trading volume, and a slight uptick in positive social media discourse following recent regulatory clarifications in key jurisdictions. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis To understand the significance of a ’28’ reading, one must examine historical patterns. The index famously plunged to a record low of ‘6’ during the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020, a moment that preceded a historic bull run. Conversely, it reached ’95’ during the peak euphoria of November 2021, just before a major market correction. The table below illustrates key sentiment levels and their typical market implications: Index Range Sentiment Label Typical Market Phase Investor Behavior 0-24 Extreme Fear Capitulation / Potential Bottom Panic selling, high stress 25-49 Fear Bear Market / Accumulation Cautious, selective buying 50-74 Greed Bull Market / Growth FOMO, increasing leverage 75-100 Extreme Greed Market Top / Bubble Irrational exuberance Currently, the index resides in the lower ‘Fear’ bracket. Market technicians often view a climb out of ‘Extreme Fear’ as a necessary first step for any sustainable recovery, as it indicates the most intense selling pressure may be exhausting itself. However, veteran analysts consistently warn that the index is a contrarian indicator; extreme readings often signal a coming reversal. Therefore, a rise from ‘Extreme Fear’ is watched closely but not interpreted as an immediate all-clear signal. Broader Market Impacts and On-Chain Correlations The shift in the Fear & Greed Index rarely occurs in a vacuum. It frequently correlates with observable on-chain data from blockchain analytics firms. For instance, a move out of extreme fear often coincides with a decrease in the volume of Bitcoin moving to exchange wallets (a sign of reduced intent to sell) and an increase in the number of ‘accumulation addresses’ (wallets with only incoming transactions). Furthermore, the options market shows changing dynamics; the put/call ratio for Bitcoin options may decline as the fear index rises, indicating reduced demand for downside protection. This sentiment shift also impacts altcoins. Typically, when fear recedes slightly, capital begins to rotate tentatively from Bitcoin into major large-cap altcoins, which often exhibit higher beta (volatility) relative to Bitcoin’s movements. The recent index change may therefore presage a period of reduced correlation across crypto assets, allowing fundamental projects to differentiate themselves. The Regulatory and Macroeconomic Backdrop Market sentiment does not evolve independently of the global financial landscape. The index’s recent improvement occurs against a complex backdrop of evolving central bank policies, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory advancements for digital assets. Clearer guidance from legislative bodies in the United States and Europe regarding cryptocurrency custody and classification can directly reduce market uncertainty, a key driver of fear. Similarly, macroeconomic factors like inflation data and interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve heavily influence risk asset appetite, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts note that a stabilizing macro environment often provides the foundation for sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index to recover, as it reduces a major source of systemic risk for the asset class. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to 28 marks a meaningful, though preliminary, shift in cryptocurrency market psychology. This transition from ‘extreme fear’ to ‘fear’ reflects a measurable cooling of panic across multiple data-driven dimensions, including volatility, social sentiment, and market momentum. While firmly indicating that investor caution still dominates, the move suggests the market may be entering a phase of accumulation and consolidation after a prolonged period of distress. For investors, this index level serves as a critical data point, emphasizing the importance of disciplined, long-term strategy over emotional reaction. As always, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a valuable snapshot of the market’s emotional temperature, reminding participants that the collective mood swings between fear and greed are a permanent feature of the financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 28 mean? A1: A score of 28 places market sentiment in the ‘Fear’ zone (25-49). It indicates that negative emotions like anxiety and caution are dominant among investors, but the intense panic associated with ‘Extreme Fear’ (below 25) has subsided. This level often corresponds with periods of price stabilization and potential accumulation by long-term investors. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A2: The index is updated daily, typically once per 24-hour period. The data provider, Alternative, aggregates the latest metrics for volatility, volume, social media, surveys, dominance, and search trends to calculate a new score each day, reflecting the most recent shifts in market sentiment. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? A3: The index is best used as a contrarian sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. Historically, ‘Extreme Fear’ levels have often coincided with market bottoms and buying opportunities, while ‘Extreme Greed’ has signaled potential tops. However, it should never be used in isolation and must be combined with fundamental and technical analysis for informed decision-making. Q4: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? A4: While Bitcoin’s price, volatility, and dominance are heavily weighted inputs, the index aims to measure sentiment for the broader cryptocurrency market. Factors like social media mentions and surveys encompass major altcoins. Bitcoin’s outsized influence on the overall market means its performance significantly drives the final score. Q5: Has the index ever been wrong? A5: As a sentiment indicator, it reflects current emotions, not future price predictions. It can remain in ‘Extreme Fear’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ for extended periods during prolonged bear or bull markets. Its primary value lies in identifying emotional extremes that have, in the past, preceded market reversals, but timing those reversals based solely on the index is highly unreliable.

According to definitive data from the leading crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, this significant expiry event will occur at 08:00 UTC, potentially creating substantial volatility and influencing short-term price trajectories for the world’s premier digital asset. Simultaneously, Ethereum options worth $390 million will reach their expiry, compounding the market’s focus on derivatives activity. This confluence of events represents one of the first major financial tests for digital assets in the new year, drawing intense scrutiny from institutional traders and retail investors alike. Decoding the $1.85 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry The sheer scale of today’s Bitcoin options expiry demands a thorough examination of its core mechanics. The notional value, representing the total worth of the underlying Bitcoin tied to these contracts, underscores the growing institutional footprint in crypto derivatives. Crucially, the put/call ratio for this batch sits at 0.48. This key metric, calculated by dividing put option volume by call option volume, indicates a market sentiment leaning bullish. Specifically, a ratio below 1.0 suggests traders have opened more call options (bets on price increases) than put options (bets on decreases). Consequently, this skew can influence market maker hedging behavior in the hours surrounding expiry. Furthermore, analysts immediately highlight the max pain price of $88,000. This theoretical price point is where the largest number of these Bitcoin options contracts would expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option buyers and maximum gain for option sellers. Market makers, who often hedge their positions, may engage in trading activity to pin the spot price near this level as expiry approaches. However, it is vital to understand that max pain is a snapshot, not a deterministic force. External market factors, including macroeconomic news or substantial spot market flows, can easily override its influence. Asset Notional Expiry Value Put/Call Ratio Max Pain Price Bitcoin (BTC) $1.85 Billion 0.48 $88,000 Ethereum (ETH) $390 Million 0.62 $2,950 Ethereum’s Substantial $390 Million Companion Expiry While Bitcoin commands the headline, the concurrent expiry of $390 million in Ethereum options adds a critical layer of complexity to the market event. Ethereum’s put/call ratio of 0.62, while still below 1.0, is notably higher than Bitcoin’s. This suggests a slightly more cautious or hedged sentiment among Ethereum options traders. The max pain price for ETH is set at $2,950, providing a clear focal point for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The interaction between Bitcoin and Ethereum volatility during this period is a key watchpoint for analysts. Historically, large expiries can lead to correlated price movements, but divergences often occur based on asset-specific narratives and liquidity profiles. Deribit continues to dominate the crypto options landscape, consistently processing over 85% of global volume. The exchange’s data is therefore considered the authoritative source for such expiry events. The reliability of this data allows traders to make informed decisions. Additionally, the structure of these options—primarily European-style, which can only be exercised at expiry—reduces the risk of early assignment and concentrates the market impact around the settlement time. Historical Context and Market Impact Analysis To fully grasp the potential outcomes, one must consider historical precedents. Large quarterly and monthly options expiries have become regular features of the crypto market cycle. Past events have demonstrated a range of effects: Volatility Suppression: Sometimes, the dominant force is gamma hedging by market makers. If they are short gamma near expiry, they may buy or sell spot assets to remain delta-neutral, potentially damping volatility. Pin Risk to Max Pain: On other occasions, especially in lower-liquidity environments, the spot price exhibits a “pinning” effect, gravitating toward the max pain price as expiry nears. Post-Expiry Breakouts: Often, the most significant price movement occurs *after* the expiry settles. The removal of large hedging overhead can unleash pent-up momentum, leading to decisive breaks above or below key technical levels. The current macroeconomic backdrop, including interest rate expectations and traditional equity market performance, will also play a decisive role in how spot prices absorb the expiry’s mechanical effects. Traders monitor the options open interest term structure to gauge where future pressure points may lie. Expert Insights on Derivatives Market Maturity The consistent growth in notional expiry values, from hundreds of millions to multiple billions, signals the profound maturation of cryptocurrency derivatives markets. This growth reflects increased participation from regulated entities, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. These players use options not purely for speculation, but for sophisticated strategies like portfolio insurance, yield enhancement, and directional hedging. The depth of this market now provides valuable sentiment indicators. For instance, the skew of options prices across different strike prices can reveal where professional traders see support and resistance levels. Moreover, the evolution of products like volatility derivatives and the increasing correlation between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) metrics mean that events like today’s expiry are no longer isolated. They are integrated into global risk-on/risk-off calculus. Analysts from major financial institutions now routinely publish research on crypto options flows, treating them with a analytical framework similar to that used for equities or commodities. Conclusion The expiry of $1.85 billion in Bitcoin options and $390 million in Ethereum options today represents a significant, data-rich event for cryptocurrency markets. While the max pain prices of $88,000 for BTC and $2,950 for ETH provide focal points, market participants should view them as one of many factors in a complex ecosystem. The bullish-leaning put/call ratios, particularly for Bitcoin, offer a snapshot of prevailing sentiment heading into the new year. Ultimately, the true impact will be determined by the interplay of derivatives mechanics, spot market liquidity, and broader financial conditions. This Bitcoin options expiry underscores the crypto market’s continued financialization and its growing interconnectedness with global capital flows, making such events essential reading for any serious market observer. FAQs Q1: What does a “put/call ratio” of 0.48 mean for Bitcoin? A1: A put/call ratio of 0.48 means there are roughly twice as many call options (bullish bets) as put options (bearish bets) set to expire. This typically indicates a bullish sentiment among the options traders for this expiry cycle. Q2: What is “max pain price” and does it guarantee the price will go there? A2: Max pain price is the strike price at which the total financial loss for all options buyers is maximized (and gain for sellers is maximized). It is a theoretical calculation, not a guarantee. While market maker hedging can sometimes influence price toward it, spot market forces often prevail. Q3: How does a large options expiry actually affect Bitcoin’s spot price? A3: The effect is primarily indirect via market maker hedging. To manage their risk (delta/gamma), market makers buy or sell Bitcoin in the spot market. This activity can create support, resistance, or volatility suppression in the hours before expiry, with potential for a release of momentum afterward. Q4: Why is Deribit’s data so important for these events? A4: Deribit is the world’s largest cryptocurrency options exchange by volume, consistently handling over 85% of global trading. Its data on open interest, put/call ratios, and max pain is therefore considered the most comprehensive and authoritative benchmark for the market. Q5: Are Ethereum options expiries as significant as Bitcoin’s? A5: While smaller in notional value, a $390 million Ethereum expiry is still highly significant. It can drive volatility for ETH and, given the correlation between assets, can influence the broader altcoin market. The different put/call ratio (0.62 for ETH vs. 0.48 for BTC) also provides a nuanced view of relative sentiment between the two major assets.

This figure, far from the threshold signaling a broad altcoin rally, provides a data-driven snapshot of a market still firmly under Bitcoin’s influence. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing historical patterns and on-chain metrics to understand the potential trajectory for alternative cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: A Market Barometer The Altcoin Season Index serves as a quantitative pulse check for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Specifically, CoinMarketCap’s algorithm analyzes the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, deliberately excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. It then meticulously compares each asset’s gains or losses against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The resulting score is a clear percentage: the proportion of these top altcoins that have outperformed the pioneer cryptocurrency. Therefore, a score of 75 or above formally declares an “altcoin season,” a period where investor capital rotates aggressively into smaller, riskier assets. Conversely, a score like the current 21 underscores a “Bitcoin season,” where capital preservation and focus on the market leader prevail. The Mechanics Behind the Metric Understanding the index requires a grasp of its construction. The 90-day window smooths out short-term volatility and captures medium-term trends, offering a more stable view than weekly or monthly comparisons. By focusing on the top 100 assets by market capitalization, the index prioritizes projects with significant liquidity and investor interest, avoiding noise from micro-cap tokens. The exclusion of stablecoins, which are designed to maintain parity with fiat, and wrapped tokens, which represent other assets on a different blockchain, ensures the metric purely measures speculative performance against Bitcoin. This methodological rigor makes the index a trusted tool for both retail and institutional analysts tracking market cycle phases. Historical Context and the Current Crypto Climate The index’s current reading of 21 is not an anomaly but fits within observable crypto market cycles. Historically, prolonged Bitcoin seasons often precede explosive altcoin rallies. For instance, the bull run of late 2020 saw the index languish in Bitcoin-dominant territory before catapulting above 75 for an extended period in early 2021. Presently, several macroeconomic and sector-specific factors contribute to the subdued index reading. Firstly, institutional adoption continues to favor Bitcoin through spot ETF products and corporate treasuries. Secondly, regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions often arrives first for Bitcoin, creating a “safe-haven” effect within the volatile crypto space. Finally, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in April 2024 historically catalyzes a market-wide focus on its supply dynamics, often sidelining altcoins in the immediate aftermath. Key factors influencing the current low Altcoin Season Index: Institutional Capital Inflows: Major investment vehicles are predominantly Bitcoin-centric. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of economic stress, investors often flock to perceived stores of value. Network Activity: Bitcoin’s hash rate and security budget remain at all-time highs, reinforcing its foundational status. Developer Activity: While vibrant in ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana, capital has been slow to follow innovation recently. Expert Analysis and Market Impact Market strategists interpret the index through different lenses. Some view a low reading as a consolidation phase, where altcoins build fundamental strength before their next leg up. Others see it as a warning sign of reduced risk appetite among crypto investors. The direct impact is observable in trading volumes and capital rotation. Exchange data shows a higher ratio of Bitcoin-to-stablecoin trading pairs compared to altcoin pairs. Furthermore, funding rates in altcoin perpetual futures markets are generally neutral or negative, indicating a lack of aggressive bullish leverage. This environment, however, can create opportunities for disciplined investors to accumulate fundamentally strong altcoins at relatively depressed valuations compared to Bitcoin, a strategy often called “altcoin accumulation.” The Road Ahead: Signals to Watch A sustained rise in the Altcoin Season Index toward the 75 threshold would likely require a confluence of events. Bitcoin achieving a new all-time high and stabilizing is frequently a precursor, as it boosts overall market confidence. Subsequently, narratives around decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), non-fungible token (NFT) volume resurgence, or breakthroughs in blockchain scalability could trigger rotational moves. On-chain metrics like the Bitcoin Dominance chart and the supply of altcoins on exchanges versus in long-term storage provide complementary data. Ultimately, the index is a lagging indicator, confirming a trend already in motion. Savvy observers monitor social sentiment, developer commits, and protocol revenue to anticipate shifts before they appear in the 90-day performance data. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index, standing firmly at 21, delivers an unambiguous message about the present state of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin retains its dominant position, with the majority of major alternative cryptocurrencies failing to outpace its performance over the last quarter. This phase, while potentially frustrating for altcoin enthusiasts, is a well-documented chapter in the volatile history of digital assets. It emphasizes the importance of understanding market cycles, employing robust risk management, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price action. As the market evolves, this index will remain a crucial tool for gauging when investor psychology and capital flows might pivot, heralding the next potential altcoin season. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index of 21 mean? An index score of 21 means that only 21% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This indicates a strong “Bitcoin season” where the pioneer cryptocurrency is leading the market. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates it by comparing the 90-day price performance of each of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The percentage of altcoins that outperform Bitcoin becomes the index score. Q3: Why are stablecoins and wrapped tokens excluded from the index? Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies and designed not to fluctuate, while wrapped tokens represent another asset (like Bitcoin on Ethereum). Excluding them ensures the index measures pure, speculative performance of alternative assets against Bitcoin. Q4: Can the Altcoin Season Index predict future price movements? The index is a lagging indicator, reflecting what has already happened over 90 days. It doesn’t predict the future but helps identify which phase of the market cycle (Bitcoin or altcoin dominance) the market is currently in, which can inform strategy. Q5: What typically triggers a shift from a low index to an altcoin season? Shifts often follow Bitcoin establishing new price stability at higher levels, combined with emerging strong narratives in other sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or GameFi, leading investors to seek higher returns in altcoins.

The price of ADA has gone down by almost 60% from its peak. Currently, it looks like the price may go lower, but investors searching for the best crypto to buy now have turned their attention towards another cryptocurrency project named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This decentralized lending project has already yielded over 300% since its presale began. It has attracted a total of $19,500,000 with the support of 18,630 holders. It is at Phase 7 presently at a cost of $0.04 per token, and this phase is selling out quickly. It will be the last opportunity to invest in at this price before it goes up toward a launch price of $0.06, with 500-750% post-launch returns expected. The Year of Difficulty for Cardano The price drop in Cardano has occurred due to a combination of reasons. Firstly, the entire crypto market is down. This impacted every major cryptocurrency negatively. Secondly, the activity on the DeFi platform of Cardano has reduced. The total value locked in DeFi applications on the platform has declined below $250 million. This value is significantly lower than other players. It has failed to pick up momentum in the emerging trend of tokenization in assets, for example, property and stocks. Large investment banks are not also not very keen. Even though there were some applications for the ETF of Bitcoin and Ethereum, there were very few applications for a Cardano ETF. It dented the confidence level. Looking at the charts, ADA has moved past a major support level and currently lies below the major average level. It may go lower unless something dramatic happens in 2026. The Next Big Thing in Crypto Cardano is struggling, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving quickly and is the next crypto that is expected to explode. The fact that the presale has been successful is enough evidence that there is demand. The project has managed to raise $19.5 million. Those who participated in Phase 1 and bought for $0.01 have realized a 300% profit. Currently in Phase 7, priced at $0.04, the people who are buying now are set to realize a return of as much as 750% when MUTM starts trading. One essential indicator that shows a quality project has come far is having a functional product. The indicator shows Mutuum Finance is on the right track and their V1 Lending Protocol will soon go live on the Sepolia Testnet. This pre-release integrates a liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a Liquidator bot. The platform will initially feature ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing and collateral. Other tokens like Solana are expected in later stages of development. Phase 7 Progress It’s time to act. Phase 7 tokens at $0.04 are being sold fast. Once it’s sold out, Phase 8 starts at $0.045. This is one of the last chances to enter at a low price before it’s opened to the public. Users are motivated by participating in a live leaderboard. Each day’s top buyer is awarded an additional $500 MUTM bonus if that day’s 24-hour period includes at least one trade from them. The leaderboard will reset at midnight UTC every day. Security is paramount. In regard to security, it should be noted that Mutuum Finance recently undertook an audit of its entire lending facility by a reputable security company called Halborn. The entire process of auditing is complete, and they have implemented all recommended changes. As such, it provides a boost to security-conscious individuals who feel MUTM is the best cryptocurrency to invest in. The difference in the two projects is obvious.

This move, announced in early 2025, positions the nation among a growing list of countries seeking to harness the economic potential of blockchain technology while implementing oversight. Turkmenistan’s Cryptocurrency Framework: A Detailed Breakdown The new regulations create a structured path for cryptocurrency activities. Consequently, both domestic and foreign nationals can now participate in crypto mining. However, they must first complete a mandatory registration process with designated authorities. Furthermore, the government will permit the operation of mining pools, which aggregate computational power. Simultaneously, the rules mandate that any cryptocurrency exchange headquartered within Turkmenistan must obtain an official license to operate legally. It is crucial to note a key distinction in the legislation. Specifically, Turkmenistan has not recognized cryptocurrency as legal tender, national currency, or a security. Therefore, this regulatory approach focuses on the activity of mining and exchange operations rather than granting cryptocurrencies official monetary status. This careful positioning allows for economic participation without immediately challenging the national currency, the Turkmenistan manat. Context and Drivers Behind the Legalization Turkmenistan’s decision arrives amidst a complex global and regional landscape for digital assets. Neighboring nations like Kazakhstan have experienced both booms and strains from crypto mining, offering a nearby case study. Domestically, the country possesses significant energy resources, including natural gas, which could potentially power energy-intensive mining operations. Analysts suggest the government aims to create a new, regulated revenue stream and attract foreign investment in technology sectors. The following table outlines the core components of the new regulatory framework: Regulatory Component Key Detail Mining Participation Open to registered domestic and foreign nationals. Mining Pools Operation is explicitly permitted under the law. Exchange Licensing Mandatory for any exchange headquartered in Turkmenistan. Asset Status Cryptocurrency is not legal tender, currency, or a security. Expert Analysis on Economic and Technological Impact Financial technology experts point to several immediate implications. First, the registration process will establish a known participant base, aiding in monitoring and taxation. Second, licensing exchanges introduces consumer protection measures and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. The move could also spur infrastructure development, particularly in areas with surplus energy. However, experts caution that success depends on transparent regulation and competitive energy pricing. The global hash rate distribution may see a minor shift if Turkmenistan attracts substantial mining operations. Comparative Landscape in Central Asia Turkmenistan’s policy places it on a spectrum with its neighbors. For instance, Kazakhstan initially welcomed miners before imposing restrictions due to grid strain. Conversely, Uzbekistan has pursued a more open, licensed approach for exchanges. By learning from these regional examples, Turkmenistan’s framework appears designed to avoid energy grid overload from the outset through its registration system. The country’s relative geopolitical isolation adds a unique dimension, as its crypto market may develop with distinct characteristics. The regulatory announcement highlights several key requirements for participants: Registration: All miners must register, providing identification and operational details. Licensing: Domestic crypto exchanges cannot operate without a formal license. Compliance: Licensed entities will likely need to follow financial reporting and AML rules. Potential Challenges and Future Considerations Implementing this framework presents clear challenges. Regulatory bodies must develop technical capacity to oversee a novel industry. Additionally, balancing energy consumption for mining with domestic needs and export commitments will be critical. The government has not yet published detailed rules on taxation for mining profits or exchange revenues, a vital next step for clarity. Future developments may include rules for token issuance or broader digital asset definitions as the market evolves. Conclusion Turkmenistan’s legalization of cryptocurrency mining and trading marks a pivotal step in its engagement with the global digital economy. By establishing a registration and licensing system, the country seeks to foster a controlled, compliant environment for crypto activities. This structured approach to cryptocurrency regulation aims to capture economic benefits while managing risks. The world will watch closely as this Central Asian nation implements its new digital asset framework, offering another model for integrating blockchain technology within a national economy. FAQs Q1: Can anyone start mining cryptocurrency in Turkmenistan now? No. Both domestic and foreign individuals must complete a government registration process before they can legally mine cryptocurrencies under the new regulations. Q2: Is Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency legal tender in Turkmenistan? No. The regulations specifically state that cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender, national currency, or a security. The rules govern the activities of mining and trading only. Q3: What does the license for a cryptocurrency exchange entail? While full details are pending, the license will be mandatory for any exchange headquartered in Turkmenistan. It will likely require compliance with financial reporting, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering standards. Q4: Why would Turkmenistan legalize crypto mining? Potential drivers include creating a new regulated industry, attracting foreign technology investment, and utilizing domestic energy resources for economic gain, based on observed trends in similar nations. Q5: How does this compare to neighboring Kazakhstan’s approach? Turkmenistan appears to be implementing a registration system from the start, potentially to avoid the unregulated grid strain that Kazakhstan experienced, suggesting a more cautious, controlled rollout.

This pivotal announcement, made from Seoul on March 15, 2025, signals a major strategic evolution for one of the blockchain ecosystem’s notable non-fungible token initiatives. Consequently, the exchange will facilitate all technical updates for its user base, ensuring a seamless transition while the project’s core trading ticker, NFT, remains unchanged. This move underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain projects and the critical role exchanges play in their operational maturity. Coinone’s Strategic Support for the AINFT Rebranding Coinone, established in 2014, operates as one of South Korea’s oldest and most compliant cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform’s decision to support the APENFT rebranding is not merely administrative. Instead, it reflects a deeper commitment to project evolution and ecosystem health. Typically, exchange support for a rebrand involves several technical and communicative steps. For instance, the platform must update its internal systems, wallet infrastructure, and user interface displays. Furthermore, it must communicate these changes clearly to its substantial user base to prevent confusion and ensure trading continuity. This process demonstrates Coinone’s operational expertise in handling asset migrations, a non-trivial task in the volatile crypto environment. The exchange has previously managed similar events, such as token swaps and mainnet migrations, building a reputation for reliability. By proactively announcing its support, Coinone provides market stability and reduces uncertainty for NFT token holders. This action aligns with global best practices for digital asset stewardship, where exchanges act as crucial intermediaries between innovative projects and the investing public. Understanding the APENFT to AINFT Transition The rebranding from APENFT to AINFT represents more than a simple name change. APENFT, originally launched with a mission to bridge world-class art with blockchain technology, has undergone a noticeable evolution in its scope and technological focus. The new moniker, AINFT, strongly suggests an expanded or refined vision, potentially integrating artificial intelligence (AI) concepts with non-fungible token infrastructure. This shift mirrors a broader industry trend where blockchain projects pivot to incorporate adjacent technological breakthroughs, thereby enhancing their utility and market relevance. Critically, the project’s decision to retain its ‘NFT’ ticker on trading platforms is a strategically sound move. It maintains brand continuity and minimizes disruption in trading markets, where ticker recognition holds significant value. A ticker change can often lead to liquidity fragmentation or trading errors. Therefore, preserving the NFT identifier allows existing holders and traders to interact with the asset without relearning its market symbol. The logo update, mentioned alongside the rebrand, serves as a visual marker of this new chapter, helping to refresh the project’s identity while its economic unit remains constant on the ledger. Market Context and Expert Analysis of Project Rebrands Project rebranding in the cryptocurrency space is a common yet critical event. According to data from industry analysts, successful rebrands often follow a period of technical development or a strategic pivot. For example, major projects like Antshares rebranding to NEO or Binance Coin becoming BNB demonstrated how a refreshed identity can align with expanded functionality. The APENFT to AINFT transition appears to follow this pattern, suggesting underlying developments not yet fully public. Market experts generally assess rebrands on several key factors: the clarity of the new vision, the technical execution of the changeover, and the level of support from key ecosystem partners like exchanges. Coinone’s early endorsement is a positive signal on the latter front. It indicates that the AINFT team has conducted necessary due diligence and coordination with one of Asia’s regulated trading gateways. This cooperation reduces execution risk for the average holder, as the complexity of updating wallet addresses and ledger mappings is managed by the exchange’s technical team. The Role of South Korean Exchanges in Global Crypto Adoption South Korea remains a powerhouse in global cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Exchanges like Coinone operate under the strict regulatory framework of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Their compliance mandates rigorous listing and asset review processes. Therefore, Coinone’s continued and proactive support for the AINFT project post-rebrand serves as an implicit validation of the project’s compliance and technical standards. It signals to the market that the project meets the exchange’s ongoing listing criteria. This context is vital for international observers. South Korean markets often exhibit unique investor sentiment, sometimes referred to as the “Kimchi Premium.” Support from a major domestic exchange like Coinone can significantly influence local trading volume and perception. Moreover, it facilitates easier access for Korean investors to participate in the project’s next growth phase. The exchange’s announcement likely includes detailed guidelines for Korean users, which will be disseminated through its official blog, customer service channels, and in-app notifications, ensuring a smooth user experience. Technical and Practical Implications for Token Holders For holders of the NFT token, the practical implications of this rebranding are straightforward, primarily due to Coinone’s managed support. Users trading or holding NFT on the Coinone platform should expect no mandatory action on their part. The exchange will handle the backend updates to reflect the new project name (AINFT) and logo across its interface. However, users should be aware of official communications from both Coinone and the AINFT foundation to avoid phishing scams that often exploit such transitions. No Action Required for Coinone Users: Holdings and trading pairs will update automatically. Ticker Consistency: The asset will continue to be traded under the ‘NFT’ symbol. Updated Project Information: The exchange’s asset info page will reflect the new AINFT name, description, and logo. Withdrawal/Deposit Stability: Wallet addresses on the Coinone platform will remain functional; no new deposit addresses are required. Holders using self-custody wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Ledger) must rely on guidance from the AINFT project itself. Typically, such rebrands do not affect the underlying smart contract address on the blockchain. Therefore, tokens held in a private wallet remain valid and simply represent a claim on the renamed project. The community should watch for official announcements regarding updated token logos in wallet applications, which can sometimes require manual updates in community-driven interfaces. Conclusion The announcement that Coinone will support the APENFT rebranding to AINFT marks a significant step in the project’s lifecycle and highlights the exchange’s role as a stabilizing ecosystem partner. This move ensures a smooth transition for investors and reinforces the project’s legitimacy within a regulated market framework. The strategic decision to retain the NFT ticker provides continuity, while the new AINFT name points toward an evolved future direction, potentially at the intersection of AI and digital asset ownership. As the blockchain industry matures, such managed evolutions, supported by credible exchanges like Coinone, will become increasingly important for sustainable growth and mainstream adoption. FAQs Q1: Do I need to swap my NFT tokens for new AINFT tokens on Coinone? No. This is a rebranding, not a token swap or migration. The existing NFT tokens in your Coinone account will automatically be associated with the new AINFT project name and logo. No user action is required. Q2: Will the trading ticker symbol change on Coinone? No. The exchange has confirmed the ticker will remain ‘NFT’. This ensures consistency across trading pairs and minimizes confusion in the market order books. Q3: What is the main reason for the APENFT project rebranding to AINFT? While the project’s official channels will detail the full rationale, rebrands typically reflect a strategic pivot or expanded vision. The new name AINFT suggests a potential focus on integrating artificial intelligence with NFT technology, indicating an evolution beyond its original scope. Q4: How does Coinone’s support impact the credibility of this rebrand? Coinone’s support is a strong positive signal. As a regulated South Korean exchange, it conducts due diligence on listed assets. Its proactive management of the rebrand implies the AINFT project meets the exchange’s compliance and technical standards, reducing risk for users. Q5: What should holders in self-custody wallets do? Holders in private wallets (like MetaMask) should ensure they follow official announcements from the AINFT foundation. The underlying smart contract address does not change in a simple rebrand. Your tokens are safe. You may need to manually update the token’s displayed name and logo in your wallet interface by following verified community guides.

The offer started sometime last year and signals one of the first public cases where a country is openly accepting crypto for military weapons. Mindex says it has clients in 35 countries. The catalog is stacked. It includes Emad ballistic missiles, Shahed drones, Shahid Soleimani-class warships, and air defense systems. There are also cruise missiles, small arms, and rockets; some of which have already been seen in the hands of Iran-backed armed groups, according to western governments and the United Nations. Mindex platform lists war gear, takes crypto, and shrugs at sanctions The Mindex site is up, public, and slick. It’s in several languages. The domain is hosted on an Iranian cloud provider that’s already under U.S. Treasury sanctions. That host, according to Washington, has ties to Iranian intelligence. The Financial Times allegedly confirmed the site’s authenticity through archive data and server records. The buying process is digital. There’s a chatbot, an online portal, and an FAQ page. That page straight up asks: “Given the sanctions on Iran, what is the guarantee that the contract will be executed and the product will reach the destination country?” Mindex answers: “It should be noted that, given the general policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding circumvention of sanctions, there is no problem in implementing the contract. Your purchased product will reach you as soon as possible.” No prices are listed, but buyers can request in-person inspections of the goods in Iran. That’s “subject to approval from security authorities.” And if you want to pay in your own country instead of Iran, that’s an option too. There are some conditions. Mindex says clients must agree to rules on how weapons are used, specifically “during a war with another country.” But the company notes that these terms are negotiable between the two sides. In other words, if you’ve got the crypto, they’ll talk. Sanctioned governments eye crypto to keep deals alive This all comes at a time when more and more sanctioned countries are testing cryptocurrency to keep their economies moving. Russia has already been caught doing it. Now Iran is making it part of its military business model. The U.S. Treasury has warned about this before. It’s hit Russian companies for using digital assets to evade sanctions. And Iran has already been under fire for doing the same with oil sales, moving hundreds of millions outside normal banks. Back in September, U.S. officials sanctioned people linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards for running what they called a “shadow banking” network using crypto. The goal: move state funds while dodging detection. Western countries aren’t happy. The UK, France, and Germany tried to restart talks with Iran. It didn’t work. In August, they triggered a UN process to snap back global sanctions after those talks collapsed. Even so, Iran keeps exporting. In 2024, it ranked 18th worldwide for arms exports, right behind Norway and Australia, according to the Stockholm Institute for Peace Research. That same year, the Atlantic Council said Iran could cash in on Russia’s export struggles following its Ukraine invasion. Get seen where it counts.

As usual, these promises were made in interviews, earnings calls, podcasts, posts on Twitter (now X), and public events throughout the year. The promises cut across SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, and Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) . According to Cryptopolitan’s analysis, the missed targets trace back years, because in 2011, Elon told The Wall Street Journal a human would reach Mars within ten years. Over fourteen years later, no human mission exists. In 2016, Elon appeared at Recode’s Code Conference with Kara Swisher, journalist and host, and Walt Mossberg, veteran technology columnist.He revised the Mars plan again.Rockets would head to Mars in 2018.Missions would follow every 26 months.Humans would launch in 2024 and arrive in 2025. Elon said, “If things go according to plan, we should be able to launch people probably in 2024 with arrival in 2025.” That year ended without a Mars launch. Elon’s ally Jared Isaacman had to fight tooth and nail to win a nomination as NASA chief, which only came in late November, forcing SpaceX to focus on Earth orbit and testing. Oh and also, the public dates shared years earlier expired without updates matching those promises. Then the Hyperloop idea, something Elon once described it as a fastest way to move people between cities in different countries by 2025. Tesla Robotaxi launch failed to match Elon’s public claims In July during Tesla Q2 2025 earnings call, Cryptopolitan reported that Elon falsely promised investors that robotaxis would cover half of the U.S. population by year-end. He said, “I believe half of the population of the US will be covered by Tesla’s robotaxi by the end of the year.” Austin, Texas is still the only city with active robotaxi operations, and even there, a report from The New York Times says that local residents rarely saw the vehicles. When they did, the cars were not fully autonomous. Each vehicle reportedly still carried a human safety monitor. The promise of empty cars came earlier. During a 2024 fourth-quarter earnings call, Elon said Teslas would operate in Austin without anyone inside by June. “Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin,” he said. Texas rules required a human monitor. The monitors stayed. In September, Elon posted on X that the safety driver would leave by year-end. “The safety driver is just there for the first few months,” he wrote. In October, he repeated the timeline on another earnings call. In December, at an xAI hackathon, he said, “Unsupervised is pretty much solved.” AI, Roadster demos, and DOGE cuts missed targets In 2024, Elon replied to Logan Kilpatrick, developer advocate at Google AI Studio, on X. Logan asked, “How long until AGI?” Elon replied, “Next year.” Welp, AGI is still not here as of January 1st 2026. November brought another promise on The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan, podcast host, asked about the long-awaited Tesla Roadster, announced in 2017 with preorders taken. Elon said, “We’re getting close to demonstrating the prototype.” He said the demo would be unforgettable and hoped it would happen before year-end. No demo happened. The Roadster did not launch. He also talked about launching flying cars while mentioning Peter Thiel, his frenemy entrepreneur and investor. Clearly, no flying car has appeared. After Donald Trump won reelection, Elon famously took charge of DOGE, a new federal group, and vowed to cut $2 trillion in waste, fraud, and abuse.

The win followed months of attacks from executives and billionaire donors who tried to stop him and failed. Zohran entered office with a clear focus on working-class New Yorkers, rising living costs, and the role of big business in the city’s economy. Zohran was sworn in just after midnight at a decommissioned subway station beneath City Hall, placing his hand on a Quran as he took the oath right beside his wife, the First Lady Rama Duwaji. Zohran spent part of the night working inside his new office, and around midday, he returned to City Hall in a taxi cab for a public inauguration. Bernie Sanders, a United States senator and longtime mentor of Zohran, administered the oath again during the daytime ceremony. Zohran enters City Hall after Wall Street spends millions to stop him New York City executives and billionaire business figures spent more than $40 million trying to block his rise, but that effort clearly failed, forcing financial leaders to adjust to an administration they openly opposed. Billionaire hedge fund manager Billy Ackman spent about $2 million backing efforts to defeat him, but after Zohran won, Billy went on X and said :- “Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.” During his campaign, Zohran pledged to spend his first 100 days taking what he called “concrete and substantive actions” to address the cost-of-living crisis pushing residents out of the city. He also said he would confront “corporate greed.” Wall Street ally president Donald Trump warned during the race that federal funding could be cut if Zohran won. Donald also spoke publicly about sending National Guard troops to the city. After the election, Trump changed his tone and invited Zohran to the White House in November. The meeting ended without confrontation. “I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,” Trump said. Zohran faces legal limits though, cause he cannot raise taxes without approval from New York State lawmakers. Wall Street bets on AI continue as Zohran pushes economic pressure at home As Zohran prepares to govern, Wall Street remains locked into aggressive spending on AI, in spite of the blatant risks, with more than 60 financial institutions published outlooks showing near-universal confidence in AI. Fidelity International called it “the defining theme for equity markets” in 2026. The BlackRock Investment Institute said AI would continue to outweigh tariffs and traditional macro forces. NatWest described the technology as “a powerful engine of economic expansion.” BCA Research, which warned of a possible U.S. recession, stayed neutral on stocks because of heavy AI capital spending. JPMorgan Wealth Management framed the risk in blunt terms. “The biggest risk, to us, is not having exposure to this transformational technology,” the company said. Wall Street is also extremely concerned about geopolitics, trade barriers, and a weakening U.S. labor market, according to Bloomberg. Even with those risks, expectations remain for continued global growth. Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates many times next year, thanks to Trump’s expected appointment that will most likely force the central bank to lose its independent. “Regional policy shifts suggest a more supportive macro backdrop for global growth in 2026,” said State Street. “With an inflation trajectory trending lower, US policy rates likely to fall as the Fed takes stock of a softening labor market, and policy levers turning stimulative, we have a supportive environment for risk assets.” But Fidelity warned that:- “There is a disconnect between the positive short-term environment for risk assets, and a broader structural instability. Global fragmentation, a depreciating dollar, US Federal Reserve independence, and AI capex trends are themes to watch in 2026 and beyond.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Economy,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-02 02:50:25

This pivotal finding comes directly from comprehensive user data released by Dunamu, Upbit’s operator, providing an unprecedented look into the trading behaviors and demographic composition of one of the world’s most active crypto economies. The report not only highlights XRP’s sustained dominance over giants like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on the platform but also maps the evolving profile of the Korean crypto investor. XRP Secures the Top Spot on Upbit’s 2025 Trading Charts Dunamu’s annual data release offers a clear hierarchy of asset popularity. While the global crypto market often fixates on Bitcoin and Ethereum, Upbit’s user base demonstrated a distinct and powerful affinity for XRP. The asset consistently outperformed all others in trading volume on the exchange throughout 2025. Following XRP, the list of highly traded assets included Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), the stablecoin Tether (USDT), and Dogecoin (DOGE). This ranking underscores a unique market dynamic within South Korea, where local investor sentiment can significantly diverge from global trends. Analysts point to several factors for this phenomenon, including XRP’s established presence in the Korean market for many years, its utility in cross-border payments which resonates with a trade-heavy economy, and the specific community and trading culture that has developed around the asset on local exchanges. Upbit’s Expanding User Base and Demographic Breakdown The growth metrics within the report are equally significant. Upbit’s cumulative registered user base reached a staggering 13.26 million by the end of 2025. Crucially, the platform attracted 1.1 million new users during the year, indicating robust growth even in a market characterized by increasing regulatory clarity and maturation. A granular demographic analysis reveals a user base composed of 65.4% men and 34.6% women, a gender ratio that continues to narrow slowly compared to earlier years in the industry. The age distribution provides critical insight into the primary wealth-generating and investing cohorts in South Korea. Investors in their 30s formed the largest group at 28.7%, followed closely by those in their 40s (24.1%) and 20s (23.2%). This concentration in the 30-49 age range suggests cryptocurrency investing is now a mainstream financial activity for established professionals and mid-career individuals, not solely the domain of younger, retail speculators. Decoding the “Midnight Hour” and Global Trading Patterns One of the most intriguing data points concerns market activity timing. The analysis identified 12:00 a.m. UTC as the most active trading hour on Upbit. This time corresponds to 9:00 a.m. Korean Standard Time (KST). This pattern strongly indicates that a significant portion of daily trading activity begins at the opening of the traditional business day in South Korea, as investors and traders assess overnight movements in global markets and execute their daily strategies. Furthermore, this 9:00 a.m. KST activity spike occurs just as the trading day is ending in North America, creating a fascinating handover of liquidity and volatility between the world’s major economic zones. This data is invaluable for understanding global crypto market flows, as activity on a major exchange like Upbit can influence asset prices worldwide. The Ripple Effect: Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem The consistent high-volume trading of XRP on a major fiat on-ramp like Upbit has tangible effects beyond simple rankings. Firstly, it ensures deep liquidity for XRP/KRW (Korean Won) trading pairs, which benefits all traders through tighter bid-ask spreads and reduced slippage. Secondly, such sustained demand is a key metric watched by project developers, institutional analysts, and regulators. It signals real-world usage and investor confidence that is separate from speculative narratives driven by social media. For the broader South Korean market, Upbit’s growth to over 13 million users—in a country of approximately 51 million people—illustrates the profound penetration of digital asset platforms into the national financial fabric. This level of adoption inevitably shapes regulatory discussions and the development of future digital asset frameworks within the country. Conclusion The 2025 data from Upbit solidifies XRP’s remarkable position as the most traded cryptocurrency on South Korea’s leading exchange, a testament to its enduring appeal in a sophisticated and competitive market. The accompanying user statistics paint a picture of a maturing investor base, with millions of new users and a demographic shift toward prime-age professionals. Understanding these patterns—from the preferred asset to the precise hour of peak trading—provides an essential blueprint for comprehending the forces that drive one of the globe’s most influential cryptocurrency economies. As the digital asset landscape evolves, data-driven insights from major platforms like Upbit will remain crucial for mapping its true trajectory. FAQs Q1: Why was XRP the most traded cryptocurrency on Upbit in 2025? XRP’s top position is attributed to its long-standing presence and high liquidity in the South Korean market, its practical use case for efficient cross-border payments which aligns with Korea’s export-driven economy, and a strong, established local trading community that has developed over years. Q2: What does Upbit’s user growth say about crypto adoption in South Korea? Adding 1.1 million new users in 2025 to reach over 13 million total indicates that cryptocurrency trading is moving beyond early adopters and becoming a mainstream financial activity in South Korea, even amidst a maturing regulatory environment. Q3: What is the significance of the most active trading hour being 12:00 a.m. UTC (9:00 a.m. KST)? This pattern shows that a major wave of daily trading activity in Korea begins at the start of the local business day. Traders are likely reacting to overnight price action from other global markets, making this a key time for liquidity and volatility. Q4: How does the demographic data of Upbit users compare to global crypto trends? The high concentration of users in their 30s and 40s (over 52% combined) suggests crypto investing in Korea is particularly popular among mid-career professionals, which may differ from some Western markets that historically had a stronger skew toward younger investors in their 20s. Q5: Does high trading volume on Upbit influence XRP’s global price? Yes. As one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, especially for XRP/KRW trading pairs, sustained buying or selling pressure on Upbit can have a measurable impact on XRP’s price discovery and liquidity across all global markets.

The project’s official Medium announcement outlines a structured four-quarter plan beginning with service overhaul and culminating in global implementation, positioning BioPassport as a potential leader in the rapidly evolving intersection of healthcare and blockchain innovation. This strategic blueprint arrives during a period of increased institutional interest in health-focused cryptocurrency projects, with the global digital health market projected to reach $657 billion by 2025 according to Statista research. BioPassport Roadmap: A Quarter-by-Quarter Breakdown The BioPassport roadmap presents a meticulously planned progression through 2026, with each quarter dedicated to specific developmental milestones. The first quarter will focus on service overhaul and rebranding initiatives, potentially addressing user feedback and market positioning. Subsequently, the second quarter introduces the highly anticipated wellness tracker beta service alongside an AI coaching system, representing the project’s core technological innovation. This phased approach demonstrates strategic planning common among successful blockchain projects that prioritize foundational improvements before feature deployment. Industry analysts note that this structured timeline aligns with established product development methodologies in both health technology and blockchain sectors. The roadmap’s clarity provides transparency for BIOT token holders and potential users, addressing growing demands for accountability in cryptocurrency projects. Furthermore, the separation of service overhaul from feature launches suggests a commitment to stability before innovation, potentially reducing implementation risks that have plagued other health-tech blockchain initiatives. Wellness Tracker Beta and AI Coaching System Integration The centerpiece of BioPassport’s 2026 strategy involves the Q2 launch of its wellness tracker beta service coupled with an AI coaching system. This dual-component approach addresses two critical aspects of digital health: data collection and personalized interpretation. The wellness tracker will presumably collect various health metrics through potential integrations with wearable devices or manual input systems, while the AI coaching component aims to provide actionable insights based on this collected data. Technical Implementation and Market Context From a technical perspective, integrating AI coaching with blockchain-based health data presents both opportunities and challenges. The decentralized nature of blockchain offers potential advantages for data security and user control, addressing growing privacy concerns in digital health. However, implementing effective AI algorithms on decentralized networks requires sophisticated architecture that balances computational efficiency with distributed processing. BioPassport’s success may depend on how effectively it navigates these technical complexities while maintaining user-friendly interfaces. The market context for this development is particularly relevant, as the global wellness technology sector continues expanding rapidly. Research from Global Market Insights indicates the digital wellness market could surpass $1.5 trillion by 2030, with AI-powered health applications representing one of the fastest-growing segments. BioPassport’s timing appears strategically aligned with this growth trajectory, potentially positioning the project to capture market share as adoption increases. Ecosystem Expansion and Mainnet Development Strategy BioPassport’s third-quarter focus on ecosystem expansion and mainnet preparations represents a critical phase in the project’s evolution. Ecosystem development typically involves partnerships, integration opportunities, and community-building initiatives that extend a blockchain project’s utility beyond its core functionality. For a health-focused project like BioPassport, this might include collaborations with healthcare providers, fitness applications, research institutions, or insurance companies. The planned proprietary mainnet development signals BioPassport’s intention to transition from potentially relying on existing blockchain infrastructure to creating its own specialized network. This move, while resource-intensive, offers greater control over transaction speeds, fee structures, and governance models specifically tailored to health data applications. Historical data from similar blockchain migrations suggests that successful mainnet launches can significantly enhance token utility and project credibility when executed with adequate technical preparation and community communication. Global Implementation and Regulatory Considerations The fourth quarter’s global service support implementation represents both an ambitious goal and a complex challenge. Expanding health technology services across international borders involves navigating diverse regulatory frameworks, data protection laws, and cultural attitudes toward health data sharing. The European Union’s GDPR, United States’ HIPAA, and various Asian data protection regulations create a complex compliance landscape for health-focused blockchain projects. Strategic Positioning in Competitive Landscape BioPassport operates within a competitive landscape that includes established health technology companies, traditional healthcare providers developing digital solutions, and other blockchain projects targeting the health sector. The project’s differentiation may depend on several factors including the specific implementation of its wellness tracker, the sophistication of its AI coaching algorithms, the user experience design, and the actual utility of the BIOT token within the ecosystem. Successful navigation of this competitive environment will require both technical excellence and strategic market positioning. Furthermore, the broader cryptocurrency market context in 2026 will significantly influence BioPassport’s trajectory. Factors including regulatory developments, institutional adoption patterns, and overall market sentiment toward utility tokens will create the environmental conditions within which the project must execute its roadmap. The planned quarterly structure provides flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions while maintaining progress toward long-term objectives. Conclusion BioPassport’s 2026 roadmap presents a comprehensive vision for integrating blockchain technology with personal wellness tracking and AI-driven health coaching.

The problem comes mainly from Madagascar, an island where central bank governor Aivo Andrianarivelo said produces up to 20 tonnes of gold each year, worth literally $2.8 billion at current prices, yet almost none of it appears in official trade records. Madagascar targets gold smuggling networks draining state revenues Aivo said criminal groups involved in the gold trade operate with aircraft, helicopters, and advanced transport systems that allow metal to leave the country undetected. “The criminal gangs, they have aircraft, helicopters, very sophisticated means of transportation,” he said. “Our strategy is to reduce the gold trafficking business in Madagascar.” As Cryptopolitan extensively reported throughout 2025, gold rallied by more than 60 percent and crossed $4,300 per troy ounce, becoming one of the top 5 most-traded assets globally. In countries where mining happens outside formal systems, authorities link the trade to environmental destruction, polluted rivers, human trafficking, and funding for armed groups. Madagascar now joins a growing list of countries where central banks and finance ministries are running domestic buying programs to get back control of the market. According to Aico, they’re trying to pull small-scale miners into regulated markets by offering official purchase channels instead of leaving them dependent on smugglers. Buying programs spread as prices fuel illegal gold mining Countries including Ecuador, the Philippines, and Ghana are expanding similar schemes. David Tait, chief executive of the World Gold Council, said artisanal and small-scale miners produce up to 1,000 tonnes each year, with large volumes entering illegal trade. “It’s anybody’s guess how much gold goes to bad actors, but even if you take a guess at 50 percent, it is an enormous amount of money,” David said. Rising prices also increase criminal income and environmental damage. “It could be apocalyptic, it really could, a law of unintended consequences of a rally to $10,000,” David said. In Ghana, the government launched a centralized buying body called GoldBod in 2025 as mercury use and water pollution from mining turned into a political crisis. Officials say more than 60 percent of the country’s waterways are now contaminated due to mining tied to gold. In Ecuador, where drug gangs have shifted into mining for cash, the government is expanding a buying program launched in 2016. A new buying station is set to open in Zamora in January. Diego Patricio Tapia Encalada, head of investments and international settlements at the Central Bank of Ecuador, said fast payments attract miners. “The price is important because then we incentivise the miner not to go to other channels,” Diego said, adding that payments are made within 48 hours. For Madagascar, higher prices increase pressure to control a sector long beyond state reach. “One of the objectives is to make gold benefit Madagascar, and to legitimise the business,” Aivo said. “That is the main goal, to make it more transparent.” The central bank plans to raise reserves from one tonne to four tonnes, a target unchanged after a new government took power in October. The bank buys output from artisanal miners and ships it overseas for refining. The metal can then be sold for foreign currency or added to reserves. The potential impact is large. Despite widespread production, gold does not appear among Madagascar’s top recorded exports, which include vanilla, cloves, clothing, and nickel. Not all programs succeed. Marc Ummel, head of raw materials at SwissAid, said weak traceability has caused failures. “Most of them do not have good due diligence mechanisms,” Marc said, pointing to cases in Sudan and Ethiopia, where central banks bought illegally mined supply from the Tigray region. There are working models. In Mongolia, a buying program running for over 30 years helped eliminate mercury use because stations test for contamination. Enkhjin Atarbaatar, director general of financial markets at the Bank of Mongolia, said artisanal mining was widespread in the 1990s, but most production now comes from small or mid-sized firms. Selling gold remains a key source of foreign currency. As prices stay high, regulation grows harder. Diane Culillas, chief executive of Swiss Better Gold, said all output reaches markets regardless of legality. “The gold always finds its way to market,” she said. New tracing tools may help. Ecuador is testing isotope scanners to identify ore origins. “If you do this now, in 10 years there’ll be only tiny amounts of gold going in the bad guys’ directions,” David said .

This is a 60% drop from November’s $194.2 million, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield. PeckShield reported 26 major crypto exploits during the month, including a single address-poisoning scam that cost one user $50 million. This scam involves scammers using look-alike wallet addresses to trick victims into sending funds to the wrong destination. In most cases, the first and last four characters of the addresses match, with the attacker hoping that the victim will accidentally send funds to the fraudulent address by selecting the poisoned address from their transaction history without closely examining the entire string. PeckShield noted that another user lost approximately $27.3 million due to a private key leak in a multi-signature wallet hack. Although the decline in the total amount of stolen funds is a positive development, many industry experts caution that users must remain vigilant and exercise caution to protect themselves against common scams and cybersecurity threats. Bybit’s $1.4B hack highlights concentrated crypto losses The year 2025 was another challenging year for blockchain as centralized exchanges , DeFi protocols, and infrastructure providers, attackers siphoned an estimated $2.2 billion in the 10 largest incidents, roughly on par with the “nearly $2.2 billion” stolen in 2024, according to an analysis based on Chainalysis data previously reported. However, the damage was far more concentrated. While the sheer number of mid-tier exploits increased from the previous year, 2025 also saw the largest crypto theft ever recorded: Bybit’s $1.4 billion breach in February. The Dubai-based exchange suffered the largest crypto theft on record on Feb. 21, when attackers drained approximately 401,000 ETH , worth a staggering $1.4 billion at the time, from wallets tied to the platform. Onchain security firms reported that funds were drained from Safe-based multisig wallets across multiple networks, including Ethereum and Arbitrum, before being rapidly funneled through a network of newly created addresses. Trust Wallet and Flow hacks expose browser wallet risks According to PeckShield, the Christmas Trust Wallet hack, which resulted in the wallet being drained of $7 million in user funds, and the $3.9 million Flow protocol hack were two of the most significant attacks in December. The Trust Wallet exploit affected the wallet’s browser extension. Browser-based wallets are continuously connected to the internet, a design characteristic that can increase susceptibility to specific cybersecurity threats . Using a hardware wallet , an offline storage device similar to a USB drive, to store cryptocurrency private keys is widely regarded as one of the safest methods for storing digital assets. Users can also completely neutralize the threat of address posing scams by checking every character of the destination wallet’s address multiple times, rather than quickly glancing at it or selecting it from a transaction history list. Trust Wallet users impacted by a recent browser extension hack are facing new delays after the company confirmed that its Chrome extension has been temporarily taken down from the Chrome Web Store. This resulted in slowing the rollout of a key claims verification tool tied to the incident. Trust Wallet chief executive Eowyn Chen said the extension became unavailable after the company encountered a Chrome Web Store bug while attempting to release a new version.

The spotlight, however, fell squarely on Bitcoin, where a staggering $18.99 million was forcibly closed, with short sellers bearing 84.56% of the pain. This event highlights the intense volatility and high-stakes nature of the perpetual futures market, where rapid price movements can trigger cascading effects for over-leveraged traders. Bitcoin Liquidations Lead a Market-Wide Squeeze The data from the past 24 hours paints a clear picture of a market moving sharply against bearish bets. Perpetual futures, which are derivative contracts without an expiry date, use a funding rate mechanism to tether their price to the underlying spot market. When prices rise rapidly, traders who have borrowed assets to sell (shorting) face mounting losses. Consequently, exchanges automatically close their positions to prevent negative balances, a process known as liquidation. In this instance, Bitcoin’s price action triggered a cascade. The dominance of short-side liquidations at 84.56% strongly suggests a swift upward price movement caught a large cohort of traders off guard. This phenomenon, often called a ‘short squeeze,’ forces sellers to buy back the asset to close their positions, which can ironically fuel further price increases in the short term. Market analysts frequently monitor liquidation clusters as they can indicate local tops or bottoms and signal excessive leverage in the system. Ethereum and RIVER Follow the Volatile Trend While Bitcoin led the liquidation volume, other major cryptocurrencies experienced similar pressure. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, saw $10.55 million in positions liquidated. Notably, short positions comprised 66.7% of this total, indicating a correlated but less extreme squeeze compared to Bitcoin. The lower percentage suggests a more balanced mix of long and short positions were wiped out during ETH’s price movements. The data for RIVER, a prominent altcoin, further underscores the market-wide nature of the event. With $9.27 million liquidated and shorts making up 77.43% of the total, it followed the pattern set by Bitcoin. This synchronicity often points to a macro-level catalyst or a surge in overall market sentiment that impacts correlated assets. The following table summarizes the key liquidation data: Asset Total Liquidations Short Position % Long Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $18.99M 84.56% 15.44% Ethereum (ETH) $10.55M 66.70% 33.30% RIVER $9.27M 77.43% 22.57% This data, sourced from aggregated cryptocurrency derivatives tracking platforms, provides a snapshot of extreme market stress. Importantly, these figures represent only a portion of the global derivatives market, as they are compiled from major centralized exchanges that publicly report such data. Expert Analysis on Derivatives Market Mechanics According to common analysis from derivatives trading desks, events like these serve as a critical reminder of market mechanics. The high funding rates that often precede such squeezes make it expensive to hold short positions, creating a precarious setup. When the price finally breaks upward, the resulting liquidations act as a forced buying mechanism. Seasoned traders monitor metrics like the estimated leverage ratio and open interest to gauge market vulnerability. Historically, large-scale liquidation events have preceded both sustained trends and sharp reversals. For instance, the market downturn of 2022 was punctuated by several record-breaking liquidation days that accelerated downward momentum. Conversely, the bullish cycle of 2024 saw multiple short squeezes that propelled prices higher as stop-loss orders were triggered. The current event’s context within broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate expectations or institutional adoption flows, is essential for understanding its potential longer-term impact. The Ripple Effects of a Major Squeeze The immediate effect of such liquidations is a rapid reduction in market leverage and open interest. This can temporarily reduce volatility as overextended positions are cleared. However, the forced buying from short liquidations provides potent, albeit artificial, upward pressure on the spot price. Furthermore, these events often lead to increased volatility in the options market, as implied volatility spikes due to the sudden and dramatic price action. For the broader ecosystem, large liquidations highlight several key points: Risk Management Importance: They underscore the critical need for prudent leverage and stop-loss strategies. Market Sentiment Gauge: The skew toward short liquidations often reflects a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment, at least temporarily. Infrastructure Stress Test: Exchanges must handle the high volume of forced trades without system issues, testing their operational resilience. Ultimately, while dramatic, single-day liquidation events are a normal function of a mature, liquid derivatives market. They represent the transfer of capital from incorrect bets to those on the right side of the move, contributing to price discovery. Conclusion The 24-hour period ending March 21, 2025, delivered a powerful lesson in cryptocurrency market dynamics, with Bitcoin liquidations dominating headlines. The overwhelming dominance of short position liquidations, particularly for BTC, signals a pronounced squeeze that realigned leveraged positions with a shifting market reality. These events, while volatile, are integral to the derivatives landscape, serving to flush out excessive leverage and realign prices. Market participants will now watch closely to see if this liquidation flush establishes a new support level or merely punctuates a short-term correction, as the search for the next directional catalyst begins. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when short positions are liquidated? A1: Short position liquidation occurs when a trader who has borrowed and sold an asset, betting on a price decrease, is forced to buy it back at a higher price to close the position. This happens automatically by the exchange when the trader’s losses exceed their collateral, preventing a negative account balance. Q2: Why is a high percentage of short liquidations significant? A2: A high percentage, like Bitcoin’s 84.56%, strongly indicates a ‘short squeeze.’ This means the price moved up sharply, forcing many bearish traders out of their positions simultaneously. Their forced buying can create additional upward momentum in the price. Q3: Where does liquidation data come from? A3: Liquidation data is aggregated and reported by analytics platforms that track activity on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., Binance, Bybit, OKX). The data is a sample of the total market but is considered a reliable indicator of trends and extremes. Q4: How do liquidations affect the average cryptocurrency investor? A4: For spot investors not using leverage, the main impact is increased price volatility. Large liquidations can cause sharp, temporary price spikes or dips. They also signal where large clusters of stop-loss orders may be located, which technical analysts monitor. Q5: Are large liquidations a bearish or bullish signal? A5: It depends on the context. A squeeze of short positions (like this event) is immediately bullish as it involves forced buying. However, it can also indicate that excessive bullish leverage has built up, potentially setting the stage for a long liquidation event if the price reverses. Analysts view it as a sign of a market clearing excess, not a definitive long-term directional indicator.

56715141,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=887453,1767324359,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56715141.jpeg,Turkmenistan’s crypto mining law takes effect after November approval,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/turkmenistans-crypto-mining-law-takes-effect/,"Turkmenistan’s long-anticipated crypto mining law has officially taken effect, marking a major shift in the tightly controlled nation’s economic policy after gaining parliamentary approval in November and receiving presidential assent in late 2025. The new Law on Virtual Assets came into force on January 1, 2026, establishing a legal framework for cryptocurrency mining, trading, and exchanges under strict oversight – but with significant restrictions that reflect Ashgabat’s cautious approach to digital assets. Shortly after this news was made public, reports from reliable sources confirmed that the new regulation had received the approval of Serdar Berdimuhamedow, the President of Turkmenistan. With this approval in place, virtual assets are categorized under civil law. It also creates a licensing system that the central bank effectively oversees. Turkmenistan amends its policy for crypto-related activities Turkmenistan’s recent move paves the way for a small but considerable chance for crypto-related activities in the country. Earlier, Turkmenistan was recognized for its isolation, tough capital controls, and stringent government regulations; hence, making a significant change with its decision to support crypto mining. Nonetheless, sources noted that the country’s decision raised controversy among individuals who wondered whether mining operations could be effectively carried out in a nation where the government closely tracks access to the internet. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Turkmenistan has always been one of the most isolated nations globally. This situation resulted from the government’s decision to implement stringent restrictions on sectors such as media, travel, and foreign investment. In an attempt to address its isolation status, the government began providing its citizens with electronic visas last year to simplify the process for foreigners’ visits. Now that the Central Asian country has adopted a decision to support crypto mining, analysts have commented that this move appears to be another carefully managed way to attract investment and technical skills to Turkmenistan without loosening political control. This situation prompted reports to contact officials in the country for their comments. Responding, they outlined this legislation as a move to modernize the economy, rather than as a means to establish a financial revolution. Notably, the licensing regulations, central bank oversight, and payment limitations enable the government to maintain full control over this sector. Regarding the new regulation , reports highlighted that this law appears to follow a trend of cautious change led by the government rather than true liberalization. Another discovery was that Turkmenistan’s economy heavily depends on the exportation of natural gas, with China positioning itself as a key client. Therefore, crypto mining offers a possible strategy to generate funds from extra energy resources. It also helps the nation diversify its income sources beyond hydrocarbons. While Turkmenistan decides to support crypto mining, reports from reliable sources have disclosed that Russia has begun making its regulations stricter, despite securing a ranking as one of the significant global centers for mining. Russia implements several changes to its mining activities A recent report noted that Moscow has decided to make changes to the country’s mining activities. Following this change, it was confirmed that the nation moved mining operations into formal, taxed systems. It also opted to restrict operations in areas encountering power shortages. According to this finding, sources noted that although Turkmenistan does not have an official collaboration with Russia and maintains a policy of permanent neutrality, the new regulation reflects a broader trend in Eurasia aimed at enhancing mining operations outside the US. However, even with this approach in place, the United States still positions itself as a leading option for significant industrial miners. In the meantime, analysts pointed out the existence of clear restrictions. According to their research, cryptocurrencies are not suitable for payments, exchanges will be heavily regulated, and the implementation of internet controls will be considered. As a result of these limitations, they predicted that Turkmenistan’s mining industry would expand at a slow and selective pace.

56714826,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257930,1767324611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Market Bottom Remains Elusive, Warns Veteran Bloomberg Analyst",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-market-bottom-bloomberg-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Market Bottom Remains Elusive, Warns Veteran Bloomberg Analyst In a sobering assessment for cryptocurrency investors, a prominent Bloomberg Intelligence strategist has delivered a stark warning: Bitcoin has not yet reached its market bottom. Mike McGlone, a senior macro strategist with a long track record in commodity and market analysis, presented data suggesting the flagship digital asset may face further declines before establishing a true cyclical low. His analysis, shared in late 2024, hinges on a critical technical metric—the 50-week moving average—and its historical relationship with major market reversals. Understanding the Bitcoin Market Bottom Thesis Mike McGlone’s analysis provides a data-driven perspective on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Currently, Bitcoin trades at approximately a 13% discount to its 50-week moving average. This moving average smooths out price data over the past year, offering a benchmark for the asset’s medium-term trend. However, McGlone points to a concerning historical pattern. Notably, genuine market bottoms in Bitcoin’s volatile history have typically formed when the price plunged to a much steeper discount of around 55% below this key average. This discrepancy between the current 13% discount and the historical 55% benchmark forms the core of his caution. Consequently, the analysis implies that the present price level may not represent the ultimate low for this market cycle. The 50-week moving average itself acts as a dynamic support or resistance level, often reflecting broader market sentiment and institutional positioning. The Role of the 50-Week Moving Average in Crypto Analysis Technical analysts frequently use moving averages to identify trends and potential turning points. The 50-week period is particularly significant because it approximates a full trading year, filtering out short-term noise. When an asset’s price trades significantly below its long-term moving average, it often indicates oversold conditions or a sustained bear trend. For context, during previous major crypto winters, such as the 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 periods, Bitcoin’s price did indeed test levels far below this average. McGlone’s reference to a 55% discount is not arbitrary. It is derived from observing past capitulation events where panic selling exhausted itself. Therefore, his statement serves as a quantitative framework rather than mere speculation. It invites market participants to consider the depth of previous corrections. Furthermore, this analysis aligns with a macro perspective, considering factors like liquidity conditions and Federal Reserve policy, which Bloomberg Intelligence regularly monitors. Contextualizing McGlone’s Expertise and Market Impact Mike McGlone brings decades of experience in finance, having analyzed commodities and macro trends before focusing on crypto assets. His reports for Bloomberg Intelligence are widely cited for their data-centric approach. This specific analysis gains weight from his established methodology. The warning arrives amid a complex global economic backdrop, influencing risk assets like Bitcoin. Market reactions to such analyses are often mixed. Some traders view deep discounts as buying opportunities, while others see them as signals for further caution. The key takeaway is the emphasis on historical precedent. The table below illustrates how Bitcoin’s price interacted with its 50-week moving average during notable past bottoms: Period Approx. Price Discount to 50-Wk MA at Bottom Subsequent 12-Month Performance Q1 2019 ~50-60% Significant Recovery Q4 2022 ~40-50% Strong Rally Current Analysis (2024) ~13% To Be Determined This comparative view underscores the analyst’s central argument. Other market experts often monitor similar metrics, including the 200-day moving average and Mayer Multiple. However, the 50-week average provides a distinct, longer-term lens. Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The potential for further price discovery lower has implications beyond Bitcoin’s spot price. Firstly, mining economics could face renewed pressure if asset values decline while operational costs remain fixed. Secondly, the broader digital asset market, which often correlates with Bitcoin, may experience continued volatility. Thirdly, institutional adoption timelines could be influenced by prolonged market uncertainty. Nevertheless, it is crucial to frame this analysis within the context of Bitcoin’s inherent volatility and its history of robust recoveries. Past performance never guarantees future results, but it provides essential data. McGlone’s report does not predict an inevitable crash; instead, it highlights a risk parameter based on observable data. Market participants should consider multiple viewpoints and fundamental factors, including: On-chain activity: Metrics like network hash rate and active addresses. Regulatory developments: Clarity from major global jurisdictions. Macroeconomic factors: Interest rate trajectories and inflation data. Adoption catalysts: Such as spot ETF flows and institutional integration. Ultimately, analyses like McGlone’s contribute to a more informed market dialogue. They emphasize risk management and historical awareness over short-term sentiment. Conclusion Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone’s assessment presents a cautious, data-heavy perspective on the search for the Bitcoin market bottom. By comparing the current 13% discount to the 50-week moving average against historical norms near 55%, the analysis suggests the market may not have seen its lowest point yet. This viewpoint, grounded in technical analysis and historical precedent, serves as a critical reminder of the asset’s volatility. While not a definitive forecast, it underscores the importance of rigorous analysis and measured expectations for investors navigating the complex cryptocurrency landscape. The path to the next Bitcoin market bottom, therefore, remains a key focus for analysts and traders alike. FAQs Q1: What is a 50-week moving average? A 50-week moving average is a technical analysis tool that calculates the average closing price of an asset over the past 50 weeks. It smooths out short-term price fluctuations to reveal the underlying longer-term trend. Q2: Why does Mike McGlone believe a 55% discount signals a market bottom? His belief is based on historical observation. In previous major Bitcoin bear markets, the price has often found a durable bottom after falling approximately 55% below its 50-week moving average, indicating a point of maximum pessimism and selling exhaustion. Q3: Does this analysis mean Bitcoin’s price will definitely fall further? No. The analysis identifies a risk parameter based on history. It is not a certainty. Market conditions are unique each cycle, and new factors like institutional adoption can influence price action differently than in the past. Q4: How should a long-term investor interpret this warning? A long-term investor might view it as a reminder of Bitcoin’s volatility and a framework for understanding risk. It could inform dollar-cost averaging strategies or prompt a review of portfolio allocation, but it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Q5: Are other analysts using similar metrics to predict a Bitcoin market bottom? Yes. Many technical analysts monitor moving averages, including the 50-week and 200-day. Other metrics like the Mayer Multiple, stock-to-flow models, and on-chain realized price are also used to assess market cycles and potential bottoms.

This rally marks a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, reflecting renewed institutional confidence and shifting macroeconomic winds. Consequently, analysts are closely examining the drivers behind this ascent. Bitcoin Price Breaks Through Key Psychological Barrier The Bitcoin price crossing $89,000 represents a crucial technical and psychological achievement. Market data from Bitcoin World and other aggregators confirms sustained buying pressure. Historically, such round-number milestones often act as both targets and resistance levels. Therefore, this breakthrough suggests underlying strength in the current market cycle. Several immediate factors contributed to this price action. First, recent regulatory clarity in major economies has reduced uncertainty. Second, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows have shown consistent growth. Finally, broader macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluation concerns, are driving asset diversification. For instance, on-chain data reveals substantial accumulation by long-term holders. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Rally Drivers This cryptocurrency rally extends beyond simple speculation. A confluence of fundamental and technical drivers provides context. The adoption of blockchain technology by traditional finance accelerates. Moreover, the Bitcoin network’s hash rate continues to hit record highs, signaling robust security and miner commitment. The following table outlines key metrics surrounding this price event: Metric Detail Price $89,008.28 Primary Market Binance USDT Pair 24-Hour Volume Significantly Above Average Key Resistance Broken $88,500 – $89,000 Zone Market sentiment, as measured by established fear and greed indices, has shifted from neutral to greedy. However, this does not necessarily indicate an immediate top. Past cycles show sustained rallies can continue despite elevated sentiment readings. The current market structure differs markedly from the 2021 peak, featuring more mature infrastructure. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the role of institutional participation. Reports from firms like Fidelity and BlackRock highlight growing corporate treasury allocations. This institutional inflow creates a more stable price floor compared to previous retail-driven rallies. Experts point to the volatility compression observed in recent months as a precursor to this breakout. Furthermore, the macroeconomic landscape provides a tailwind. Central bank policies in 2024 and early 2025 have influenced capital flows. As a result, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a digital hedge, similar to gold. This narrative gains strength with each inflationary data release. The asset’s fixed supply stands in stark contrast to expansive monetary policies. Historical Context and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to $89,000 follows a predictable yet volatile path. The asset has weathered multiple 50%+ drawdowns since its inception. Each recovery has reached new all-time highs, reinforcing its long-term trend. The current price sits within a critical range that could determine the next macro phase. Network Fundamentals: Active addresses and settlement volume remain strong. Miner Health: Revenue is sufficient to support operations post-halving. Regulatory Environment: Clearer frameworks reduce systemic risk. Technological Development: Layer-2 solutions improve utility and scalability. Comparisons to traditional assets are inevitable. Bitcoin’s year-to-date performance often outpaces major indices. This relative strength attracts capital from other asset classes. However, correlations with equities can shift rapidly during risk-off events. Investors must monitor these dynamics closely. Conclusion The Bitcoin price achieving a valuation above $89,000 underscores its evolving role in global finance. This milestone results from improved fundamentals, institutional adoption, and a favorable macro climate. While volatility remains inherent, the trend indicates growing maturity for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Market participants will watch for a sustained close above this level to confirm the next leg of the bull market. The Bitcoin price action serves as a key barometer for digital asset health. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to rise above $89,000? A confluence of factors drove the rise, including sustained institutional ETF inflows, positive regulatory developments, and broader macroeconomic conditions encouraging asset diversification. Q2: Is the current Bitcoin price sustainable? While cryptocurrency prices are inherently volatile, analysts note stronger fundamentals now than in previous cycles, including robust network security and growing institutional adoption, which may provide more stability. Q3: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The $89,008.28 price represents a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency, surpassing its previous peak achieved in the 2024 cycle. Q4: What are the risks at this price level? Key risks include potential regulatory shifts, macroeconomic downturns affecting risk assets, and profit-taking by short-term holders which could increase selling pressure. Q5: Should investors consider buying Bitcoin at $89,000? Investment decisions should be based on individual risk tolerance, financial goals, and thorough research. Many advocates promote a long-term, dollar-cost averaging strategy regardless of price points.

He pointed to incidents like the major Cloudflare outage in November, emphasizing his commitment to finding ways to strengthen and stabilize online systems. Following these ongoing issues with internet infrastructure, Buterin shared an X post dated Thursday, January 1, arguing that Ethereum needs to put in extra effort to attain its goal of developing the world computer, which functions as a key infrastructure piece of a freer and open internet. Afterwards, he asserted that this strategy starts with DApps that carry out their activities without fraud, censorship, or interference from third parties. Ethereum’s co-founder also noted that DApps can be broadly utilized on the blockchain. Regarding his perspective, Buterin explained, “But there are applications where you won’t even notice if Cloudflare is down – or if all of Cloudflare gets hacked by North Korea. These are applications whose stability extends beyond the fluctuations of companies, ideologies, and political groups. They also protect your privacy. This applies to finance, identity, governance, and any other essential infrastructure people want to create.” Individuals raise concerns about recent outages The Cloudflare outage , which occurred on November 18, had a massive impact on the ecosystem. Reports from sources stated that the outage, which resulted from a software failure, impacted about 20% of the global network and the security company’s websites. The firm released a report explaining the event. In this report, Cloudflare disclosed that a “feature file” in its bot management system surpassed its designated limit during a cyberattack response. Consequently, the operations of several cryptocurrency platforms were significantly impacted. Another significant outage struck on October 20, 2025. It took place in Amazon Web Services (AWS). At this point, given the frequency of outages and their impact on the ecosystem, many firms became skeptical about the reliability of centralized internet services. To illustrate the intense nature of the situation, websites such as Coinbase , Blockchain.com, BitMEX, and Ledger experienced outages, primarily caused by third-party technical issues, which led to their offline status. In a manifesto released on November 11, 2025, Buterin, together with Ethereum Foundation researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa Posner, stated that, “Decentralization does not fade away through capture but rather through convenience,” adding that, “ it drifts—automatically and continuously—toward reliance on trust.” Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Ethereum’s co-founder frequently shares his perspective on the crypto industry and technology on social media platforms, via his blog, and other outlets. Concerning his recently shared idea, sources highlighted that Buterin proposed in early December that the crypto market requires a reliable on-chain gas futures market, which will enable users to be aware of what to expect regarding blockchain transaction fees. Cloudflare encounters a significant outage Apart from the November incident, Cloudflare exp er ienced another outage on December 5. Reports noted that this situation was made public after users worldwide reported difficulties in accessing Cloudflare’s services. This announcement sparked concerns among individuals and raised complaints, mainly on the social media platform X. Some of the websites impacted by this incident included online platforms such as Canva and Downdetector, as well as trading platforms like Groww and Zerodha. However, after some time, Zerodha reported that its Kite services were completely restored. The restoration was made public after an executive from Zerodha pointed out that the Cloudflare worldwide outage had been resolved and that Kite services were completely restored. With this news, the executive urged its users to continue their trading activities as normal and apologized for any inconvenience caused. In a statement, Cloudflare mentioned that it had resolved the problem with its dashboard related to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Even with this assertion, analysts advised users to practice caution. Notably, about 4.5% of shares declined in premarket trading due to the outage. Meanwhile, regarding Cloudflare’s November outage, sources revealed that the firm encountered a disruption that temporarily impacted several online services, including ChatGPT, Spotify, and US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform. These two outages demonstrated that Cloudflare plays a crucial role in internet infrastructure by providing its users with services that safeguard websites from cyberattacks and help keep them easily accessible during times of high traffic.

According to the foundation, work is ongoing, and the next phase of the restoration is expected to take several days to complete. The breach has rattled parts of the crypto ecosystem, sparking conversations about safeguarding users, exchanges, and governance when a blockchain faces a security compromise. Flow notes that developers had “identified a path to restore EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine] functionality” as it addressed its non-EVM chain, Cadence . Meanwhile, the fix is in progress to clean up the exploit on the EVM environment, and the enquiry has been frozen for recent fixes. The foundation stated that it would then test the fixes and retest any remaining maintenance tasks, adding that it planned to take most worlds offline before restoring the vast majority of them to full availability as soon as it deemed it safe to do so. The current progress report already shows that accounts are being returned and fake tokens are being reverted daily, with on-chain audits accessible to everyone. Developers restore EVM as Cadence recovery moves forward The incident occurred on December 27, 2025, when a variety of NFTs and other assets were transferred off the network – approximately $3.9 million in total – via cross-chain bridges after an attacker exploited vulnerabilities in the execution layer. According to the Flow Foundation, the network was halted after validators intervened to stop further losses. Initially, Flow considered reverting the blockchain to a point in time before the exploit occurred. Critics warned that a reversal of the blocks could also reverse legitimate transactions, hide the bridges and exchanges used to move stolen money, and undermine investor confidence. Then, after consulting with seniors, the foundation switched course to a targeted recovery approach. This scheme still maintains most valid transactions on-chain and only processes transactions that fail to act correctly. Under this plan, affected accounts have their assets temporarily frozen as forensic analysis is carried out to identify and fully remediate the illicitly minted tokens. The foundation stated that the “scalpel” approach can enable them to resolve the issue and protect their principles of decentralization – not only for validators, but also for bridge providers, exchanges, and independent forensic partners. Security breach disrupts the Flow ecosystem and triggers market volatility The impact of the exploit has been felt throughout Flow’s ecosystem. The network freeze also temporarily shut down certain services, like the NFT lending service, where “a small percentage” of borrowers were unable to repay their maturing loans due to the transactions that came to a standstill. Investors have already felt the impact of the incident. The Flow token (FLOW) has dropped sharply across major exchanges as trading resumed. The decline has fueled broader concerns about risk management practices and raised new questions about the strength and credibility of Flow’s network security model. Flow Foundation said that after the Dec. 27 hack, a lone account had deposited around 150 million of its FLOW tokens — approximately 10% of what has been released so far and about $54 million at time of writing — to a centralized exchange, swapped most of them into other assets like Bitcoin, then cashed out more than $5 million before operations could be ground to a halt. The group attributed this to flaws in the exchange’s AML/KYC controls, which shifted financial risk onto users who may have unknowingly acquired bogus tokens.

Speaking on an episode of the Milk Road show on Thursday, CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno said that most of the indicators he tracks through the firm’s bull score index turned bearish in early November and have not yet recovered. The index, which ranges from 0 to 100, aggregates multiple metrics, including network activity, investor profitability, Bitcoin demand, and market liquidity, to assess overall market conditions. Key metrics signal a bearish shift Moreno said the final confirmation, in his view, came from a technical signal: Bitcoin’s price falling below its one-year moving average. This indicator, which reflects the average price of an asset over the past 12 months, is commonly used to identify long-term trends. “For me the last confirmation, it’s a technical indicator, which is the price going below its one-year moving average,” Moreno said, adding that this move typically confirms a transition into a bear market. Bitcoin began 2025 trading at around $93,000 and climbed to a peak of $126,080 in October, according to data from CoinGecko. However, it ended the year below its starting level, challenging expectations that the post-halving period would sustain higher prices. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading near $88,716. If Bitcoin is indeed in a bear market, Moreno’s assessment runs counter to predictions from analysts who have pointed to 2026 as a potential growth year for the asset. Potential bottom in the $56,000–$60,000 range Looking ahead, Moreno suggested that Bitcoin’s bear market bottom could fall between $56,000 and $60,000 over the coming year. His estimate is based on Bitcoin’s realized price, which represents the average price at which current holders acquired their coins, and on patterns observed in previous bear markets. “Historically, what happened in previous bear markets, you see the price coming down to what is called the realized price,” Moreno said. During bull markets, prices tend to trade well above this level, but in bear markets, the realized price often acts as a baseline for potential lows. A decline to the $56,000 level would represent a drawdown of roughly 55% from Bitcoin’s all-time high. While significant, Moreno noted that this would be less severe than in past cycles, when Bitcoin has experienced drawdowns of 70% to 80%. A more resilient bear market environment Moreno also argued that the current downturn appears more stable compared to previous bear markets. Unlike 2022, which was marked by major industry collapses such as the Terra ecosystem, Celsius Network, and FTX, the current period has not seen similarly high-profile failures. He pointed to structural changes in the market, including the presence of large institutional participants and exchange-traded funds that tend to buy on a more regular basis and are less likely to sell during downturns. According to Moreno, this steady demand helps cushion price declines. “There are other types of players now that buy more periodically,” he said, adding that demand in past bear markets typically contracted more sharply. With a broader base of investors and more established companies in the sector, Moreno suggested that Bitcoin’s current bear market, if confirmed, may prove less volatile than those of the past.

Key Takeaways: CryptoQuant says Bitcoin may have entered a bear market in early November. Bitcoin’s drop below its one-year moving average is the key signal confirming a broader trend shift. Moreno expects a potential bear market bottom between $56,000 and $60,000. Speaking on the Milk Road show on Thursday, Moreno said the majority of signals behind CryptoQuant’s bull score index have been flashing warning signs for weeks. The index, which ranges from 0 to 100, tracks a mix of metrics including network activity, investor profitability, Bitcoin demand, and overall market liquidity. Bitcoin Falling Below One-Year Moving Average Signals Trend Shift For Moreno, the most decisive signal is a familiar long-term technical marker: Bitcoin falling below its one-year moving average. That indicator, which reflects the average price over the past 12 months, is often used to distinguish between broader uptrends and downtrends. “For me, the last confirmation is the price going below its one-year moving average,” Moreno said, adding that this move typically marks a transition into bearish conditions. Bitcoin’s recent price action appears to support that view. After starting 2025 near $93,000, the asset rallied to a peak of around $126,080 in October before reversing course and ending the year below its opening level, according to data from CoinGecko. As of Friday, Bitcoin was trading near $88,500. If the current phase is indeed a bear market, it challenges widely held expectations that 2026 would mark another strong growth year for Bitcoin. Instead, Moreno argues the market may still be in the process of finding a bottom. Based on Bitcoin’s realized price, the average price at which current holders acquired their coins, Moreno estimates a potential bear market low in the $56,000 to $60,000 range over the next year. Historically, he said, Bitcoin prices tend to drift back toward this realized level during prolonged downturns, after deviating sharply higher in bull markets. Bitcoin’s Potential 55% Drawdown Seen as Mild by Historical Standards A decline to that range would represent a drawdown of roughly 55% from Bitcoin’s all-time high. While significant, Moreno views that figure as relatively mild by historical standards. Previous bear markets have seen losses of 70% to 80% from peak levels, often accompanied by cascading failures across the crypto industry. This cycle, however, looks structurally different. Moreno noted the absence of major systemic collapses so far, unlike 2022, when the implosions of Terra, Celsius, and FTX triggered widespread panic and forced selling. He also pointed to the growing role of institutional participants , including ETFs and long-term allocators , who tend to buy steadily and are less likely to exit positions during downturns. That shift, combined with a deeper pool of market participants and more established infrastructure, could help cushion the downside even if bearish conditions persist. “In previous bear markets, the demand was basically, you know contracting,” Moreno said. “I would say that structurally, we now have more like institutional or ETFs that don’t sell, and also there’s some buying there.” The post Bitcoin May Already Be Two Months Into a Bear Market: CryptoQuant appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|Market,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2026-01-02 04:46:55

The volatility allowed pseudonymous trader “Vida” to generate around $1 million in profit by reacting quickly to abnormal market signals. Anomaly in BROCCOLI(714) Vida said he already held spot and derivatives positions in BROCCOLI(714) and had set automated alerts to flag quick price increases and large divergences between spot and perpetual futures prices. When those alerts were triggered, he observed extreme imbalances in Binance’s order book. This included unusually large buy orders in the spot market that were not matched by similar depth in the futures market. Viewing the behavior as highly irregular, Vida first closed an existing funding-rate arbitrage position to secure gains, then added long exposure as spot prices continued to rise. He closely monitored the order book for signs that the large bids would be pulled, which he believed would signal an imminent reversal. When those bids disappeared, Vida exited his long positions and quickly flipped to short, and then closed those trades after prices dropped sharply. As reported by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, the activity appeared to be consistent with a hacker gaining control of a market maker’s accounts on Binance. According to Lookonchain, the suspected attacker attempted to move funds by aggressively buying spot, opening long perpetual positions through other accounts, and using coordinated self-trading. The main reason behind choosing BROCCOLI(714) could be due to its shallow liquidity and ease of price manipulation. However, in a subsequent update, Vida said Binance’s internal investigation found no clear evidence of a hacking incident. The exchange stated that it had not identified definitive signs of account compromise based on internal data. Community Reaction Many traders called the price action fake and engineered. Several users said the token traded flat for most of the day before suddenly spiking and crashing, with no real spot demand or on-chain activity to support the move. Others argued the rally was driven almost entirely by futures and pointed to a forced squeeze rather than organic buying. The latest incident also raised concerns about supply concentration, as Binance-controlled wallets held a large share of tokens, which makes price discovery highly centralized.

This planned maintenance window, affecting five specific digital currencies, begins precisely at 3:00 p.m. UTC on January 8. Consequently, the exchange aims to ensure network stability and security for its substantial user base. This proactive measure highlights the ongoing technical diligence required in the digital asset ecosystem. Upbit Arbitrum Suspension: Timeline and Affected Assets The suspension represents a routine yet critical network maintenance procedure. Upbit communicated the details clearly to its users, specifying a start time of 3:00 p.m. UTC on January 8. The exchange has not provided a specific end time for the resumption of services, indicating the suspension will continue through January 9. This approach is common for exchanges conducting thorough system checks and upgrades. Users must therefore plan their transactions accordingly to avoid inconvenience. Specifically, the suspension impacts transactions for five cryptocurrencies that utilize the Arbitrum One network as their primary layer-2 scaling solution. The affected tokens are: ANIME (Animecoin) ARB (Arbitrum’s native governance token) MLK (MiL.k) BOUNTY (Bounty0x) LZM (Lizumu) Importantly, trading for these assets on Upbit’s internal order books will remain fully operational during this period. The restriction applies solely to the movement of tokens onto and off of the exchange via the Arbitrum One network. This distinction is crucial for traders and holders to understand. Understanding the Arbitrum One Network Context To fully grasp the impact of Upbit’s announcement, one must understand the role of Arbitrum One. Developed by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum is a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. It processes transactions off the main Ethereum chain (Layer-1) before bundling and settling them on-chain. This architecture provides key benefits: Reduced Transaction Fees: Significantly lower costs compared to mainnet Ethereum. Faster Throughput: Enhanced transaction speed and scalability. EVM Compatibility: Seamless operation for Ethereum-based applications. As a result, many decentralized applications (dApps) and tokens have migrated to or launched on Arbitrum to leverage these advantages. The five tokens affected by Upbit’s suspension are prime examples of projects utilizing this ecosystem. Consequently, any maintenance on this network by a major exchange like Upbit directly impacts user accessibility and liquidity flows for these assets. Exchange Maintenance as a Standard Security Protocol Regular network maintenance is a standard, non-alarming practice for reputable cryptocurrency exchanges. These procedures are essential for several operational and security reasons. Primarily, they allow technical teams to perform vital upgrades to node software, ensuring compatibility with the latest network protocols. Furthermore, maintenance windows enable security audits and the implementation of enhanced safety measures to protect user funds. Exchanges also use this time to reconcile wallets and verify the integrity of transaction histories. For instance, a similar suspension occurred on Binance for the Arbitrum network in late 2024 for wallet integration updates. Therefore, Upbit’s action aligns with industry best practices for risk management and technological upkeep. It demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to providing a stable and secure trading environment. Immediate Impact and User Guidance The immediate effect of this suspension is straightforward: users cannot deposit or withdraw the five listed tokens via the Arbitrum One network during the specified window. However, several alternative actions remain available. Users can still trade these tokens against other pairs on Upbit’s platform. For those requiring asset movement, exploring alternative withdrawal networks, if supported by Upbit for the specific token, is a potential option, though often at a higher transaction cost. The table below summarizes the operational status during the suspension: Function Status on Upbit Notes Arbitrum Deposits (ANIME, ARB, MLK, BOUNTY, LZM) Suspended From 3:00 p.m. UTC, Jan 8 Arbitrum Withdrawals (ANIME, ARB, MLK, BOUNTY, LZM) Suspended From 3:00 p.m. UTC, Jan 8 Spot Trading for Affected Tokens Operational All trading pairs remain active Deposits/Withdrawals on Other Networks Check Token Page Availability varies per asset Users should monitor Upbit’s official announcement page for the precise reactivation notice. Historically, such maintenance periods by major exchanges conclude within several hours to a full day. Planning transactions around these known windows is a hallmark of experienced cryptocurrency users. Broader Implications for the South Korean Crypto Market Upbit’s decision also reflects the stringent regulatory and operational environment governing South Korea’s digital asset sector. The country enforces rigorous rules on exchanges, mandating robust security protocols and transparent communication with users. Proactive maintenance like this helps exchanges comply with these standards and maintain their operating licenses. As one of South Korea’s largest exchanges by volume, Upbit’s operational changes often signal trends or requirements affecting the broader local market. Other domestic exchanges may conduct similar network maintenance in tandem or succession. This event underscores the maturing infrastructure of the crypto industry, where scheduled technical upkeep is becoming as routine as it is in traditional finance. Conclusion Upbit’s temporary suspension of Arbitrum One network services for five cryptocurrencies is a planned and precautionary measure. This action underscores the exchange’s dedication to network security and technical reliability. While it temporarily limits deposit and withdrawal functionality for ANIME, ARB, MLK, BOUNTY, and LZM tokens, trading continues uninterrupted. Users are advised to note the timeline and plan their asset movements accordingly. This event highlights the ongoing evolution and professionalization of cryptocurrency exchange operations within the dynamic digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: Can I still trade the affected tokens on Upbit during the suspension? A1: Yes, absolutely. The suspension only affects deposits and withdrawals via the Arbitrum One network. All spot trading pairs for ANIME, ARB, MLK, BOUNTY, and LZM will remain fully active and operational on the exchange. Q2: When will Arbitrum One deposits and withdrawals resume on Upbit? A2: Upbit has announced the suspension begins at 3:00 p.m. UTC on January 8 and will continue through January 9. The exchange has not provided an exact end time. Users must monitor Upbit’s official announcement page for the service resumption notice. Q3: Are my funds safe on Upbit during this maintenance? A3: Yes, this is a standard network maintenance procedure. Fund safety is the primary reason for such scheduled suspensions, allowing the exchange to perform security checks and system upgrades. Trading and account balances are not impacted. Q4: What is the Arbitrum One network? A4: Arbitrum One is a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It helps process transactions faster and at a lower cost than the Ethereum mainnet while maintaining strong security guarantees. Many tokens and dApps use it for efficient operations. Q5: What should I do if I need to move my ARB tokens during the suspension? A5: You have two options. First, you can wait until Upbit reactivates the Arbitrum One network services. Second, you can check the token’s deposit/withdrawal page on Upbit to see if an alternative network (like Ethereum mainnet) is supported, though this usually incurs higher transaction fees.

This development follows growing market consensus that the Federal Reserve will implement additional monetary easing throughout the year. Major Asian trading hubs including Tokyo, Singapore, and Hong Kong reported orderly trading conditions despite the significant policy shift expectations from the world’s most influential central bank. Asian Currencies Maintain Steady Footing in Early 2026 Trading Regional currencies across Asia-Pacific markets showed minimal volatility during the initial January 2026 sessions. The Japanese yen traded within a narrow band against the dollar, while the Chinese yuan maintained its managed stability. Southeast Asian currencies including the Singapore dollar and Thai baht similarly exhibited restrained movements. Market analysts attribute this stability to several converging factors that have prepared regional economies for potential dollar weakness. Firstly, Asian central banks have built substantial foreign exchange reserves throughout 2025. These reserves provide crucial buffers against currency volatility. Secondly, regional inflation rates have largely returned to target ranges across most Asian economies. This normalization reduces pressure for aggressive monetary policy responses. Thirdly, trade balances in key Asian economies remain robust despite global economic headwinds. US Dollar Weakens Amid Federal Reserve Policy Expectations The US dollar index declined approximately 0.8% during the first trading sessions of 2026. This movement reflects market pricing of anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate reductions. Recent economic data from the United States shows moderating inflation and slowing but stable employment growth. These indicators support the case for monetary policy normalization after several years of restrictive rates. Federal Reserve officials have signaled their intention to gradually reduce the federal funds rate throughout 2026. The central bank aims to balance inflation control with economic growth support. Market participants currently price in between 75 and 100 basis points of rate cuts for the year. This expectation has fundamentally altered currency market dynamics and capital flow patterns. Expert Analysis of Regional Currency Resilience Financial institutions across Asia have prepared for this monetary policy transition throughout 2025. Regional banks strengthened their dollar liquidity positions while diversifying currency exposures. “Asian economies learned valuable lessons from previous Fed tightening cycles,” noted Dr. Li Wei, Chief Economist at the Asian Development Bank Institute. “Current stability reflects both improved macroeconomic fundamentals and more sophisticated policy frameworks.” The table below illustrates key Asian currency movements against the US dollar during the first week of January 2026: Currency Change vs USD Key Support Level Japanese Yen (JPY) +0.3% 145.00 Chinese Yuan (CNY) +0.1% 7.15 Singapore Dollar (SGD) +0.4% 1.38 Thai Baht (THB) +0.2% 35.50 Indian Rupee (INR) +0.5% 82.00 Comparative Analysis of Regional Monetary Policies Asian central banks maintain diverse policy stances as 2026 begins. The Bank of Japan continues its ultra-accommodative monetary approach despite global tightening trends. Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China implements targeted stimulus measures to support economic recovery. Southeast Asian central banks generally maintain neutral to slightly accommodative positions. This policy diversity creates interesting dynamics for regional currency markets. Some analysts suggest Asian currencies may decouple from traditional dollar correlations. “We observe increasing regional currency co-movement independent of dollar fluctuations,” explained Maria Santos, Head of FX Research at Standard Chartered Asia. “This reflects deepening regional economic integration and local currency bond market development.” Several factors contribute to this evolving dynamic: Regional trade agreements have reduced dollar dependency for intra-Asian commerce Local currency settlement systems have expanded throughout Southeast Asia Asian bond markets now provide viable alternatives to dollar-denominated debt Currency swap arrangements between central banks enhance liquidity management Global Economic Context and Future Projections The global economic landscape entering 2026 shows moderate growth with contained inflation. Major economies have largely completed post-pandemic normalization. Supply chain disruptions have substantially eased while energy markets remain balanced. This environment supports gradual monetary policy normalization across developed economies. International financial institutions project steady Asian economic growth throughout 2026. The International Monetary Fund forecasts 4.2% expansion for emerging Asian economies. This compares favorably with projected global growth of 3.1%. Regional resilience stems from several structural advantages including demographic trends, technological adoption, and manufacturing competitiveness. Historical Perspective on Currency Market Transitions Current market conditions resemble previous Federal Reserve easing cycles but with important distinctions. The 2019 easing cycle occurred amid trade tensions and manufacturing weakness. By contrast, 2026 begins with relatively stable trade relationships and recovering industrial production. Additionally, Asian economies now possess stronger external positions and more flexible exchange rate regimes. “Asian financial systems demonstrate remarkable resilience compared to previous decades,” observed Professor Kenji Tanaka of Tokyo University’s Economics Department. “Regulatory reforms, improved corporate governance, and deeper local capital markets provide crucial stability anchors during global monetary transitions.” Historical analysis suggests Asian currencies typically appreciate during Fed easing cycles, but current conditions may produce more nuanced outcomes. Conclusion Asian currencies demonstrate impressive stability as 2026 trading commences amid shifting global monetary conditions. Regional foreign exchange markets absorb Federal Reserve easing expectations with minimal disruption. This resilience reflects years of structural improvements and policy enhancements across Asian economies. The US dollar’s moderate decline aligns with anticipated policy normalization rather than fundamental weakness. Market participants will closely monitor upcoming economic data and central bank communications for further directional cues. The relative stability of Asian currencies against dollar movements suggests maturing regional financial systems and reduced external vulnerability. FAQs Q1: Why are Asian currencies stable despite dollar weakness? Asian currencies maintain stability due to strong fundamentals including substantial foreign exchange reserves, controlled inflation, robust trade balances, and improved monetary policy frameworks that reduce vulnerability to external shocks. Q2: How many Federal Reserve rate cuts do markets expect in 2026? Financial markets currently price in between 75 and 100 basis points of Federal Reserve rate reductions throughout 2026, reflecting expectations for gradual monetary policy normalization. Q3: Which Asian currency shows the strongest performance against the dollar? The Indian rupee demonstrates relative strength with a 0.5% appreciation against the US dollar in early 2026 trading, supported by strong economic growth prospects and foreign investment inflows. Q4: How do Asian central bank policies differ from the Federal Reserve? Asian central banks maintain diverse stances ranging from accommodative (Japan) to neutral (Southeast Asia) to targeted stimulus (China), creating varied responses to Federal Reserve policy changes.

This significant growth demonstrates how blockchain technology continues to capture real-world value through innovative financial instruments. The rapid expansion of Solana tokenized RWAs represents a fundamental shift in how traditional assets interact with decentralized networks, creating new opportunities for investors and institutions alike. Solana Tokenized RWAs Reach $873.3 Million Milestone Data from RWA.xyz reveals that Solana-based tokenized real-world assets have grown substantially in recent weeks. The blockchain now hosts approximately $873.3 million in tokenized RWAs, marking a 10% increase from previous valuation levels. This growth trajectory positions Solana as a significant player in the expanding tokenization market. The platform’s technical capabilities, including high throughput and low transaction costs, have attracted substantial institutional interest. Furthermore, the network’s architecture supports complex financial operations while maintaining accessibility for diverse market participants. Several factors contribute to this remarkable growth pattern. First, increasing institutional adoption drives demand for tokenized assets. Second, technological improvements enhance Solana’s infrastructure reliability. Third, regulatory developments create more favorable conditions for blockchain-based financial products. The combination of these elements creates a powerful growth engine for Solana’s tokenization ecosystem. Market analysts observe that this expansion reflects broader trends in decentralized finance and traditional finance convergence. Real-World Asset Tokenization Market Dynamics The tokenization of real-world assets represents one of blockchain technology’s most promising applications. Traditional assets like real estate, commodities, and financial instruments gain new liquidity and accessibility through tokenization. This process converts physical or traditional financial assets into digital tokens on blockchain networks. Consequently, investors can trade fractional ownership in previously illiquid assets. The global RWA tokenization market has experienced exponential growth across multiple blockchain platforms. Solana’s particular advantages in this space include: High transaction throughput enabling efficient settlement of tokenized assets Low transaction costs making fractional ownership economically viable Growing developer ecosystem creating specialized tokenization protocols Institutional partnerships bridging traditional finance with blockchain solutions Comparative data shows Solana gaining market share against other blockchain platforms. While Ethereum maintains the largest RWA tokenization volume, Solana’s growth rate exceeds industry averages. This performance indicates strong network effects and increasing platform maturity. Market participants particularly value Solana’s balance between decentralization and practical performance characteristics. Regulatory Landscape and the CLARITY Act Impact Asset management firm Bitwise recently published analysis suggesting Solana could benefit significantly from proposed U.S. legislation. The CLARITY Act, currently under consideration in Congress, aims to establish comprehensive cryptocurrency market structure regulations. Bitwise researchers believe this legislation would accelerate growth in the RWA tokenization sector. Specifically, regulatory clarity would reduce uncertainty for institutional investors considering blockchain-based asset solutions. The proposed legislation addresses several critical areas for tokenized assets: Regulatory Aspect Potential Impact on Tokenized RWAs Legal classification Clearer definitions for security tokens versus utility tokens Custody requirements Standardized frameworks for institutional asset protection Trading regulations Established rules for secondary market transactions Reporting standards Transparency requirements for tokenized asset performance Industry experts note that regulatory developments typically follow a predictable pattern. Initial uncertainty gives way to framework establishment, followed by accelerated adoption. The current legislative environment suggests the United States may be approaching the adoption acceleration phase. Consequently, blockchain platforms with strong technical foundations and existing institutional relationships stand to benefit disproportionately. Technical Infrastructure Supporting Solana’s Growth Solana’s blockchain architecture provides distinct advantages for tokenized real-world assets. The network’s consensus mechanism combines proof-of-history with proof-of-stake elements. This hybrid approach enables high transaction throughput without sacrificing security guarantees. Additionally, Solana’s parallel processing capabilities allow simultaneous settlement of multiple tokenized asset transactions. These technical characteristics directly address common challenges in traditional asset tokenization. Several technical innovations contribute to Solana’s RWA capabilities: Sealevel parallel execution enables concurrent transaction processing Gulf Stream mempool-less transaction forwarding reduces confirmation times Turbine block propagation protocol enhances network scalability Cloudbreak horizontally scaled accounts database supports massive data requirements These innovations collectively create an environment conducive to complex financial applications. Tokenized assets require reliable settlement, transparent ownership records, and efficient transfer mechanisms. Solana’s technical stack addresses each requirement effectively. Network upgrades continue to enhance these capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility for existing tokenized assets. Institutional Adoption and Market Validation Institutional participation represents a crucial validation metric for blockchain-based financial systems. Major financial institutions have increasingly explored tokenization solutions on various platforms. Solana has attracted notable institutional interest through partnerships and pilot programs. These developments signal growing confidence in the network’s reliability and regulatory compliance capabilities. Furthermore, institutional involvement typically precedes broader market adoption patterns. Recent institutional developments include: Asset management firms testing tokenized fund structures Investment banks exploring tokenized debt instruments Real estate companies piloting property tokenization projects Government entities investigating tokenized treasury products This institutional activity creates positive feedback loops for the Solana ecosystem. Each successful implementation attracts additional participants while refining technical and operational processes. The resulting network effects strengthen Solana’s position in the competitive blockchain landscape. Market data suggests this institutional momentum will continue through 2025 and beyond. Comparative Analysis with Other Blockchain Platforms Solana’s growth in tokenized RWAs occurs within a competitive multi-chain environment. Several blockchain platforms actively develop tokenization capabilities with varying approaches and specializations. Understanding these competitive dynamics provides context for Solana’s specific achievements. Each platform brings unique strengths to the tokenization challenge while facing distinct limitations. Key competitors in the RWA tokenization space include: Ethereum with established DeFi infrastructure and largest developer community Avalanche offering subnet architecture for customized compliance requirements Polygon providing Ethereum compatibility with enhanced scalability Stellar focusing on cross-border payments and asset tokenization Solana distinguishes itself through technical performance metrics and growing institutional relationships. While Ethereum maintains dominance in total value locked, Solana demonstrates superior growth rates in specific sectors. This pattern suggests market segmentation rather than winner-take-all dynamics. Different blockchain platforms may ultimately specialize in particular asset classes or geographic markets. Solana’s current trajectory positions it strongly for continued expansion in tokenized financial instruments. Future Projections and Market Evolution The tokenized RWA market shows strong indicators for continued expansion through 2025. Multiple analysts project exponential growth as regulatory frameworks mature and technical infrastructure improves. Specific projections vary by research firm, but consensus estimates suggest the total tokenized RWA market could reach several trillion dollars within five years. Solana’s market share within this expanding ecosystem will depend on execution across several dimensions. Critical success factors for Solana include: Sustaining network reliability during periods of high demand Developing regulatory-compliant tokenization standards Expanding institutional partnerships and integration pathways Enhancing cross-chain interoperability for asset transfers Maintaining competitive transaction costs as volume increases Market evolution will likely follow patterns observed in other technological transformations. Early adoption gives way to infrastructure development, followed by mainstream integration. Current indicators suggest the tokenization market approaches the infrastructure development phase. Platforms that establish robust ecosystems during this period will capture disproportionate value in subsequent phases. Solana’s recent performance suggests strong positioning for this market transition. Conclusion The 10% monthly growth of Solana tokenized RWAs to $873.3 million represents a significant milestone in blockchain adoption. This expansion demonstrates increasing institutional confidence in blockchain-based asset solutions. Furthermore, potential regulatory developments like the CLARITY Act could accelerate this growth trajectory substantially. Solana’s technical infrastructure and growing ecosystem position it strongly within the competitive tokenization landscape. The continued evolution of real-world asset tokenization on Solana and other blockchain platforms will likely transform traditional finance in fundamental ways. Market participants should monitor these developments closely as they reshape investment opportunities and financial system architecture. FAQs Q1: What are tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)?

Early risk-taking showed up most clearly in Asia, where Hong Kong and South Korea led gains as technology and semiconductor shares extended a late 2025 bounce. Japan and mainland China stayed shut for holidays, which kept liquidity light across the region. Crypto traders kept a close eye on whether Bitcoin can turn that calm into momentum, after a choppy stretch around the year-end. Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst at Mudrex, said Bitcoin is gradually regaining strength. “For the first time in months, the 30-day change in long-term holder supply has turned positive, rising by around 10,700 BTC, signalling renewed conviction among investors,” he said. “At the same time, continued exchange outflows suggest reduced selling pressure, helping build momentum. If Bitcoin manages to clear the $89,500 resistance, a decisive move towards the $100,000 mark is likely, with $87,000 emerging as a strong support level.” Market snapshot Bitcoin : $88,574, up 1.2% Ether : $3,009, up 1.2% XRP : $1.87, up 2% Total crypto market cap: $3.08 trillion, up 1.2% Equity Futures Advance On Year-End Strength In Technology Shares Across equity futures, investors leaned into the same year-opening tone, S&P 500 futures rose 0.29% and Nasdaq futures added 0.36% as traders carried over a year-end lift in big tech. That optimism still traces back to the AI trade, which powered much of 2025’s gains as money chased applications, data centres and advanced chips. As 2026 begins, investors are watching whether earnings can keep validating those valuations, especially with policy uncertainty building in Washington. Attention now shifts to the US economy and the Federal Reserve, with markets waiting on delayed data after the US government shutdown and recalibrating expectations for rate cuts. Traders price in only a 15% chance of a cut this month, with one more reduction seen by June. Markets Brace For Political Risk And Policy Shifts Politics also sits squarely in the mix, President Donald Trump is expected to announce Chair Jerome Powell’s replacement later this month, a move that investors see as another potential source of volatility. Meanwhile, metals stayed in the spotlight after a blockbuster 2025, spot gold rose 0.9% to $4,351.70 an ounce and spot silver jumped 2% to $72.63 per ounce, extending a run powered by rate-cut expectations, geopolitical tension and demand flows. In currencies, the dollar started the year on the back foot after its steepest annual drop in eight years, with investors weighing a more dovish Fed path against a shifting global rate backdrop.

XDC holds over $132 million USDC and close to $200 million in overall stablecoin liquidity. XDC’s DeFi ecosystem could follow Ethereum as a big beneficiary if the CLARITY Act passes through the Senate as expected. The XDC Network’s stock has been quietly gaining ground on CoinMarketCap’s market cap rankings, and it finally capped a strong 2025 with a big leap. With the January 1 jump, XDC Network overtook Official Trump, the memecoin token launched by US President Donald Trump, Filecoin and MYX Finance. The surge also puts it directly behind Algorand, Polygon, Arbitrum and Ondo, one of the big winners from the RWA narrative that dominated 2025 gains. Interestingly, XDC Network has been one of the covert beneficiaries of the RWA, stablecoin and institutional adoption surges that not only led 2025 gains but also defied the October 11 market capitulation that held the market below critical levels until year-end. XDC became a leading bridge to RWA tokenization As Cryptopolitan reported at the end of 2025, XDC surpassed $717 million in tokenized RWAs, according to data from Trade Fi Network . XDC has pitched itself as a bridge to launch tokenized, on-chain versions of live trade finance transactions, invoice tokenization, commodity-backed tokens, and institutional settlement rails. The network’s offering appears to be specialized for institutional users looking to layer 1 or layer 2 subnet systems to launch sovereign and privacy-preserving subnets that run on the security of the XDC mainnet. XDC displays massive capital concentration in high-value institutional products. One example of such deployments is the $345.3 million VERT Capital USDC-denominated private credit pools, which account for roughly 48% of XDC Network’s RWA value. The values have since gone up to $369 million, accounting for 53% according to today’s data. Next in line, Liqi Brazil (private credit and corporate bonds) accounts for 15% while Comtech Gold secures close to $15 million in commodities on the network. While these long-term, yield-bearing instruments were previously opaque and manual, XDC offers strategic support for TradFi players exploring a route on-chain, as seen in its XDC RWA Accelerator launched in partnership with Plug and Play, which they promoted as moving tokenization from “theoretical experiment” to “real balance sheet usage.” XDC grows as hub for regulated stablecoins Stablecoins and their issuers were one of the few categories that stayed in the green throughout 2025. Circle’s $1.05 billion IPO signaled strong public-market appetite for stablecoin issuers, while RLUSD issuer Ripple also completed a $500 million round at a $40 billion valuation. XDC has managed to stake a growing claim of the $314 billion stablecoin market cap, hosting over $132 million USDC and close to $200 million in overall stablecoin liquidity. With the GENIUS Act passed in the US and MiCA regulations in Europe, regulated stablecoins such as USDC have grown in importance for instant payment infrastructure, lending, liquidity markets, and RWA settlement. Citi forecasts the stablecoin market could reach up to $4 trillion by 2030 with stronger global regulation and adoption, and XDC’s share of that market is expected to grow, especially as tokenization and institutional use develop further. CLARITY Act expected to spark DeFi expansion in 2026 Coinbase’s research head David Duong credited the policy shift that delivered the GENIUS Act as the motivation for banks and corporations such as JPMorgan to finally start building the technical infrastructure to interact with stablecoins, which led to the explosion of that sector. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (CLARITY Act), which passed the House and moved into Senate reconciliation for later this month, provides critical provisions for DeFi platforms and sets clear guidelines for their operation. If it has a similar impact on DeFi as GENIUS had on stablecoins, Ethereum undoubtedly holds prime real estate because of the maturity of its $69 billion decentralized market. However, as more players seek specialist chains and platforms to serve their specific use cases, XDC’s DeFi ecosystem could present a solid case as a viable alternative. According to Defillama data, XDC currently holds around $25 million total value locked (TVL) across core DeFi applications, liquidity pools, and stablecoin activity. It has also shown positive growth potential in terms of incentive programs, liquidity incentives, lending, AMM, and yield-oriented products that attract both retail and institutional capital.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|USDC|XDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-02 05:27:33

Hack Losses Ease in December Losses from hacks and cybersecurity exploits in the crypto industry fell sharply in December, offering a modest sign of improvement after a volatile year for digital asset security. According to data from blockchain security firm PeckShield , total losses linked to crypto-related attacks reached roughly $76 million during the month, which was a steep 60% decline from November’s $194.2 million. While the lower figure suggests a slowdown in the scale of successful attacks, analysts warn that the underlying risks facing users and platforms are still significant. PeckShield reported a total of 26 major crypto exploits in December. One of the most severe incidents involved a single user losing approximately $50 million through an address poisoning scam. This type of attack relies on subtle deception rather than technical vulnerabilities, with attackers sending small transactions from wallet addresses designed to closely resemble legitimate ones. These fake addresses often share the same first and last characters as the intended destination, increasing the likelihood that a victim might mistakenly select the fraudulent address from their transaction history without carefully reviewing the full string. Another major loss that was pointed out by PeckShield involved a private key leak tied to a multi-signature wallet, resulting in roughly $27.3 million in stolen funds. Incidents like this prove that even more sophisticated wallet setups are not immune to user-side security failures, especially when private keys are exposed through poor operational practices or compromised environments. Beyond these large individual losses, December also saw several platform-level exploits . Among them was a Christmas-time hack affecting Trust Wallet, in which around $7 million in user funds were drained via vulnerabilities linked to its browser extension. PeckShield also pointed to a $3.9 million exploit involving the Flow protocol. Despite the month-over-month decline in stolen funds, security experts place a lot of emphasis on the fact that users should not interpret the data as a signal that risks are diminishing. Instead, they prove the importance of vigilance and basic security hygiene. Simple practices like verifying every character of a wallet address before sending funds can greatly reduce the risk of address poisoning scams. Similarly, storing private keys on hardware wallets is still widely considered one of the safest approaches to crypto asset storage. Overall, December’s figures suggest that while the scale of losses can vary, the threat landscape is still active and changing.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-02 05:30:00

Key Takeaways: Crypto hack losses fell 60% in December to $76 million, marking a sharp drop from November’s levels. A single address poisoning scam accounted for $50 million of losses, making it December’s largest crypto exploit. PeckShield warns that persistent threats like key leaks and browser wallet exploits still pose serious risks. The figure marks a notable decline from November’s $194.2 million, offering a rare pause after months of elevated attack activity across the sector. Address Poisoning Scam Drives $50M Loss in December Crypto Exploits PeckShield said December saw 26 major crypto exploits, with a handful of incidents accounting for the bulk of losses. The largest involved a single user who lost $50 million in an address poisoning scam. In such attacks, threat actors send small transactions from wallet addresses that closely resemble legitimate ones, hoping victims will mistakenly copy or select the fraudulent address during a transfer. These scams often rely on visual similarity. Typically, the first and last few characters of the fake address match the real one, making it easy for users to miss subtle differences when scanning transaction histories. Attackers exploit that moment of inattention to redirect funds irreversibly. Another major incident in December involved a private key leak tied to a multi-signature wallet, which resulted in losses of about $27.3 million. PeckShield said the breach highlights the persistent risks around key management, even for wallets that rely on multiple approvals for transactions. #PeckShieldAlert December 2025 witnessed ~26 major crypto exploits, resulting in total losses of ~$76M. This figure represents a decrease of over 60% from November's total of $194.27M, marking a significant reduction in monthly losses. Notably: Wallet 0xcB80…819 lost $50M… pic.twitter.com/CNW3R6646j — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) January 1, 2026 While the overall decline in stolen funds may appear encouraging, security experts caution that it does not necessarily signal a lasting shift. PeckShield pointed to several notable attacks during the month, including a Christmas-day exploit targeting Trust Wallet’s browser extension that drained roughly $7 million, as well as a $3.9 million hack affecting the Flow protocol. Browser-based wallets remain a common target for attackers due to their constant internet connectivity. In contrast, hardware wallets, offline devices designed to store private keys, are widely considered one of the safest options for long-term asset storage, a distinction often highlighted by security researchers and outlets such as Cointelegraph. PeckShield said users can significantly reduce their exposure to common exploits by adopting basic precautions. These include verifying every character of a destination address before sending funds, avoiding reliance on saved transaction histories, and keeping private keys offline whenever possible. Brooklyn Man Charged in $16M Crypto Scam Targeting Coinbase Users As reported, US prosecutors have charged a 23-year-old Brooklyn resident , Ronald Spektor, with stealing roughly $16 million in cryptocurrency from around 100 Coinbase users through an alleged phishing and social engineering scheme. According to the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, Spektor posed as a Coinbase employee and contacted victims claiming their funds were at immediate risk, pressuring them to transfer crypto to wallets he controlled. Authorities said the scheme relied on panic tactics rather than technical hacks. Operating under the online alias “lolimfeelingevil,” Spektor allegedly warned victims of imminent theft to override skepticism and force quick decisions.

Rhee says inflation will be relatively steady in 2026 South Korea just introduced new currency-support measures last week, after the won approached the 1,500-per-dollar mark — a level last seen during the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis. The won had declined after foreign capital outflows, and concerns that additional US investment linked with trade talks could add pressure on the exchange rate had grown. In his New Year’s address on Friday, the BoK governor asserted that the $20 billion outlined in the US trade agreement represents the upper annual limit, adding that investment decisions would not be taken if they threatened FX market stability. He explained that the decline in the exchange rate is due to the difference in interest rate gaps between the nation and the US, as well as the Korean discount. He also argued that resident foreign investment created short-term FX supply-demand pressures. Nonetheless, he said inflation is expected to remain steady in the year ahead. However, he warned that additional exchange-rate weakness could threaten that outlook. The central bank maintained borrowing costs at 2.5% in late November and revised its growth and inflation projections upward. Most analysts believe the bank will keep rates unchanged at the Jan. 15 policy meeting. Nevertheless, the bank asserted that it’s still open to cut rates further next year, even as it ramps up oversight of risks stemming from won weakness and climbing housing prices. Any move toward additional easing will hinge on a holistic assessment of price pressures, economic momentum, and financial stability risks, the bank said in its 2026 policy statement. However, a Bloomberg poll in December found that economists expected the next rate cut would not happen until the last quarter of 2026. Some analysts also believe the BOK has already completed its rate-cutting phase. Global investors are urging Korea to increase its stock allocation Global investment banks are encouraging South Korea to increase its US stock allocation , anticipating a surge in AI in 2026. They emphasized that the US stock markets are expected to continue climbing next year. UBS Global Wealth Management even stated in its 2026 outlook report that spending on capital across data centers, power, and semiconductors will drive further gains in AI-related shares. It also forecast the S&P 500 to hit 7,700 in its base case and potentially reach as high as 8,400 if markets perform well. JPMorgan also projected the US market could post 13%–15% annual growth over the next two years. Additionally, Morgan Stanley expects a 14% rise in the S&P 500 next year, which would take it above 7,800, ahead of Japan and Europe. Moreover, Goldman Sachs also denounced claims that AI is overheating, arguing that investment is still in its “early stages” and will continue to grow as hyperscalers and nations compete for AI dominance.

This prediction from Standard Chartered implies an upside of more than 300% from current levels. While XRP’s price action remains constrained in the near term, market behavior suggests strategic positioning rather than disorderly selling. WOW! STANDARD CHARTERED ANALYST FORECAST #XRP COULD HIT $8 BY 2026, MARKING A 315% INCREASE! https://t.co/4qV0pIiwOc pic.twitter.com/ffgB6gUM2p — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 29, 2025 Regulatory Shifts Alter the Long-Term Framework Standard Chartered’s renewed confidence in XRP is rooted primarily in changes to the U.S. regulatory environment. For much of the previous market cycle, legal uncertainty rested on XRP’s adoption and limited institutional participation. According to Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital assets research, improved regulatory clarity has reduced those constraints and created a more stable foundation for growth. The bank’s $8 target is framed as a structural repricing rather than a momentum-driven surge. In this view, XRP’s earlier underperformance was a result of regulatory friction , not weaknesses in the asset’s utility. With that overhang easing, Standard Chartered argues that XRP can now scale within institutional portfolios and cross-border payment infrastructure freely over the coming years. Institutional Flows and Supply Dynamics Institutional interest has increasingly emerged through market structure rather than price acceleration. Since November, U.S.-based spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted over $1.25 billion in net inflows, with more than 1 month of positive flows . Compared with the more volatile allocation patterns observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, XRP-related flows have been steadier, suggesting longer-term positioning. Alongside ETF activity, XRP balances held on centralized exchanges have declined toward multi-year lows . This reduction in readily available supply does not guarantee higher prices, but it can amplify market reactions when demand changes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Consolidates Near Key Support as Leverage Builds In the short term, XRP has struggled to reclaim higher levels. The token recently fell to around $1.87, posting a modest decline even as trading volume rose more than 20% above recent averages. Elevated activity without meaningful price movement typically reflects rotation or positioning rather than panic-driven exits. The $1.85 area has continued to act as a key support zone , absorbing selling pressure and preventing a deeper pullback. However, upside attempts have repeatedly stalled near the $1.88 region, where sellers remain active. With moving averages still trending lower, the technical backdrop remains cautious. Derivatives data adds further complexity to the setup. Open interest has climbed to roughly $3.43 billion, indicating growing leverage, while spot flows have remained modestly negative. Attention is now turning to January’s scheduled release of 1 billion XRP from escrow, which typically heightens sensitivity when the price is tightly compressed.

56719264,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257948,1767334210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveals Crucial Market Equilibrium Across Major Exchanges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-perpetual-futures-long-short-ratio-analysis-3/,"BitcoinWorld BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveals Crucial Market Equilibrium Across Major Exchanges Global cryptocurrency markets observed a remarkably balanced BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across major exchanges this week, signaling cautious equilibrium among institutional and retail traders. According to March 2025 data from the world’s three largest cryptocurrency futures platforms by open interest, aggregate positioning shows traders maintaining nearly equal long and short exposure. This precise 49.29% long versus 50.71% short distribution represents one of the most neutral sentiment readings in recent months, potentially indicating consolidation before significant price movement. Market analysts closely monitor these BTC perpetual futures metrics because they provide real-time insight into trader psychology and potential market direction. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Analysis The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio serves as a critical sentiment indicator for cryptocurrency markets. Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures lack expiration dates and utilize funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. Consequently, the distribution of long versus short positions reveals collective market expectations. Currently, the aggregate 49.29% long to 50.71% short ratio demonstrates minimal directional bias among leveraged traders. This equilibrium suggests neither overwhelming bullish nor bearish conviction dominates current market psychology. Furthermore, the consistency across major exchanges indicates broad-based sentiment rather than platform-specific phenomena. Exchange-specific data reveals subtle variations in trader positioning. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, shows 49.3% long positions against 50.7% short positions. Similarly, OKX displays 49.64% long versus 50.36% short positioning. Interestingly, Bybit demonstrates a slight bullish tilt with 51.02% long positions against 48.98% short exposure. These minor discrepancies highlight how different trading communities exhibit varying risk appetites and market interpretations. However, the overall convergence toward neutrality remains the dominant narrative across all three platforms. Market structure analysts emphasize that such balanced ratios often precede periods of increased volatility when consensus breaks. Cryptocurrency Derivatives Market Context The cryptocurrency derivatives market has evolved significantly since Bitcoin futures first launched on regulated exchanges in 2017. Today, perpetual futures dominate trading volumes, offering continuous exposure without contract rollovers. The combined open interest across Binance, OKX, and Bybit regularly exceeds $15 billion, making their collective positioning data particularly influential. When analyzing BTC perpetual futures ratios, market participants consider several contextual factors. These include overall market capitalization, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and Bitcoin’s halving cycle. The current neutral positioning emerges against a backdrop of institutional adoption milestones and evolving regulatory frameworks worldwide. Historical analysis reveals patterns in long/short ratio behavior. During strong bull markets, long ratios frequently exceed 60%, while bear markets often see short ratios surpassing 55%. The current near-50/50 distribution mirrors patterns observed during previous consolidation phases. For instance, similar ratios preceded the 2023 rally following the banking crisis and the 2024 breakout after spot ETF approvals. Market technicians also correlate these ratios with funding rates, which remain moderately positive across exchanges. This combination suggests cautious optimism rather than speculative frenzy. Additionally, the stability of these ratios over the 24-hour measurement period indicates sustained rather than fleeting sentiment. Expert Interpretation of Market Positioning Derivatives analysts emphasize the importance of exchange-specific nuances when interpreting BTC perpetual futures data. Bybit’s slight long bias may reflect its retail-heavy user base, while Binance’s perfect balance could indicate sophisticated institutional participation. OKX’s positioning often correlates with Asian market hours and regional sentiment. According to cryptocurrency market researchers, balanced ratios frequently signal indecision among traders awaiting catalysts. Potential triggers include macroeconomic data releases, regulatory announcements, or Bitcoin network developments. The current equilibrium suggests traders position cautiously ahead of known events, including quarterly expiries and scheduled protocol upgrades. Risk management professionals highlight the implications for market stability. Balanced long/short ratios typically reduce systemic leverage risks because opposing positions create natural hedges within the ecosystem. However, they also increase vulnerability to sudden sentiment shifts when consensus emerges. Trading volume patterns accompanying these ratios provide additional context. Recent data shows stable volumes without the spikes characteristic of capitulation or euphoria phases. This volume profile supports the neutral sentiment interpretation. Market makers and liquidity providers reportedly adjust spreads and depth based on these ratio readings, affecting execution quality for all participants. Comparative Analysis Across Trading Platforms A detailed comparison of exchange-specific BTC perpetual futures ratios reveals meaningful patterns. The following table summarizes the 24-hour positioning data across the three major platforms: Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Binance 49.3% 50.7% -1.4% (Slightly Bearish) OKX 49.64% 50.36% -0.72% (Neutral) Bybit 51.02% 48.98% +2.04% (Slightly Bullish) Aggregate 49.29% 50.71% -1.42% (Neutral) Several factors contribute to these inter-exchange variations: User demographics: Different platforms attract distinct trader profiles Geographic concentration: Regional market hours influence positioning Product features: Leverage limits and interface designs affect behavior Liquidity conditions: Execution quality varies across platforms Notably, the aggregate ratio weights exchanges by their open interest, giving Binance’s positioning disproportionate influence. This methodology accurately reflects market-wide exposure. The consistency across platforms suggests genuine consensus rather than statistical anomaly. Historical data indicates that such convergence often precedes trend establishment. Market participants monitor whether Bybit’s bullish tilt spreads to other platforms or whether Binance’s neutrality becomes dominant. These dynamics will likely determine the next sustained price movement. Market Impact and Future Implications The current BTC perpetual futures positioning carries several implications for market structure. First, balanced ratios typically correlate with range-bound price action as opposing forces cancel out. Second, they indicate healthy skepticism rather than irrational exuberance or fear. Third, they suggest available capital for directional moves when catalysts emerge. Trading strategists note that such environments favor certain approaches: Volatility strategies: Options traders may position for impending breakouts Range trading: Spot traders might capitalize on defined support and resistance Basis trading: Arbitrageurs could exploit futures-spot discrepancies Gamma hedging: Market makers may adjust options inventories Market health indicators beyond long/short ratios provide complementary context. Funding rates remain slightly positive, suggesting longs pay shorts but without excessive pressure. Open interest shows stability rather than dramatic expansion or contraction. Liquidations data reveals minimal forced position closures. Together, these metrics paint a picture of cautious equilibrium. Regulatory developments increasingly influence derivatives markets, with jurisdictions implementing position limits and reporting requirements. These changes may affect future ratio patterns as compliance adjusts trading behavior. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio analysis reveals a market in careful balance during March 2025. With aggregate positioning at 49.29% long versus 50.71% short, traders exhibit remarkable neutrality across major cryptocurrency exchanges. This equilibrium suggests collective indecision ahead of potential catalysts, with subtle variations between platforms reflecting different user demographics and regional influences. Market participants should monitor whether this balance persists or breaks with forthcoming developments. The BTC perpetual futures market continues providing invaluable sentiment signals, with current ratios indicating neither excessive greed nor fear dominates cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Such balanced conditions historically precede significant price movements when consensus eventually forms. FAQs Q1: What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio measure? The ratio measures the percentage of open long positions versus short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across specified exchanges. It indicates whether traders collectively lean bullish (more longs) or bearish (more shorts). Q2: Why is the current ratio significant? The near 50/50 split across major exchanges suggests balanced market sentiment without strong directional bias. Historically, such equilibrium often precedes periods of increased volatility when consensus breaks. Q3: How do exchanges differ in their ratios? Bybit shows slight bullish bias (51.02% long), Binance demonstrates near-perfect balance, and OKX falls between them. These variations reflect different user bases, geographic concentrations, and platform features. Q4: What factors could change these ratios? Major price movements, regulatory announcements, macroeconomic developments, or Bitcoin network events typically shift trader positioning. Unexpected news often triggers rapid ratio adjustments. Q5: How should traders use this information? Professional traders incorporate ratio data into broader market analysis alongside price action, volume, funding rates, and macroeconomic context. It serves as one sentiment indicator among many rather than a standalone signal.

Bitcoin’s renewed quantum debate reflects a divide between developers who see no near-term threat and critics who want visible preparedness, with proposals like BIP-360 aiming to preserve flexibility rather than rush adoption of still-inefficient quantum-resistant cryptography. Aave’s dispute between its DAO and Aave Labs highlights a fundamental problem in DeFi: the absence of clear legal frameworks defining how DAOs control revenue, brands, and offchain assets. U.S. Crypto Market Structure Bill Enters a Critical Phase 2026 will be a decisive year for U.S. Crypto regulation, as lawmakers weigh whether they can pass a comprehensive digital asset market structure bill before the mid-term elections. The market structure bill will be an all-encompassing framework that defines how digital assets are regulated, splits oversight between the SEC and CFTC, and clarifies which tokens fall outside securities law. Drafts from the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee are now on the table, with leadership signaling plans for early-2026 markups after months of behind-the-scenes negotiations with Democrats. Despite the momentum, several unresolved issues remain that could hinder the passage of the bill. These include how DeFi should be treated under AML and securities rules and whether the SEC or CFTC should have primary authority in classifying a token. Political sensitivities around President Trump's crypto conflict of interest also further complicate negotiations. What adds to the complexity is the U.S. mid-term election. The time window for reconciling Senate drafts and aligning with the House's already-passed CLARITY bill is narrow. Lawmakers only have the first half of the year to demonstrate tangible progress before the mid-term election dynamic takes over. Key Take The 2025 crypto cycle was driven less by speculative retail momentum and more by regulatory signaling, clearer rules, a pro-crypto presidency, and a more constructive stance from the SEC and CFTC, but unlike hype-fueled liquidity surges, regulatory progress delivers its benefits slowly, requiring time to translate optimism into real adoption and sustained market growth. The passage of the GENIUS Act demonstrates the tangible impact of regulatory clarity: stablecoin market capitalization expanded from roughly $200 billion to over $300 billion, while clear rules unlocked participation from major technology and financial institutions, triggering a new wave of institutional stablecoin issuance. Despite encouraging public signals, passage of a comprehensive crypto market structure bill is far from assured; industry insiders in Washington put the odds at only 50–60%, warning that the legislation’s complexity and exposure to politically sensitive issues could still derail it. Quantum Computing Reignites a Long-Running Bitcoin Debate Debates around how Bitcoin should prepare for quantum computing's threat have reignited, centering on a clear divide between bitcoin developers and critics over how early should the network start to prepare for the potential risks. On one side, Bitcoin developers argue that quantum computing does not pose a practical threat in the near term. They point out that quantum computing capable of breaking Bitcoin's elliptic curve cryptography do not exist today and are unlikely to for decades. On the other side, critics argue the problem is not about the precise timelines but more about preparedness. They argue even if the threat is currently theoretical, the absence of a visible plan creates uncertainty, particularly as governments and large tech firms are already preparing for quantum-resistant cryptography. The key question is not when quantum computers arrive, but whether Bitcoin has a credible path to adapt. Currently, Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 360 (BIP-360) outlines a gradual upgrade path toward quantum-resistant address formats. The proposal introduces new signature schemes designed to withstand quantum attacks, allowing users to opt in by moving funds to new addresses over time rather than a network-wide change. Key Take One of the biggest challenges with current post-quantum cryptography is efficiency. Many quantum-resistant schemes require significantly larger key and signature sizes, increasing transaction weight, bandwidth usage, and storage costs. Post-quantum cryptography is rapidly improving in efficiency, with signature sizes shrinking dramatically over time — from roughly 8,000 bytes in early schemes like Lamport signatures in 2011 to around 350 bytes for modern designs such as SPHINCS by late 2025. However, even with this progress, quantum-resistant signatures remain several times larger than Bitcoin’s current 64-byte ECDSA standard. Rushing Bitcoin into quantum-resistant cryptography could lock the network into suboptimal designs, while the actual threat remains distant. What matters most is preserving flexibility, a clear, credible upgrade path that allows Bitcoin to adopt mature solutions when the technology is truly ready. Aave Governance Showdown: DAO vs. Aave Labs A major governance dispute has erupted between Aave DAO and Aave Labs. Aave DAO is the decentralized autonomous organization responsible for governing the Aave protocol, the largest DeFi lending protocol with over $33B in total value locked. It operates through community voting by AAVE token holders. Aave Labs is the centralized development entity and core team behind the Aave ecosystem. It functions as a company focused on building and maintaining products. The Aave DAO and Aave Labs are now publicly at odds over who ultimately controls key revenue streams, the user-facing interface, and even the Aave brand. The conflict was triggered by Aave Lab's decision to integrate CoW Swap into the Aave interface, diverting swap fees away from the DAO treasury and toward Aave Labs. Aave Labs argues this revenue comes from a privately owned front-end product, while DAO delegates view this move as a de facto privatization of protocol-related income that could amount to over $10 million annually. Key Take At its core, the issue can be attributed to a single root cause: there is no clear legal structure or enforceable definition governing the relationship between the DAO and the corporate entities operating around it. There is no formal legal framework specifying: How a DAO can legally own, control, or monetize revenue; How a DAO can hold, license, or enforce rights over brands, trademarks, and intellectual property; What fiduciary or economic obligations builders and service providers owe to tokenholders. Many DAOs, including Aave, have operated under this ambiguity. While it may have enabled rapid growth in earlier stages when incentives were aligned, conflicts can easily erupt once meaningful and visible value emerges without clear legal arrangements defining who is entitled to claim it. This event is not a failure of decentralized governance. Onchain governance functions well for smart contracts, but it cannot address offchain assets such as brands or intellectual property, which require real-world legal enforceability. Just as the GENIUS Act provides stablecoins with clear legal status, decentralized finance protocols will also need clear regulatory and legal pathways to integrate sustainably with the real world. Weekly Market Chart: Bitcoin’s Volatility Declines According to data from Bitwise, Bitcoin’s volatility has been on a downward trend since 2020. Throughout 2025, Bitcoin has been less volatile than the market’s most popular stock, Nvidia. This shift reflects a fundamental change in Bitcoin’s characteristics: it is increasingly de-risking as an investment and benefiting from a more diversified investor base, driven by traditional investment vehicles such as Bitcoin treasury companies and ETFs.

Key Takeaways: Bithumb identified more than $200 million in dormant crypto spread across 2.6 million inactive accounts. One account held $2.84 million after nearly 12 years of inactivity, highlighting early crypto adopters who never returned. Some dormant assets posted gains exceeding 61,000%, showing how long-term inactivity amplified early-stage crypto returns. The disclosure came as part of a dormant asset recovery campaign aimed at users who have not logged in or traded for more than a year, according to Finance Feeds . Bithumb said inactive balances totaled about 291.6 billion Korean won, or roughly $201.8 million. Some of the accounts flagged in the review had shown no activity for more than a decade. Bithumb Finds $2.84M Dormant Account Idle for Nearly 12 Years According to the exchange, the single largest dormant balance was worth around $2.84 million. The longest period of inactivity stretched to 4,380 days, nearly 12 years, pointing to early market participants who entered during crypto’s formative years and never returned. The findings offer a glimpse into the industry’s early retail-driven phase, when users often bought small amounts of digital assets with little expectation of long-term value. Many of those accounts were abandoned as markets cooled, platforms evolved, or personal interest faded. In some cases, users may have assumed their holdings were insignificant, unaware that years of price appreciation had turned them into sizable sums. Bithumb said some dormant holdings recorded gains exceeding 61,000%, or roughly 610 times their original value. Tracing further reveals this wallet received ~93,947 BTC in 2017–2018, mainly from CEXs and CoinJoin, including HTX, Gemini, Bixin, Bitfinex, Bithumb, and QuadrigaCX. The wallet remained dormant for 3 years until 2020. With mixed sources like these and long dormancy, the funds… pic.twitter.com/XP5mMwjkV3 — Specter (@SpecterAnalyst) October 11, 2025 These outsized returns reflect assets acquired in the earliest stages of crypto adoption, before broader public awareness and institutional involvement. For comparison, Bitcoin traded at around $767 at the start of 2014. At recent prices near $87,700, that represents a gain of about 11,300%, or roughly 114 times. Several of the forgotten assets held on Bithumb therefore outperformed Bitcoin over a similar timeframe, underscoring how early exposure combined with long-term inactivity can yield extreme results. The exchange has run similar recovery efforts before. During its 11th anniversary campaign last year, Bithumb said roughly 36,000 users reclaimed dormant assets worth about $50 million. The current campaign is larger in scale, reflecting both the platform’s age and the growth of the crypto market over time. Bithumb said it plans to notify eligible customers directly and assist with account recovery, positioning the initiative as part of its customer protection efforts. Beyond individual users, the disclosure carries broader implications for the market. Dormant balances represent latent supply that could re-enter circulation during future market cycles. Upbit Moves 99% of Customer Assets to Cold Storage After $30M Hack As reported, Upbit is shifting nearly all customer assets into cold storage after hackers stole 44.5 billion won (about $30 million) from its Solana hot wallet, marking one of the strongest security responses yet by a major exchange. Operator Dunamu said the platform will raise its cold wallet ratio to 99% and reduce hot wallet exposure to effectively zero, far above South Korea’s legal requirement that 80% of user funds be stored offline. The exchange already held 98.33% of assets in cold storage at the end of October, the highest among domestic platforms, but accelerated its overhaul following the breach. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have launched an investigation, and local reports have cited early intelligence assessments that allegedly connect the intrusion to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.

56720403,https://invezz.com/?p=3018752,1767334916,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Crypto market rally today: here’s why Bitcoin and altcoins are going up,https://invezz.com/news/2026/01/02/crypto-market-rally-today-heres-why-bitcoin-and-altcoins-are-going-up/,"The crypto market rally resumed today, Jan. 2, as investors bought the recent dip. Bitcoin price rose to over $88,500, while Ethereum jumped by $3,000. The market capitalization of all tokens jumped by 1.35% to over $3 trillion. Most altcoins were in the green, with Story (IP) rising by 30%. Pepe token jumped by 25%, while Aerodrome Finance (AERO), Immutable (IMX), Filecoin (FIL), Maple Finance (SYRUP), and Render (RNDR) soared by over 10%. Crypto market rally today | Source: CMC Crypto market rally rose as investors bought the dip One potential reason why the crypto market rally is happening is that investors are buying the dip. Bitcoin remains 30% below its highest point in 2025, while Ethereum has plunged by 40%. Other top tokens have also dipped by double digits from last year’s high. It is common for investors to buy the dip after an asset crashes by double digits. The rebound is also happening as investors anticipate the so-called January Effect. The January Effect is a phenomenon where financial assets rise in January as investors start to buy after selling in December as part of tax-loss harvesting. Rising futures open interest The crypto rally is also happening as the futures open interest start rising. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the interest has jumped by 2.16% in the last 24 hours to $130 billion. Rising open interest is a sign that investors are deploying leverage, which is a bullish sign. Still, the interest remains much lower than last year’s high of over $255 billion. It has remained under pressure since the large liquidation event that happened on October 10, when over 1.6 million traders were wiped out. The rising futures open interest is happening as liquidations ease. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the 24-hour liquidation dropped by 40% to $141 million. 102,114 traders were liquidated in this period, with Bitcoin shorts worth $23.5 million being wiped out. Potential risk-on sentiment ahead of Fed cuts and IPOs The crypto market rally is also happening as investors embrace a risk-on sentiment as the year starts. Indeed, data shows that global stocks started the year well, with the Hang Seng Index rising by 2.70%, while the Sensex Index soared by 30 basis points. Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indices were also in the green. Market participants are bracing for a strong year, with most Wall Street analysts predicting that the S&P 500 Index will jump to $7,500 and above this year. The potential catalysts for the markets are Federal Reserve interest rate cuts , IPOs, including Anthropic, SpaceX, and Kunluxin , and strong earnings. Therefore, this optimism is helping to boost the crypto market. Potential dead cat bounce or bull trap Still, the main risk is that the ongoing rally of Bitcoin and altcoins could be a dead-cat bounce. Besides, the holiday mood is continuing, with the 24-hour volume plunging by 25% to $64 billion. In normal times, the volume in the crypto market is usually over $100 billion. A dead-cat bounce is a situation where assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies rebound briefly and then resume the downward trend as the momentum fades. The odds of a bull trap are elevated because past attempts to rebound have faced substantial resistance, with large companies like Wintermute and Binance selling.

The Financial Times reported that Iran’s Ministry of Defence Export Center, known as Mindex, is pitching deals that accept digital currencies, while also allowing barter arrangements and payments in Iranian rials. The offer emerged over the past year and appears to be one of the first known cases of a nation-state publicly signalling it will take crypto for strategic military exports. Mindex Advertises Weapons Linked To Iran-Backed Groups, Report Says Mindex says it has client relationships with 35 countries, and it markets a catalogue that includes Emad ballistic missiles, Shahed drones, Shahid Soleimani-class warships and short-range air defence systems, according to the report. Its multilingual website also lists small arms, rockets and anti-ship cruise missiles, some of which Western governments and UN reporting have linked to Iran-backed militant groups in the Middle East, the FT said. On the site, Mindex says buyers must agree to conditions about how weapons would be used “during a war with another country”, although it adds such terms are “negotiable between the contracting parties”. The export centre also operates an online portal and a virtual chatbot, which guides prospective customers through the process and addresses concerns about sanctions in an FAQ. Sales Pitch Emerges As Crypto Aids Trade For Sanctioned Actors The site does not list prices, but it mentions buyers can arrange payment in the destination country and it offers in-person inspection of goods in Iran, subject to approval from security authorities, according to the newspaper. The pitch lands at a moment when crypto has become a practical tool for sanctioned actors trying to keep trade moving, and US and European officials have stepped up enforcement against networks that use alternative channels to route money around the formal banking system. In Sept. 2025, the US Treasury announced sanctions targeting a financial network it said supported Iran’s military, and it alleged the use of shadow banking structures that can include crypto-linked schemes and overseas fronts. Russia’s Arms Exports Slump Opens Door For Rivals For counterparties, the risks remain high, anyone using conventional finance to pay Iran can face restrictions under US and allied sanctions programmes, which can cut access to Western-linked banking and trade services. Iran’s arms marketing also comes as the global weapons trade reshapes under the strain of the Ukraine war. SIPRI has reported that Russia’s arms exports fell 64% between 2015 to 2019 and 2020 to 2024, and the FT said Iran ranked 18th in the world for major arms exports in 2024, while noting that Russia’s reduced capacity has opened space for other suppliers. The Atlantic Council argued in 2024 that Iran was on track to replace Russia as a leading arms exporter and said Washington needs a strategy to counter that trend.

This analysis provides a comprehensive, evidence-based examination of Kusama’s price trajectory through 2030, scrutinizing its unique technological role, market dynamics, and the fundamental drivers that could influence its long-term valuation. Investors and analysts globally are watching this ‘canary network’ closely for signals about the broader Web3 ecosystem. Understanding Kusama: The Canary Network for Polkadot Kusama serves a critical function within the Polkadot ecosystem. Launched by the Web3 Foundation, it operates as an experimental and fast-paced proving ground. Developers deploy new parachains, governance features, and upgrades on Kusama first. Consequently, this network provides real-world stress testing before implementation on the more conservative Polkadot mainnet. This unique ‘canary in the coal mine’ role creates a distinct value proposition separate from mere speculation. The network’s governance, powered by KSM token holders, is notably agile, allowing for rapid iteration. This environment fosters genuine innovation but also carries inherent risk, a duality that directly impacts its market valuation. Technical and Fundamental Analysis for 2025 Projecting Kusama’s price for 2025 requires analyzing multiple converging factors. Fundamentally, the growth of the parachain slot auction ecosystem on Kusama is paramount. Successful deployments and active use cases increase utility and demand for KSM tokens, which are bonded for these slots. Technically, price action must be contextualized within broader market cycles and Bitcoin’s dominance trends. Analysis of historical support and resistance levels, combined with on-chain metrics like active addresses and staking participation, offers a data-driven foundation. For instance, a sustained increase in the number of unique active addresses often precedes positive price momentum. Furthermore, the rate of new parachain launches and the total value locked (TVL) in Kusama-based decentralized applications provide tangible metrics for gauging network health beyond pure price speculation. Expert Perspectives on Network Adoption Industry analysts from firms like Messari and CoinShares frequently highlight Kusama’s adoption curve. Their quarterly reports track parachain lease periods, developer activity, and cross-chain message volume. The consensus suggests that Kusama’s price is less tied to hype cycles and more correlated with tangible technological milestones and the success of projects launching on its network. For example, the performance of early-mover parachains in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) provides critical feedback. This real-world usage data forms a more reliable basis for long-term valuation models than short-term trading sentiment alone. Long-Term Trajectory: 2026 to 2030 Outlook The forecast for 2026-2030 hinges on the maturation of the entire Polkadot multi-chain vision. As interoperability becomes a non-negotiable standard for blockchain, networks facilitating cross-chain communication may see increased valuation. Kusama’s position as the agile, experimental layer of this ecosystem could capture significant value if it becomes the preferred launchpad for major Web3 projects. However, this outlook is contingent on several variables: the competitive landscape from other Layer-1 and Layer-0 solutions, regulatory developments for decentralized networks, and the broader adoption of blockchain technology. Scenarios range from Kusama becoming a niche developer network to a bustling hub of interconnected, specialized blockchains. Each scenario carries profoundly different implications for KSM token economics and demand. Comparative Market Position and Risk Assessment Evaluating Kusama necessitates comparison with its peers. Unlike general-purpose smart contract platforms like Ethereum or Solana, Kusama provides a specific infrastructure service. Its closest analog is Polkadot itself, but with a deliberately higher risk-and-reward profile. The table below outlines key differentiating factors: Factor Kusama (KSM) Polkadot (DOT) Primary Role Experimental canary network Production-grade mainnet Governance Speed Fast (7-day voting) Slower, more deliberate Parachain Lease Period Shorter (6-12 months) Longer (up to 96 weeks) Risk Profile Higher (early-stage code) Lower (audited, stable) Potential risks for investors include: Technological Risk: Experimental code on Kusama may contain undiscovered bugs. Adoption Risk: Developers may bypass Kusama or the parachain model may lose relevance. Market Risk: KSM price remains highly correlated with the volatile crypto asset class. Regulatory Risk: Evolving global regulations could impact staking or governance mechanisms. Conclusion This Kusama Coin (KSM) price prediction analysis for 2025 through 2030 underscores that its value is intrinsically linked to its utility as Polkadot’s agile canary network. While short-term price movements will fluctuate with market sentiment, the long-term valuation will likely be determined by the success and adoption of projects built on its framework, the health of the parachain ecosystem, and the broader realization of a interoperable multi-chain future. Investors should base decisions on fundamental network activity, developer growth, and technological milestones rather than speculative price trends alone. FAQs Q1: What is the main purpose of the Kusama network? Kusama serves as an experimental, fast-moving ‘canary network’ for Polkadot. It allows developers to test new blockchain technologies, parachains, and governance models in a real-world environment with real economic stakes before deploying them on the more stable Polkadot mainnet. Q2: How does the KSM token derive its value? The KSM token derives value from its utility within the network. Holders use KSM to participate in governance votes, stake for network security, and, most importantly, bond tokens to secure parachain slot auctions for new projects wanting to connect to the Kusama relay chain. Q3: Is Kusama simply a testnet for Polkadot? No, it is more accurately termed a ‘canary network’ or ‘experimental network.’ Unlike a traditional testnet with valueless tokens, Kusama operates with its own valuable cryptocurrency (KSM) and a fully functional, community-governed economy, making it a production environment with higher risk and faster innovation. Q4: What are the biggest risks of investing in KSM? Key risks include the experimental nature of the code running on Kusama (leading to potential bugs or exploits), the possibility that the parachain model may not achieve widespread adoption, high volatility common to crypto assets, and an evolving regulatory landscape that could impact its staking and governance mechanics. Q5: How does Kusama’s governance differ from Polkadot’s? Kusama’s governance is designed for speed and adaptability. It features shorter voting periods (e.g., 7 days for referenda compared to Polkadot’s 28 days) and generally lower thresholds for proposal approval. This reflects its purpose as a fast-paced environment for testing new ideas in on-chain governance.

The crypto security investigator has traced malicious attacks that began in late December, where a hacker has made away with small thefts of under $2,000 per victim. “It appears hundreds of wallets are currently being drained on various EVM chains for small amounts ( Source: Investigations by ZachXBT on Telegram. The wallets are being funneled into the address identified as 0xAc2e…ad8Bf9bFB, which on-chain data shows is holding assets from nearly 20 different blockchains. Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche, Arbitrum among EVM chains affected According to blockchain information from Debank, shared by the 2D investigator on Telegram, the attacker’s accumulated assets include about $54,655 worth of assets on Ethereum, accounting for 51% of its total balance. The BNB Chain follows with approximately $25,545, or 24%. At the time of this reporting, smaller but still notable balances were also recorded from layer-2 and alternative chains like Base ($8,688), Arbitrum ($6,273), Polygon ($3,498), Optimism ($1,480), Zora ($994), Linea ($909), and Avalanche ($386). EVM Hacker’s portfolio. Source: Debank.io Investors on Crypto Twitter suggest that the hacker may have used fake MetaMask emails sent during the holidays to trick traders to hand them their wallet seed phrases. However, per an analysis from Nansen, the address has been confirmed as one of the attacker wallets connected to the Trust Wallet Chrome Extension “Shai- Hulud” Supply Chain Attack, the security incident that began over the Christmas period. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Christmas Eve, a malicious code compromised Trust Wallet’s browser extension version 2.68, resulting in an estimated $7 million in losses. “Our Developer GitHub secrets were exposed in the attack, which gave the attacker access to our browser extension source code and the Chrome Web Store (CWS) API key,” Trust Wallet explained in a post-mortem published last Tuesday. “The attacker obtained full CWS API access via the leaked key, allowing builds to be uploaded directly without Trust Wallet’s standard release process, which requires internal approval/manual review.” They used that access to register the domain “metrics-trustwallet[.]com” and distributed a trojanized version of the extension, with a backdoor that could harvest users’ wallet mnemonic phrases and transmit them to “api.metrics-trustwallet[.]com.” Trust Wallet said about one million users of its Chrome extension were asked to update to version 2.69 after the compromised update was pushed to the browser’s extension marketplace on December 24. “Sha1-Hulud was an industry-wide software supply chain attack that affected companies in several sectors, including but not limited to crypto,” the company said. The disclosure brought light to Shai-Hulud 3.0, a newer iteration of the malware that researchers believe is a stealth version of the original code. “The primary difference lies in string obfuscation, error handling, and Windows compatibility, all aimed at increasing campaign longevity rather than introducing novel exploitation techniques,” Upwind researchers Guy Gilad and Moshe Hassan said. Nansen expects the stolen tokens to be routed through Tornado Cash, eXch, Railgun, THORChain, Debridge, and TRON OTC venues. Holiday email scams takeover Christmas in record 2025 At the start of December, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center sent warnings to Americans about fraudulent and phishing emails, saying citizens had lost more than $785 million annually to non-payment and non-delivery scams during holidays, with credit card fraud adding another $199 million. Moreover, blockchain-monitoring firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs estimate that cybercriminals stole $2.7 billion in crypto last year, the highest annual total on record. The largest by far was the breach of Dubai-based exchange Bybit, where attackers stole about $1.4 billion. That attack surpassed previous record-setting crypto heists, including the $624 million Ronin Network breach and the $611 million Poly Network hack in 2022. North Korean state-linked hackers were the perpetrators of most crypto theft incidents, stealing at least $2 billion during the year, according to Chainalysis and Elliptic. Since 2017, those groups are estimated to have taken around $6 billion in crypto supposedly used to fund the country’s sanctioned nuclear weapons program.

This expiry event is much smaller than average due to muted trading over the holiday period and the huge one last Friday. Trading has been subdued over the New Year holiday as expected, with volume and volatility low, and spot markets mostly sideways as we start a new month and a new year. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s small tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.48, meaning that there are a lot more calls (longs) expiring than puts (shorts). Max pain is around $88,000, according to Coinglass, which is pretty close to the current spot prices, so many will be in the money on expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $100,000, which has $1.3 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There remains around $1.1 billion in OI at $75,000 and $80,000 as bearish bets mount up. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is at $28 billion, much lower now after last week’s massive expiry. “Overall, market liquidity remains subdued, and sentiment is pessimistic,” said crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live in a market update earlier this week. In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 130,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $396 million, max pain at $2,950, and a put/call ratio of 0.62. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $6.7 billion, around a third of what it was in late August. Spot Market Outlook Nothing has really changed over the past month, observed analyst ‘Credibull Crypto’ on Friday. “As expected, we are simply chopping around at these levels with zero breaks in HTF [high time frame] market structure, despite many already claiming our cycle top is in.” The $74,000 support level remains unbroken, “and there are a number of indications that we are forming a bottom here,” they added.

""XRP is one of the only chains that has it's own stablecoin"" pic.twitter.com/tEBGI8FOLC — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) December 31, 2025 ETFs and the Role of Stablecoins In the video, Barron discussed whether XRP is beginning to approach the level of institutional attention seen around Bitcoin and ETH ETFs. He said, “I think that we’re moving in that direction.” His comments centered on structural developments rather than financial performance. Barron framed XRP’s position through how institutions evaluate blockchain networks and their ability to support real business activity . Barron highlighted stablecoins as a central part of the current narrative. He stated that XRP is “one of the only chains that also has its own stablecoin,” referring to the RLUSD stablecoin. According to Barron, this introduces “a new element” for building business activity on the chain. He linked this directly to how companies think about deploying capital and infrastructure on public networks. Machine-Driven Transactions and Ripple’s Global Expansion Barron said one of the most significant developments ahead is the increase in computer-to-computer transactions. He explained that as adoption of Web3 models grows, automated transactions will rise. He tied this trend to the value of having a stablecoin integrated with a public blockchain. Barron emphasized that XRP operates on a public chain with an independent verification network already in place, which supports this use case. Barron also addressed Ripple’s business development outside the US. He said Ripple faced challenges domestically while the lawsuit remained active. During that period, he observed that Ripple continued to expand its international presence . He added that his organization operates globally and has worked with Ripple in Asia for several years.

56722791,651775,1767338101,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56722791.jpeg,Ethereum: Buterin Revives ‘Milady’ For A World Computer Push,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-buterin-milady-world-computer-push/,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin rang in 2026 by switching his X profile image back to a Milady-style avatar and pairing it with a manifesto-like post that re-centers Ethereum’s identity around a single, old-school ambition: becoming “the world computer” for an open internet. “Welcome to 2026! Milady is back,” Buterin wrote , before ticking through what he framed as Ethereum’s 2025 progress: higher gas limits, a larger blob count, better node software quality, and zkEVMs hitting major performance milestones. He also argued that “with zkEVMs and PeerDAS ethereum made its largest step toward being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of blockchain.” Ethereum Must Deliver The World Computer But the post’s center of gravity wasn’t a victory lap. It was a warning that the network is still falling short of its own stated goals and that chasing whatever narrative is currently printing attention is not the point. Buterin drew a bright line between Ethereum’s long-term mission and trend-driven incentives that often dominate crypto cycles. “Ethereum needs to do more to meet its own stated goals,” he wrote. “Not the quest of ‘winning the next meta’ regardless of whether it’s tokenized dollars or political memecoins, not arbitrarily convincing people to help us fill up blockspace to make ETH ultrasound again , but the mission: To build the world computer that serves as a central infrastructure piece of a more free and open internet.” From there, he offered a description of what “world computer” should mean in practice: decentralized applications that can’t be quietly altered or shut off, and that remain usable even when the companies and infrastructure most users take for granted fail. “We’re building decentralized applications. Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference,” he wrote. “Applications that pass the walkaway test: they keep running even if the original developers disappear. Applications where if you’re a user, you don’t even notice if Cloudflare goes down — or even if all of Cloudflare gets hacked by North Korea .” Buterin extended that same set of expectations beyond finance, explicitly name-checking identity, governance, and “whatever other civilizational infrastructure people want to build,” and he emphasized privacy as a core property rather than a nice-to-have. A notable thread in the post is that Buterin refuses to treat usability-at-scale and decentralization as a trade-off Ethereum can punt on. “To achieve this, it needs to be (i) usable, and usable at scale, and (ii) actually decentralized,” he wrote, arguing those requirements apply both to the base layer—“including the software we use to run and talk to the blockchain” and to the application layer. That framing implicitly puts pressure on multiple constituencies at once: core protocol work, client diversity and quality, infrastructure that doesn’t centralize around a few providers, and dapp architectures that can survive developer abandonment while still meeting user expectations. Buterin closed on a note of resolve rather than specifics, saying Ethereum has “powerful tools” but needs to apply them more aggressively. “All of these pieces must be improved — they are already being improved, but they must be improved more,” he wrote. “Fortunately, we have powerful tools on our side — but we need to apply them, and we will.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,030.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|vitalik buterin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-02 07:15:01

This $0.04 Altcoin Clears Halborn Audit Ahead of V1 Protocol Launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-cheap-crypto-to-skyrocket-this-0-04-altcoin-clears-halborn-audit-ahead-of-v1-protocol-launch/,"In crypto, investors tend to initiate the biggest moves once a project has removed the doubt, and not prior to it. Checks on security are completed. Core features lock in. There is a vision of a launching window. It is then that focus usually starts changing. This is the trend that is emerging around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto trading around $0.04 which recently passed through a significant audit arch before its V1 protocol was launched. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized loaning and borrowing protocol with two markets based on the different needs. In the peer-to-contract market, customers sell assets in liquidity pools and get the mtTokens. These mtTokens signify their place within the pool and receive APY as borrowers payment interest. To use the pool example, when a user deposits an amount of $5,000 of ETH in a pool with an interest rate of 5% of the annual percentage yield, the value of the mtTokens will rise with the interest payments received. The peer-to-peer market enables the users to take loans against collateral. Borrowers are able to buy the variable rates that will fluctuate with the demand or constant rates to make the repayment predictable. Loan-to-Value restrictions put restrictions on the amount borrowed as compared to collateral value. In case of a drop in market prices and position crosses the liquidation threshold, the liquidations take place. The liquidators recover a portion of the debt and get discounted collateral that assists in safeguarding the system. This pattern ensures stability during periods of rotation in the larger crypto assets. Participation and presale advancement indication The release of Mutuum Finance was also divided into fixed stages with set prices starting in early 2025. The project has already raised $19.5M, had 18700 holders and sold 820M of tokens. The total number of tokens of MUTM is 4B. Out of this figure, 45.5% or approximately 1.82B tokens are to go to the presale. Distribution has been steady and it has assisted in dispersion of ownership instead of being concentrated in the initial stages. The token was introduced at $0.01 and is currently valued at approximately $0.04 which represents approximately 300% MUTM appreciation. Phase 1 participants are set for 500% token growth provided that MUTM will achieve an official price in the market at $0.06. The prices of each phase and the allocation are higher and lesser respectively, which has led to high demand later in the stages to come. Mutuum Finance has also a 24-hour leaderboard where the most worthy contributor each day will earn MUTM in the amount of $500. This aspect promotes regular attendance with remaining allocations decreasing. V1 launch due and Halborn audit was completed One of the greatest updates was by the official X account of the team. The independent audit of the V1 lending and borrowing protocol of Mutuum Finance by Halborn security is completed . The completed contracts were audited and readiness to be put into deployment was checked. After the audit, the group said it was working on the release of V1 in the Sepolia testnet, which will then be followed with the mainnet release. The timing of launching will happen in the near future. Preparation of security does not end on that note. MUTM additionally scores 90/100 CertiK Token Scan and operates a bug bounty program worth $50k specifically aimed at finding possible errors in the code. In the case of a crypto accepting and issuing DeFi that is equal in terms of collateral and liquidity, such layers are important. It is the opinion of some analysts that when V1 is launched and the users have the opportunity to use the protocol the market will start to appreciate MUTM on the basis of usage as opposed to distribution phases. In quantitative situations, MUTM is expected to go over $0.06, and go on increasing with adoption, but this will also rely on the execution and the market environment. The importance of MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) might be a good choice in the watch of those interested in buying cheap cryptocurrency with upside potential as it has a combination of risks that are already mitigated. Development is advanced. The Halborn audit is done. Security checks are administered. V1 is approaching. Instead of using attention cycles, MUTM has a growth narrative of lending that is pegged to demand yield in the form of mtTokens and a buy-distribute model where MUTM buys on the open market with a fraction of protocol fees and redistributes the wealth to users who stake mtTokens on the safety module. The said combination is what is making market commentators talk more about MUTM as the next crypto to watch. Its ability to literally skyrocket or not will be a factor of execution, but passing a full audit before V1 will be a step that most projects will never see.

However, it also failed to provide any actual goals for next year, aside from some vague words, which were quickly criticized by some of its fan base. The Backlash In its yearly recap, Pi Network’s team said 2025 was a “defining” one for the project due to the Open Network and PI token launch in February. This opened the door for “Pi’s ecosystem to interact with the broader blockchain world – a milestone achieved after more than six years of building Pi’s infrastructure and community, ensuring real utility was ready at launch.” It continued by highlighting the subsequent updates, AI introductions, progress on the KYC scene, the release of the Pi App Studio, Pi Network Ventures, and so on. It also outlined several of its community-focused initiatives, such as the Q3/4 Hackathon, the ecosystem directory staking, and the .pi Domains Auction. When it came to setting 2026 goals, though, the post was rather imprecise and perhaps equivocal. It reads: “The Pi community’s efforts this year enabled the launch of Open Network and the many apps, utilities, and features that will continue to be worked on. Pi Network in 2026 will be shaped by Pi’s long-term strategies and planning, in addition to Pioneers, developers, and partners building and using the ecosystem together.” Given the lack of specifics, a significant portion of the comments below the X post turned negative. One user said that “years of hype, delays, vague timelines, and zero accountability have destroyed market confidence.” Another added , “talking to the Pi team is like someone painting in the air! Useless!” A third one claimed “nothing good comes out of the Pi ecosystem,” while OLOBO had some painful predictions for the project’s native token: “The slowest project in history. The hypes have faded. By June 2026, Pi would be trading at $0.001.” PI Misses the Rally After several days of sideways action, many altcoins have posted impressive gains today. Some of them are even placed around Pi Network’s PI in terms of market cap, such as ENA, which has rocketed by 10%. However, PI’s price action has remained muted as the asset continues to fight to stay above the $0.20 support despite some promising signs . What could be somewhat worrisome for PI’s short-term performance is the fact that more than 6 million tokens will be unlocked today, which could increase the selling pressure. After the middle of the month, the number will gradually decline to under 4 million at times, which could provide some market stability. PI Token Unlock Schedule.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/galaxy-digital-ceo-dont-fck-with-xrp-army-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) shared a video that reopened a familiar theme within crypto markets. The clip featured Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz discussing tribal behavior in digital asset communities, specifically XRP Army. Xaif paired the video with a direct message about XRP supporters, describing them as loud, loyal, liquid, and unshaken. Xaif used the clip to emphasize the positive culture within the XRP army. Hours earlier, the community had demonstrated measurable action during a brief but intense trading window. Xaif framed the community as a cohesive force within a market that is often shaped by sentiment. Galaxy CEO said it best Crypto is tribal… and don’t f*ck with the XRP Army. I know that all too well. Loud. Loyal. Liquid. They don’t shake. They don’t fold. They change the market. https://t.co/TzbEmQIL84 pic.twitter.com/S7V3B93L4M — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 31, 2025 Novogratz on Division, Trust, and Crypto Tribalism In the video, Novogratz spoke broadly about the current phase of the digital asset sector. He described crypto as being in a “golden era,” while linking market behavior to deeper social divisions. He pointed to declining trust across institutions, belief systems, and interpersonal relationships. That environment, he said, drives people toward groups with shared identity. “Crypto is very tribal,” Novogratz said. He followed that statement with a blunt warning: “Don’t fuck with the XRP army.” The remark stood out because it did not come from an XRP advocate. Novogratz has historically aligned more closely with other networks . XRP ETF Trading Activity Shows Coordinated Action Novogratz has previously commended the XRP army , and recent trading activity shows the strength of this community. On the final trading day of 2025, XRP community figure Chad Steingraber urged supporters to trade XRP-related ETFs The response arrived quickly. Within 30 minutes, Steingraber revealed that ETF trading volume reached nearly $3 million. That surge occurred without a major news catalyst. It came from coordinated action by retail participants acting on a shared directive. The activity highlighted liquidity depth rather than volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market observers noted the speed of execution. Steingraber provided updates, revealing a trading volume of $27.63 million by the end of the trading day. Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF led the pack with a volume of $8.89 million. The XRP Army’s Dedication The XRP Army has faced regulatory pressure, market cycles, and prolonged consolidation. Despite that history, the community continues to mobilize when called upon. The final trading day of 2025 reinforced that reality. Analysts have high expectations for XRP in 2026 . This activity shows that the community is stronger than before, and 2026 could be the year XRP reaches its true potential.

This comprehensive analysis examines DOGE’s potential trajectory from 2026 through 2030, incorporating technical indicators, market fundamentals, and expert perspectives to provide a balanced forecast. Dogecoin Price Prediction 2026: Foundation Year Analysis Market analysts project 2026 as a consolidation year for Dogecoin. The cryptocurrency will likely build upon its established position as a leading meme coin with practical utility. Several factors will influence DOGE’s performance during this period. Transaction volume growth remains a primary driver, particularly as more merchants adopt Dogecoin payments. Additionally, network development initiatives could enhance Dogecoin’s technical capabilities. Market sentiment toward alternative cryptocurrencies will also play a significant role. Historical data shows Dogecoin often follows broader market trends while maintaining unique volatility characteristics. Technical analysis suggests key resistance levels between $0.35 and $0.45 could define 2026’s trading range. However, external factors like regulatory developments may introduce unexpected variables. The Dogecoin community’s continued engagement provides fundamental support. Meanwhile, institutional adoption trends will offer crucial momentum indicators. Consequently, 2026 may establish the foundation for Dogecoin’s longer-term price trajectory. Technical Indicators and Market Psychology Technical analysis reveals important patterns for Dogecoin’s medium-term outlook. The 200-week moving average has historically provided strong support during market corrections. Furthermore, trading volume patterns indicate increasing institutional interest. Market psychology surrounding meme coins continues evolving as well. Investors now evaluate Dogecoin based on both community strength and technological merit. This dual assessment creates more stable valuation metrics. Historical volatility data shows decreasing price swings percentage-wise as market capitalization grows. Network activity metrics provide additional insights into genuine usage versus speculative trading. The hash rate stability indicates consistent mining participation. These technical factors combine to create a more mature asset profile. Therefore, predictions for 2026 reflect this developing market maturity. Dogecoin 2027 Forecast: Critical Inflection Point The year 2027 represents a potential inflection point for Dogecoin’s valuation. Market cycles historically suggest this period could align with broader cryptocurrency momentum. Several developments could accelerate DOGE’s price appreciation during this timeframe. First, technological upgrades might enhance transaction efficiency and reduce costs. Second, partnership announcements with major companies could increase real-world utility. Third, regulatory clarity in key markets may reduce uncertainty premiums. Fourth, broader cryptocurrency adoption could create rising tides lifting all legitimate projects. Fifth, Dogecoin’s inflationary supply model becomes less impactful as the emission rate decreases over time. These factors collectively suggest 2027 could see Dogecoin testing higher resistance levels. However, competition from other cryptocurrencies presents ongoing challenges. Market share dynamics within the payment-focused cryptocurrency segment will prove particularly important. Consequently, 2027 forecasts remain cautiously optimistic with recognition of competitive pressures. Dogecoin Price Projection Scenarios 2026-2027 Scenario 2026 Target 2027 Target Key Drivers Conservative $0.28-$0.38 $0.35-$0.52 Moderate adoption, stable markets Moderate $0.32-$0.45 $0.42-$0.65 Strong community growth, tech upgrades Optimistic $0.38-$0.55 $0.55-$0.85 Major partnerships, regulatory clarity DOGE 2028-2030 Long-Term Outlook The 2028-2030 period presents Dogecoin’s most significant opportunity for reaching the psychologically important $1 threshold. Long-term analysis considers both macroeconomic factors and cryptocurrency-specific developments. Global cryptocurrency adoption rates continue accelerating according to multiple research firms. This broader trend benefits established cryptocurrencies with strong brand recognition like Dogecoin. Additionally, technological convergence between blockchain networks may create new utility opportunities. The potential integration of smart contract capabilities could expand Dogecoin’s use cases significantly. Market capitalization requirements for reaching $1 per DOGE remain substantial but achievable given sufficient time horizon. Critical factors influencing this long-term outlook include: Adoption Metrics: Merchant acceptance and transaction volume growth Technical Development: Network upgrades and feature enhancements Market Position: Competitive standing within cryptocurrency ecosystem Regulatory Environment: Global cryptocurrency policy frameworks Macroeconomic Conditions: Inflation, interest rates, and risk appetite Historical precedent from other cryptocurrencies suggests that sustained community development combined with technological progress creates the strongest foundation for long-term appreciation. Dogecoin’s unique position as both a cultural phenomenon and functional cryptocurrency provides dual engines for growth. However, achieving the $1 milestone requires coordinated progress across multiple dimensions rather than speculative momentum alone. Expert Perspectives on $1 Valuation Financial analysts offer diverse viewpoints on Dogecoin’s path to $1. Some emphasize the importance of cryptocurrency market cycles, noting that DOGE has historically performed strongly during bull markets. Others highlight fundamental metrics like active address growth and transaction economics. Several analysts reference Bitcoin’s historical trajectory as a potential roadmap, though with important distinctions regarding supply dynamics and use cases. University researchers studying cryptocurrency markets note that meme coins face particular challenges in sustaining long-term value. However, they acknowledge Dogecoin’s exceptional community support as a differentiating factor. Industry experts from blockchain development firms emphasize that technical improvements could substantially enhance Dogecoin’s utility proposition. These professional perspectives collectively suggest that reaching $1 represents a challenging but plausible scenario given appropriate market conditions and development progress. Comparative Analysis with Historical Performance Dogecoin’s historical performance provides valuable context for future predictions. The cryptocurrency demonstrated remarkable growth during previous market cycles, though with significant volatility. Key historical milestones include the 2017-2018 rally and the 2020-2021 surge. These periods shared common characteristics including heightened retail interest and celebrity endorsements. However, current market conditions differ substantially in terms of institutional participation and regulatory frameworks. The increasing maturity of cryptocurrency markets suggests potentially different dynamics for future price movements. Comparative analysis with other major cryptocurrencies reveals Dogecoin’s unique position bridging meme culture and practical utility. This dual identity creates both opportunities and challenges for sustained appreciation. Historical volatility patterns indicate decreasing percentage swings as market capitalization increases, suggesting potentially smoother future trajectories. These historical insights inform more nuanced predictions for the 2026-2030 period. Conclusion Dogecoin’s path to $1 by 2030 represents a complex interplay of technological development, market adoption, and broader cryptocurrency trends. Our Dogecoin price prediction analysis suggests gradual appreciation through 2026-2027 followed by accelerated potential in 2028-2030. Reaching the psychologically significant $1 threshold requires sustained progress across multiple dimensions rather than speculative spikes alone. Market conditions, regulatory developments, and technological enhancements will collectively determine whether DOGE achieves this milestone. Investors should monitor fundamental metrics including transaction volume, active addresses, and development activity alongside price movements. The Dogecoin price prediction landscape remains dynamic, requiring continuous reassessment as new information emerges across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic Dogecoin price prediction for 2026? Most analysts project Dogecoin trading between $0.28 and $0.55 in 2026, depending on market conditions and adoption rates. The moderate scenario suggests a range of $0.32-$0.45 based on current growth trajectories. Q2: Can Dogecoin realistically reach $1 by 2030? Yes, Dogecoin reaching $1 by 2030 represents a plausible scenario given sufficient market capitalization growth, technological development, and broader cryptocurrency adoption. However, this outcome depends on multiple favorable factors aligning over the coming years. Q3: What are the main factors affecting Dogecoin’s future price? Key factors include cryptocurrency market cycles, Dogecoin adoption rates, technological upgrades, regulatory developments, competitive positioning, and broader macroeconomic conditions affecting risk assets. Q4: How does Dogecoin’s inflationary supply affect long-term price predictions? Dogecoin’s fixed annual inflation rate of approximately 5 billion coins becomes less impactful over time as the percentage increase to total supply decreases. This contrasts with deflationary cryptocurrencies but provides predictable mining incentives. Q5: What differentiates Dogecoin from other meme coins in long-term potential? Dogecoin benefits from first-mover advantage, stronger brand recognition, more established infrastructure, larger active community, and greater merchant acceptance compared to newer meme coins, providing more substantial foundation for long-term development.

According to web activity monitoring social account Dark Web Informer, a read-only version of Kraken’s internal support panel is on the market, being sold for as little as $1, and is supposedly negotiable. A snapshot of the dark web forum shows user “ransomcharger” telling their associates that the access would allow the viewing of user profiles and transaction histories, and could generate customer support tickets to phish customers or extract private information. Kraken support access could expose customer info for 2 months According to the listing, the access is reportedly not restricted by IP address, proxied through Kraken’s own systems. It can retrieve full know-your-customer (KYC) documents, including identification cards, selfies, proof of address, and declared sources of funds. The access is reportedly valid for at least one to two months before rotation, with time-based authentication codes expiring in February. However, Cryptopolitan has not found any other independent confirmation or evidence supporting the allegation, and Kraken’s support team has not acknowledged any compromise of its internal systems. In mid-2025, Cryptopolitan had reported that Kraken and Binance were targeted by the same social engineering campaign that resulted in a successful customer data breach at Coinbase. According to people familiar with the matter, attackers contacted customer support agents at the exchanges and enticed them with bribes in exchange for user data. Coinbase executive Brian Armstrong issued a statement saying several overseas customer service representatives accepted the bribes and provided information that included customer names, addresses, partial KYC records, and account balances. The attackers later attempted to extort Coinbase, demanding a $20 million ransom in exchange for deleting the stolen data, according to people familiar with the investigation. Coinbase declined to pay the ransom and instead notified law enforcement authorities. The breach exposed Coinbase to potential losses estimated at up to $400 million. However, for Kraken and Binance, the social engineering attempt was thwarted through layered access restrictions and real-time monitoring of support interactions. Binance has said it uses artificial intelligence systems to monitor conversations between customer support agents and users in several languages. Those systems can flag suspicious behavior like potential bribery attempts, and automatically terminate communications when risks are detected. Kraken has said it employs internal safeguards that limit unnecessary access to customer information and monitor anomalous activity within its systems. “Behind the scenes, there also is AI, machine learning, some other analytics that are going on behind the scenes that are transparent to the user to say, is everything looking the way it should? There are times when our teams will be able to jump in front and stop those types of attacks. There’s controls that you as a user have at your disposal, and then there’s controls that you don’t have to do anything, but it’s based on your behavior, based on activity, we have the ability to intervene and what we call save.” Chief Security Officer Nick Percoco. Coinbase helps law enforcement arrest service agent in India Just last week, Coinbase CEO Armstrong revealed to the public that a former customer service agent for the exchange was arrested in India, months after the support representative gave hackers access to customer data. A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed the arrest and said it came on the heels of a coordinative effort with law enforcement agencies from several jurisdictions, helping the security groups identify and prosecute those involved. The Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office also announced charges against a Brooklyn man accused of orchestrating “a long-running impersonation scheme” on Coinbase customers in the US. According to the indictment, the defendant posed as a Coinbase representative and used social engineering to convince victims that their accounts were at immediate risk. The Department of Justice mentioned that he directed victims to transfer funds to wallets under his control and took away nearly $16 million from approximately 100 victims. However, more than $600,000 has been recovered so far.

CRYPTOWZRD also outlined the daily candle closing higher, but wasn’t convinced entirely about the asset’s future price performance. The analyst noted that the market needs to “see healthier movement from here and a better chart structure.” For now, XRP just remains within a small range-bound area without a clear breakout sign. It’s worth noting that despite the mid-year price surge to a new all-time high, Ripple’s native token ended 2025 in the red.

Data from analytics firm SoSoValue reveals a net outflow of $4.57 billion over November and December 2025, coinciding with a sharp 20% decline in Bitcoin’s market value. This unprecedented movement signals a potential recalibration of institutional and retail investor sentiment toward flagship digital assets. Bitcoin ETF Outflow Reaches Historic Levels Analysts confirm the $4.57 billion exit from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs marks the largest two-month withdrawal since these funds launched in January 2024. Consequently, this substantial capital movement directly correlates with Bitcoin’s price dropping approximately one-fifth during the same period. Market observers note the outflows began accelerating in mid-November, following a period of relative stability earlier in the year. Furthermore, this trend represents a dramatic reversal from the consistent net inflows that characterized most of 2024 and early 2025. The following table illustrates the comparative fund flows for major cryptocurrency ETFs during the November-December 2025 period: ETF Type Net Flow (Nov-Dec 2025) Primary Trend Bitcoin Spot ETF -$4.57 Billion Record Outflow Ethereum Spot ETF -$2+ Billion Significant Outflow XRP ETF +$1+ Billion Notable Inflow Solana ETF +$500+ Million Moderate Inflow Several key factors potentially drive this capital rotation. First, macroeconomic pressures, including shifting interest rate expectations, often impact high-risk asset classes. Second, profit-taking after Bitcoin’s strong performance in Q3 2025 likely contributed. Third, increased regulatory scrutiny on large asset managers may have prompted portfolio rebalancing. Finally, the growing maturity of the crypto ETF market allows investors to diversify into newer fund offerings. Broader Cryptocurrency ETF Market Dynamics While Bitcoin and Ethereum funds experienced heavy selling pressure, other digital asset ETFs attracted substantial capital. Notably, spot XRP ETFs gathered over $1 billion in net inflows during the same two-month window. Similarly, Solana-focused ETFs pulled in more than $500 million. This divergence highlights a evolving market narrative where investors seek opportunities beyond the two largest cryptocurrencies. Market data suggests a strategic rotation into assets perceived to have stronger regulatory clarity or different technological value propositions. The contrasting flows reveal critical insights about current investor psychology. Investors appear to be reallocating capital based on specific catalysts rather than abandoning the digital asset class entirely. For instance, recent favorable legal developments for XRP likely boosted its ETF appeal. Conversely, Solana’s continued network resilience and developer growth may have attracted confidence. This selective movement underscores the increasing sophistication of ETF-based cryptocurrency investing, where fund choices reflect nuanced market theses. Expert Analysis on Market Implications Financial analysts emphasize the importance of context when interpreting these record outflows. “While the headline number is striking, it’s essential to view this within the lifecycle of these investment products,” states a report from CoinDesk, citing industry experts. The total assets under management (AUM) for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs still measure in the tens of billions, suggesting a deep and liquid market. Historically, ETF flows often exhibit cyclical patterns, with periods of outflow frequently preceding consolidation and subsequent inflows. The price correlation between ETF flows and Bitcoin’s spot market is a primary focus for researchers. The nearly 20% price drop alongside the outflows demonstrates the significant price impact these regulated products now wield. This relationship was less pronounced in the years before ETF approval, when market dynamics were driven more by decentralized exchanges and over-the-counter desks. The current environment shows a tighter coupling between traditional finance gateways and core crypto market volatility. Historical Context and Regulatory Landscape The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 followed a decade-long regulatory journey. Their approval represented a landmark moment for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Initially, these funds saw massive inflows, absorbing billions from both institutional and retail investors. The record outflow in late 2025, therefore, represents a critical stress test for the market infrastructure built over the preceding two years. Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) monitor these flows closely, as large, rapid movements can raise concerns about market stability and investor protection. Key developments in 2025 that set the stage for these flows include: Macroeconomic Policy Shifts: Changing central bank policies influenced risk appetite globally. Tax-Loss Harvesting: Year-end portfolio adjustments by U.S. investors likely amplified selling pressure. Product Proliferation: The introduction of ETFs for XRP, Solana, and other altcoins provided exit options for Bitcoin holdings. Technical Market Indicators: Bitcoin reaching certain resistance levels may have triggered automated selling strategies within fund structures. This period also tested the operational resilience of authorized participants and market makers who facilitate the creation and redemption of ETF shares. Their ability to manage over $4.5 billion in net redemptions without major operational hiccups is itself a sign of market maturation. The process involves converting ETF shares back into the underlying Bitcoin, which is then typically sold on the open market, applying downward price pressure. Conclusion The record $4.57 billion Bitcoin ETF outflow in late 2025 serves as a pivotal chapter in the integration of digital assets into regulated finance. While highlighting short-term bearish sentiment and a correlated price decline, the event also demonstrates the market’s capacity to handle significant capital movement. The simultaneous inflows into other cryptocurrency ETFs suggest a rotation, not a retreat, within the asset class. Moving forward, market participants will watch closely to see if this Bitcoin ETF outflow marks a temporary correction or the beginning of a longer-term trend, as the ecosystem continues to evolve under the watchful eye of investors and regulators alike. FAQs Q1: What caused the record Bitcoin ETF outflow in late 2025? The outflow likely resulted from a combination of factors: macroeconomic pressures prompting a shift away from risk assets, profit-taking by investors after prior gains, year-end tax considerations, and the availability of new alternative cryptocurrency ETFs for diversification. Q2: How did the Bitcoin ETF outflow affect BTC’s price? The net outflow of $4.57 billion coincided with a roughly 20% drop in Bitcoin’s price over the same two-month period. The selling pressure from ETF share redemptions, which requires selling the underlying Bitcoin, contributed significantly to this downward price movement. Q3: Did all cryptocurrency ETFs experience outflows during this period? No. While U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw significant outflows, spot XRP ETFs attracted over $1 billion in net inflows, and Solana ETFs pulled in more than $500 million, indicating a capital rotation within the crypto sector. Q4: Are record ETF outflows a sign of failing crypto ETFs? Not necessarily. Large outflows are a normal function of mature, liquid financial markets and represent changing investor allocations. The ability of the market infrastructure to process such a large movement without failure demonstrates operational resilience. Q5: Where does the money go when it leaves a Bitcoin ETF? When investors sell ETF shares, the fund’s authorized participants redeem those shares for the underlying Bitcoin. That Bitcoin is typically sold on the open market. The cash proceeds then return to the investor, who may hold it, reinvest in other assets like XRP or Solana ETFs, or move it into traditional investments.

56723480,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257963,1767343210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,RIVER Cryptocurrency Soars: Stunning Rally to $15 All-Time High Signals Potential Altcoin Revival,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/river-cryptocurrency-all-time-high/,"BitcoinWorld RIVER Cryptocurrency Soars: Stunning Rally to $15 All-Time High Signals Potential Altcoin Revival In a remarkable display of market momentum, the RIVER cryptocurrency briefly surged past the $15 threshold on Tuesday morning, establishing a definitive new all-time high and injecting fresh volatility into the digital asset landscape. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World, this peak represents an extraordinary 852% appreciation from its recent low of $1.61 recorded just a fortnight ago. Consequently, this price action has captured significant attention from traders and analysts, who are now scrutinizing whether RIVER’s volume-backed advance could herald a broader recovery for alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, in 2025. RIVER Cryptocurrency’s Meteoric Price Trajectory The ascent of RIVER to its unprecedented $15 valuation did not occur in isolation. Market data reveals a consistent upward trend over the preceding seven days, culminating in this morning’s explosive breakout. Specifically, the token demonstrated a 452% climb from its weekly low, showcasing sustained buying pressure. Following the brief touch above $15, however, the asset experienced a predictable retracement, a common phenomenon after such rapid gains. As of this report, RIVER consolidates around the $12 mark, still reflecting a substantial 26% gain on the daily chart. This price discovery phase is critical, as it tests new support levels and investor conviction. Several technical and fundamental factors typically converge to enable such rallies. First, a significant increase in network activity or a major protocol upgrade can drive demand. Second, strategic exchange listings often enhance liquidity and accessibility. Finally, broader market sentiment plays a pivotal role; even a slight shift towards risk-on behavior can disproportionately benefit smaller-cap assets. Analysts closely monitor trading volume as a key health metric, and in RIVER’s case, the figures are undeniably robust. Unprecedented Trading Volume and Market Impact The scale of trading activity surrounding RIVER provides compelling context for its price movement. Data aggregated by CoinGecko indicates that the token’s 24-hour futures trading volume approached a staggering $2.6 billion. Notably, the Binance exchange accounted for approximately $1.4 billion of this total, positioning RIVER’s futures volume in third place globally, trailing only the behemoths Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This level of volume signifies deep market participation and suggests the move is supported by substantial capital flows rather than mere speculation. Volume Significance: High trading volume validates price movements, indicating genuine interest and reducing the likelihood of a manipulation-driven pump. Exchange Dominance: Concentration on a major platform like Binance provides liquidity but also concentrates risk; a single exchange’s policy change can impact price. Market Rank: To rank above thousands of other tokens in volume is a rare feat, often reserved for assets with strong community or institutional backing. For comparison, the table below illustrates RIVER’s volume standing relative to other top assets during the same 24-hour window, based on typical market structure: Asset Approx. 24h Futures Volume Primary Exchange Bitcoin (BTC) $45.2 Billion Binance, Coinbase Ethereum (ETH) $18.7 Billion Binance, Bybit RIVER $2.6 Billion Binance Solana (SOL) $2.1 Billion Binance, OKX Expert Analysis on Altcoin Market Dynamics The RIVER development team has publicly expressed optimism that its token’s performance could act as a catalyst for a wider altcoin market recovery this year. This perspective emerges while a significant portion of the crypto market, excluding major leaders, experiences sideways or declining price action. Historically, altcoin seasons often commence with a standout performer attracting capital into the sector. Market analysts note that for a sustainable altcoin revival, several conditions must be met: increased on-chain activity across various blockchains, a stable or rising Bitcoin dominance ratio that later rotates, and sustained inflows into crypto investment products beyond just BTC and ETH. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions remains a paramount factor for institutional adoption of altcoins. The current trading environment in 2025 continues to be shaped by evolving policy frameworks. Assets that demonstrate clear utility, robust governance, and transparent operations are increasingly favored. Therefore, RIVER’s ability to maintain its momentum may depend not just on market sentiment, but also on the fundamental value proposition of its underlying protocol and its adherence to compliance standards. The Road Ahead: Sustainability and Market Psychology After establishing a new all-time high, the immediate focus shifts to sustainability. Sharp rallies often invite profit-taking, as evidenced by the pullback to $12. The key for RIVER will be to establish a higher support base than its previous cycles. Market technicians will watch for consolidation patterns, such as flags or pennants, which can indicate a continuation of the trend if accompanied by healthy volume. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) and other momentum oscillators provide clues about whether the asset is overbought in the short term. From a behavioral finance perspective, a successful breakout like this can create a powerful network effect. It attracts media coverage, which in turn draws the attention of retail and institutional investors who may have previously overlooked the asset. This cycle can fuel further demand, but it also raises volatility. Long-term holders now face decisions about portfolio rebalancing, while new entrants gauge the risk of buying at a perceived local top. The psychology of support and resistance levels becomes self-reinforcing, making the $15 level a critical benchmark for future price discovery attempts. Conclusion The RIVER cryptocurrency’s journey to a new all-time high above $15 marks a significant event in the 2025 digital asset market. Driven by colossal trading volume and occurring against a backdrop of general altcoin stagnation, this rally presents a compelling case study in market dynamics. While the token has retraced some gains, its substantial weekly and bi-weekly percentage increases underscore a powerful bullish impulse. Ultimately, whether RIVER can lead a broader altcoin recovery will depend on sustained fundamental development, continued high liquidity, and a favorable shift in overall market risk appetite. Observers will now monitor if this is a isolated event or the precursor to a wider rotation of capital within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What caused RIVER’s price to surge to a new all-time high? The surge resulted from a combination of factors, including sustained buying pressure over the past week, exceptionally high trading volume (particularly on Binance), and likely positive developments or sentiment around its underlying protocol. Market dynamics often see capital flow into assets showing momentum. Q2: How does RIVER’s trading volume compare to major cryptocurrencies? According to CoinGecko data, RIVER’s 24-hour futures trading volume of approximately $2.6 billion ranked it third globally, behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. This indicates an unusually high level of interest and liquidity for a non-top-two asset. Q3: What does an “all-time high” mean for a cryptocurrency? An all-time high (ATH) is the highest price point an asset has ever achieved since its inception. Breaking an ATH is psychologically significant, as it means every historical holder is at a profit, and it removes previous price resistance levels, potentially opening the door for further gains. Q4: Could RIVER’s rally signal the start of an ‘altcoin season’? While one asset’s performance alone does not define a market-wide season, historically, strong breakouts in select altcoins have sometimes preceded capital rotation into the broader sector. The RIVER team has expressed this hope, but a sustained altcoin season requires broader factors like increased total value locked (TVL) in DeFi and positive Bitcoin market structure. Q5: What typically happens after a cryptocurrency hits a new all-time high? After an ATH, price action often enters a volatile phase. Some investors take profits, causing a pullback. The asset then attempts to establish new support levels. The subsequent price movement—consolidation, continuation upward, or a deeper correction—depends on ongoing demand, market sentiment, and fundamental news.

Arnold opened with the claim that crypto sits at the center of “two mega trends”: digital assets and the tokenization of financial assets and argued the combination of macro policy, US legislation, and SEC posture could drive “trillions of dollars” of new inflows. The 3 Bullisch Crypto Catalysts First, Arnold pointed to what he described as a monetary-policy regime shift, including the resumption of “reserve management purchases,” and framed it as supportive for risk assets broadly. “We’re starting to see significant stimulus,” he said, adding that markets were already seeing “quantitative easing light” as “the Fed is starting to buy its own bonds,” while suggesting demand for government debt could fall alongside lower rates. Related Reading: Scaramucci Picks His Top 3 Crypto Altcoins As Rate-Cut Tailwinds Build Second, he argued crypto-specific regulation could function like a green light for institutional capital. He singled out the market structure focused Clarity Act, saying its passage would be “like a starter gun for ETH and SOL to run into trillions of dollars of value,” and noted discussion of a US Senate markup date of Jan. 15 with hopes of movement by late January or February. Third, Arnold highlighted what he called a tokenization push led by SEC chair Paul Atkins, describing “Project Crypto” as an effort to “bring all of traditional finance on the blockchain.” He paired that theme with a distribution angle around spot crypto ETFs, leaning on a quote he cited about how unusual the early ETF growth was: “These were the single best-selling product in the world and no one was allowed to make a phone call to sell it or advertise it,” he said. Top 6 Crypto Altcoins To Invest In For 2026 Arnold’s first pick is Ethereum. He frames it as the primary beneficiary of stablecoin growth and added that stablecoins are “mostly on the Ethereum blockchain,” and tied the thesis to regulation via the Genius Act, citing a view that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expects the sector to grow “10x in the next few years.” Arnold also said Ethereum’s stablecoin share rose to 53% from the high-40s “just a few months” earlier, and argued the link to ETH value accrual runs through fees: “30% of all fees on Ethereum are actually stablecoin revenue,” he said. “So as this is 10x’es the amount of fees, the amount of Ethereum being burned should be 10x to match.” Arnold’s second pick was Solana, which he portrayed as a usage leader relative to its market value versus Ethereum. He argued Solana is “already one of or if not the most used chain in crypto,” and claimed that through 2025 it was “more used than the entire rest of the industry combined times 2 to three.” He also cited a real-world asset milestone, saying Solana “RWA holders…have surpassed 125,000 holders.” Cardano is next, which Arnold said had a weak 2025 but could benefit from founder Charles Hoskinson’s push around Midnight. Arnold played a longer excerpt in which Hoskinson argued privacy could be the wedge that changes user behavior: “They can go through Midnight to Cardano and they get privacy. They do something new and different,” Hoskinson said. “Midnight my view will be through hybrid applications… private prediction markets, private DEXes, private stable coins… maybe… those Bitcoin people are going to want to trade on a private DEX instead of a public DEX.” Related Reading: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash Arnold then shifted to AI infrastructure with Bittensor (TAO), calling it “decentralized AI” plumbing and noting it had a recent “halving” and a fixed supply model he compared to Bitcoin’s. He also pointed to early-2026 ETF momentum, saying Grayscale filed an S-1 for a TAO product and Bitwise followed with a Bittensor ETF filing. For tokenization exposure, Arnold highlighted Ondo Finance (ONDO) ahead of what he described as an Ondo Summit on Feb. 3, where “world leaders, investors, policy makers” would reconvene, and closed his list with Propy, a real-estate-focused project he said is “US licensed” for title and escrow closing and “backed by Coinbase,” positioning it as a bet on bringing home buying and selling “on-chain.” Arnold closed his list with Propy, explicitly flagging it as the most speculative end of the spectrum and pairing it with a warning that lower-cap exposure can mean “these altcoins go to zero.” The Altcoin Daily host described it as “essentially real estate on-chain.” He emphasized operational and regulatory positioning as part of the pitch, saying Propy is “US licensed title and escrow closing,” and also highlighted its backers: “They’re backed again by Coinbase.” The investment thesis, as Arnold presented it, is straightforward tokenization logic applied to housing: bringing parts of the buying and selling process onto rails that can be settled and recorded on-chain, with Propy positioned as a project already operating within the US compliance perimeter he expects to matter more in 2026. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.98 trillion.

56723886,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257966,1767344111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Upbit’s Crucial Pause: QTUM and QI Deposits Halted for Quantum Network’s Vital Hard Fork,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-qtum-qi-hard-fork-suspension/,"BitcoinWorld Upbit’s Crucial Pause: QTUM and QI Deposits Halted for Quantum Network’s Vital Hard Fork SEOUL, South Korea – January 10, 2025 – In a significant operational move, the prominent South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has announced a temporary suspension of deposit and withdrawal services for assets on the Quantum blockchain network. This crucial pause, affecting QTUM and QI tokens, directly supports an upcoming network hard fork scheduled for January 11, 2025. Consequently, the exchange will halt these services starting at 9:00 a.m. UTC to ensure a secure and stable transition for all user assets. Understanding Upbit’s QTUM and QI Service Suspension Upbit’s decision represents a standard yet critical protocol for major cryptocurrency exchanges during blockchain network upgrades. The temporary suspension for QTUM and QI deposits and withdrawals begins precisely at 09:00 UTC on January 11. Trading for these assets, however, will continue uninterrupted on Upbit’s spot markets. This approach allows users to trade while the exchange’s internal systems synchronize with the new, forked Quantum blockchain. The suspension period will persist until the exchange team confirms the network’s stability post-upgrade. Typically, such maintenance windows last several hours but can extend based on technical complexities. This proactive measure protects users from potential transaction losses or errors that could occur if funds moved during the chain split. Major global exchanges like Binance and Coinbase implement identical protocols for network upgrades. The Quantum network’s developer team likely coordinated this timeline with key exchange partners months in advance. Network hard forks are essential for implementing new features, security patches, or consensus changes. Therefore, temporary service halts are a necessary industry norm to safeguard billions in user funds. The Technical Imperative Behind the Quantum Network Hard Fork A hard fork is a permanent divergence in a blockchain’s protocol, creating two separate chains. The Quantum network’s upcoming upgrade necessitates this split to implement new technical specifications. Exchanges must pause external transactions to prevent replay attacks and ensure all user balances correctly map to the new chain. Upbit’s technical team will meticulously monitor the fork process. They will validate block production and consensus stability on the new chain before reopening services. For context, the Quantum (QTUM) blockchain merges Bitcoin’s security model with Ethereum’s smart contract flexibility. Its native token, QTUM, fuels the network. QI is likely a prominent token issued on the Quantum blockchain. Hard forks on such hybrid networks require careful handling due to their complex architectures. The table below outlines key aspects of this operational event: Aspect Detail Exchange Upbit (South Korea) Affected Assets QTUM, QI Action Deposit/Withdrawal Suspension Start Time Jan 11, 2025, 09:00 UTC Network Quantum (QTUM) Event Type Planned Network Hard Fork Historically, well-executed hard forks like Ethereum’s London upgrade or Bitcoin Cash’s splits followed similar exchange protocols. Successful upgrades often lead to enhanced network performance and security. Conversely, poorly managed forks can cause chain instability and asset value volatility. Upbit’s clear communication aims to mitigate uncertainty for its substantial user base. Expert Analysis on Exchange Protocol During Forks Blockchain infrastructure experts consistently emphasize the necessity of exchange suspensions during forks. “Exchanges act as custodians for millions of users,” explains a veteran blockchain engineer from a leading Web3 foundation. “Pausing deposits and withdrawals is non-negotiable for security. It allows their nodes to cleanly upgrade and reconcile the new ledger without conflicting transactions.” This process involves several technical steps: Node Upgrades: Upbit’s servers running Quantum nodes update to the new software version. Chain Monitoring: Engineers monitor for consistent block production on the new chain. Balance Snapshot Verification: Pre-fork user balances are verified against the new chain’s genesis state. Security Audits: The new chain is checked for vulnerabilities before reopening gates. Furthermore, the timing at 09:00 UTC strategically targets lower global trading volume periods. This minimizes market disruption for QTUM and QI holders. Users typically receive clear instructions from exchanges via official blogs and social media channels. Upbit’s announcement follows this established best practice, providing users with ample notice to plan their transactions. Potential Market Impact and User Guidance While trading continues, the deposit/withdrawal freeze can create temporary liquidity imbalances. Typically, the price of the affected assets may experience slight volatility due to reduced arbitrage opportunities. However, planned forks like this one usually have minimal long-term price impact. Users should follow these practical steps: Complete Transactions Early: Initiate any QTUM or QI deposits or withdrawals well before the 09:00 UTC deadline. Monitor Official Channels: Watch Upbit’s announcement page for the service resumption notice. Verify Receiving Networks: When services resume, ensure you send funds to addresses compatible with the new, forked chain. Beware of Scams: Ignore messages claiming you must “claim” new tokens or provide private keys. Notably, this event highlights the mature operational framework of major exchanges like Upbit. By prioritizing security over convenience, they protect the ecosystem. Similar suspensions have occurred for Ethereum’s Merge and Cardano’s Vasil upgrade. Each instance reinforced the importance of meticulous change management in decentralized finance. Conclusion Upbit’s temporary suspension of QTUM and QI deposits and withdrawals for the Quantum network hard fork is a standard, security-first procedure. This planned maintenance, beginning January 11, 2025, at 09:00 UTC, ensures user assets remain safe during a significant blockchain upgrade. The move reflects the exchange’s commitment to operational excellence and aligns with global best practices. Consequently, users can expect a secure transition, with normal service resuming once the upgraded Quantum network demonstrates stability. This event underscores the ongoing evolution and professionalization of cryptocurrency infrastructure. FAQs Q1: Can I still trade QTUM and QI on Upbit during the suspension? A1: Yes, trading for QTUM and QI on Upbit’s spot markets will continue without interruption. Only the deposit and withdrawal functions for these specific assets will be temporarily suspended. Q2: How long will the QTUM and QI deposit/withdrawal suspension last? A2: Upbit has not specified an exact end time. The suspension will last until the exchange completes its integration with the new, forked Quantum blockchain and confirms network stability. This typically takes several hours, but users should monitor Upbit’s official announcements for the resumption notice. Q3: Will I receive new forked tokens from this Quantum network upgrade? A3: This depends entirely on the nature of the hard fork. If the fork results in a new, separate chain with a new token, Upbit will evaluate supporting it based on factors like security and liquidity. The exchange will make a separate announcement regarding any potential token distribution after the fork is complete. Q4: Is my QTUM and QI balance safe on Upbit during this process? A4: Yes. The suspension is a protective measure. Upbit takes a snapshot of user balances before the fork. Your holdings will be accurately reflected on the new chain once services resume. The process is designed specifically to keep funds safe. Q5: What should I do if I have a pending QTUM transaction when the suspension starts? A5: Complete all deposits and withdrawals well before the 09:00 UTC deadline on January 11. If a transaction is not fully confirmed on the blockchain by the cutoff time, it may be delayed until after services resume. Check the transaction status on a Quantum block explorer for confirmation.

The Nasdaq-listed exchange’s CEO shared the roadmap in a post on X Friday, mentioning several prongs, including global expansion, improving payments infrastructure, and supporting the developer base onchain. “We’re making major investments in product quality and automation underlying each of these as well. Goal is to make Coinbase the #1 financial app in the world,” the CEO wrote. Coinbase sets sights on building an ‘everything exchange’ Brian Armstrong told the crypto community that the company’s primary objective for 2026 is to grow into an “everything exchange.” The app will integrate several financial services within a single application, including cryptocurrencies, equities, prediction markets, and commodities. According to the company executive, these products would be available on spot markets, futures, and options, taking Coinbase’s business model beyond being a crypto-only exchange. The announcement did not include a timeline or jurisdiction-specific plans. However, Coinbase has repeatedly said that regulatory clarity in the United States and other markets will determine how quickly it can add non-crypto asset classes. Armstrong also mentioned the exchange is looking to bring more users “onchain” through the company’s developer network, the Base layer-2 blockchain, and the Base application, which he deemed a “consumer-facing gateway to onchain activity.” The company believes Base can support the creation of decentralized applications, social features, and creator-focused tools like Ethereum. Coinbase bashed over ‘ignoring’ support and privacy issues The roadmap announcement was received with heavy criticism from Crypto Twitter, who cited how Coinbase’s customer support practices have been a thorn in the community. Several accounts on X blasted the company for supposedly “outsourcing” support services, against the backdrop of last year’s data breach. Here are our top priorities for 2026 at Coinbase: 1) Grow the everything exchange globally (crypto, equities, prediction markets, commodities – across spot, futures, and options) 2) Scale stablecoins and payments 3) Bring the world onchain through @CoinbaseDev , @base chain,… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 1, 2026 Cryptopolitan had reported that several of Coinbase’s offshore support employees accepted bribes to share customer’s information. This resulted in losses of approximately $400 million. “Any plans to onshore customer support to safeguard customers’ privacy and prevent the data breaches that have happened in the past?” one X user asked, prompting a response from another who accused the company of cutting costs by employing offshore workers over user protection. “Of course not, that would affect their bottom line. Why hire reputable and trustworthy American workers when they can undercut employees by outsourcing the work through foreign labor?” the reply said. “Brian doesn’t care about his customer base or customer privacy. He has to appease his investors with the stock price. Numbers on a chart above all.” Part of those calling for immediate improvements to customer support said it is the biggest barrier to trust and growth, while others asked Armstrong and his team not to limit the Base app to creator and content coins. “Get rid of scams in the Base app. Having to constantly look up coin addresses and worry about scams is too much friction if you’re serious about onboarding the world onchain,” a critic commented. The “super app” approach was also questioned, as netizens pondered over if consumers in North America and Europe want a single app that does everything. According to one community member, super apps may be popular in parts of Asia, but there are few clear examples of them succeeding in Western markets. Creator economy ideas not necessarily good, community argues Jesse Pollak, a Base developer and internet personality, sought for feedback on how the app could be better on Thursday. An X user who goes by the name “isthinking” suggested adding creator revenue streams directly to Base profiles. “If base can serve as the literal base of creator payouts of all digital means, Shopify is a first step, then once liquid is in apps, make people money without needing to trade/speculate,” they explained . Isthinking suggested that music streams, entertainment royalties, and e-commerce income could all go into onchain identities. Creators could then get instant cash from fees without having to sell tokens. They said that most content creators stay away from crypto tech because they are afraid of hurting their reputation and losing money, which Jesse Pollak agreed with by sending a “salute” emoji.

Bitcoin ended 2025 lower than where it began and is trading near $88,500. Meanwhile, data from Polymarket shows restrained upside expectations for BTC, with traders assigning just a 21% probability of Bitcoin reaching $150,000 before 2027. Bitcoin Bear Market Signals Grow Bitcoin may already be several weeks into a new bear market phase, according to on-chain and technical indicators tracked by CryptoQuant. During a recent episode of the Milk Road show, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno explained that the majority of metrics used in the firm’s bull score index turned bearish in early November and have not yet shown signs of recovery. The bull score index ranges from 0 to 100, and aggregates several indicators including network activity, investor profitability, Bitcoin demand, and market liquidity. According to Moreno, the final confirmation for him came when Bitcoin’s price fell below its one-year moving average,which is a long-term technical indicator widely used to assess broader market trends. He described this move as a clear signal that the market shifted into bearish territory, as the one-year moving average often acts as a dividing line between bull and bear cycles. Bitcoin began 2025 trading close to $93,000 before rallying to a peak of roughly $126,080 in October. However, it ended the year lower than where it started, according to data from CoinCodex . At press time, Bitcoin was trading near $88,500, proving that momentum has weakened despite optimism from analysts who expected 2026 to be a strong growth year for the asset. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinCodex ) Moreno believes that if the bear market thesis holds, Bitcoin could eventually bottom between $56,000 and $60,000 in the coming year. This estimate is based on Bitcoin’s realized price, which represents the average price at which current holders acquired their coins. Historically, Bitcoin prices have tended to fall back toward realized price levels during bear markets after deviating above them in bull cycles. A decline to that range would represent a drawdown of about 55% from Bitcoin’s all-time high. Moreno explained that while this is a big drop, it would still be less severe than previous bear markets, which saw declines of 70% to 80%. In that sense, the current downturn could be viewed as comparatively mild. He also argued that this bear market seems structurally more stable than past cycles. Unlike 2022, when the collapse of major players like Terra, Celsius Network, and FTX triggered widespread panic, the current market has not experienced similar systemic failures. Moreno also pointed to steady accumulation by institutional investors and ETFs as factors that could help cushion downside pressure and support long-term market stability. Polymarket Traders Also Skeptical of Bitcoin Rally Meanwhile, prediction market traders on Polymarket are showing relatively cautious expectations for Bitcoin’s price trajectory, and assigned just a 21% probability that the cryptocurrency will reach $150,000 before the end of 2026. The odds prove that there is a sense of hesitation among traders, even as many analysts argue that Bitcoin’s next major bull phase may be delayed rather than canceled. Bitcoin’s price odds on Polymarket According to Polymarket’s active market asking what price Bitcoin will hit before 2027, the highest confidence bet currently sits at $100,000, which traders assign an 80% probability. Beyond that level, confidence drops sharply. Bitcoin reaching $120,000 is priced at a 45% chance, while the probability falls to 35% at $130,000, 28% at $140,000, and just 21% at $150,000. Even $120,000 would still sit below Bitcoin’s previous all-time high. Market participants seem to be factoring in structural changes to Bitcoin’s historical price behavior. The four-year cycle tied to halving events, which previously provided a rough framework for forecasting bull and bear markets, appears to be losing its predictive power after Bitcoin closed 2025 in negative territory. With that pattern breaking down, traders may be reassessing how much weight to give long-standing cycle-based models, opening the door for new dynamics to shape price action. Example of BTC’s 4-year cycle Despite subdued expectations in prediction markets, macro and regulatory developments also still fuel bullish narratives among analysts. Anticipation around President Donald Trump’s upcoming announcement of a new US Federal Reserve chair increased speculation that interest rate cuts could follow, which is a backdrop that already helped push gold and silver to record highs in late 2025. At the same time, proposed US crypto legislation, including the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, is expected to provide clearer regulatory guardrails that could encourage deeper institutional participation. Major financial institutions like Standard Chartered, Strategy, and Bernstein forecast Bitcoin reaching $150,000 in 2026, while more aggressive projections from Tom Lee of Fundstrat place long-term targets as high as $200,000 to $250,000.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-02 09:00:00

According to official monitoring from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) , 48 jurisdictions committed to start collecting standardized crypto transaction and user data from January 1, 2026, with the first automatic cross-border exchanges expected to take place in 2027. Countries Begin Collecting Data Based on reports , service providers such as major exchanges, some broker platforms, crypto ATMs and certain custody services will be obliged to record account details, transaction histories and users’ tax residency information for reporting to domestic tax authorities. That information will be formatted so it can be shared automatically with partner tax offices once the exchange phase starts. The OECD monitoring update lays out the kinds of fields that must be gathered and stored for future reporting. What Exchanges Must Report According to news outlets tracking the rollout, exchanges are already adjusting onboarding forms and internal compliance systems to verify customers’ tax residency and capture wallet-level activity. Some jurisdictions, led by the United Kingdom, have moved faster to require platforms to keep detailed purchase and sale records for users in scope. Tax authorities will then receive yearly reports covering balances, transfers and gains for listed accounts. Operational Strain And Privacy Questions The new rules create practical burdens. Smaller platforms will need to upgrade systems or hire compliance staff to track the new data points. Based on reports, privacy advocates and parts of the crypto industry are warning that the depth of data collection could raise concerns about how long sensitive transaction records are held and who can access them. Some legal teams are already studying how domestic data-privacy laws interact with automatic information exchange. Middle Nations Join The Second Wave A further group of jurisdictions has said it will begin domestic collection later. Reports note that an additional 27 jurisdictions have timelines that target January 1, 2027 for starting to collect, with exchanges of information to follow in 2028 for that batch. At least one analysis of national updates also indicates that a handful of countries are planning to stagger implementation because of local legislative calendars. How This Will Play Out For Users For ordinary crypto users, the immediate change will be more questions during account setup and clearer record-keeping demands from providers. Based on official guidance, CARF itself does not create new taxes; rather, it gives tax offices the data they need to enforce existing rules. For some investors, that means past reporting gaps will be easier for authorities to spot. Reports have disclosed that implementation will vary by country. Some tax administrations are ready to receive standardized files in 2027, while others are still finishing domestic law changes.

Here’s What You Need to Know,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-proponent-jake-claver-was-just-exposed-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"Concerns surrounding credibility and conduct have quietly grown within the XRP community over the months. Price predictions that once drew enthusiasm now face deeper scrutiny. Jake Claver, a well-known figure in the XRP community, has faced criticism for his bold price predictions . However, a recent series of videos by Zach Rector has shifted attention toward more serious allegations. XRP: Serious Claims Raised Crypto commentator Levi Rietveld recently published a video addressing allegations presented by Rector. In the video, Rietveld said Claver was “exposed inside of the XRP community” and claimed Rector uncovered evidence of fraud connected to a publicly available court case from 2023. Rietveld stated that the documents show Claver admitted to forging documents, emails, and screenshots to mislead investors. WTF!? Jake Claver Was Just EXPOSED! $XRP pic.twitter.com/Eb0KyGJzRD — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 31, 2025 Rietveld said the court filings included admissions that Claver fabricated screenshots to give the impression he had access to funds he did not possess. He also claimed the records showed examples of faked wire transfers used to manipulate business partners. Rietveld described the alleged conduct as deliberate and calculated, adding that Claver “admitted to all of these charges” in the case. Zach Rector has taken an aggressive stance against Claver . He has shared court excerpts and commentary asserting that Claver’s past behavior contradicts the image he presents publicly. According to Rector, the documents reflect a pattern of deception rather than isolated mistakes. Rector has emphasized that the case records are publicly accessible and not based on rumor. Rector has also maintained that the issue centers on trust and accountability, not personal disputes. Rector stated that his intention is not to attack anyone associated with Claver, but to document why he believes transparency is necessary. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 History of Controversial XRP Predictions Before these allegations regained attention, Claver already faced criticism for extreme XRP price forecasts. Rietveld has previously criticized Claver for suggesting XRP could reach $20 in 2025. He took things further, challenging claims that the asset could reach $10,000 in 2026 . While bold predictions remain common in crypto media, critics say Claver presented certainty rather than speculation. That approach has drawn increasing resistance as timelines passed without results. Claver has also received additional criticism, as many now see his predictions as intentional deceit. What’s Next for the XRP Army? Skepticism toward crypto investments remains high among many traditional investors. While some have called for unity in the XRP army, unresolved allegations tied to prominent figures reinforce those doubts. Ignoring such claims harms XRP’s standing more than confronting them directly. As of now, Claver has not publicly addressed the latest wave of criticism.

According to an alert on ZachXBT’s Telegram channel, an unknown attacker has been targeting several crypto wallets and stealing small amounts, notably under $2,000 per wallet. While at first glance the losses seem minor, the vast amount of wallets being targeted at the same time is a concerning development, especially as the attack vector remains unknown at the moment. As of the last update, ZachXBT estimates that total losses have reached roughly $107,000 , but warned that the figure may continue to increase. At the time of publication, the investigation did not identify the attack vector that allowed the attacker to compromise these wallets, which leaves room for more victims to be affected. ZachXBT has flagged the attacker’s address: 0xAc2e5153170278e24667a580baEa056ad8Bf9bFB. Some community members believe that the attacks may be the result of a malicious campaign targeting MetaMask users. One X user, going by the name MechaKong, highlighted a spoof email that was reportedly sent to MetaMask users earlier in the day. The message urged recipients to upgrade to the latest version of the wallet and directed them to download a file that was not affiliated with the official source. A screenshot of the phishing email shows a fake download link masked under a MetaMask-branded prompt, which may have tricked unsuspecting users into compromising their wallets. See below. Vladimir S. | Officer’s Notes @officer_secret · Follow Replying to @officer_secret According to @Mecha_Kong , there was a spoof mm email sent out today about upgrading… could be the reason behind drains… 8:12 AM · Jan 2, 2026 40 Reply Copy link Read 6 replies Trust Wallet users were recently targeted Last week, similar panic ensued among several Trust Wallet users who found that their wallets had been drained without warning. Specifically, users who were operating the Trust Wallet Google Chrome extension became the victim of a large-scale heist after attackers were able to upload a malicious version, v2.68, to the Chrome Web Store on December 24, 2025. It is estimated that they were able to carry this out, likely using leaked API keys, and pushed malicious code disguised as analytics logic, which allowed them to quietly harvest sensitive user data, specifically seed phrases. Attackers were able to steal somewhere between $7 million and $8.5 million from hundreds of wallets across more than 2,500 affected addresses. A patch has since been released to fix the compromised version, and Trust Wallet has confirmed that it will reimburse all affected users. Over $3 billion lost to hacks in 2025 The recent wallet-draining campaign, however, presents a sharp contrast from broader crypto attack trends in 2025, where attackers were largely found to be targeting centralized services across fewer incidents. Total losses from these concentrated events surpassed $3 billion last year, with a handful of breaches like the Bybit hack accounting for the vast majority of the stolen funds. The total number of incidents, however, dropped compared to the previous year. Security agencies have attributed a significant portion of total crypto losses to North Korean hackers , who are believed to have netted roughly $2.02 billion through increasingly coordinated and structured operations.

The token is expected to recover after trading lower following its November airdrop and exchange debut. Monad (MON) is one of the post-airdrop tokens expected to make a recovery. MON rose by over 17% ahead of the weekend, peaking at $0.028. The token is still lagging from its initial peak of $0.045 after its long-awaited launch. MON has been expected to pump for a while, based on its underperformance in December. However, the token remains risky as the crypto market recovery is still questioned. Monad also launched a new L1 chain at a time when demand for new platforms was low. Despite this, Monad has been building up a DeFi stack. Monad builds up a record value locked Monad has built up value locked since its launch, recently rising to a record of $251M. The chain carries over $397M in stablecoins and hosts several DeFi apps. Monad reached peak value locked, though app revenues vary based on incentives and campaigns. | Source: DeFiLlama . Activity on Monad generates relatively low fees for node operators, but apps are picking up speed. App revenues peaked at the end of 2025, with over $200M in daily fees . Since then, the chain slowed down its activity, coinciding with overall weak post-holiday trading. Monad’s flagship app is Upshift, an online capital allocator. The app increased its liquidity by over 82% in the past month, now holding $476M based on its own reporting . App-based liquidity may also signal much higher usage for Monad, based on its app-based economy. Results and fees may vary depending on app incentives and campaigns. Some of the apps may also extract fees for their own teams. Monad is repeating Solana’s model, focusing more on the chain’s economy and successful apps, rather than on incentives for block production, which remain much smaller. The Monad project shows a further shift to chains as infrastructure, where apps are the main value centers, offering services and transfers. MON still offers staking, with around 14% of the supply locked for an annualized yield of up to 12%. The end results of staking may vary depending on the token’s market performance. MON open interest rises near an all-time peak MON derivative trading is picking up, with open interest near an all-time high. The MON derivative market carries more than $127M in positions, with more active trading in the past two weeks, betting on a directional move. MON traders tend to take long positions, with only limited risk-taking by shorting the token. The asset remains volatile and continues to cause liquidations during attempts at shorting. In the past day, over $133M in short liquidations added to the MON rally. The recent MON climb liquidated all available short positions before the downturn, signaling the price action may be due to a short squeeze. An organic MON recovery based on the performance of Monad is yet to happen, as the market reassesses risk and the appeal of altcoins. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged the incident in the early hours of Friday, warning that victims are losing relatively small amounts per wallet (typically under $2,000), while the root cause remains unidentified. The coordinated attack follows a devastating December for crypto security, which saw $76 million stolen across 26 major exploits , including a $50 million address poisoning scam and the Christmas Day Trust Wallet breach that drained roughly $7 million from users. Source: Telegram Attack Pattern Emerges Across Multiple Blockchains ZachXBT identified a suspicious address (0xAc2***9bFB) that may be linked to ongoing thefts targeting EVM chains. The investigator is compiling verified addresses of theft victims as more victims come forward and is requesting that affected users contact him directly via X (formerly Twitter). The distributed attack mirrors tactics seen in recent high-profile incidents, in which attackers exploit multiple smaller wallets rather than targeting a single large holding. This approach often evades immediate detection while maximizing total extraction across compromised accounts. Security researchers note that the cross-chain nature suggests sophisticated infrastructure, with threat actors operating simultaneously across different blockchain networks to drain funds before victims can respond. Beyond EVM chains, the attack methodology resembles patterns observed in address-poisoning schemes and private-key compromises that have plagued the industry over recent months.

Trust Wallet Breach Highlights Broader Vulnerability Crisis The alert comes days after Trust Wallet users faced fresh complications when the company’s Chrome extension was temporarily removed from the Chrome Web Store, delaying a crucial claims verification tool for victims of the Christmas Day hack. Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen confirmed that Google acknowledged a technical bug encountered during the new version release. “ We understand how concerning this is, and our team is actively working on the issue, ” Trust Wallet stated after identifying 2,520 drained wallet addresses linked to roughly $8.5 million in stolen assets across 17 attacker-controlled wallets. The December 25 breach stemmed from a malicious version 2.68 of Trust Wallet’s browser extension, which appeared legitimate, passed Chrome’s review process, but contained hidden code that extracted recovery phrases. Users who installed the compromised extension and logged in between December 24 and 26 faced immediate fund outflows across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum , Bitcoin , and Solana . @TrustWallet users affected by the Chrome extension hack are still waiting for the claims tool after the extension was pulled due to a Chrome Web Store bug #TrustWallet #CryptoSecurity #Chrome https://t.co/O6atPd0DVa — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 1, 2026 Trust Wallet traced the incident to a broader supply-chain attack known as Sha1-Hulud, which surfaced in November and compromised multiple companies through exposed GitHub secrets and a leaked Chrome Web Store API key. The attack bypassed internal approval checks, allowing direct uploads of malicious code that appeared authentic to both automated security systems and manual reviewers. Industry Faces Human-Layer Security Crisis Mitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi, warns that the crypto sector confronts a fundamental security reckoning as attack vectors increasingly target operational vulnerabilities rather than smart contract code. “ The threat landscape is shifting from onchain code vulnerabilities to operational security and treasury-level attacks, ” he told Cryptonews. “ As code hardens, attackers target the human element. “ Despite December’s 60% month-over-month decline in hack losses to $76 million, down from November’s $194.2 million, security experts emphasize that persistent threats remain. “ Crypto is facing a security reckoning, ” Amador stated. “ Most hacks this year haven’t occurred due to poor audits, they’ve happened after launch, during protocol upgrades, or through integration vulnerabilities. “ Blockchain security firm PeckShield documented 26 major exploits in December, with address-poisoning scams and private-key leaks accounting for substantial losses.

The latest events, however, are revolving around the readiness of the protocols. As Bitcoin closes the year 2025 with a -5% change as it continues consolidating, with Solana sustaining its momentum at a crucial point of resistance levels, Mutuum Finance has made considerable advances. The V1 lending & borrowing protocol used in the project has been audited by Halborn Security. This was followed by the implementation of all feedback received and the final code version being developed. With the team set to reveal the launch date of the protocol’s V1, Mutuum Finance, at $0.04 in the present presale phase, is considered to be a top pick in the list of cryptos to buy. Bitcoin Ends 2025 Flat BTC is closing 2025 unchanged. It continues moving in a way near to the price of about $88,410 with the support being at $88,210. The market is stable but it has been observed that the number of Bitcoin holders have been experiencing average realised losses of approximately $300 million per day. It is thus understandable why, despite its high profile among the cryptos, it appeared less enticing than its competitors that can grow faster in 2026. Solana Regains Momentum Solana is in the headlines after experiencing more than 140% increase in the trading volumes, as the prices kept soaring to the $127-$130 bracket. Open interest in the derivatives market of Solana is on the rise, which means a new wave of speculation. A rise above $130 could, therefore, result into a potential rise to $150. Although larger profits are made compared to Bitcoin, Solana is very market-dependent and that is why it is a less preferable alternative investment compared to a relatively new token like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Presale Strength of Mutuum In the present case, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised a total of 19,550,000 since its presale started and has drawn a total of 18,650 holders. Currently, the platform is at Phase 7 at a price of $0.04, which means that the price has grown by a desirable 300% compared to the Phase 1 price. Nevertheless, this stage will be sold at an early stage and will transfer to Phase 8 with a price of 0.045. Not like most other tokens, which were made exclusively for the intent of speculation, Mutuum Finance is now developing its lending and borrowing feature to encourage more demand. The fact that users can earn yield or borrow without selling their asset is set to boost activity on the platform. If all goes well, it appears that the long-term gains could be promising. An initial bet of $1,000 could result in gains of $15,000, assuming the token price reaches $0.60 during the early growth stage. Security and MUTM Readiness The degree of execution confidence is an essential long-term value factor. An independent audit has been conducted by Halborn Security in regard to Mutuum Finance, encompassing the examination of lending and borrowing contracts. This has also been completed, and the final analysis of the code has been concluded. Moreover, the readiness for the launch of MUTM V1 protocol has also been confirmed, boosting the overall readiness of Mutuum Finance regarding its appeal as top investment. Stacking Ahead Of 2026 Bitcoin and Solana are still key leaders within the market, though growth opportunities look relatively measured. Mutuum Finance, traded below $0.05, offers a combination of early-stage valuation, sound infrastructure, and legitimate DeFi use cases. When it comes to making a choice on which crypto is worth buying today for long-term strategic holding, MUTM is quickly emerging as a clear choice for the best crypto to buy today before the 2026 cycle.

Related Reading: Crypto Headed For A $10 Trillion Future? Hoskinson Says RWA Is The Key Moreno pointed to the price sliding below its one-year moving average as the clearest technical confirmation, and he used that signal to argue a lower trading range may be on the path ahead. Bitcoin Technical Signals, Market Mood Moreno said a likely bottom could sit near the realized price, which he put in the $56,000–$60,000 band. That would mean a drawdown of roughly 55% from Bitcoin’s all-time high — a drop that is large but smaller than past crashes that hit 70% or 80%. Market momentum is muted. Bitcoin began 2025 near $93,000, peaked at about $126,050 in October, and ended the year below where it started, according to CoinGecko. Trading hovered around $88,920 as of Friday, based on available data. Derivatives Show Caution Ahead Of Expiry Bitcoin was holding the $87,000–$89,000 range as $1.85 billion in options approached expiry. Reports show derivatives volume fell 39% while open interest remained flat, a mix that points to hesitation rather than aggressive positioning by traders. Technical measures show price compression near support, and traders are watching expiry closely because a larger move could follow when those contracts settle. Volatility has been lower than in some previous selloffs, and that has left price action tighter than many expected. Institutional Accumulation And The Missing Shock Moreno and others note the environment feels structurally different. Large institutional players and regulated ETFs have been buying more regularly, and those flows are not known to be selling in panic. That steady demand has helped prevent the kind of cascading failures seen in 2022, when Terra, Celsius and FTX collapsed and amplified losses across the market. Because those big shocks did not occur this time, the drawdown looks more controlled, even if prices are moving down. Outlook Hinges On Macro And Regulation Some analysts still predict 2026 could bring fresh highs, citing expected US rate cuts and a friendlier policy stance in Washington. At the same time, observers are watching whether Bitcoin’s tighter link to US stocks holds as macro and regulatory decisions land. If the correlation weakens, crypto may chart its own course. If it stays strong, the path for Bitcoin could be shaped largely by broader market moves rather than crypto-specific flows. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators What Traders Will Watch Based on reports and Moreno’s view, the key items to monitor are the one-year moving average, realized price levels near $56,000–$60,000, the outcome of options expiries, and whether institutional buyers continue steady purchases. Price action has been calmer than some past crises, but that calm has masked real downside risk. Analysts and traders are split; some expect a return to growth next year, while others are preparing for lower prices before any sustained recovery.

The OECD brought together regulators in June 2023 to address the tax discrepancies from the crypto industry, arguing that the sector “limits the visibility of tax authorities.” “With respect to transparency for tax purposes, the OECD, working with G20 countries, completed and published the Crypto-Asset Reporting framework for the reporting and automatic exchange of information (AEOI) in relation to Crypto-Assets between tax authorities for tax compliance purposes,” the economic organization wrote in its report published last October. EU, Asia, the US, and UK prepare for global crypto tax transparency The CARF initiative mandates the involved jurisdictions to implement the framework by translating its requirements into domestic law, including due diligence obligations and reporting standards. According to the OECD, this will help Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (RCASPs) know which user information to collect and how to submit it to tax authorities. Moreover, the participating countries also need legal frameworks for the automatic exchange of information. Some jurisdictions will use the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAAC), which supports the sharing of data under the Common Reporting Standard. Others may take up the bilateral double tax treaties, Tax Information Exchange Agreements, or regional arrangements like the EU’s coordinated system. The OECD reported that several jurisdictions have already passed legislation requiring crypto platforms to collect CARF-related data or are finalizing enforcement measures, and believe more than 50 countries will be ready when CARF exchanges begin in 2027. G20 officials have welcomed the CARF framework and invited the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes to support its implementation. As of now, 59 countries have joined a joint statement committing to CARF compliance and are actively showing their political support for the program. Jurisdictions adding CARF exchanges in 2027-2028. Source: OECD. The first batch of 48 jurisdictions will begin collecting data in 2026 for exchanges starting in 2027. However, another 27 countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, and Hong Kong, are expected to start reporting in 2028. Per a press statement released by the special Chinese jurisdiction Hong Kong’s government, the city opened a forum in early December to receive feedback on CARF and updates to tax reporting standards. Immediate changes commences in the United Kingdom As reported by the BBC, the UK government issued a statement requiring all crypto buyers to provide account details to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) starting Thursday. The updated reporting requirements now give authorities detailed insights into user holdings, transactions, and profits. Crypto exchanges in the UK now must provide accurate, up-to-date information on all users. Platforms failing to comply may face fines, while investors can no longer rely on limited disclosure to evade taxes. HMRC will automatically collect data from all users of crypto exchanges, and is expected to uncover tens of millions of pounds in previously unpaid taxes. Proponents believe the CARF rules will make it significantly harder for wealthy crypto investors to hide gains from the revenue collector. “HMRC has been concerned for some time about high levels of non-compliance among crypto investors. HMRC is running a disclosure facility where taxpayers can come clean on undeclared gains and unpaid tax prior to April 2024,” Dawn Register, a tax dispute resolution partner at BDO, told the news publication. In 2025, the largest crypto by market cap and purported benchmark for the industry, Bitcoin, surged from approximately $93,500 at the start of 2025 to nearly $124,500 before falling below $90,000 by year-end. The investors who bought during price dips and sold during peaks are now liable for taxes on their gains.

Samsung’s chip boss and co-CEO Jun Young-hyun told staff in a New Year speech that clients are calling the new product a comeback moment. Back in October, Samsung said it was already in “close discussion” with Nvidia to supply HBM4 chips, a deal that if signed will quickly swing momentum fast in Samsung’s favor. But Jun also said the company still needs to improve the chip’s overall strength before it can claim real dominance again. Samsung expands foundry and signs $16.5B Tesla chip deal Samsung is also stacking wins in its foundry business. Jun said new chip deals with major clients have put this part of the company in a strong spot. He claimed the foundry is now “primed for a great leap forward.” One of those big deals is a $16.5 billion agreement with Tesla, signed last July. Another Samsung co-CEO, TM Roh, gave his own outlook for 2026 and pointed to rising component costs and tariff walls as real threats. He also talked about reducing risks by changing how and where the company sources parts and ships products. Across Asia, markets opened strong for the new year. South Korea’s Kosdaq rose 2.17%, closing at 945.57. The KOSPI Index ended at 4,309.63, up 2.27%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 2.76% to 26,338.47, and India’s Nifty 50 climbed 0.49% to 26,274.90. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 closed at 8,727.80, up 0.15%. Some Asian exchanges stayed shut for the holidays, including Japan and mainland China. Singapore’s Straits Times Index was up 0.32%, while the Sensex in India gained 0.56%. Meanwhile, Sapphire Foods dropped as much as 6.4% after revealing a merger plan with rival franchisee Devyani, before cutting back losses. SK Hynix warns of harder fight in 2026 as demand for AI chips grows Over at SK Hynix, CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said demand for AI-related chips had exploded faster than the company expected. Speaking in his own New Year address, Kwak said: “AI demand is now a given rather than an upside surprise.” He also warned the business climate in 2026 could get worse, not better. According to him, tougher conditions are ahead, and competing in the memory business will demand bolder bets and more spending. His company is leading the HBM market for now, with a 53% share in the third quarter of 2025. Samsung is second at 35%, and Micron is far behind with 11%, based on fresh numbers from Counterpoint Research. On the first trading day of 2026, Samsung shares jumped 7.2%, while SK Hynix went up 4%. That’s stronger than the KOSPI Index, which only rose 2.3%. Both companies hit record highs. It’s clear the market still sees plenty of money in the memory race, even with the risks piling up. Some Asian markets were still closed for the holidays, including Japan and mainland China.

The stock ended the day at HK$34.46 after pricing its initial public offering at HK$19.60, which sat at the upper end of the marketed range. Trading earlier in the session saw the shares climb as much as 119% before some gains faded by the close. Biren raised $717 million from the sale, with the retail portion subscribed more than 2,300 times, showing how heavy demand was for the deal in Hong Kong. Biren designs graphics processing units used to train and run AI models, as interest in AI stocks has grown across global markets, while China’s policy push to support domestic chip development has fed demand for these offerings in Hong Kong. Biren trading sets pace for upcoming AI listings in Hong Kong Biren’s first day performance now sets a reference point for other AI-related names preparing to list in Hong Kong next week. MiniMax Group and Knowledge Atlas Technology, known as Zhipu, are both scheduled to debut in the same market. Biren’s closing gain ranked as the strongest since Kuaishou Technology surged 161% during its 2021 debut among Hong Kong listings that raised at least $700 million. In its prospectus, Biren said proceeds from its offering will fund research and development for its computing products. The company reported a 1.6 billion yuan net loss for the first six months of the year as spending stayed heavy. Earlier this week, MiniMax said it plans to raise up to HK$4.19 billion, or $538 million, from its offering. Exchange filings also showed Biren raised HK$5.58 billion in gross proceeds. Together, the transactions point to renewed deal flow in Hong Kong, especially for companies tied to artificial intelligence and semiconductors. Market figures underline that rebound. Hong Kong raised $36.5 billion from 114 new listings in 2025, its strongest year since 2021 and more than triple the $11.3 billion raised in 2024, according to data from LSEG. Listings of comparable size between 2020 and 2025 produced a weighted average first day gain of almost 23%, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Baidu advances Kunlunxin plan as chip push continues Meanwhile, Baidu also announced on Friday that it was moving ahead with plans to list its AI chip unit Kunlunxin after confidentially filing a listing application with the Hong Kong exchange on January 1, thanks to fundraising that valued Kunlunxin at 21 billion yuan, or about $3 billion. Kunlunxin was founded in 2012 as an internal Baidu unit focused on AI chips before becoming independently operated, while Baidu kept a controlling stake. The unit mainly supplies chips to Baidu but has grown external sales during the past two years as demand widened beyond the parent company. DeepSeek, a Hangzhou-based startup, released a paper this week describing a more efficient method for building AI systems. The company drew industry attention last year after releasing its R1 reasoning model, and earlier research releases have come ahead of major product launches. China’s drive to build its domestic chip sector has picked up pace this year as trade tensions remain high. Officials are weighing incentives worth up to $70 billion to support the industry.

According to proprietary data from The Block, monthly spot trading volume on major centralized exchanges (CEX) fell to approximately $1.13 trillion, marking the weakest performance since September 2024. This significant decline represents a 32% decrease from November’s $1.66 trillion and a staggering 49% drop from October’s $2.23 trillion, creating concern among market participants globally. CEX Spot Trading Volume Analysis: December’s Market Contraction The cryptocurrency market experienced substantial cooling during December 2024. Major centralized exchanges collectively processed approximately $1.13 trillion in spot transactions. This figure represents the lowest monthly total since September 2024, when markets recorded similar subdued activity. The Block’s proprietary data reveals consistent downward pressure throughout the final month of the year. Consequently, analysts now examine multiple contributing factors behind this pronounced decline. Exchange performance varied significantly despite the overall market contraction. Binance maintained its dominant position with approximately $367.35 billion in spot trading volume. Following Binance, Bybit secured second position with substantial but reduced activity. Gate.io and Bitget completed the top four exchanges by volume. These platforms demonstrated relative resilience compared to smaller competitors. However, all major exchanges experienced notable percentage declines from previous months. Top CEX Spot Trading Volume December 2024 Exchange Approximate Volume Market Position Binance $367.35 billion 1st Bybit Data not specified 2nd Gate.io Data not specified 3rd Bitget Data not specified 4th Historical Context and Market Comparison December’s trading volume decline continues a pattern established in previous months. October 2024 recorded $2.23 trillion in CEX spot trading volume, representing a recent peak. November then showed early contraction signs with $1.66 trillion. December’s $1.13 trillion completes a clear three-month downtrend. This sequential reduction suggests systemic rather than temporary market factors. Historical data reveals similar patterns during previous market cycles. Several comparable periods demonstrate analogous market behavior. September 2024 previously held the recent low-volume record before December’s performance. Earlier in 2023, markets experienced similar contractions during summer months. However, December’s decline appears more pronounced percentage-wise. Analysts typically attribute such patterns to multiple interacting variables. These include regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and seasonal trading patterns. Expert Analysis: Understanding the Volume Decline Market analysts identify several plausible explanations for December’s volume contraction. First, traditional year-end portfolio rebalancing often reduces cryptocurrency trading activity. Institutional investors frequently decrease risk exposure before annual reporting. Second, regulatory uncertainty in multiple jurisdictions may have prompted caution. The SEC’s ongoing cryptocurrency framework development continues affecting market sentiment. Third, macroeconomic conditions including interest rate decisions influence capital allocation. Additionally, technological developments potentially contributed to volume redistribution. Decentralized exchange (DEX) growth continues attracting trading activity away from centralized platforms. Layer-2 scaling solutions and cross-chain bridges facilitate alternative trading venues. While DEX volumes don’t fully explain CEX declines, they represent a growing market segment. Finally, reduced volatility across major cryptocurrencies likely decreased trading incentives. Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibited unusually narrow trading ranges throughout December. Market Impact and Future Implications The CEX spot trading volume decline carries multiple implications for market participants. Exchange revenue models directly correlate with trading activity, potentially affecting operational stability. Reduced volume typically decreases liquidity, potentially increasing slippage for large orders. Market makers may adjust strategies in response to changing conditions. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny often intensifies during low-volume periods as authorities examine market health. Several positive developments might emerge from current conditions. First, reduced speculative trading could indicate healthier long-term investor behavior. Second, exchanges may enhance services and reduce fees to attract returning volume. Third, innovation often accelerates during market contractions as platforms compete for reduced activity. Historical patterns suggest volume typically recovers following consolidation periods. However, recovery timing and magnitude remain uncertain given evolving market structures. Exchange Competition: Binance maintains dominance despite overall market contraction Percentage Declines: 32% monthly and 49% quarterly reductions signal significant shift Market Health: Reduced volume may indicate decreased speculation or capital outflow Regulatory Environment: Multiple jurisdictions continue developing cryptocurrency frameworks Technological Shift: DEX and alternative trading venue growth continues Conclusion December 2024’s CEX spot trading volume decline to $1.13 trillion represents a significant market development with multiple implications. This fifteen-month low continues a three-month contraction trend, suggesting systemic rather than temporary factors. While Binance maintained exchange dominance, all major platforms experienced substantial volume reductions. Market analysts attribute this decline to regulatory uncertainty, macroeconomic conditions, and seasonal patterns. Consequently, market participants should monitor volume recovery patterns during early 2025 for indications of broader market direction. The CEX spot trading volume metric remains crucial for understanding cryptocurrency market health and participant behavior. FAQs Q1: What was the exact CEX spot trading volume in December 2024? The total CEX spot trading volume reached approximately $1.13 trillion in December 2024, according to The Block’s proprietary data. Q2: How does December’s volume compare to previous months? December’s $1.13 trillion represents a 32% decrease from November’s $1.66 trillion and a 49% decline from October’s $2.23 trillion. Q3: Which exchange had the highest trading volume in December? Binance led all centralized exchanges with approximately $367.35 billion in spot trading volume during December 2024. Q4: What factors might explain the trading volume decline? Potential factors include year-end portfolio rebalancing, regulatory uncertainty, reduced cryptocurrency volatility, and growing decentralized exchange competition. Q5: How significant is a 15-month low in trading volume? A 15-month low indicates the weakest trading activity since September 2024, suggesting potential market transformation rather than temporary fluctuation.

Between January 1 and December 31, 2025, the value of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) holdings rose from $54.83 billion to $77.35 billion, representing a $22.52 billion increase, or a 41.07% annual gain, based on data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham . !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Bitcoin remained the core driver of the portfolio. Over the same period, BlackRock’s BTC holdings rose from approximately 552,550 BTC to 770,380 BTC, an increase of 217,830 BTC. In dollar terms, Bitcoin exposure grew from $51.16 billion to $67.14 billion, representing a $15.98 billion increase, or 31.24% year over year. Ethereum delivered the strongest relative growth. BlackRock’s ETH holdings expanded from around 1.07 million ETH to 3.48 million ETH, adding roughly 2.41 million ETH in 2025. The value of those holdings climbed from $3.59 billion to $10.21 billion, a gain of $6.62 billion, translating to a 184.40% increase over the year. The figures underscore not only sustained institutional demand for crypto assets, but also BlackRock’s tendency to deploy capital steadily through periods of consolidation rather than chasing short-term price surges. Q1 2025 crypto ETF inflows set the tone The year began amid choppy market conditions following the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. While prices fluctuated early in the quarter, ETF inflows consistently favored BlackRock’s iShares products , cementing the firm’s role as the dominant institutional gateway into crypto markets. By the end of the first quarter, BlackRock held approximately 575,860 BTC and 1.17 million ETH, with a combined crypto portfolio valued at $49.85 billion. The temporary dip in valuation reflected broader market volatility rather than reduced exposure, as accumulation continued beneath the surface. First half of 2025 Bitcoin leads while Ethereum builds Momentum accelerated in the first half of the year. From January 1 to June 30, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio grew by $23.91 billion, climbing from $54.77 billion to $78.67 billion. Bitcoin remained the backbone of the allocation, rising from $51.16 billion to $74.47 billion, a 31.3% increase. Ethereum also advanced, increasing by $678.95 million, from $3.53 billion to $4.21 billion, reflecting a more measured accumulation phase as institutional interest continued to develop. Ethereum drives BlackRock crypto portfolio growth in Q3 2025 The most dramatic growth occurred during the third quarter. From early July through September 30, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio surged to $102.09 billion, a 28% increase in just three months. While Bitcoin added nearly $11 billion in value over the period, Ethereum emerged as the fastest-growing component. ETH holdings jumped from $4.37 billion to $15.83 billion, a gain of more than 260%, highlighting rising institutional focus on Ethereum-linked yield, tokenization, and settlement use cases. BlackRock crypto holdings consolidate in Q4 2025 Finbold’s analysis shows that BlackRock’s $22.52 billion increase in crypto exposure during 2025 was driven by continued demand flowing through its spot exchange-traded funds. The Bitcoin and Ethereum tracked in this report reflect assets accumulated via BlackRock’s ETF platform, led by the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), as investors sought regulated access to digital assets throughout the year. Rather than signaling a proprietary shift by BlackRock itself, the data highlights how institutional and retail capital increasingly used the firm’s ETFs as a preferred gateway into crypto markets. Even as prices consolidated in the fourth quarter, inflows remained resilient, reinforcing the view that digital assets are being treated less as a short-term trade and more as a long-duration allocation within diversified portfolios.

This comprehensive analysis examines realistic PEPE price predictions from 2026 through 2030, grounded in market data, historical patterns, and fundamental blockchain metrics. Market analysts currently observe PEPE trading within established ranges while monitoring broader cryptocurrency adoption trends that could influence future valuation. PEPE Price Prediction Fundamentals and Market Context Understanding PEPE’s potential requires examining its foundational elements within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Launched in April 2023, PEPE emerged during a memecoin resurgence that followed Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s market successes. The token operates on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 asset, leveraging existing infrastructure for security and interoperability. Market capitalization currently positions PEPE among the top memecoins by trading volume and community engagement metrics. Historical data reveals PEPE experienced significant volatility since its inception, with notable price surges and corrections aligning with broader market cycles. Technical analysts emphasize the importance of trading volume, holder distribution, and liquidity pool stability when projecting future price movements. Furthermore, regulatory developments concerning cryptocurrency classification continue influencing investor sentiment toward memecoins specifically. Technical Analysis and Historical Performance Patterns Technical indicators provide quantitative frameworks for evaluating PEPE’s price potential. Moving averages across multiple timeframes establish support and resistance levels that historically influenced price action. Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings frequently indicated overbought or oversold conditions preceding significant price adjustments. Additionally, trading volume patterns correlate with social media sentiment metrics tracked by cryptocurrency analytics platforms. Historical performance demonstrates PEPE’s sensitivity to several market factors: Bitcoin correlation: PEPE typically follows Bitcoin’s directional movements with amplified volatility Social media trends: Platform engagement metrics directly impact short-term trading volume Exchange listings: Major platform additions historically triggered price appreciation Memecoin cycles: Sector-wide momentum affects individual token performance Chart analysis reveals consolidation periods followed by breakout movements, establishing patterns that technical analysts reference when constructing future scenarios. Expert Perspectives on Memecoin Valuation Methodology Cryptocurrency analysts employ diverse methodologies when evaluating memecoins like PEPE. Traditional financial metrics often prove less applicable to assets deriving value primarily from community engagement and cultural relevance. Instead, experts emphasize network metrics including active wallet addresses, transaction frequency, and holder concentration statistics. These indicators help assess organic growth versus speculative trading activity. Industry researchers from blockchain analytics firms note that successful memecoins typically demonstrate sustained community development beyond initial hype cycles. Projects maintaining developer activity, ecosystem expansion, and utility implementation show greater long-term resilience. Comparative analysis with established memecoins provides context for PEPE’s potential maturation path within the broader digital asset landscape. 2026 Price Projection: Realistic Targets and Critical Factors The 2026 PEPE price prediction incorporates multiple market scenarios based on current trajectory analysis. Conservative estimates reference gradual adoption curves observed in comparable assets during similar development stages. Moderate scenarios assume continued cryptocurrency market expansion with memecoins maintaining proportional representation. Bullish projections require significant ecosystem development and mainstream adoption acceleration. Critical factors influencing 2026 valuation include: Regulatory clarity: Government policies affecting cryptocurrency trading and taxation Technology adoption: Blockchain integration in mainstream financial systems Market capitalization: Total cryptocurrency market growth projections Competitive landscape: New memecoin entries and existing token developments Analysts emphasize that 2026 projections assume no black swan events significantly disrupting cryptocurrency markets. Historical volatility patterns suggest potential price ranges rather than precise predictions, with probability distributions indicating most likely outcomes. 2027-2028 Outlook: Ecosystem Development Requirements The 2027-2028 period represents a crucial maturation phase for PEPE according to blockchain development experts. Sustainable growth during these years typically requires expanding beyond pure memecoin status through utility implementation. Historical precedents from other successful tokens demonstrate the importance of developing use cases that extend beyond speculative trading. Potential development pathways include gaming integrations, NFT collaborations, or decentralized finance applications. Market analysts identify several benchmarks for evaluating PEPE’s progress toward 2028: Metric Current Status 2028 Target Active Addresses Fluctuating with market trends Sustained growth independent of hype cycles Development Activity Community-driven initiatives Structured roadmap with regular updates Exchange Presence Multiple major platforms Additional tier-1 exchange listings Partnerships Limited formal collaborations Established ecosystem partnerships Price projections for this period increasingly depend on fundamental developments rather than speculative momentum alone. Analysts note that tokens successfully navigating this transition typically demonstrate reduced volatility and more stable growth patterns. The 1-Cent Threshold: Mathematical Realities and Market Requirements Achieving a 1-cent valuation represents a significant milestone requiring substantial market capitalization expansion. Simple mathematics reveals the scale of this challenge: reaching $0.01 from current levels represents exponential growth measured in multiples rather than percentages. This valuation would position PEPE’s market capitalization among the top cryptocurrency projects historically, requiring either massive token appreciation or substantial supply reduction mechanisms. Market analysts identify several plausible pathways toward 1-cent valuation: Supply reduction: Token burning mechanisms decreasing circulating supply Mass adoption: Extraordinary growth in user base and transaction volume Market expansion: Extraordinary cryptocurrency market capitalization growth Utility creation: Development of essential functions creating inherent value Historical precedents from other cryptocurrencies demonstrate that such achievements typically require years of sustained development rather than short-term speculation. Experts emphasize that while mathematically possible, reaching 1 cent represents an ambitious target requiring multiple favorable conditions aligning simultaneously. Comparative Analysis with Historical Memecoin Performances Evaluating PEPE against historical memecoin performances provides valuable context for long-term projections. Dogecoin’s multi-year journey from micro-cap to top-ten cryptocurrency demonstrates the potential for community-driven assets under favorable market conditions. Shiba Inu’s rapid ascent followed by consolidation illustrates both possibilities and challenges for tokens experiencing explosive growth phases. Key differentiators in PEPE’s position include launching during a more mature cryptocurrency era with established infrastructure and regulatory frameworks. This environment potentially enables more measured development but also presents greater competition for attention and resources. Analysts note that successful navigation of these conditions requires strategic differentiation and consistent community engagement beyond initial novelty. 2030 Long-Term Vision: Sustainable Positioning in Crypto Ecosystem The 2030 outlook for PEPE extends beyond price predictions to examine potential roles within the evolving digital asset landscape. Cryptocurrency market projections suggest continued growth with increasing institutional participation and regulatory frameworks. Memecoins maintaining relevance through this period typically demonstrate adaptability and ecosystem integration beyond their original concepts. Long-term analysts emphasize several development pathways that could influence PEPE’s 2030 positioning: Niche specialization: Dominating specific use cases or community segments Technology integration: Leveraging blockchain advancements for enhanced functionality Cross-chain expansion: Operating across multiple blockchain networks Governance evolution: Developing sophisticated community decision-making systems Price predictions for 2030 inherently involve greater uncertainty but generally follow established growth patterns observed in digital assets maintaining relevance across market cycles. Successful projects typically demonstrate capacity for evolution while preserving core community engagement that initially drove adoption. Risk Factors and Market Considerations for Investors Investors evaluating PEPE price predictions must acknowledge inherent risks within cryptocurrency markets. Volatility remains substantially higher than traditional asset classes, with potential for rapid valuation changes. Regulatory developments continue evolving across jurisdictions, potentially affecting trading accessibility and taxation frameworks. Additionally, technological risks including smart contract vulnerabilities and exchange security concerns persist within the ecosystem. Market analysts recommend several considerations for balanced evaluation: Portfolio allocation: Appropriate position sizing relative to risk tolerance Time horizon: Alignment between investment goals and projected development timelines Diversification: Exposure across cryptocurrency sectors and asset classes Research commitment: Ongoing monitoring of project developments and market conditions Historical data indicates that informed decision-making incorporating both opportunities and risks typically yields superior outcomes to speculative trading based solely on price predictions.

PEPE benefits from established infrastructure and launching during a mature market phase but faces greater competition for attention. Long-term potential depends on differentiation through utility development and sustained community building. Q4: What are the biggest risks for PEPE price predictions? Primary risks include regulatory changes affecting trading, market volatility, technological developments favoring other projects, and failure to evolve beyond initial memecoin status through utility implementation. Q5: How important is community engagement for PEPE’s price trajectory? Community engagement remains crucial for memecoins, directly influencing trading volume, developer activity, and ecosystem growth. Sustainable projects typically demonstrate consistent engagement beyond initial hype cycles.

Could a definitive breakout take place as early as next week? Or is Bitcoin still traversing within its bear flag before the next big leg down? Can this upside push retest the $90,000 resistance? Source: TradingView As can be seen in the 4-hour chart, the $BTC price is in an up phase at the moment. This has taken the price clear of the major ascending trendline, but the bulls are having some trouble with resistance at $89,000 while the Stochastic RSI indicator lines on this time frame are becoming overbought. There is still probably room for the price to head up to the crucial $90,500 horizontal resistance level, but if it did get there, it is likely that it will be rejected once again. In fact, it might be argued that the $BTC price could be forming an ascending triangle, with $90,500 as the top, and with the major trendline ascending towards it. Is an ascending triangle forming? Source: TradingView The daily chart shows the potential ascending triangle. It may be a bit on the early side to call this, but as long as the $BTC price comes up to the resistance of the top of the triangle, and is rejected, this would probably confirm the pattern. It must however also be borne in mind that the price is in a bear flag (dashed mauve lines), so even if the $BTC price does break out of the ascending triangle, it would still be in that bear flag, potentially until well over $100,000. Strong breakout of the downtrend - bulls in control for now Source: TradingView The weekly view shows a strong breakout of the downtrend line and the falling wedge pattern. It can be seen that if the $BTC price can break through the $93,000 to $94,000 area, this would turn into major horizontal support, potentially setting the price for a big rally higher. At the bottom of the chart, the indicator lines are posturing for a cross back to the upside of the blue fast line over the orange slow line. If this is the case at the end of this week, next week could be a good one for the bulls. It just needs to be kept in mind that the price has been hammered down every time it looks as though it might escape the shackles of the resistances. Who knows if the market makers are ready to let the price fly just yet? One thing does look likely though, and that is the eventual big move will be to the upside.

The question now is whether the bulls can seize control and initiate a decisive move to the upside. Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) have also endured substantial turbulence, and some analysts believe they could be gearing up for a solid start to the year. What’s Next for XRP? The asset’s price briefly exceeded $1.90 on December 29, but the bears intercepted the move and suppressed the valuation. As of this writing, it trades at around $1.88 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 2% increase on a daily scale. Several hours ago, the popular X user Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential indicator had flashed “a macro buy signal” on XRP, meaning a more significant rebound could be on the way. Prior to that, BitGuru argued that the asset is at a pivotal moment, which has historically led to a major rally. “XRP price is now compressing near key support after trend exhaustion. This is typically where smart money starts positioning early before the next directional move.” Meanwhile, the amount of XRP tokens stored on centralized platforms continues to decline. X user Niels revealed that exchange balances have fallen from 3.76 billion coins in October 2025 to approximately 1.6 billion as of the end of December. Such a development is usually seen as bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. ETH’s Path Ahead The second-largest cryptocurrency started the new year slightly below $3,000, but it reclaimed that psychological level several hours ago. According to X user Gerla, “a clean break” above that mark opens the door to a 15-20% move in the coming weeks. CyrilXBT chipped in, too. They noted that ETH has been testing the $3K zone numerous times recently and every time it sits around it long enough, “people get bored, call it dead… then it moves when no one’s ready.” The analyst assumed the following months could be highly beneficial for the asset, envisioning the rise to a new all-time high of around $7,000 and the explosion beyond $10,000 sometime next year. The market observer using the moniker JAVON MARKS is also bullish. They think ETH is capable of breaking multiple resistance points in the near future and surging to the specific target of $4,811.71. Once that level is exceeded, the price may skyrocket above $8,500, the analyst added. Renewed Bull Run or Pullback for BTC? The leading digital asset is also in the green today (January 2), with its price jumping past $89,000. Analyst The Swing Trader recently claimed that BTC has been forming “a very tight pennant” for the past six weeks, suggesting that breaking this pattern to the upside could lead to a pump above $100,000, while in the opposite case, it might result in a plunge toward $75,000. JAVON MARKS stands clearly on the bullish side, envisioning an ascent to $126,200, while Crypto GEMs predicted that the asset’s valuation could explode above $200,000 “soon.” At the same time, some analysts presented a more cautious thesis. X user Crypto Tony expects a pullback after the positive start to the year, whereas Ted believes every pump will be rejected until BTC breaks above $90K, citing “strong spot demand.” The post Ripple’s (XRP) Next Big Move, Ethereum’s (ETH) Outlook for a Strong Year, and More: Bits Recap Jan 2 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Ethereum|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-01-02 10:56:56

The analyst also stated this would form the macro bottom for the leading crypto, as it recovers from this bear market. Why The Bitcoin Price Could Drop To As Low As $25,000 In an X post, Crypto Whale stated that the monthly chart suggested that the Bitcoin price could form a macro bottom near $25,000 sometime in 2026. The analyst further remarked that if history rhymes, these deep retracements tend to mark long-term accumulation zones. He added that this doesn’t signify the end of the cycle but the reset before the next expansion. However, in another X post, Crypto Whale suggested that the Bitcoin price isn’t yet in a bear market, highlighting how the 2026 bull run is likely to unfold. He stated that this month, the crypto market will see a Bitcoin-led rally, while there will be a broad altcoin expansion in February. The analyst expects the bull trap to set in in March, which he predicts would lead to volatility and panic selling. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Is Extremely Bearish Right Now Once that happens, Crypto Whale predicts that May will usher in the capitulation phase, while a full bear market confirmation will happen in June. This outlook for the Bitcoin price comes as research firm XWIN Research noted that BTC has not clearly entered a new bullish trend. The firm further stated that the crypto market remains in a high-volatility range environment, which is neither decisively bullish nor bearish. Meanwhile, XWIN Research raised the possibility that the Bitcoin price could drop to as low as $50,000. They stated that this could happen if recession risks intensify, with deleveraging and ETF outflows pushing the leading crypto below $80,000 and making $50,000 a possibility. BTC Death Cross Signals Drop To $38,000 In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez drew attention to a death cross, which has been recurring on the BTC weekly chart. The analyst noted that if history repeats itself, the Bitcoin price could record a similar 50% to 60% correction, dropping to as low as $38,000 in the process. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Decision Phase, But What Does It Mean For The Crypto Market? This death cross between the 10-week and 50-week simple moving averages is said to have occurred in September 2014, leading to a Bitcoin price correction of 67%. It also occurred in June 2018, March 2020, and January 2022, resulting in price corrections of 54%, 53%, and 64%, respectively. Martinez opined that the zone between $50,000 and $38,000 is starting to become interesting from a long-term spot accumulation standpoint. He added that the market will confirm the next move for the Bitcoin price in its own time. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $88,700, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

EWCL announced a $70 million funding deal with Cango in June 2025. HCW analysts have a $3 price target for CANG while Greenridge analysts assigned a $4 valuation projection. Cango Inc. was up more than 3% in pre-market ahead of its first full trading day after news that Enduring Wealth Capital Limited (EWCL) made a fresh $10.5 million commitment to the firm’s Bitcoin mining business with operating bases across over 40 sites in North America, the Middle East, South America, and East Africa. According to public disclosures seen by Cryptopolitan, EWCL will subscribe for an additional 7 million Class B ordinary shares in cash at $1.50 per share, which is 20% above the firm’s baseline share price of $1.25 and closing market price of $1.36. Market observers often attribute this level of oversubscription as a bullish signal for future returns not yet reflected in a business’s performance. EWCL backs Cango to lead changing BTC mining sector According to Cango’s press release, the proposed investment, which is expected to close in January, subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the requisite approval by the New York Stock Exchange, EWCL’s shareholding in the Bitcoin miner is expected to increase from approximately 2.81% to approximately 4.69% of the total outstanding shares. Correspondingly, EWCL’s voting power is expected to rise from approximately 36.68% to approximately 49.61% of the total voting power of Cango’s outstanding shares. The EWCL management team is expected to continue to provide core resources for Cango’s 50 EH/s operations and AI transformation. Earlier in June, EWCL completed an aggregate purchase of 10,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, a total purchase price of up to $70 million securities purchase agreement with Cango. This latest cash injection also boosts Cango’s cash reserves and provides the liquidity to pursue its 2026 AI/HPC expansion. Paul Yu, CEO and Director of Cango, commented on EWCL betting on Cango to the tune of $10.5 million to maintain profitability into the future. “The increased investment from EWCL is a powerful vote of confidence in our strategic roadmap. The strengthened alignment with a major shareholder who thoroughly understands our vision enables us to execute with greater certainty and ambition. In 2026, we will continue to strengthen our Bitcoin mining operational capabilities, with a focus on improving hashrate efficiency, upgrading our mining fleet, and selectively acquiring strategic mining assets.” Cango has a long runway Despite the 20% oversubscription for the deal, analysts still believe Cango’s 7,400+ BTC reserves, 50 EH/s fleet, and $450.20 million market cap are still severely undervalued, backing the firm’s chain-to-cloud strategy to take off. Earlier this month, Greenridge analysts assigned Cango a $4 target price even before the announcement of its latest deal with EWCL. HCW analysts made a less bullish case, foreseeing a 100% gain to $3 as more probable for the CANG stock. The impetus for those bullish calls came from the strong numbers that Cango published in its Q3 2025 earnings report. Total revenue was up 60.6% at $224.6 million, with Bitcoin mining making up $220.9 million of the final count for the quarter. Cango’s operating income came in at $43.5 million, net income was $37.3 million, and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2025 was $80.1 million. During the third quarter, Cango increased its total output by 37.5% and daily production by 36% compared to the second quarter of 2025, earning a total of 1,930.8 BTC for the quarter at a daily average of 21 BTC. The firm managed to couple its productivity boost with an average return of about $18,000 on every Bitcoin it mined during the quarter. As of the end of September 2025, Cango reported that it had mined 5,810 BTC throughout its lifetime. Other than the provision of fresh capital to accelerate its core growth initiatives, the timing of EWCL’s investment in Cango represents a level of conviction that is bucking a trend of BTC miners and their backers reevaluating their business models as profitability is no longer a forgone conclusion due to falling token prices, ballooning hashrates and reduced rewards for mining blocks. Less profitable outfits have simply jumped ship, repurposing their mining equipment for hyperscalers to run AI data centers due to the competition in the market. Cango is on track for long-term AI compute expansion goals Cango has progressed past its ADR program phase to transition to a direct listing on the NYSE, which is expected to unlock capital structure, corporate transparency, and strategic benefits for a firm with plans to expand to serve the growing demand for AI compute capacity. Notably, Cango has activated pilot projects in both integrated energy solutions and distributed AI computing since entering the digital asset space in November 2024, pursuing expansion opportunities ahead of the market squeezes that have forced contemporaries to sharply pivot their businesses. According to official Cango documents, the firm maintains a long-term vision to build a global, distributed AI compute grid powered by green energy. It also plans to operate multiple hubs and edge nodes as a utility-like provider of AI compute for multinationals and large‑scale AI applications. Commenting on the opportunity for future pivots, Yu said: “Beyond our core mining business, this capital also supports the parallel development of our strategic pillars in energy and AI compute. We are actively exploring and investing in synergistic opportunities in these areas as we build toward our long-term goal: establishing an integrated, global infrastructure platform capable of powering the future digital economy.”",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-02 11:03:56

As trading desks return and liquidity improves, major digital assets typically resume clearer trends. XRP now sits at the center of renewed attention , with technical signals suggesting that its next move could arrive sooner than many expect. Market analyst Guy on the Earth recently shared his outlook on X, pointing to the end of the traditional Christmas consolidation period. He expects meaningful market movement to resume in early January and believes XRP could reach $2.20 by January 10. His projection comes at a time when XRP’s chart structure reflects both short-term recovery potential and longer-term technical risk. Monthly Support Breakdown Reshapes the Outlook XRP recently lost its monthly support level for the first time since November 2024. This breakdown carries weight because monthly timeframes often define broader market direction. XRP I'm back. The Christmas consolidation period we often see at this time of year is coming to a close. The real market movement will resume from next week. $2.20 by January 10th is my bias. The monthly support was lost for the first time since Nov 2024. The target of that… pic.twitter.com/J6Cr4hfZ0k — Guy on the Earth (@guyontheearth) January 1, 2026 Historically, similar losses have led to extended corrective phases rather than brief pullbacks. Based on standard technical projections, the measured downside target from this support loss sits near $0.90, a level that previously acted as a major demand zone. This structural weakness does not guarantee an immediate decline, but it does increase downside risk if bullish momentum fails to reassert itself. Daily Bullish Divergence Signals Short-Term Relief Despite the bearish signal on the monthly chart, the daily timeframe presents a more constructive development. XRP currently shows a bullish divergence , where momentum indicators rise while price action trends lower. Traders often interpret this pattern as a sign of selling exhaustion. Guy on the Earth believes this divergence could drive a relief rally at the start of the year. Such rallies often occur after prolonged consolidation and can produce sharp upside moves as sidelined capital re-enters the market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Critical Role of the $1.95 Level The sustainability of any rebound depends heavily on XRP’s ability to reclaim key resistance. According to the analysis, XRP must close back above $1.95 to reduce the risk of further downside later in January. Failure to do so would likely keep the broader bearish structure intact and reopen the path toward lower price targets. This level now acts as a dividing line between a corrective bounce and a more meaningful trend shift. Why $2.20 Matters So Much If XRP reaches $2.20, market reaction at that level will prove decisive. This zone aligns with previous support that turned into resistance and has repeatedly influenced XRP’s price behavior. A strong acceptance above $2.20 would signal renewed bullish control, while rejection would confirm lingering weakness. As liquidity returns and volatility expands, XRP stands at a defining technical moment. The weeks ahead will determine whether early 2026 begins with renewed upside momentum or deeper consolidation still ahead.

Milady is back,” Buterin wrote, before pointing to a series of technical upgrades completed last year, including higher gas limits, expanded blob capacity, improvements in node software quality, and major advances in zkEVMs and PeerDAS. He describes these milestones as some of Ethereum’s most important steps toward becoming a more powerful and scalable blockchain. Beyond Hype: Ethereum’s Long-Term Mission Buterin used the post to reiterate Ethereum’s broader mission, arguing that the network should not focus on short-term narratives or speculative trends, but instead serve as a foundational layer for a freer and more open internet. He highlights the importance of decentralized applications that operate without fraud, censorship, or third-party interference, continue functioning even if their original developers disappear and protect user privacy. Such applications, he said, should remain stable regardless of political, corporate, or ideological shifts. The Unusual Lore of Milady The renewed attention has once again drawn focus to Milady’s unconventional history. Launched in August 2021, Milady Maker is a collection of 10,000 neochibi-style NFTs on Ethereum created by the Remilia Collective. From the outset the project embraced irony, discomfort and intentionally broken aesthetics blending cute anime imagery with cryptic humor and insider references that many initially failed to understand. Milady — kkomysh (@kkomysh) January 1, 2026 Surviving Controversy and Volatility Milady has weathered numerous controversies including public disputes involving its creators, legal battles between founders, allegations of misconduct and technical incidents that resulted in the loss of funds. Despite these challenges the collection has repeatedly rebounded. In May 2023, a meme shared by Elon Musk triggered a surge in trading activity pushing Milady into the mainstream spotlight. Since then the ecosystem has continued to expand through new tokens, community initiatives and cultural events. Culture Still Moves Markets While the NFT market remains volatile, Milady’s latest rally underscores how cultural signals from influential figures can still move prices — particularly for projects rooted as much in internet subculture as financial speculation.

This milestone underscores Solana’s growing role beyond retail and memecoin trading into serious asset tokenization and institutional finance. Over the last month, tokenized RWAs on Solana climbed nearly 10% to an all-time high of $873.3 million. The number of RWA holders on Solana also grew by 18.4% to 126,236, according to RWA.xyz. The network’s surge comes at a time when there’s growing institutional interest in tokenizing traditional assets, such as US Treasuries and stocks. Most of the Solana tokenized RWAs already support US Treasuries, such as BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund and Ondo’s US Dollar Yield, which have a trading market cap of $255.4 million and $175.8 million, respectively. The uptick in tokenized assets on Solana includes not just traditional treasury products but also emerging tokenized equities, such as Tesla xStock and NVIDIA xStock, collectively adding tens of millions of dollars in capital to the network — evidence that institutional-grade products are taking root. The SEC approved six Solana ETFs recently Ethereum is still the leading blockchain in the tokenization market, with $12.3 billion in RWAs, followed by BNB Chain at $2 billion. Meanwhile, Solana is emerging as a serious contender after a strong December 2025. Capital Markets confirmed : “Entering the new year, regulated and yield-bearing RWAs continue to expand on Solana.” Ideally, institutional investors are driving the fast rise of RWAs on Solana. With six Solana ETFs approved in October 2025, institutional investors invested $765 million in the asset, marking the wider acceptance of Solana within traditional finance. Western Union (WU) also took a bold step when it decided to select Solana for its stablecoin remittance platform, which now has 150 million customers and is expected to be deployed in early 2026. However, despite growing traction across its ecosystem, Solana started 2026 near $125, down from the $190 high it reached in January 2025. Its price is also down 57% from its all-time high of $293.30 in early 2025. Nonetheless, the network has maintained a position of dominance above peers, producing $110 million in onchain app revenue over the past 30 days, far surpassing Ethereum and Hyperledger. Bitwise says Solana will stand out if the CLARITY Act is approved Crypto index fund manager Bitwise predicts Solana will hit a new record high if the CLARITY Act is approved in the US in 2026. It explained that the bill’s passage would spark a surge in overall crypto tokenization, with Solana standing out as a major beneficiary. It remarked, “We’re bullish on Ethereum and Solana. Really bullish. Primarily because we think stablecoins and tokenization are megatrends, and Ethereum and Solana are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of that growth.” Galaxy Research also expects Solana’s Internet Capital Markets to hit $2 billion in 2026, up from $750 million, as the U.S. prepares for over 50 new spot altcoin ETF launches. Ondo Finance, a leader in the RWA space, achieved $2 billion in 2025 trading volume and plans to launch on Solana in 2026, with SEC approval and European expansion already under its belt. Earlier this month, Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge, told CNBC that Solana is well-positioned to become a standard for tokenized assets in the industry. He still believes that tokenization will power the next phase of digital finance on fast, low-cost blockchain networks, adding that Solana’s unique technical features will make it a top choice for developers. Big names like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Fidelity getting involved with the Solana blockchain only emphasize the rising influence of the network and tokenization in traditional finance. These collaborations are set to strengthen capital inflows and credibility next year.

56728062,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257983,1767353110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Binance Monitoring Tag Triggers Scrutiny for ACA, D, DATA, and FLOW Tokens",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-monitoring-tag-aca-data-flow/,"BitcoinWorld Binance Monitoring Tag Triggers Scrutiny for ACA, D, DATA, and FLOW Tokens In a significant move for the digital asset ecosystem, global cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced on March 21, 2025, the application of a Monitoring Tag to four distinct tokens: Acala (ACA), D (D), Streamr (DATA), and Flow (FLOW). This decision immediately places these assets under heightened exchange scrutiny, potentially affecting their liquidity and investor perception. Consequently, market participants globally are analyzing the implications of this regulatory-style action from a leading trading platform. Understanding the Binance Monitoring Tag Mechanism Binance’s Monitoring Tag functions as a critical risk management tool. The exchange applies this designation to tokens that exhibit specific characteristics warranting closer observation. Primarily, these characteristics include unusual volatility patterns , significant development team changes , or shifts in project commitment levels . Furthermore, the tag serves as a transparent alert system for the platform’s vast user base. When a token receives this tag, Binance conducts regular reviews of its status. The exchange may then decide to maintain the tag, remove it, or escalate to a more severe classification. For instance, a token could potentially face delisting if its associated risks fail to diminish. This process underscores the platform’s proactive approach to market integrity and user protection. Deep Dive: The Four Tagged Tokens and Their Ecosystems Each of the four tagged tokens represents a unique segment of the blockchain industry. Their simultaneous tagging suggests Binance may be responding to broader market or sector-specific signals rather than isolated incidents. Acala (ACA): DeFi on Polkadot Acala operates as a decentralized finance hub and stablecoin platform within the Polkadot ecosystem. The ACA token facilitates governance, staking, and transaction fee payments on the network. Recent months have shown fluctuating developer activity and Total Value Locked (TVL) metrics on the Acala network, which may have contributed to the monitoring decision. D (D): The Denarius Project Denarius (D) is a hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake cryptocurrency focusing on privacy and fast transactions. It represents a different class of asset compared to the others, being a standalone blockchain. Its trading volume on Binance has historically been lower, which can sometimes correlate with higher volatility and susceptibility to market manipulation. Streamr (DATA): Decentralized Data Broadcasting The Streamr network aims to create a decentralized protocol for real-time data streams and monetization. The DATA token powers this ecosystem. The project’s pivot towards more enterprise-focused data solutions in 2024 may have introduced execution risk, a factor exchanges commonly monitor. Flow (FLOW): NFT and Gaming Blockchain Flow is a layer-1 blockchain designed for next-generation games, apps, and digital assets, famously hosting NBA Top Shot. The FLOW token secures the network and pays for transaction fees. Despite strong branding, the broader NFT and gaming sector has experienced a notable cooling period throughout 2024, impacting associated tokens. Immediate Market Impact and Trader Considerations The announcement triggered immediate, measurable reactions across trading venues. Typically, a Monitoring Tag can lead to short-term price depreciation due to negative sentiment and potential sell-offs from risk-averse investors. However, it also increases visibility, sometimes attracting speculative traders. Users must note key changes when trading tagged tokens on Binance. Risk Warning Pop-ups : Traders encounter additional click-through warnings. Periodic Reviews : The tokens’ status is not permanent and will be reassessed. Potential Liquidity Shifts : Some institutional or algorithmic traders may reduce exposure. Historical data from previous Binance tagging events shows varied outcomes. Some tokens addressed underlying issues and had the tag removed, while others faced further restrictions. Therefore, this action represents a cautionary phase, not a definitive judgment. Expert Analysis on Exchange-Led Governance Market analysts view this move as part of a larger trend of exchanges assuming quasi-regulatory roles. “Centralized exchanges like Binance are increasingly the first line of defense for retail investors,” notes Dr. Lena Chen, a fintech researcher at the Cambridge Digital Assets Programme. “Their tagging systems create a de facto screening process that can preempt more severe market disruptions.” This analysis highlights the evolving responsibility of trading platforms beyond mere order matching. Data from blockchain analytics firms indicates that tagged tokens often experience a 15-30% increase in social media discussion volume, much of it focused on project fundamentals. This can pressure development teams to communicate more transparently with their communities. The table below summarizes key metrics for the tagged tokens prior to the announcement. Pre-Announcement Token Metrics (7-Day Average) Token Price Volatility Binance Volume Share GitHub Commits (30d) ACA High 42% 18 D Very High 65% 5 DATA Medium 38% 24 FLOW Medium 55% 31 The Path Forward for Projects and Investors For the teams behind ACA, D, DATA, and FLOW, the Monitoring Tag serves as a formal catalyst for action. Successful navigation of this period typically involves clear roadmap execution, enhanced community communication, and demonstrable network growth. Investors, meanwhile, should treat the tag as a mandatory flag for enhanced due diligence. It is crucial to distinguish between a Monitoring Tag and a delisting warning. The former is observational, while the latter is punitive. Binance has established specific criteria for removal, often related to improved liquidity, stabilized development activity, and reduced compliance concerns. Projects have successfully emerged from similar tags in the past, sometimes emerging stronger with renewed focus. Conclusion Binance’s decision to apply a Monitoring Tag to ACA, D, DATA, and FLOW tokens represents a pivotal moment for these projects and their communities. This action underscores the exchange’s commitment to risk management and market stability in the dynamic 2025 cryptocurrency landscape. Ultimately, the tag provides a structured observation period, offering both a warning to users and an opportunity for projects to reinforce their foundational strengths. The market will now watch closely to see how each token responds to this new layer of scrutiny. FAQs Q1: What does a Binance Monitoring Tag mean for my existing holdings? A1: Your holdings are not automatically affected. You can still hold, deposit, and withdraw the tokens. The tag primarily serves as a risk warning for new traders and subjects the token to periodic exchange reviews. Q2: Can a token recover after receiving a Monitoring Tag? A2: Yes. If the project addresses the concerns that prompted the tag—such as improving liquidity, development activity, or network stability—Binance can remove the designation. Several tokens have had tags removed in previous years. Q3: Does this tag affect trading on other exchanges? A3: Not directly. The Binance Monitoring Tag is specific to Binance’s platform. However, other exchanges may take note of the action and conduct their own reviews, as it signals recognized risk factors. Q4: How often does Binance review tagged tokens? A4: While Binance does not publish a fixed schedule, reviews typically occur quarterly or in response to significant project developments. The exchange makes announcements regarding any status changes. Q5: Is the Monitoring Tag a precursor to delisting? A5: Not necessarily. It is a separate, less severe classification. A delisting warning is a more serious alert that comes later if monitored risks are not mitigated. The Monitoring Tag is an intermediate, observational step.

56728297,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=887591,1767353119,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56728297.jpeg,China targets end-to-end use cases in move to capture value from AI boom,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robots-fortune-telling-apps-chinas-ai-boom/,"A coastal city in southeastern China has transformed into a major center for artificial intelligence development, with companies working on everything from advanced robotics to smartphone applications. Hangzhou, often called China’s Silicon Valley, has become home to tech firms building sophisticated computer chips, robots, and systems that connect human brains to computers. At the same time, newer entrepreneurs are launching AI-powered pet apps and fortune-telling programs. The city’s tech sector has gained international attention one year after DeepSeek put Chinese AI innovation in the spotlight. Both China and the United States are pushing hard to develop what experts consider the next big step in AI: systems that work in the real world. Companies from Meta to Tencent are building “world models” AI programs designed to help robots move around, guide cars without drivers, or predict real-world situations like weather patterns. China’s government has made “embodied intelligence” a key goal in its next Five-Year Plan . Last November, a commission that advises the U.S. Congress recommended that Washington increase funding and speed up approvals for self-driving systems and robots. The commission warned that China is moving quickly ahead in physical AI applications. Cheaper energy offsets chip disadvantage for AI startups Several Hangzhou startups are preparing to sell shares to the public. Manycore, which specializes in spatial intelligence, along with robot manufacturers Unitree and Deep Robotics – part of a group locals call the “six little dragons” – plan to list in Hong Kong or on mainland Chinese stock exchanges, joining other AI companies going public. Victor Huang, who helped start Manycore after working as a software engineer at Nvidia, said his company relies on chips from the California-based manufacturer because they provide better computing power for the energy they use. However, he pointed to an advantage China has: cheaper electricity costs. Huang explained that a three-nanometer chip uses roughly 30% less power than chips that are five or seven nanometers. But companies can still compete if their electricity costs are 40%-50% lower, he said. “Computing power cannot be viewed in isolation,” Huang told CNBC . “It depends on data quality, energy supply and operating conditions.” Manycore made its spatial AI model available for free, a strategy China favors, unlike many U.S . companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic that charge for access. Huang said this lets the company collect user feedback, though it also limits income since people don’t have to pay. “So you’ll get pressure from investors,” he said. China’s AI development has concentrated on practical uses rather than pursuing the kind of super-intelligent AI that fascinates many in Silicon Valley. Examples include personalized suggestions from Baidu Map and ByteDance’s chatbot called Doubao. In December, Doubao led China’s AI apps with 155 million people using it each week, almost twice as many as its nearest rival, DeepSeek ‘s chatbot, according to QuestMobile, a company that tracks business data. Doubao’s success shows that ease of use and practical value might matter more than technical complexity. Liangzhu emerges as China’s experimental AI hub A more relaxed, experimental approach is growing alongside these commercial efforts. While major players like Alibaba and DeepSeek focus on advanced AI, Liangzhu has become the center of more unusual AI projects. After relocating to Liangzhu in 2025, Alex Wei is developing an AI software that is based on conventional Chinese fortune-telling techniques. He’s investigating how AI can meet people’s emotional needs. Developers are drawn to Liangzhu because of its low business pressure. “You can come to Liangzhu with 1,000 renminbi ($143) and leave with your product demo,” Wei stated. “It’s a really welcoming location. You can find assistance for even a little app that serves a thousand users; you don’t need to have a unicorn product.” This attention is changing how startups plan for growth. Many are targeting users outside China, with some founders planning to use China’s manufacturing networks to offer lower prices globally. Tough competition at home and Chinese consumers’ unwillingness to pay for apps have also pushed startups to seek international markets, observers say. Afra Wang, who publishes the Concurrent newsletter about China and Silicon Valley, said some developers are using AI to break away from traditional jobs in uncertain employment markets. They’re working to become “superindividuals” who run profitable businesses alone or with very small teams. Wang cautioned that some businesses are simply adding AI features for marketing purposes, from air conditioners to mirrors that check if sunscreen is properly applied. She describes some of these as “physical AI slop”, borrowing the term used for poor-quality content produced by AI. For now, Hangzhou’s business owners are trying almost every concept, from practical to playful, in a fast-changing market.

The team behind the project has revealed that its lending and borrowing model has gone through a thorough audit by Halborn Security. In addition, all the audit recommendations have been implemented, and the project’s first version is set to debut on testnet, marking a major step in the evolution of the platform from an idea to a functional DeFi project. Currently, the MUTM token is being offered at a $0.04 in presale, with a total raise of $19,550,000. The token has attracted a good number of participants, with 18,650 people registered as holders. Specialists are measuring the potential price that the token might take up in the future, using its actual utility in place of speculation. Among the top cryptos that people consider investing in currently, Mutuum Finance is one that has a solid structure in place. Presale Mechanics For MUTM The current stage at which Mutuum Finance is selling its token is Phase 7, and the price at which the token sells has been set at $0.04. However, this price has shown a rise of 300% from Phase 1, when the price per token was set at $0.01. The price increment may appear very low and aims at creating value for the investors. For example, when buying at $0.04, an investment of $300 will give an investor a total of 7,500 tokens. However, if the price rises to $0.60 within the short span, the investment will rise to $4,500. Launch to Growth The token will be launched with a price of $0.06. This might allow a possible return of around 440% for those who are purchasing it right now. But according to experts, this is only the starting point. The project is building a complete DeFi platform with a focus on lending and borrowing. The further it advances with usage, the more the demand for the token is expected to rise as MUTM solidifies its place as the top crypto to buy. Comparisons to AVAX A way to make clear how a price of $15 in 2027 is possible for the price of the MUTM token in the future will use the example of Avalanche (AVAX) in the years of 2020-2021. At the end of 2020, the price of AVAX was in the vicinity of $2.80, but in November of 2021, its price jumped to the vicinity of $146, a rise of well over 5,000% in a little more than a year as per crypto news. This kind of growth will come as Mutuum Finance develops to maturity, when the network is widely in use. MUTM’s Illustrative Gains Specialists use simple examples to illustrate possible results. With a price of $0.04, an investment of $500 will buy 12,500 tokens. Once the price increases to $15, the investment will be worth $187,500. A current investment of $1,000 could increase to $375,000, and even an investment of $100 could increase to $37,500. Such examples illustrate why Mutuum Finance is believed to be an attractive option for long-term investors rather than short-term traders. Mutuum Finance has been cautious in that they subjected the project’s lending and borrowing smart contracts to a security audit by Halborn Security. This process has been completed and its recommendations integrated in the platform. This will avert threats associated with scaling up within a stipulated timeframe that is central to predictions that indicate a considerable increase over a long period. So far in the benchmarking of success in the form of AVAX, the key takeaway is to get in early before the mass market does. AVAX shows that legitimate use and subsequent growth are able to drive serious ROI within a relatively short time frame. Entry prices are attractively low in MUTM, and it clearly offers a legitimate purpose through DeFi that in and of itself offers potential to hit the target of $15 by 2027.

Strategy’s $17.5 Billion Loss Numbers Stun Community,https://bitcoinist.com/did-saylors-bitcoin-bet-fail/,"Market expert Andy has drawn attention to a significant loss that Michael Saylor’s Strategy took in the last quarter of 2025, mainly due to its Bitcoin exposure. Meanwhile, renowned economist Peter Schiff also highlighted how the MSTR stock would have been one of the worst-performing stocks if the company were in the S&P 500. Michael Saylor’s Strategy Posts $17.5 Billion Loss Amid Bitcoin Decline In an X post , Andy noted that Saylor’s Strategy will report GAAP earnings for a fourth-quarter loss of $17.5 billion in 2025, which ranks as the largest quarterly loss in history. This follows Bitcoin’s decline in the fourth quarter, with the leading crypto dropping below $100,000. This caused this loss for the company, given its BTC exposure. Strategy’s Bitcoin exposure also contributed to the MSTR stock’s massive decline last year as BTC fell. The stock recorded a 2025 loss of almost 50%, dropping to the low $150 from its high of around $450. In an X post , Schiff noted that the stock’s decline in 2025 would make it the 6th-worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 if Saylor’s company were in the index. The economist again criticized Saylor’s Bitcoin model, stating that buying BTC was basically all the company did, which he claimed has destroyed shareholder value. However, it is worth noting that Strategy’s Bitcoin exposure contributed to the company’s strong Q2 and Q3 earnings last year. In Q2, the company recorded $14 billion in GAAP operating income, while it recorded $3.9 billion in the third quarter. Furthermore, MSTR stock has remained one of the best-performing assets since Saylor and Strategy adopted BTC in 2020. The stock is up over 260% in the last five years. Meanwhile, Schiff stated that the MSTR stock will likely deliver even worse returns in 2026 than in 2025. He believes this would happen because of Bitcoin, which the economist expects to drop more this year than it did in 2025, putting stress on the MSTR shares in the process. Reason To Still Be Bullish On Strategy and MSTR Market expert Adam Livingston stated that he remains bullish on Michael Saylor’s Strategy and MSTR stock because the company is hedging against inflation with Bitcoin rather than holding cash. Livingston noted that the real risk isn’t the volatility with the MSTR stock or market movement, but inflation, which continues to erode. The expert further declared that Bitcoin changes the risk equation, thanks to its scarcity, which helps protect companies like Strategy and individuals against ‘money printing.’ Interestingly, Livingston suggested that Saylor’s company could become one of the most valuable in the world, thanks to its BTC exposure . He noted that long-term purchasing power is the objective, and this is where he expects the company to stand out.",Bitcoin News|Adam Livingston|ANDY|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|GAAP|michael saylor|mstr|Peter Schiff|S&P 500|Strategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-02 11:30:46

Mudrex analyst Akshat Siddhant said long-term holder supply has turned positive for the first time in months, rising by about 10,700 BTC, while continued exchange outflows point to reduced selling pressure. He noted that a break above $89,500 could open the door to a move toward $100,000, with $87,000 acting as key support. Broader markets echoed the cautious optimism, with US equity futures edging higher as enthusiasm around big tech and AI carried over from late 2025. Attention now shifts to US economic data delayed by the government shutdown, Federal Reserve rate expectations, and political risk tied to President Donald Trump’s expected decision on the next Fed chair. Meanwhile, gold and silver extended strong gains, and the dollar began the year weaker after its steepest annual drop in eight years. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $88,980, stabilizing after a volatile end to 2025. The chart shows BTC rebounding from a late-November low around $85,000, followed by a period of sideways consolidation through December. From a technical standpoint, $88,000–$88,500 has emerged as a key near-term support zone. A sustained hold above this area could allow BTC to test the upper boundary of the range near $90,000, with further resistance sitting around $92,000. A decisive break above that level would be needed to shift near-term momentum back in favor of bulls. On the downside, a loss of $88,000 would likely bring $85,000 back into focus. Below that, a deeper pullback could open the door toward the $82,000–$83,000 region, which previously acted as a demand zone during the November selloff. Ethereum, meanwhile, is trading around $3,024, showing early signs of stabilization after a sharp multi-month decline. The chart highlights a clear downtrend from September highs above $4,500, followed by a steep breakdown in November and choppy recovery attempts throughout December. ETH recently bounced from lows near $2,800, but upside momentum remains tentative. For ETH, the $3,000–$3,050 area now acts as a critical pivot range. Holding above this zone could allow a move toward $3,200, with further resistance near $3,400 if momentum improves. On the downside, failure to defend $3,000 may send ETH back toward $2,800, with additional support around $2,700. Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment remains cautious, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index still lodged in the fear zone. According to CoinMarketCap data shown in the chart, the index currently reads 34, underscoring a hesitant mood among investors despite recent stabilization in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. While sentiment has improved modestly from 27 last week, it remains well below neutral levels and far from the optimism seen earlier in 2025. The index is also sharply higher than last month’s extreme fear reading of 16, suggesting panic has eased, but confidence has yet to return. There is no US spot ETF flow data for Jan. 1 due to the New Year market closure. The latest available figures reflect Dec. 31, the final trading day of 2025. On that session, US Bitcoin spot ETFs ended the year with net outflows of $348.1 million, according to SoSoValue, despite solid activity with $2.83 billion in daily trading volume. Outflows were led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $99.05 million leave the fund, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $46.58 million in net outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC also continued to bleed assets, recording $69.09 million in outflows, while Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB posted $76.53 million in net redemptions. Even with the daily pullback, cumulative net inflows into US BTC spot ETFs remain strong at $56.61 billion, with total net assets of $113.29 billion, representing about 6.47% of Bitcoin’s market cap. US Ethereum spot ETFs also closed the year under pressure, posting $72.06 million in net outflows on Dec. 31, alongside $808.1 million in trading volume. BlackRock’s ETHA led the outflows, seeing $21.51 million leave the fund, while Grayscale’s ETH product recorded $31.98 million in net redemptions. Fidelity’s FETH also posted smaller outflows of $2.22 million, reflecting broad-based caution across issuers. Despite the day’s weakness, cumulative net inflows for US ETH spot ETFs stand at $12.33 billion, with total net assets of $17.95 billion, roughly 5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, crypto-related losses from hacks and cybersecurity exploits fell sharply in December, dropping 60% month-on-month to about $76 million.

The extended decline is leading some market observers to question the endurance of crypto’s traditional four-year boom and bust cycle, even as underlying network activity tells a different story. A Year of Persistent Declines Data from CoinGlass shared by market commentator Ted Pillows shows that in 2025, ETH fell in every month from February through April and again from September through December. The most severe single-month drop came in February, when the asset lost 32%. Other major monthly setbacks included a 22% fall in November and an 18.7% decline in March. The few positive months offered limited relief, with the largest gain being a 48.8% increase in July, followed by an 18.8% rise in August. Even so, the balance tilted heavily negative, making 2025 Ethereum’s weakest year since 2018, when repeated double-digit losses, including a 53.8% crash in March of that year, defined a deep market reset after the ICO boom. Currently, ETH is attempting to stabilize, trading around $3,020 as of early January 2026. This represents a minor 24-hour increase of 1.6%, but the cryptocurrency remains down 11.2% over the past year. The price is hovering at a critical technical junction, sitting just above its daily 200-period moving average and a key horizontal support zone. According to analyst Daan Crypto Trades, the chart has become highly compressed , suggesting a significant move could be imminent. A sustained daily close above the $3,000 level is viewed as necessary for upward momentum, while a drop back below it would likely extend the recent period of sideways trading. Building Through the Downturn Despite last year’s gloom, on-chain metrics and developer activity paint a picture of strong health and growth, with Ethereum setting a new record by deploying 8.7 million smart contracts in a single quarter, breaking the previous record from Q2 2021. Analysts believe that the consistent growth in deployments over several quarters shows real demand, mainly due to the growth of Layer 2 rollups, real-world asset projects, stablecoins, and wallet infrastructure. Network usage is also climbing, with Ethereum recently processing a record 2.2 million transactions in one day while average fees have dropped to approximately $0.17, a stark contrast to the $200 fees seen during peak periods in 2022. However, for traders, the focus remains on key price levels, with a major resistance zone sitting near $4,800. Some chart patterns suggest a breakout above that level could open a path toward $8,500. In the near term, though, the market is watching for a confirmed break from its current compressed state, with large holders continuing to accumulate ETH even as its price struggles to find lasting positive momentum.

The filing positions Grayscale to offer regulated exposure to TAO, the native token of Bittensor’s decentralized AI marketplace, through a passive investment vehicle holding digital assets valued at $7.97 million as of December 31. The trust currently trades on OTCQX with 1.88 million shares outstanding and charges a 2.5% total expense ratio while maintaining 0.0192 TAO per share. Grayscale structured the product as a Delaware statutory trust formed in April 2024, with shares issued in 10,000-unit baskets exclusively through authorized participants who create or redeem holdings using either in-kind TAO deposits or cash orders executed by liquidity providers.

In-kind orders allow broker-dealers to deposit TAO directly into BitGo’s custody vault or withdraw assets during redemptions. In contrast, cash orders utilize Coinbase as a prime broker to execute purchases on behalf of participants through segregated accounts. Cash transactions employ either variable-fee structures, in which liquidity providers absorb price differentials, or actual execution orders that place price risk on authorized participants between trade-date NAV and final settlement values. The trust calculates net asset value daily at 4:00 PM Eastern using the CoinDesk TAO CCIXber Reference Rate, with cascading backup protocols that default to the Coin Metrics Real-Time Rate or Coinbase spot pricing if the primary index becomes unavailable. BNY Mellon serves as administrator and transfer agent, while Coinbase Custody Trust Company handles digital asset safekeeping alongside BitGo, though the trust currently prohibits staking activities pending IRS guidance on grantor trust tax treatment. Grayscale committed to irrevocably abandoning rights to tokens from network forks or airdrops to preserve the structure’s tax classification, potentially forfeiting future value from protocol upgrades. European ETP Wave Signals Broader Altcoin ETF Competition The Grayscale filing arrives as Deutsche Digital Assets and Safello launched the Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP on SIX Swiss Exchange in October, offering 1.49% fee exposure to staking rewards through the Kaiko Safello Staked Bittensor Index. That product generated immediate institutional interest, as TAO rallied 42% in October to $427.59, though the token has since declined to current levels amid broader crypto market year-end outflows. Bitwise files 11 crypto strategy ETFs with SEC targeting DeFi, Layer-2, and privacy protocols for NYSE Arca trading. #Bitwise #ETF https://t.co/4lfgX8jyOM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 31, 2025 Bitwise simultaneously filed for eleven strategy-based crypto ETFs on December 30, including a dedicated TAO product alongside funds tracking AAVE, UNI, NEAR, SUI, STRK, ZEC, ENA, and other protocols. The wave of applications followed the SEC’s October 2025 introduction of generic listing standards , which eliminated case-by-case approval requirements and accelerated institutional product launches across formerly restricted altcoin markets. Speaking with Cryptonews, Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, noted that altcoin ETF launches are “ colliding with tight liquidity, low investor confidence and pronounced market underperformance, ” but argued new listings “ create a steady inflow channel that can serve as a liquidity buffer. ” Ending 2025, XRP ETFs posted six consecutive days of inflows exceeding $420 million, while Solana products attracted $2.29 million on December 31 even as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded combined outflows of $420 million that session. Source: SosoValue Despite immediate market headwinds, Grayscale’s filing positions the firm to capture institutional demand once macro conditions stabilize. The trust’s net asset value declined 51.6% year-over-year to $4.24 per share as of December 31, trading at a 124% premium to NAV at $9.50 market price. Notably, the filing disclosed risks, including TAO’s historical volatility ranging from $188.82 to $709.06 annually, potential SEC classification that could force liquidation, and irreversible custody losses from compromised private keys despite multi-signature cold storage protocols across geographically distributed facilities.

According to a recent report from Delphi Digital, a bearish market sentiment has taken hold over the past few months, with some market watchers claiming the top of the four-year market cycle has already passed. The crypto market analytics platform believes investor sentiment has changed due to Bitcoin’s muted end-of-year performance, but the lines between traditional financial assets and crypto are also blurred, as companies experiment with new forms of tokenization. Delphi market analysis: Equity is moving onchain Per Delphi’s 2026 outlook , the distinction between tokens and traditional equity is now more difficult to define since companies like California-based Securitize are filing for initial public offerings (IPOs) while simultaneously looking into tokenization. Crypto is facing a token identity crisis. The lines are blurring on both sides. Equity is moving onchain with companies like Securitize filing for IPOs. Tokens are becoming more equity like through MetaDAO's ownership coins and Uniswap's fee switch. Customer Acquisition Cost… pic.twitter.com/CgjHQuHq8q — Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) January 1, 2026 Some crypto projects, such as MetaDAO have launched ownership tokens that mimic how traditional financial firms issue shares, and decentralized platform Uniswap has added fee switches, much like how equity-like returns are for token holders. Among the upcoming token models is the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tokens, which are distinct to equity-like tokens or governance mechanisms because they fund user acquisition at scale. PayPal is one of the many companies moving forward with tokenization, having spent over $60 million in venture capital cash on incentives to begin its quest for digital assets. Yet, per Delphi, CAC tokens could achieve comparable results through token emissions, where early adopters can receive larger rewards that taper as the network grows. The analysts cited Worldcoin as the best example of this model, reportedly spreading over 500 million WLD tokens to onboard users and expanding the footprint of its World App. According to data from Dune analytics, the project crossed $3.8 billion market cap level during the bull market run in mid-2025, although its token’s price traded below $2.5 in the whole of last year. US regulatory clarity opens crypto market to institutions Changes in regulations have made things much clearer for the crypto industry, especially in the US and Europe. POTUS signed an executive order in the US to encourage responsible innovation and the use of stablecoins backed by the dollar. However, he also clearly said that a CBDC was not an option. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went a step ahead to support experimentation by issuing no-action letters for the Depository Trust Company’s tokenization pilot and the Fuse Crypto Token. US Congress is in support of crypto-friendly candidates for 2026 midterms. This comes against the backdrop of discussing the CLARITY Act , which places crypto regulatory oversight in the hands of the CFTC. Although some economists believe there are still some hiccups in country-by-country jurisdictional rules, MiCA has been protecting investors and has made the environment more palatable for institutions to join in. Crypto market mulls optimism as Bitcoin trades just below $90,000 Despite the ongoing gloomy outlook, there is a perception that the industry has grown enough to handle downturns and escape historic crypto winters. “It’s more of an industry now. So if there is a winter or a downturn, it’s not going to be a complete lights-out moment,” Kaiko senior researcher Adam Morgan McCarthy told NPR. The crypto derivatives market has approximately $2.2 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options reaching expiration, with the former taking up $1.87 billion in notional value currently outstanding. At the time of this reporting, the king coin is trading at around $88,970, just above the $88,000 “max pain” point, where option writers may start counting heavy losses. Coinglass open interest data shows 14,194 call contracts have been placed against 6,806 puts, which could mean hodlers are bracing for a price comeback upwards of $90,000.

Though measured in tone, the Commodity Strategist hinted he expects 2026 to be a crisis year by providing a historical parallel. Specifically, he opined that President Donald Trump shall suffer from poor timing, much like President Herbert Hoover. Hoover famously entered the Oval Office in 1929, mere months before the Great Depression started. McGlone provided both evidence for his assumptions and issued several stark predictions. Specifically, he identified gold’s grabbing of alpha – its ability to outperform the market – as a major warning sign evident through much of 2025. Gold grabbing alpha in 2025 was a warning – especially vs. falling crude oil Unfortunately for investors hoping to benefit from the precious metals boom, the market expert also opined that gold, silver , and most similar assets will suffer from, in his words, ‘went up-too-much’ dangers in 2026. Similarly, McGlone identified T-Bonds – the debt securities of the American government – as the stars of the market, as he estimates they will be the ones to ‘take alpha’ from the yellow metal in the ongoing year. Will the crypto market bloom in 2026? Mike McGlone simultaneously gave a word of warning to cryptocurrency investors as he forecasted that a Bitcoin ( BTC ) fall to $50,000 is more likely than a rally back to $100,000. As evidence, he cited that Bloomberg’s Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the digital assets market – dropped 19% last year. Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000. Cryptos to lead the next post-inflation deflation cycle due to wealth creation reversion.

However, while the pressure is clearly visible, artificial intelligence ( AI ) models suggest that the cryptocurrency may somewhat stabilize this month and maybe see some gains. Some early signs of this stabilization may already be evident, with Bitcoin trading at around $89,500 at the time of writing, up nearly 2% on the day due to a supportive technical picture. Bitcoin price reclaims key technical levels A few of the core momentum measures have also strengthened, led by the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 70.4, signaling firm upside momentum. The MACD value of 319.5 likewise remains positive. Trend strength readings further reinforced the picture. For instance, the Average Directional Index ( ADX ) rose to 65.2, a level typically associated with bullish directional moves. Similarly, a positive Rate of Change ( ROC ) at 1.308 indicates that bulls are firmly in control of order flow. However, it must be noted that the white/red Stochastic Oscillator, which measures price momentum over the past nine periods smoothed across six periods, is at 99.2, suggesting a consolidation period or a pullback toward short-term moving averages is possible.

Tesla delivered 1,942 vehicles in France in December, a 66% crash from the same time last year. In Sweden, December turned into a total flop, with Tesla’s deliveries falling 71%. The full-year figure didn’t do any damage control either, 67% lower than 2024. Even with electric vehicles becoming more popular across the continent, Tesla couldn’t keep up.While the rest of the battery-powered car industry enjoyed a 27% growth in registrations during the first eleven months, Tesla’s total registrations during that same stretch tanked 28%. Only Norway stuck with the brand. The country recorded 5,679 new Tesla registrations in December, nearly 90% higher than the previous year. It’s no surprise, 96% of new cars sold in Norway last year were fully electric. European buyers turn away as Musk’s politics stir backlash Sales didn’t just fall because of car prices or competitors. There was also the Elon Musk factor. Across Germany and the UK, Tesla faced a wave of customer pushback after Musk openly backed far-right political figures. That didn’t help brand loyalty. Some buyers looked elsewhere. Elon hasn’t backed down though. He’s still betting hard on Tesla’s Full Self-Driving feature, known as FSD, to drive future sales in Europe. But that plan has one big problem, it’s not legal there yet. European regulators haven’t approved it, and Tesla is now clashing with the exact agency it needs a greenlight from. RDW, the Dutch authority that handles vehicle approvals for the EU, is supposed to be the company’s “main path” to clearance, according to a post by Tesla on Musk’s X platform. The post claimed RDW “has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026.” That statement didn’t land well. The very next day, RDW said that was false. “We do not share details about ongoing applications from manufacturers,” the agency said in a public statement. “Both RDW and Tesla are aware of the efforts needed to reach a decision on this matter in February. Whether this timeline will be met is yet to be determined in the coming period.” Tesla pushes for FSD approval while regulators push back Elon isn’t sitting quietly about the delay. During Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, he told investors, “Pressure from our customers in Europe to push the regulators to approve would be appreciated.” That speech came right before the company quietly updated its website with new FSD safety data, data that has already been called out by critics for weak comparisons and flawed methods. After the meeting, Tesla’s Europe team posted a link to RDW’s contact page, asking supporters to thank the agency for supposedly greenlighting the system. The regulator did not take that well. A statement went up on RDW’s site the following day, saying: “We thank everyone who has already done so, but would like to urge people not to contact us about this matter. It takes up unnecessary time for our customer service. Furthermore, this will have no impact whatsoever on whether or not the schedule will be met.” Back on the numbers side, analysts expect Tesla to report an 11% drop in global deliveries for the fourth quarter. Tesla, clearly bracing for worse, put out its own estimate suggesting that drop might actually be closer to 15%. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

XRP has entered such a phase. As institutional adoption replaces retail speculation as the dominant theme, analysts increasingly frame XRP as financial infrastructure rather than a typical cryptocurrency. This shift explains why unconventional valuation scenarios now command serious attention. The conversation gained momentum after Xaif highlighted a detailed discussion on X that explored XRP through a non-retail framework. Rather than promoting a price prediction, the analysis examined how XRP could behave if banks, ETFs, and cross-border payment systems drive demand at scale. That distinction sits at the heart of the emerging $10,000 price support scenario. XRP HIGHLIGHT Even talk of $10K price support is grabbing attention… imagine the demand when the real wave hits. In a recent discussion, the analysis broke down non-retail assumptions and focused on bank adoption + ETF mania as key drivers. One line stood out: Not a… https://t.co/rW9OjOiXQ0 pic.twitter.com/OGIN1UyIYN — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) January 1, 2026 Moving Beyond Retail-Based Valuation Models Traditional crypto valuation relies heavily on speculative demand and retail-driven cycles. The analysis referenced by Xaif rejects that approach for XRP. It argues that analysts should evaluate XRP based on liquidity requirements, settlement efficiency, and institutional balance sheet dynamics. In this framework, price reflects utility and capital velocity rather than hype. This perspective assumes that large financial institutions require deep, stable liquidity pools. If XRP serves as a core bridge asset for cross-border settlements, demand would scale with transaction volume rather than market sentiment. Paul Barron on XRP’s Institutional Positioning The discussion reached a wider audience through a clip from The Paul Barron Network, where host Paul Barron examined the analysis in detail. He directly compared XRP’s position to Ethereum’s current standing, stating, “Where Ethereum is right now versus where XRP is today—and I’m basically talking about the number two and three asset—Ripple’s plans for becoming that favorite position for banks continues to excel or accelerate.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Barron emphasized that the scenario avoids traditional price forecasting. He explained, “The guy is analyzing this more from a standpoint of what happens if we see an absolute move on XRP that’s based around not the normal assumptions.” He stressed that the analysis excludes retail behavior and focuses on institutional mechanics. ETFs, Banks, and Cross-Border Liquidity The scenario incorporates three primary drivers: bank adoption, ETF expansion, and cross-border payment demand. Barron noted that these forces could converge, saying the analysis considers “big bank adoption, what we’re going to see in the ETF craze that most likely will take off, and then we start to look at just the cross-border side.” Unlike speculative inflows, institutional usage demands consistent liquidity. If XRP fulfills that role, price support could emerge at levels that appear extreme by retail standards. Why the $10,000 Scenario Draws Attention The discussion does not present a forecast. Barron clarified this point, stating, “Not a prediction—a scenario based on institutional math, liquidity, and cross-border adoption, not retail hype.” That distinction explains why the $10,000 figure functions as a theoretical support concept rather than a near-term target. As institutional narratives continue to reshape crypto markets, XRP’s valuation debate reflects a deeper shift. Investors now increasingly assess XRP through the lens of global financial infrastructure, not speculative cycles.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $150L by the end of 2026 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2032, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 has become highly debated. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rally after the halving were expected to bring more clarity, but instead they’ve brought mixed volatility in Bitcoin price forecast. However, top analysts are bullish on BTC price prediction this year. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach about $250,000 by 2026. He bases this view on Bitcoin’s limited supply and the possibility that institutions and major companies will continue to adopt it. Investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has made a similar prediction, arguing that Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a strong store of value in a world where traditional currencies are becoming less stable. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction 2026 model.

Currently, the price is aiming for a consolidation within a bullish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces minor buying pressure Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bullish pressure as it surged toward $90K. Currently, the BTC price is facing buying domination around immediate resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $854 million, showing a surge in trading interest today.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 52, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Buying domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $90,689, it will fuel a bullish rally to $94,661. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $86,356, beginning a bearish trend to $83,468. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying pressure as sellers failed to push the price below immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 4,279 BTC for $451.06 million at an average price of $105,412. The report revealed that the company held 35,102 BTC as of December 30, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction January 2026 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a recovery around January 2026. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2026 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the years following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price after a downturn in 2025. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2026. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2026 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $150,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2028, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2029 By 2029, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2030 Projections for 2030 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2031 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2032 The forecast for 2032 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2026, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $150,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,738 by the end of 2028. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November.

In an update posted Thursday, Flow said it had made “significant progress” on its remediation plan and had begun phase two of the recovery, which is expected to take several days. UPDATE: EVM RESTORATION ACCELERATED & PHASE 2 PROGRESS Remediation of the Flow network continues in Phase 2 with significant progress. The Flow core developer team has identified a path to restore EVM functionality during ongoing Cadence remediation. This unlocks EVM to proceed… — Flow.com (@flow_blockchain) January 1, 2026 The foundation said developers have identified a way to restore Ethereum Virtual Machine functionality in parallel with ongoing fixes to Flow’s native Cadence environment. Flow Resumes Blocks and Moves Toward Full Recovery Flow noted that the EVM network could return within 24 hours of the announcement, barring unforeseen issues. Block production on the network has already resumed, with the latest block stamped at 09:30:50 UTC on Jan. 2, 2026. Source: Flowscan Cadence-based transactions are processing, while account-by-account verification continues for wallets affected by the exploit. Flow said fraudulent tokens are being removed through on-chain transactions that can be independently verified, and that more than 99.9% of accounts are expected to retain full access once EVM functionality is restored. The exploit occurred on Dec. 27, when an attacker took advantage of a vulnerability in Flow’s execution layer to mint and distribute fraudulent tokens, moving roughly $3.9 million in assets across multiple bridges before validators halted the chain. @flow_blockchain 's planned controversial rollback after a $3.9M exploit draws backlash from “blindsided” ecosystem partners #Flow #Blockchain #Exploit https://t.co/A8w3rJJAUn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 29, 2025 Investigators later identified the attacker’s Ethereum wallet and tracked attempted laundering through cross-chain protocols, while freeze requests were sent to major exchanges and stablecoin issuers. Initially, Flow developers proposed rolling the chain back to a checkpoint prior to the exploit. That proposal drew sharp criticism from bridge operators and other ecosystem partners, who warned it could create accounting inconsistencies and push losses onto third parties. After Backlash, Flow Opts for Targeted Token Cleanup Following the backlash, the foundation introduced a revised plan focused on isolating and destroying illicit tokens while preserving legitimate transactions. Under the current approach , the network restarted from the last sealed block before the halt, without reorganizing the chain. Roughly 1,500 Cadence accounts that received fraudulent tokens were temporarily restricted while remediation transactions were carried out. Source: Flow network Recovery plan Flow said most of those accounts have little or no prior activity and are expected to be restored quickly once the illicit balances are removed. Validators approved a temporary software upgrade granting elevated permissions to carry out the cleanup, with those permissions set to be revoked once remediation is complete. As part of its post-mortem disclosures, Flow also flagged what it described as troubling activity on an unnamed centralized exchange. The foundation said that within hours of the exploit, a single account deposited around 150 million FLOW tokens, roughly 10% of the total supply, converted a large portion into bitcoin, and withdrew more than $5 million before the network was halted. Flow said the exchange failed to respond to requests for information about the trading patterns, calling the episode an apparent AML and KYC lapse that shifted risk onto users who unknowingly bought fraudulent tokens. While Flow did not identify the exchange, some users have speculated it could involve Binance. Market data shows the fallout is still weighing on Flow’s DeFi ecosystem, as the total value locked on the network fell 12% over the past 24 hours to about $72.1 million, down from roughly $102 million on Dec. 31. The FLOW token is currently trading at $0.081, dropping by 53.3% in the last 7 days following the exploit and the initial rollback proposal, as uncertainty spread and some exchanges paused deposits and withdrawals.

While long-term upside is not dismissed outright, a renowned crypto trader says 2026 is not the inflection window for a $1,000 XRP price, emphasizing patience, structural market maturation, and a longer investment horizon. XRP Price’s Near-Term Expectations Reset The debate around XRP’s long-term valuation has resurfaced following renewed community discussion sparked by a widely circulated price forecast highlighted by Uphold. This forecast suggested that the XRP price could eventually reach $1,000 in 2030. The projection prompted analysts and traders to reframe expectations around timing rather than destination. While some acknowledged the long-term possibility, commentary emphasized that 2026 lacks the structural conditions required to support such a valuation, shifting the focus toward patience and extended adoption cycles. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying A prominent market commentator known as Pharaoh reinforced this position by explicitly ruling out 2025 and 2026 as viable timeframes for such a move. His stance aligns with the view that XRP’s growth trajectory should be evaluated through a long-term lens rather than short-term price spikes. According to this perspective, price discovery at that scale would require sustained institutional integration, deeper utility-driven demand, and time for macro and regulatory clarity to translate into capital inflows. The message to investors is straightforward: suppress short-term noise and avoid anchoring expectations to arbitrary calendar years. Diverging Views Expose The Limits Of Short-Term Price Optimism In a separate post, Pharaoh, reflecting a traditional finance perspective, cautioned holders against short-term, click-driven hype, aligning with Don Kwok’s assessment that rapid gains are unrealistic. That caution is reinforced by XRP’s recent trajectory. Despite recovering from its 2024 drawdown and maintaining relative stability through late 2025, price action has remained range-bound compared to the scale required for exponential upside. Even with the launch and early inflows of XRP-focused exchange-traded products, the impact on spot price has been incremental rather than transformative. Institutional activity, strategic partnerships, and ongoing ecosystem development have improved XRP’s structural positioning, yet none have produced the liquidity surge or demand shock necessary to justify rapid escalation toward triple- or quadruple-digit levels. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Reach $1 In 2026? Analysts Reveal What To Expect This disconnect highlights a key constraint: adoption and institutional validation do not automatically translate into immediate price repricing. Capital rotation into XRP-linked products has so far been measured, and partnership announcements have tended to reinforce long-term utility narratives rather than trigger speculative inflows. As a result, expectations of an accelerated move to $1,000 overlook how slowly large-scale capital typically enters and reshapes mature digital asset markets. These perspectives converge on a single conclusion. While opinions differ on XRP’s ultimate ceiling, there is broad agreement that the asset’s current growth path favors gradual appreciation over explosive near-term gains. The debate, therefore, is not about destination, but about discipline—aligning projections with market mechanics, capital behavior, and realistic timelines rather than headline-driven hype.

The latest backlash centers on accusations of “corporate double-speak,” with critics arguing that Coinbase’s public messaging around openness and decentralization has not always aligned with its actions, particularly around token listings and ecosystem support. Traders Call Out Coinbase Over Base and Memecoin Listings The discussion gained traction after a crypto trader posting under the name rbthreek criticized Coinbase leadership on X, pointing to what he described as a persistent gap between statements and behavior. He referenced Coinbase’s earlier reluctance to list tokens native to Base, its Ethereum layer-2 network. I see Brian on the feed over the holiday and I’m ngl I personally don’t think it’s in good faith. They’ve run this same playbook for a long time now, remember we’re dealing w the same people at CB who refused to list a single Base coin for over a year. And when they finally did… — rb3k (@rbthreek) January 1, 2026 When listings eventually came, he argued, they were poorly handled and followed by what he described as a wave of low-quality listings, reinforcing skepticism among builders and traders. He also highlighted comments previously made by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong questioning the substance of meme coins, contrasting those remarks with the exchange’s decision to list several Solana-based meme coins that later suffered steep losses, while only a handful of Base meme coins have been listed to date. According to traders, Coinbase listed at least 11 Solana-based meme coins in 2025, many of which later fell sharply in price, while only three Base meme coins have been listed to date. Another trader, Turtle, said Coinbase had failed to visibly support projects backed by Coinbase Ventures, such as Arcadia and Giza, despite promoting other initiatives like Zora. He argued that brand optics matter and that inconsistent support risks undermining confidence in the broader Base ecosystem. Not all voices were critical, as a user known as Zk said Base leadership, particularly Jesse Pollak, had been supportive in practice and suggested that tensions stem partly from differing expectations. I think Jesse supports memes tbh. He's been nothing but excellent in my experience, and he has been the most supportive coinbase staff of anyone. Brian doesn't appear to get them from the video he made, and it's absolutely wrong that they are just a picture and a name attached… — zk. (@zk_lmao) January 1, 2026 He argued that some meme communities focused primarily on short-term price action and listings rather than long-term collaboration, and that the Base team’s focus shifted last year as it worked to ship the Base app. According to Zk, much of the frustration reflects a shared desire for Base to succeed, even if participants disagree on how that should happen. Concerns about sentiment were further detailed by a user named Amy, who traced what she described as a gradual reversal in Base community confidence. Yeah you're spot on. The listing situation was the start of the reversal for Base sentiment wise. Jesse had his pulse on the chain and created a culture where people were building and bridging here. Successful projects hit a point where they had maxed their potential on Base… — Amy (@BasedAmy0x) January 1, 2026 She linked the downturn to stalled exchange listings, competition with Solana-based memes, confusion around the rollout of creator and “coined content” tokens, delayed decentralized exchange integration, and unmet expectations around the Base app’s rewards and inclusion. She said perceptions that Coinbase favored affiliated projects led some builders and users to leave the chain. Creator Coins Test Coinbase’s Vision for an Open Marketplace Armstrong responded directly to the discussion, saying Coinbase now offers access to millions of tokens through decentralized exchange integrations. Coinbase has millions of tokens available now via DEX. That’s the best way to get more tokens listed. CEX listings are more difficult for variety of reasons, not all in our control. Also, don’t treat any listing as an endorsement – we’re trying to build the everything exchange,… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 2, 2026 He reiterated that centralized listings are more complex and not endorsements, framing Coinbase’s role as providing a marketplace rather than making judgments on value. In a subsequent post, Armstrong outlined Coinbase’s priorities for 2026, including expanding an “everything exchange” and bringing more users on-chain through Base and Coinbase’s developer tools. Here are our top priorities for 2026 at Coinbase: 1) Grow the everything exchange globally (crypto, equities, prediction markets, commodities – across spot, futures, and options) 2) Scale stablecoins and payments 3) Bring the world onchain through @CoinbaseDev , @base chain,… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 1, 2026 The debate intensified after a creator token tied to YouTuber Nick Shirley on Base briefly neared a $9 million valuation before plunging 67% within hours . On-chain data showed strong royalty earnings, raising questions about whether creator tokens drive adoption or short-term speculation.

The AI protocol has now facilitated over 19.8 million transactions in total, 14 million fewer than the Base network. The South Korean venture fund cited Dune Analytics data, which showed that roughly half of all daily transactions since mid-December have been processed through Dexter. At the same time, Coinbase’s share has fallen to one-quarter to one-third, depending on the day. Number of x402 transactions per facilitator. Source: Dune The remaining volume is distributed among PayAI and DayDreams, which together made up as high as 30% of the rest of the market on their best days. Coinbase, Dexter, PayAI, and DayDreams have each now processed more than 10 million x402 transactions in total. At the same time, the total number of x402 transactions has increased exponentially since October. Daily volumes rose from negligible levels in early October to repeated peaks of more than 2 million transactions by mid-November. Several days in late November and early December counted spikes approaching or exceeding 3 million transactions in a single day, according to the Dune charts. Between early October and mid-November, Coinbase facilitated the majority of x402 transactions, taking up 60% or 70% of daily volume. However, December 10 saw Coinbase’s share drop to 31%, as Dexter’s share climbed to 30.7%. The AI network went on to become the leading facilitator throughout the final month of the year. PayAI and DayDreams also show consistent growth in both absolute transaction counts and percentage share. Together, they regularly account for 20% to 30% of daily x402 volume, per the stacked bar charts from Dune analytics. x402 experimental code converted to production payments x402 is an open payment protocol developed last year by Coinbase, which revived the HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code. While the code has existed for decades, it was never meaningfully implemented in web infrastructure. x402 gives it a practical role by enabling instant, automated stablecoin payments directly over standard HTTP requests. When a client requests access to an API, dataset, or digital resource, the server replies with a 402 status code that includes payment terms. They can then send a signed payment payload, mostly denominated in USDC. A facilitator like Dexter AI checks the payment on-chain and, once it is validated, tells the server to send the requested content right away. It keeps an eye on compatible blockchains, checks incoming payments, creates signed authorizations, and provides an HTTP interface. To that end, traders can make on-chain payments without having to host their own blockchain nodes. Coinbase operates a hosted facilitator that offers fee-free USDC payments on Base and Solana, with high-throughput settlement. That service has been a key driver of early x402 adoption. However, the protocol was explicitly designed to support multiple independent facilitators, allowing services to choose or switch providers. Coinbase released x402 publicly in May last year, but by December, the company said it had processed 75 million x402 transactions worth $24 million in paid APIs and AI agent interactions. In September, Coinbase launched a second version of the protocol that added network-agnostic identifiers, pluggable facilitators, wallet hooks, and a discovery layer known as x402 Bazaar, all to allow developers and services to use x402 freely with other blockchain networks and operators. “Think of it as like paywalls for scrapers. So x402 is a great standard for situations where an AI agent needs access to data or access to content in order to make more informed, better decisions. Really, any digital goods or any digital piece of media can be paid for with X 402,” said head of engineering at Coinbase Developer Platform Erik Reppel. x402 integrations expanded with real-world use cases The adoption of x402 has received some support from major internet services like Cloudflare, which announced plans to integrate it into its platform and co-launch the x402 Foundation, alongside Google Cloud’s Agent Payments Protocol, which uses the payment protocol for on-chain settlement. Coinbase has illustrated potential use cases that include agents pulling live market data, commissioning AI art models or subscribing to real-time sports and financial feeds. Some of the listings on x402 Bazaar include Prixe, a stock price API where agents can generate up-to-date financial reports. Get seen where it counts.

This strategic move directly impacts trading pairs including AI/BNB and eight others, potentially signaling broader market adjustments. The announcement follows established exchange protocols for maintaining market quality and liquidity standards. Binance Delisting Announcement: Complete Trading Pair Details Binance released official communication specifying the exact trading pairs scheduled for removal. The exchange will cease trading for these pairs at precisely 8:00 a.m. UTC on January 3, 2025. Consequently, all pending orders will undergo automatic cancellation. The exchange typically implements such measures to ensure optimal market conditions. The affected trading pairs include: AI/BNB (AllianceBlock Nexera vs. Binance Coin) ETC/BNB (Ethereum Classic vs. Binance Coin) FLOW/BTC (Flow vs. Bitcoin) LPT/BNB (Livepeer vs. Binance Coin) SFP/BTC (SafePal vs. Bitcoin) VET/BNB (VeChain vs. Binance Coin) WCT/FDUSD (World Credit Token vs. First Digital USD) WIF/BRL (dogwifhat vs. Brazilian Real) WLFI/BRL (WallFi vs. Brazilian Real) Notably, this action does not affect the availability of these cryptocurrencies on other trading pairs. For instance, traders can still access AI through AI/USDT or AI/BTC pairs. Similarly, the exchange maintains multiple trading options for other affected assets. Understanding Exchange Delisting Procedures and Criteria Major cryptocurrency exchanges regularly review trading pairs against established criteria. Consequently, they remove pairs that fail to meet specific standards. Binance follows a transparent evaluation framework. The exchange typically considers several key factors before making delisting decisions. These factors include poor liquidity and trading volume. Additionally, they evaluate project development activity and team commitment. Furthermore, network stability and security receive careful examination. Finally, responsiveness to periodic reviews matters significantly. Exchange representatives emphasize that delisting represents normal market operations. Moreover, they implement these measures to protect users. Specifically, they aim to prevent market manipulation risks. Also, they work to ensure adequate liquidity for all active pairs. Therefore, traders should understand this context. Regular portfolio reviews become essential for active market participants. Historical Context and Market Impact Analysis Historically, delisting announcements create immediate market reactions. For example, similar announcements in 2023 affected specific altcoin prices temporarily. However, the broader market typically absorbs these changes quickly. Data from previous delisting events shows varied impacts. Some assets experience increased volatility immediately following announcements. Others maintain stable prices through alternative trading pairs. The current delisting affects multiple asset categories. Specifically, it includes established projects like Ethereum Classic. Also, it involves newer tokens like dogwifhat. This diversity suggests a comprehensive review process. The exchange likely evaluated each pair independently. Therefore, traders should analyze each asset’s specific situation separately. Immediate Effects on Traders and Market Participants The announcement triggers several immediate considerations for market participants. First, traders holding positions in affected pairs must act before January 3. They should close or transfer their positions accordingly. Second, liquidity providers face adjustments to their strategies. They need to reallocate resources to remaining active pairs. Third, automated trading systems require updates. Specifically, they must exclude the delisted pairs from their algorithms. Market analysts observe specific patterns following such announcements. Typically, trading volume increases temporarily in affected pairs. This surge occurs as traders adjust their positions. Subsequently, liquidity migrates to alternative trading pairs. For instance, AI trading activity may shift to AI/USDT markets. Therefore, traders should monitor volume changes across all relevant markets. Trading Pair Primary Alternative Secondary Alternative AI/BNB AI/USDT AI/BTC ETC/BNB ETC/USDT ETC/ETH FLOW/BTC FLOW/USDT FLOW/BNB VET/BNB VET/USDT VET/BTC This table illustrates available alternatives for major affected pairs. Importantly, all underlying assets remain tradable on Binance. They simply become unavailable through specific pair combinations. Broader Market Implications and Industry Trends The cryptocurrency industry continues evolving rapidly. Exchange delistings represent one aspect of market maturation. Recently, regulatory developments influence exchange operations significantly. For example, compliance requirements become increasingly stringent. Consequently, exchanges must maintain rigorous standards. They regularly optimize their trading pair offerings accordingly. Industry experts note several emerging trends. First, exchanges focus more on liquidity concentration. They prefer consolidating trading activity into fewer pairs. This approach improves overall market depth. Second, regulatory considerations affect pair selection. Specifically, stablecoin pairs receive particular scrutiny. Third, geographic factors influence decisions. The removal of BRL pairs suggests specific market evaluations. Technical Considerations for Affected Projects Projects affected by delisting announcements face technical considerations. Their development teams typically issue statements reassuring communities. They emphasize continued development roadmaps. Also, they highlight alternative trading venues. Furthermore, they sometimes announce new exchange listings concurrently. This strategy helps mitigate potential negative perceptions. Blockchain analytics firms track on-chain metrics following such announcements. They monitor wallet activity and network utilization. Generally, they report minimal fundamental impact on most projects. The underlying technology and adoption continue unaffected. Therefore, long-term investors often view these events as temporary operational adjustments. Risk Management Strategies for Affected Traders Professional traders implement specific strategies around delisting events. They recommend several precautionary measures. First, review all open orders in affected pairs immediately. Second, consider position migration to alternative pairs. Third, monitor price discrepancies during the transition period. Fourth, adjust risk parameters in automated trading systems. Fifth, stay informed about potential chain reactions in related markets. Exchange representatives provide clear guidance for affected users. They typically offer sufficient advance notice. Also, they maintain detailed FAQ sections. Furthermore, they provide customer support for clarification requests. Therefore, traders should utilize these resources proactively. Conclusion Binance’s decision to delist nine spot trading pairs represents standard exchange operations within the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. This Binance delisting affects specific pair combinations while preserving alternative trading options for all underlying assets. Market participants should approach this development as an operational adjustment rather than a fundamental market shift. The cryptocurrency industry continues demonstrating maturation through such systematic reviews and optimizations. Traders must remain vigilant about exchange announcements while maintaining diversified trading strategies across multiple platforms and pairs. FAQs Q1: What happens to my funds in delisted trading pairs? Binance will automatically cancel all pending orders in affected pairs at delisting time. Your cryptocurrency holdings remain safe in your wallet, but you must trade them through alternative available pairs. Q2: Does delisting mean the cryptocurrency itself is being removed from Binance? No, delisting specific trading pairs does not remove the cryptocurrency from the exchange. For example, while AI/BNB is delisted, AI remains available through AI/USDT, AI/BTC, and other active trading pairs on Binance. Q3: Why would Binance delist trading pairs? Exchanges regularly delist pairs that fail to meet specific criteria including low liquidity, insufficient trading volume, network instability, or poor project development. This maintains market quality and protects users. Q4: How often does Binance review and delist trading pairs? Binance conducts periodic reviews throughout the year, typically announcing delistings monthly or quarterly. The exchange provides at least seven days’ notice before implementing any delisting. Q5: Should I sell my holdings in affected cryptocurrencies immediately? Not necessarily. Since the cryptocurrencies remain available through other trading pairs, the delisting may not significantly impact their value. Evaluate each project’s fundamentals and consider transferring to alternative pairs rather than panic selling.

Price action is compressing, RSI is turning higher, and institutional buyers continue to accumulate, yet prediction markets remain skeptical of a rapid six-figure breakout. Polymarket odds still favor $120,000 as the most likely outcome, even as Bitcoin trades within a tightening triangle near $89,000. The next move could set the tone for the year ahead. Polymarket: Why Traders Are Hesitant to Predict a Quick $150K Bitcoin Price Surge Bitcoin is kickstarting 2026 with a mixed bag of optimism and realism. While analysts are still tossing around six-figure targets, Polymarket traders are still being cautious about how high they think BTC can go before 2027. Looking at the market odds, you see that the most likely outcome is $120,000, with a 45% probability, even though that level is below its 2025 all-time high. But the confidence in higher targets is starting to wane. Polymarket is saying: 35% of traders think $130,000 is a possibility 28% of traders think $140,000 is a possibility 21% of traders think $150,000 is a possibility Source: Polymarket By contrast, the market is saying there’s probably an 80% chance Bitcoin either holds or recovers the $100,000 zone, suggesting traders think it will hold firm but don’t expect a rags-to-riches surge right away. This caution might be due to cycle dynamics – Bitcoin ended last year in the red, and with the 4-year halving cycle coming to a close, traders are probably being a bit more picky about where they put their bets. Institutional Bitcoin Buying Signals Long-Term Commitment On the other hand, despite softer sentiment among individual traders, the institutions are still putting their money where their mouth is. In the last quarter of 2025, Japan-based Metaplanet added 4,279 BTC, bringing its stash to 35,102 BTC, which is worth a cool $3.1 billion at today’s prices. Even though their stock price has been a bit of a dud, they’re still treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Tether has done the same thing. As BTC dipped below $88,000, the stablecoin issuer added 8,889 BTC, which cost them about $778.7 million. These purchases don’t guarantee a quick price spike, but they do show that the big players are using the dips to get a bit more exposure. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Triangle Breakout Or Triangle Breakdown? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction continues to be neutral, as BTC is trading around $89,400, stuck inside a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. This pattern is more about tightening volatility than any weakness. The price is still forming higher lows, and the resistance line is sloping down from $92,800 to $93,000. BTC is oscillating around a pivot zone near $88,200-$89,000, where the 50-day and 100-day EMA100-day EMAs are converging. This compression of the EMAs is a sign of balance, not a sign that things are approaching a breaking point. As long as the price stays above the rising trendline from $84,400 and the 200-day EMA near $87,000, the overall structure remains constructive. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The candlestick action is backing that up as well. Recent sessions are showing spinning tops and small-bodied candles, which are more a sign of indecision than of selling off. The RSI has broken its short-term downtrend and is now above 55, suggesting momentum is strengthening. If Bitcoin can close above $90,500, that would resolve the triangle to the upside and open a path towards $92,800 and then $95,000. If it breaks below $87,000, though, that would be a blow to the setup and open the possibility of a move down to $85,800; at the moment, the structure is more likely to be on the upside. What Could Trigger Bitcoin’s Next Major Move in 2026 With institutions soaking up supply and price compressing to a technical apex, the setup suggests preparation is underway, not exhaustion. Whether the next move is a measured breakout or just another range expansion will define how quickly those $150,000 targets start looking realistic. For now, traders are betting on patience, and history suggests Bitcoin tends to reward it. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.39 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000276, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Germany’s two biggest export markets turned into deadweight, and the BGA doesn’t think that 2026 will offer much help. “We do not see a turnaround, but at best a brief respite,” said Dirk Jandura, president of BGA. German exports to the U.S. dropped more than 7%, sinking below €150 billion (about $156 billion). China hit harder, with German exports falling 10% to just €81 billion, based on numbers from GTAI. U.S. tariffs and German factory cuts drag numbers down BGA’s Jandura said U.S. tariffs on European goods acted like “sand in the gears of transatlantic trade,” cutting into profits and pushing up costs. German exporters lost room to breathe. At the same time, the country’s economy faced a combo of deeper issues: a strong euro, high energy prices, too much red tape, and low investment. Germany’s HCOB PMI for manufacturing dropped to 47.0 in December, down from 48.2 in November, and anything under 50.0 means shrinking activity, according to the S&P Global. Export sales also fell for the fifth month in a row, crashing at the fastest rate since December 2024, along with production numbers. German companies cut purchases, inventories, and even staff. Job losses reached the worst pace in six months. But strangely, manufacturers kept their hopes up. Their outlook for production hit a six-month high, mostly because they’re betting on demand from new products and government spending on defense and infrastructure. China exports are just as bad Things in China didn’t go any better, where the government backed homegrown producers in 2025, slashing the need for German imports . Because of that, sectors like automotive, mechanical engineering, and chemicals, where Germany usually leads, got hit the hardest. Local competitors are taking over. “This often stabilizes global sales, but leads to fewer exports from Germany,” Jandura said. So German companies are adjusting. More of them are building inside China instead of shipping goods in. Some are even taking their money to other Asian markets instead. Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping was telling his people that China achieved 5% GDP growth in 2025. Jinping said:- “China’s economy is forging ahead under pressure, moving toward innovation and quality, demonstrating strong resilience and vitality. The growth rate is expected to reach around 5%, continuing to rank high among the world’s major economies.” Whether anyone outside China buys that spin is a different matter. But one thing’s for sure: Germany’s exporters aren’t seeing that growth in their order books.

This renewed buying pressure from major investors is being demonstrated in the recent surge in the number of coins acquired by accumulation wallet addresses. Behind The Ethereum Slow Price Momentum The price of Ethereum may be exhibiting sluggish performance on the surface, but beneath the market noise, there is a noticeable shift in investor sentiment. Currently, ETH investors are turning up at a fast rate in the volatile crypto environment. CW, a crypto analyst and data analyst, has reported an uptick in buying activity as observed in the rise in the ETH Balance on Accumulation Addresses metric, which is historically linked to long-term holding behavior. Investors’ activity moving against price action is an indication of rising conviction among patient players. Furthermore, this divergence points to a maturing stage of strategic accumulation even as the broader sentiments signal persistent caution. Since the altcoin’s price reached around the $2,800 price mark, CW highlights that the number of ETH held by accumulation addresses saw a sharp uptick, increasing by 5.2 million ETH. The chart shows that the cumulative coins held by the investors have increased to more than 27 million ETH. Following the decline in the Ethereum price , buying activity from large investors or whale holders has accelerated, bringing their total holdings to 26.78 million ETH. Such a rise in whale accumulation suggests that the cohort is exhibiting renewed conviction in the altcoin’s long-term action. CW stated that the buying activity is a positive signal for the Ethereum market. This action is currently observed across the broader crypto market as massive accumulation is taking place on other coins , such as Bitcoin. As a result, the expert is confident that the market is still in its bull phase. Large Holders Doubling Down On ETH Large holders are making an obvious move toward Ethereum, which is stacking up the leading altcoin, as reported by Milk Road, a market expert. Milk Road determined this action among the cohort by examining the ETH Balance by Holder Value. Milk Road’s research is primarily centered among wallet addresses holding between 10,000 ETH and 100,000 ETH. Data from the metric shows that accumulation from the group has gone parabolic in the past few days. This change implies that strategic players might be positioning ahead of a larger market movement despite the suppressed short-term price movements. After years of steady decline, the expert noted that these wallets are climbing fast again and are now back near all-time highs. In simple terms, the biggest Ethereum whales are returning to the market and are aggressively increasing their stash. Should this accumulation continue, it could mark the foundation for ETH’s next significant trend.",Ethereum|bitcoin|CW|ETH|ETH Balance by Holder Value|ETH Balance on Accumulation Addresses Metric|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Whales|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Milk Road,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-02 13:00:07

While there has been no significant bullish breakout yet, the price is pressing against key local resistances. Buyers are trying to reclaim control, but the lack of follow-through makes this a pivotal area to watch. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC remains trapped within a descending channel, testing the upper boundary once again near the critical $90K level. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages located above $95K act as major dynamic resistance levels, and buyers have yet to reclaim them. Despite recent bounce attempts, momentum has been fading. RSI is climbing but is still around the neutral territory, indicating that there is room for a move higher. If buyers fail to break above the $90K zone and the higher boundary of the channel, another visit to the $80K support zone remains likely. Until that breakout happens, this is still a bearish market structure. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the asset has been consolidating in a short-term channel. Multiple rejections from the $90K level, located at the middle of the channel, have formed a mid-range ceiling. Meanwhile, higher lows forming gradually below this zone show that buyers are slowly stepping in. The RSI is also pushing higher, showing bullish momentum building while still not being overbought. If a clean breakout above $90K occurs with strength, it opens up the way for a move toward the primary resistance zone at $95K. On the other hand, failure at the $90K zone could mean another sweep back toward $86K and even a breakdown of the channel that could pave the way for a deeper drop toward the $80K area. On-Chain Analysis The BTC exchange reserve metric continues to drop sharply, hitting 2.75M BTC, a significant multi-year low. This trend reflects ongoing accumulation and reduced sell pressure on centralized exchanges. While the price action has remained stagnant, this underlying metric supports the long-term bullish thesis. However, the disconnect between low reserves and weak price action highlights the broader uncertainty and hesitation among market participants heading into the first quarter of 2026. Therefore, more sideways or even corrections might be required before the market can begin rallying again.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-theres-nothing-stopping-xrp-from-reaching-20-now-heres-why/,"Crypto markets often disguise major moves behind long periods of calm. XRP appears to be exiting one of those phases, as price structure, supply dynamics, and long-term technical signals align with unusual precision. After years of compression, XRP now trades in a zone that historically precedes powerful trend expansions. This outlook gained attention after Amonyx shared a long-term XRP chart on X, covering price action from 2014 through projected levels into 2030. His analysis argues that XRP has completed its post-2025 consolidation phase and now faces minimal technical resistance on the path toward $20 and beyond. Logarithmic Structure Points to a Major Expansion The chart Amonyx referenced uses a logarithmic scale to capture XRP’s full market history across multiple cycles. This view highlights repeating patterns of extended consolidation followed by sharp, vertical breakouts. XRP has followed this structure in every major cycle since 2014. Using Fibonacci extensions drawn from prior market expansions, the analysis identifies $20+ as a natural extension target rather than an extreme outlier. The current price zone aligns with historical breakout regions where XRP previously transitioned from accumulation into acceleration. There is nothing stopping $XRP reaching $20+ now. It’s inevitable pic.twitter.com/DFn1dCpCCg — Amonyx (@amonyx) January 1, 2026 Exchange Supply Reaches an Eight-Year Low On-chain data strengthens the bullish narrative. XRP balances on centralized exchanges recently dropped to their lowest levels in approximately eight years. Investors typically move assets off exchanges when they intend to hold rather than sell. This ongoing withdrawal trend reduces available sell-side liquidity. Lower exchange supply often magnifies price moves once demand increases , especially during breakout phases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the $20 Path Looks Increasingly Open Amonyx’s thesis rests on convergence rather than speculation. Long-term chart structure shows XRP pressing against historical expansion zones. Exchange supply continues to contract. Routine supply no longer unsettles price action. Together, these factors suggest that XRP now trades in a late-stage accumulation environment. While short-term volatility remains inevitable, the broader setup supports the view that upside expansion faces limited structural resistance. As accumulation persists and long-term technical patterns mature, XRP increasingly reflects a market preparing for continuation rather than consolidation. Under these conditions, a move toward $20 no longer appears extraordinary but structurally aligned with XRP’s historical behavior.

But investigators are struggling to identify the exploiter behind it. Mysterious Wallet Drainer According to ZachXBT’s latest findings, the attack is targeting a large number of wallets for relatively small amounts. Losses have been mostly below $2,000 per victim. While the individual thefts are limited in size, the cumulative losses are steadily increasing. As of the most recent update shared by the investigator, approximately $107,000 has been drained, and the total is expected to rise as the activity continues. The attack remains active at the time of reporting. ZachXBT said that the root cause of the wallet drains has not yet been identified, which makes it unclear how the attacker is gaining access to victims’ funds. No definitive exploit vector has been confirmed so far. While the identity of the attacker is also unknown, ZachXBT has flagged a wallet address believed to be linked to the activity: 0xAc2e5153170278e24667a580baEa056ad8Bf9bFB. Trust Wallet Hack Wallet drains continue to plague crypto users. Just a week earlier, Trust Wallet disclosed a major security incident involving its browser extension. On December 24, a malicious version of the Trust Wallet Browser Extension, version 2.68, was published to the Chrome Web Store outside the company’s normal release and review process. The compromised version contained malicious code that allowed attackers to access sensitive wallet data and carry out unauthorized transactions. Trust Wallet said the issue only affected users who opened and logged into version 2.68 between December 24 and December 26, and did not impact mobile app users or other extension versions. The company identified 2,520 affected wallet addresses from which approximately $8.5 million in assets were drained and linked to 17 attacker-controlled addresses. Trust Wallet also noted that the same attacker addresses were used to drain wallets not connected to the incident. The company has since promised reimbursement to affected users.

As per the current market, “What price will Bitcoin hit before 2027?” Polymarket shows 45% odds of Bitcoin reaching $120,000. Notably, this price point is below its all-time high. The probabilities drop sharply at higher price levels, with $130,000 carrying a 35% chance, $140,000 falling to 28%, and $150,000 priced at just 21%. Reports indicate that traders are placing a safe bet, with an 80% likelihood that BTC will reach a peak of $100,000 . With this move in place, sources claimed that it was unclear why users opt to be very cautious. Some assumed that they decided to adopt this approach in relation to the end of the four-year cycle , following Bitcoin’s major losses in 2025. Uncertainties surrounding the fate of Bitcoin spark controversy Regarding the four-year cycle, it is worth noting that the cycle followed trends around halving events in the history of BTC. It also played a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by helping traders forecast future movements. Now that the cycle is losing prominence, analysts suggest that a new trading pattern may be emerging. Interestingly, despite the crypto market being pessimistic, experts still propose that 2026 will be a strong year for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump made it clear that he intends to announce the US Federal Reserve’s new chair in the upcoming weeks. This news sparked hope in the cryptocurrency industry, as many had anticipated that interest rates would decrease. Immediately after those assumptions, the prices of precious metals, such as gold and silver, increased significantly, with both reaching new peaks in the last quarter of 2025. Digital assets, on the other hand, remained unchanged. Analysts are now expressing the likelihood of crucial crypto legislation, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, to provide straightforward regulations and potentially facilitate significant institutional adoption. Several analysts from firms such as Standard Chartered, Strategy, and Bernstein forecast that the price of BTC may reach an all-time high of $150,000 by 2026. Others, like Tom Lee from Fundstrat, who adopted a more positive outlook on the matter, suggested that the cryptocurrency could rise as much as $200,000 to $250,000. Traders point out some of the limitations surrounding BTC’s growth Bitcoin’s price ignited tension in the crypto industry after dropping sharply in November. Analysts claim that some factors could not sustain the cryptocurrency’s price above the $110,000 level. These factors were institutional investments and corporate purchases. They provided various reasons to back this claim. Among these reasons, one key factor raised is the surging interest in Bitcoin options, particularly those related to the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin (IBIT) exchange-traded fund. In the meantime, it was confirmed that the total open interest in Bitcoin options escalated from a record of $39 billion noted in December 2024 to a new level in December 2025. Analysts explained that this rise led to heightened awareness of the covered call strategy in the ecosystem. Critics, on the other hand, expressed their belief that by leasing out their anticipated earnings for a fee, major investors have unintentionally set a restriction that halts Bitcoin from attaining its next substantial growth phase. To better understand this point, analysts noted that it is useful to perceive a covered call as an option between earning a higher price and receiving a regular income.

This development follows the year-end holiday period when traditional markets closed while cryptocurrency spot trading continued globally. Market analysts now scrutinize this price discrepancy as a potential catalyst for increased volatility during early 2026 trading sessions. Understanding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Phenomenon The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap represents a measurable price difference between the December 31, 2025 closing price and the January 2, 2026 opening price. Importantly, this gap formed because Bitcoin’s spot market continued trading during the CME’s holiday closure from December 31 through January 1. Consequently, when futures trading resumed, the contract prices adjusted to reflect spot market movements that occurred during the exchange’s inactivity. Daan Crypto Trades, a recognized market analyst, first identified this development through social media platform X. The analyst noted that such gaps typically become focal points for short-term trading strategies. Furthermore, historical data shows that approximately 85% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies significantly based on market conditions. The Mechanics of Futures Market Dislocations CME Bitcoin futures operate on a regulated schedule that differs from cryptocurrency spot markets. While spot exchanges like Coinbase and Binance operate 24/7 throughout the year, traditional derivatives markets observe specific holidays and weekends. This structural difference creates periodic disconnections between derivative and spot prices. Recent Notable CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps Date Gap Size Fill Time Market Context January 2024 $420 3 days Post-ETF approval rally July 2024 $580 14 days Regulatory uncertainty period January 2025 $510 7 days Institutional adoption phase January 2026 $655 TBD Current analysis period Market Implications and Historical Precedents The current $655 gap represents one of the larger January openings in CME Bitcoin futures history. Market participants generally monitor these gaps because they often create technical trading opportunities. Specifically, traders might position themselves to profit from the expected price movement toward the gap fill level. However, the timing remains uncertain and depends on multiple market factors. Historical analysis reveals several important patterns: January gaps tend to fill faster than mid-year gaps, averaging 5.3 days versus 11.7 days Larger gaps (over $500) typically indicate stronger market momentum during the closure period Institutional participation in gap fills has increased steadily since 2023 Volatility spikes often accompany the gap-filling process, particularly during Asian trading hours Expert Perspectives on the 2026 Market Opening Financial analysts emphasize that CME gaps provide valuable information about market sentiment during exchange closures. The $655 discrepancy suggests significant spot market activity occurred while institutional traders couldn’t adjust their futures positions. This situation potentially indicates several market dynamics, including retail-driven movements, geopolitical developments, or algorithmic trading patterns that continued during the holiday period. According to derivatives market specialists, CME Bitcoin futures now represent approximately 35% of all regulated Bitcoin derivatives volume globally. This substantial market share means gaps in CME contracts often influence broader market psychology, even affecting spot prices on cryptocurrency exchanges. The current gap’s size suggests particularly strong momentum developed during the two-day trading hiatus. Technical Analysis and Trading Considerations Traders typically approach CME gaps using specific technical methodologies. The gap area itself often functions as both support and resistance, depending on the gap’s direction. For the current $655 gap, analysts will monitor whether prices move toward filling the gap quickly or if the market establishes new trading ranges above or below the gap zone. Several factors could influence how this situation develops: Volume analysis during the first week of January trading Institutional flows through regulated investment products Global macroeconomic developments affecting risk assets Cryptocurrency-specific news regarding regulation or adoption Market technicians note that gap fills don’t always occur immediately. Sometimes markets establish new trends that leave gaps unfilled for extended periods. However, statistical analysis shows that CME Bitcoin futures gaps under $700 have a 92% fill rate within 30 trading days, based on data from 2020 through 2025. The Regulatory and Institutional Context The CME’s position as a regulated exchange adds significance to these market events. Unlike cryptocurrency-native derivatives platforms, CME operates under U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight with traditional market hours and holiday schedules. This regulatory framework attracts institutional participants who may interpret gaps differently than cryptocurrency-native traders. Since the 2023 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the relationship between CME futures and spot markets has strengthened considerably. Many institutional trading desks now use CME futures for hedging ETF exposures, creating additional connections between these market segments. The January 2026 gap therefore reflects not just holiday trading patterns but also evolving institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Global Market Reactions and Comparative Analysis While the CME observed its holiday schedule, other global derivatives markets showed varied responses. European exchanges with different holiday calendars displayed smaller gaps, while Asian markets demonstrated continuous trading throughout the period. This geographic variation in market structure creates arbitrage opportunities that sophisticated traders often exploit during such dislocations. The $655 gap size exceeds most comparable periods in recent years. For context, the average January CME Bitcoin futures gap from 2021-2025 measured $387, making the current development approximately 69% larger than the recent average. This substantial difference suggests unusual market conditions developed during the year-end transition period. Risk Management Perspectives Professional traders emphasize that gap trading carries specific risks. While historical patterns provide guidance, each market situation involves unique variables. Risk managers typically recommend position sizing that accounts for the possibility that gaps may not fill as expected or may take longer than anticipated to resolve. Additionally, the increasing correlation between cryptocurrency and traditional markets adds complexity to gap analysis. During the 2025 holiday period, traditional equity and bond markets also experienced unusual movements that might have influenced cryptocurrency sentiment indirectly through portfolio rebalancing or risk appetite adjustments. Conclusion The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap forming on the first trading day of 2026 represents a significant market development with implications for short-term volatility and trading strategies. This event highlights the ongoing structural differences between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency trading ecosystems. As institutional participation in cryptocurrency derivatives grows, understanding these market mechanics becomes increasingly important for all market participants. The coming weeks will reveal whether this gap fills quickly or establishes new trading parameters for early 2026. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a CME Bitcoin futures gap? A CME Bitcoin futures gap occurs when there’s a price difference between the closing price before a market holiday and the opening price after the holiday. This happens because Bitcoin’s spot market trades continuously while CME futures have specific trading hours and holidays. Q2: How often do these gaps typically get filled? Historical data from 2020-2025 shows approximately 85-92% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies from immediate to several weeks depending on market conditions and gap size. Q3: Why does the CME have different trading hours than spot cryptocurrency exchanges? The Chicago Mercantile Exchange operates as a traditional regulated financial exchange with set hours and holidays, while cryptocurrency spot markets operate 24/7 globally without traditional market closures. Q4: How does this $655 gap compare to previous years? The $655 gap exceeds the average January gap of $387 from 2021-2025 by approximately 69%, making it one of the larger January openings in recent CME Bitcoin futures history. Q5: What should traders watch regarding this development? Traders typically monitor trading volume, institutional flows, and whether prices begin moving toward the gap level. The speed and manner of any potential gap fill can provide insights into market sentiment and momentum for early 2026.

And not only is this ludicrously misleading, it’s also plain dangerous. The company is pushing an inflation prediction market that lets users gamble on monthly CPI data , and they’re claiming their platform is better than Wall Street at forecasting inflation. The same Wall Street that has been doing this for well over two centuries. But then you also read Kalshi’s so-called research report on the matter and realize they haven’t shown their study anywhere at all. So no one knows what “Wall Street consensus” they beat or how exactly they’re pulling forecasts from betting slips. This is ECONS 101. Kalshi turns CPI data into a betting board To quote my professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Jonathan Gruber, “If you want people to take you seriously as an economist, you show your work, as detailed as humanly possible.” You don’t just toss out a headline that you’re smarter than professional forecasters and expect applause. Right now, Kalshi looks like it’s trying to turn serious macroeconomic analysis into a game of coin tosses with the world’s largest economy on the line. It’s silly. Anyway, on the surface, Kalshi offers ten binary bets on where the Consumer Price Index will land for December. You can bet that inflation from November to December is above 0.25%, which means a CPI above 325.844. That’ll cost you $0.53 to win $1.00. You can also go the other way, bet under, and pay $0.47. Other bets target year-over-year inflation between 2.6% and 3.0%, with different prices depending on the range. It’s all wrapped in decimal points, implied levels, and payout charts that make absolutely no sense to this aspiring economist. When you combine all ten bets, you get what’s called an implied probability distribution. But instead of a normal curve, it’s bimodal. Two peaks. No confidence around the center, just gaps. Hilarious, right? “Market Advantage Across Event Types (1 Week Prior) YOY CPI,” according to Kalshi The two dominant guesses land around 2.55% and 2.65%, with barely anything near 2.59%, which is odd. If you go by the average or the median of the curve, you’d be picking a number the market itself says is unlikely. That’s the whole problem. A market forecast that bets against its own math isn’t much of a forecast, now is it Mr. Tarek Mansour? Thankfully, Kalshi kind of admits it. They group inflation surprises into three buckets: normal (below 0.1 percentage points off), moderate shocks (0.1–0.2), and major shocks (above 0.2). But without knowing the baseline they used or how those shocks were measured, this feels like branding and literally nothing else. Kalshi compares betting signals with traditional markets The full study, which Kalshi hasn’t released, might explain what’s going on with this strange setup. Maybe it’s just a matter of needing more players to even out prices. More arbitragers, people who don’t care about politics or news drama and just want to make a buck, could help flatten out the betting curve and close that weird gap around 2.59%. Or maybe, as Kalshi hopes, the pricing reflects something deeper, like some hidden binary outcome no one else in history has ever seen. That’d be quite a bold theory for a site that still hasn’t shown how it’s winning the inflation prediction game. But hey, that’s a different story. A company could make a billion-dollar hedge knowing they might lose, just to protect themselves. That pulls prices away from real expectations. Kalshi thinks it’s cutting through that noise. I call that “delulu.” But again, Kalshi did admit that its sample size is weak. “Given that our overall sample spans ~30 months, major shock events are definitionally rare,” they said. “Statistical power for larger tail events remains limited.” Translation? The test period is short, rare events didn’t really show up, and the current data isn’t deep enough. But they still believe the results “are highly suggestive of outperformance.” Make it make sense. No matter how slick the presentation is, gambling doesn’t belong in economics. Anyone who tries to fit it in clearly did not pass ECONS 101. Kalshi also said , “In environments where consensus forecasts reflect correlated model assumptions and shared information sets, prediction markets offer an alternative aggregation mechanism that may detect regime changes earlier and process heterogeneous information more efficiently.” Whatever that means.",OP-ED|Kalshi|USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-02 13:25:43

Index fund flows and passive investing have fundamentally altered market dynamics, making stock-picking more challenging and indexation effects unavoidable. Portfolio allocation size matters more than simple buy/hold/sell labels; conviction and volatility should drive position sizing. Sector movements are increasingly dictated by ETF flows, causing good companies to underperform as index dominance overshadows fundamentals. “Mediocre.” I guess there are many worse things we can be called. I've been called plenty of those in the comments section here, as I approach 2,500 of those answered in 3 years. Quite a journey so far. Thanks to all who have taken the time to read my work during 2025. Mediocre is also how I describe how Bitcoin has performed historically. Does that sound strange, given its monster move earlier this year to an all-time high? Or, due to its even bigger run-up since before most of us knew what cryptocurrency was (or when “staking” was a misspelled way to say, “I'm making steak for dinner”)? Here's what I'm getting at. This is Bitcoin's price since mid-November of 2021. So more than 4 years ago. That's when it touched $60,000. Since that time, it has doubled, and then some, topping out at $126,000 on October 6 of 2025. And now, around $88,000 near year-end 2025, off 30% from that peak, it is up only 34% from where it was more than 49 months ago. So about an 8% annualized return. Data by YCharts The bad news: that's a lot more risk to take on when, as we see below, T-bills earned half that return, despite starting near a 0% rate in late 2021. And the much-maligned non-US segment of the stock market, represented above by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF ( EFA ), had a nice year in 2025, but that followed 3 years of zilch. Yet based only on the strength of a solid past 12 months, EFA's return since that November 2021 starting point now exceeds that of Bitcoin. As we see above, EFA (orange line) and Bitcoin (purple line) took very different directions but ended up at about the same spot. What does this say about Bitcoin's future as an investment? NOTHING. What does it say about perception versus reality when it comes to popular asset types? A LOT. This is why I recently published this table as part of a detailed article on how I'm using 10 ETFs as the current “core” of my Allocation portfolio that I run for investing group members and also share with subscribers at my website. The goal is to coach investors based on my experience allocating through modern market conditions, with risk management at the forefront of everything. ETF Yourself Using Bitcoin to lower risk? You might be surprised to hear “Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT )” and “risk management at the forefront” in the same place. That's the whole idea. To combine asset classes that often exhibit LOW CORRELATION to each other, particularly when markets tank. Look, I get it. Crypto-millionaires and even billionaires are out there. I live close enough to Miami, where many of them now reside, to realize that. But with all investments, there are the early adopters. And while some hit it big, time after time, for many it is more like a strategic “lottery ticket.” The way venture capitalists reportedly fail 90% of the time . But if that one out of 10 takes off, the other 9 are quickly forgotten. Among my other pursuits, I own a partial interest in some racehorses. It's the steadiest part of the game (“claiming”), but it is still a sport in which one win pays for a string of 5th- and 6th-place finishes. The focus here is on the iShares Bitcoin ETF, the largest of its kind. And its relationship to the S&P 500, past and potentially in the future. Because recently, the biggest, most exciting trades of the last few years have started to roll over. But as I recall as a past dog owner, they can flip themselves right back up in a nanosecond. So that's always a possibility. When markets are driven as they are now by algorithms and index fund flows, and nearly every market segment picks a side (are you a risk-on asset or a risk-off asset?), this is something we'll all need to live with as investors. Market indecision is much more common these days. And it leads me to the key factor of position-sizing. Position-sizing: a quick introduction My entire investing process is about this: “Buy/Hold/Sell” are very misleading ways to characterize any investment at any point in time. It says everything about WHAT you are owning or not, but not a thing about HOW MUCH AS A PERCENT OF YOUR PORTFOLIO you are allocating to it. If I have a buy rating on 2 stocks, 1 might be 1% of my portfolio (more volatile, less committed to it, just dipping my toe in for starters). And the other is 5% of my portfolio. That might be because it is much less volatile, and I need to own more to get the dollar return I seek. Or, I might just believe it is an ideal situation (chart-wise, which is my main approach). Now to that IBIT situation and why I have it as a semi-regular spot among 10 ETFs in that allocation portfolio. I've smoothed this out to 3-month rolling returns, with 1-month moving windows. And while IBIT is just reaching 2 years old, the thing with Bitcoin is this: it acts differently with so much ETF money having plowed in. The same can be said for the S&P 500. Data by YCharts Yet in that picture above, I see a pair of ETFs that sometimes rise and fall together but are different in terms of volatility and the potential to move independently of each other. I can't say that about a lot of equity ETFs compared to SPY and about a lot of crypto ETFs compared to IBIT. So for now, they exhibit enough for me to allocate to each, just in varying allocations. Based on their relative attractiveness. These are the basics of diversification. But it is SO MUCH TOUGHER to find nowadays. Thanks to the forces that now move markets. And the jury is still out on Bitcoin's true place in the long-term fabric of the investor's total picture. If you were there more than 10 years ago, congratulations, you are up 15,000%. If you jumped on board 4 years ago, you underperformed much of the stock market. Data by YCharts And if you were one of many who piled in at the start of 2024, when IBIT and 11 other spot Bitcoin ETFs made it easier to own crypto, you are up 87%, comfortably ahead of SPY over that same time. Now, with reference to this chart below, just 3 months ago IBIT led SPY by 168% to 44%. So that margin went from 124% to under 40% in a hurry. Data by YCharts But that again is my point. Stock picking or allocating across many types of stocks via ETFs is not nearly as productive or efficient as it once was. And the IBIT/SPY pair is part of a mountain of evidence supporting that, which grows every day. But since IBIT is still being treated as the nascent asset it is, this is still a good time to consider it. So it made it into my 10-ETF mix, something I frankly was not expecting. That is, until I whittled 4,400 ETFs down to my forced target of only 10. Now, I allocate tactically AMONG the 10 in that table above. I own at least a little of each at all times, as long as it is in the 10. A “permanent portfolio,” if you will. But where are the individual ETFs that make up the 10? While most will stay on the roster for a long time, some will be swapped out. Not when they look unattractive from a short-term return standpoint. When they are no longer providing a diversification benefit, either long-term or short-term. For now, IBIT makes the cut. I can control risk in it with that 2% minimum weighting and control my own excitement toward it (if that happens) with that 10% maximum weighting. And I remind myself that 5% is a “long-term expected average” position for IBIT within the 10 ETF portfolio, though 2% to 10% is the range I'm allowing myself to trade it within. To me, THAT is investing today. Not simply what I own, but how much and how often. Do I like SPY or IBIT better? I like both to different degrees at different times. And in the 10-ETF portfolio, I left SPY out entirely in its cap-weighted form, opting instead to use a mix of QQQ-DIA-RSP, as that trio is much more flexible than SPY alone (separate article on that coming soon). IBIT's technical chart does not look robust, and it is still subject to a combination of big risks. Just ask Michael Saylor (head man at Strategy, symbol MSTR). Those risks include a potential top in crypto enthusiasm, due in part to a peak in market liquidity, as well as repatriation of assets toward home currency assets (China and Japan are doing a lot of that currently). Barchart I've documented SPY's risks here many times for many years. And in its top-heavy form, it still hangs in there, for now. IBIT, SPY, and the bigger portfolio-wide impacts So, why do I make room for at least a 2% allocation to IBIT and also to each of QQQ, DIA, and RSP in that 10-ETF model portfolio? Because: I don't think I'm smarter than the market. I want diversification, but smart diversification, not “I think I'm diversified” diversification, which fails when we need it most. I have a mechanism to produce indicators as to how I want to rotate between those 4 ETFs and the 6 others pictured in the table. My method (ROAR) is not the subject of this article, but it will be in others. And it's there not to be pushed on people, but to show how SOMETHING should be your allocation mechanism. Not just “every 3 months I rebalance.” IBIT allows me to take some shots with small amounts of money, by design. In its brief history, it has had an 80% rally in 3 months and lost more than 25% in 3 months. It's 30% off its high as I write this. 3 months' time! So I expect there to be tactical opportunities to spot in the charts and rotate between that 2% and 10% allocation range. Data by YCharts Finally, using SPY as a proxy for the trio of stock ETFs I use in the 10-ETF portfolio, but the only “offensive weapon” I use in my 2-ETF portfolio (alongside BIL, a T-bill ETF), here's the range of possible outcomes based on the past. Since just before the pandemic, it has shown the potential to move more than 20% in either direction over a 3-month period. Data by YCharts That's a good reason to not set it and forget it, even if US equities are the default anchor of the portfolio. But those defense ETFs are the backstop, something I think more investors should consider the case for in their portfolios. This is all about risk management WHILE pursuing return over all time frames. My goal is to keep drawdowns below 5% and sacrifice some upside at times if that's what it takes. But am I limiting my ability to compete with a traditional “balanced” portfolio over time? Not at all, as I'll continue to discuss here in the new year. Because risk management does not mean capping returns. It means keeping enough capital intact at all times to live to fight another day, or year for that matter.",IBIT|BTC-USD|VOO|IVV|SPY|DIA|DJI|IWM|NDX|QQQ|SP500,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-02 13:30:00
56731493,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257997,1767360611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Binance Delists FLOW/BTC Margin Pair: Critical Trading Update for 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-delists-flow-btc-margin/,"BitcoinWorld Binance Delists FLOW/BTC Margin Pair: Critical Trading Update for 2025 In a significant move affecting cryptocurrency traders worldwide, Binance has announced the impending delisting of the FLOW/BTC margin trading pair, scheduled for 4:00 a.m. UTC on January 3, 2025. This decision marks another strategic adjustment in the exchange’s evolving margin trading offerings. Consequently, market participants must prepare for this change immediately. The announcement follows Binance’s ongoing review of trading pairs based on liquidity, trading volume, and market demand metrics. Therefore, traders holding positions in this specific pair need to understand the implications thoroughly. Binance Margin Trading Pair Removal Explained Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, regularly evaluates its listed trading pairs. The exchange bases these evaluations on multiple quantitative factors. Specifically, these factors include trading volume, liquidity depth, and market maker support. Additionally, regulatory considerations and strategic alignment influence these decisions. The FLOW/BTC margin pair removal follows this established protocol. Market data from the past quarter shows declining volume for this specific pairing. Meanwhile, other FLOW trading pairs maintain healthier activity levels. Consequently, this selective delisting aims to optimize exchange resources. The exchange will execute the delisting precisely at the announced UTC time. Traders must close all positions before this deadline to avoid automatic liquidation. Margin trading involves borrowing funds to amplify trading positions. This practice increases both potential profits and risks significantly. The FLOW/BTC pair allowed traders to speculate on FLOW’s value against Bitcoin using leverage. However, reduced liquidity can create unfavorable trading conditions. These conditions include wider bid-ask spreads and increased slippage. Therefore, exchanges often remove such pairs to protect users from poor execution. Binance has followed this pattern consistently since 2023. The exchange previously delisted several margin pairs including ANKR/BTC and ALICE/BTC. Each decision followed similar evaluation criteria and notification procedures. Understanding the FLOW Cryptocurrency Context FLOW serves as the native cryptocurrency of the Flow blockchain. This blockchain specializes in supporting NFTs and decentralized applications. Notably, Flow powers major NFT platforms including NBA Top Shot. The project originated from Dapper Labs, creators of CryptoKitties. Since its 2020 launch, FLOW has established a substantial ecosystem. However, its trading volume distribution across exchanges shows interesting patterns. According to CoinMarketCap data, Binance handles approximately 35% of FLOW’s global spot trading volume. Meanwhile, other exchanges like Kraken and OKX maintain significant shares. The FLOW/BTC pair represents one of several trading options available. Importantly, FLOW/USDT and FLOW/ETH pairs demonstrate higher liquidity consistently. The cryptocurrency market experienced substantial volatility throughout 2024. This volatility affected trading pair performance across all major exchanges. Bitcoin dominance fluctuated between 48% and 52% during this period. Consequently, altcoin/BTC pairs faced particular pressure. FLOW’s price action reflected broader market trends while maintaining its NFT-focused niche. The table below illustrates FLOW’s recent trading pair performance on Binance: Trading Pair Average Daily Volume (30 Days) Bid-Ask Spread Status FLOW/USDT $42.7 million 0.02% Active FLOW/BTC (Margin) $1.8 million 0.15% Delisting FLOW/ETH $18.3 million 0.03% Active This data clearly shows the volume disparity driving the delisting decision. The FLOW/BTC margin pair’s volume represents less than 5% of FLOW/USDT volume. Furthermore, its spread exceeds other pairs by a significant margin. These metrics explain Binance’s rational approach to resource allocation. Expert Analysis of Exchange Pair Management Cryptocurrency exchange analysts emphasize the importance of regular pair evaluations. According to industry reports, exchanges typically review trading pairs quarterly. These reviews consider both quantitative metrics and strategic factors. Quantitative metrics include: Daily trading volume : Minimum thresholds vary by exchange tier Liquidity depth : Measured by order book concentration User activity : Number of active traders per pair Technical performance : Order execution speed and reliability Strategic factors encompass regulatory compliance and market development goals. Exchanges often prioritize pairs aligned with growing market segments. Currently, USD and USDT pairs dominate cryptocurrency trading. Bitcoin pairs, while historically significant, have declined in relative importance. This trend reflects the increasing institutional adoption of stablecoin pricing. Major trading firms now predominantly use USDT and USD pairs for pricing reference. Consequently, exchanges adjust their offerings accordingly. Binance’s decision follows this broader industry pattern precisely. Immediate Impact on Current Traders Traders currently using the FLOW/BTC margin pair face specific requirements. Binance’s announcement provides clear instructions for these users. First, all open positions must close before the delisting time. Second, users should cancel any open orders on this pair. Third, traders can transfer assets to other FLOW trading pairs if desired. The exchange will automatically convert any remaining positions after the deadline. However, this automatic process may not achieve optimal pricing. Therefore, proactive management remains strongly advisable. Historical data from previous delistings shows minimal market disruption when traders act promptly. The FLOW/BTC spot pair remains available for trading despite the margin pair removal. This distinction is crucial for long-term FLOW holders. Margin trading involves additional complexities compared to spot trading. These complexities include funding rates, liquidation risks, and collateral management. The delisting affects only the specific FLOW/BTC margin pair. Other margin pairs involving FLOW continue operating normally. Similarly, FLOW/BTC spot trading remains unaffected entirely. Traders seeking leveraged exposure to FLOW can consider alternative approaches. These alternatives include: Using FLOW/USDT margin pairs with higher liquidity Trading BTC/USDT margin pairs separately from FLOW positions Utilizing perpetual swap contracts where available Exploring decentralized margin trading protocols Each alternative carries distinct risk profiles and requirements. Traders should evaluate these options based on their specific strategies. Professional traders typically maintain multiple exchange accounts for flexibility. This practice mitigates reliance on any single platform’s offerings. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Markets Exchange delistings represent normal market evolution in cryptocurrency. These actions signal healthy ecosystem management rather than fundamental problems. The FLOW project continues developing its blockchain ecosystem actively. Recent announcements include partnerships with major sports leagues and entertainment companies. Furthermore, technical upgrades to the Flow blockchain proceed according to roadmap. The delisting specifically addresses trading pair optimization rather than project viability. Market data confirms FLOW’s continued adoption in the NFT sector. Daily active addresses on the Flow blockchain have increased 28% year-over-year. Transaction volume shows similar growth patterns despite market conditions. Cryptocurrency exchanges face increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide. This scrutiny influences listing and delisting decisions significantly. Exchanges must balance innovation with compliance requirements carefully. Binance’s approach reflects this balanced perspective. The exchange maintains hundreds of trading pairs across multiple asset classes. Regular optimization ensures sustainable operations. Users benefit from improved liquidity on remaining pairs. Market quality metrics generally improve following such rationalization. Historical analysis shows reduced spreads and better execution on consolidated pairs. Therefore, while initially disruptive, delistings often improve overall trading conditions. Conclusion Binance’s decision to delist the FLOW/BTC margin trading pair follows established exchange management practices. The January 3, 2025 deadline gives traders adequate preparation time. This action reflects specific metrics rather than broader market sentiment. FLOW continues as a viable cryptocurrency with active development. Traders should focus on alternative pairs for continued market participation. The cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves through such optimizations regularly. Therefore, market participants must maintain flexibility in their trading approaches. Understanding exchange mechanics remains crucial for successful cryptocurrency trading. This Binance delisting of the FLOW/BTC margin pair demonstrates professional market management in action. FAQs Q1: What happens to my open FLOW/BTC margin positions after delisting? Binance will automatically close any remaining positions at the delisting time. However, traders should close positions manually to ensure optimal pricing. Q2: Can I still trade FLOW against Bitcoin on Binance after January 3? Yes, the FLOW/BTC spot trading pair remains available. Only the specific margin trading pair is being removed. Q3: Why is Binance removing this particular trading pair? The exchange cites low liquidity and trading volume as primary reasons. Regular reviews identify underperforming pairs for optimization. Q4: Will this delisting affect FLOW’s price significantly? Historical data suggests minimal price impact from single exchange pair delistings. FLOW trades on multiple exchanges with deeper liquidity pairs. Q5: What alternative trading options exist for FLOW margin trading? Traders can use FLOW/USDT margin pairs or explore perpetual contracts. Different risk management approaches may be necessary for these alternatives.

This move, announced via GlobeNewswire, signals a broader industry trend where cryptocurrency miners are diversifying their business models beyond pure digital asset production. Consequently, the transaction represents a calculated reallocation of resources in response to evolving market dynamics and technological opportunities. Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Major Portfolio Restructuring Bitfarms Ltd. has sold its 70-megawatt (MW) Bitcoin mining facility in Paso Pe, Paraguay, to Sympatheia Power Fund. The company disclosed the $30 million deal on May 15, 2025. This sale concludes Bitfarms’ operational presence in Latin America. The facility previously contributed to the company’s global hash rate. However, management has decided to reallocate these assets. Therefore, the proceeds will fund new ventures in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). The Paso Pe site began operations in 2022. It leveraged Paraguay’s abundant hydroelectric power. This renewable energy source offered a cost-effective advantage for energy-intensive mining. Nonetheless, the company’s strategic review identified greater potential elsewhere. Subsequently, executives approved the divestment. This decision aligns with a corporate focus on higher-margin infrastructure projects. Moreover, it optimizes the company’s geographical footprint for future growth. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Mining Industry’s Strategic Pivot The Bitcoin mining sector is undergoing a substantial transformation. Historically, companies competed primarily on hash rate and energy cost. Now, many are exploring adjacent technological fields. For instance, HPC and AI data centers require similar infrastructure. They need robust power supplies, advanced cooling, and secure facilities. Consequently, mining firms possess transferable expertise. This industry shift is driven by several key factors. Post-Halving Economics: The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards. This event pressured mining profitability, compelling operational efficiency. Energy Market Volatility: Global energy price fluctuations impact mining margins significantly, encouraging diversification. AI Infrastructure Demand: Demand for AI compute power is surging, creating a lucrative adjacent market for data center operators. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving cryptocurrency regulations in various jurisdictions introduce uncertainty, prompting portfolio adjustments. Capital Allocation: Investors increasingly reward diversified technology plays over single-asset commodity producers. This trend is not isolated to Bitfarms. Several other publicly-traded miners have announced similar strategic reviews. They are evaluating existing assets for alternative uses. Therefore, the Bitfarms Paraguay sale is a notable case study in this broader movement. Expert Perspective on Mining Industry Evolution Industry analysts view this move as a logical adaptation. “Mining companies are natural infrastructure operators,” notes a report from Compass Point Research. “Their core competency is managing large-scale, power-hungry computing operations in often remote locations. This skill set translates directly to the burgeoning HPC and AI data center market.” The report further highlights that the capital-intensive nature of mining necessitates constant evaluation of return on invested capital (ROIC). Financial data supports this strategic rationale. A comparison of key metrics illustrates the potential appeal of diversifying revenue streams. Potential Revenue Stream Comparison: Bitcoin Mining vs. AI/HPC Hosting Metric Traditional Bitcoin Mining AI/HPC Infrastructure Hosting Revenue Model Volatile; tied to Bitcoin price & network difficulty Predictable; often long-term contracted service fees Capital Intensity Very High (ASIC hardware) High (GPU/TPU clusters & cooling) Power Cost Sensitivity Extremely High High, but often passed through in contracts Hardware Lifespan ~3-4 years before obsolescence ~4-5 years, with more upgrade flexibility Regulatory Scrutiny Increasing globally Established and generally stable This comparative analysis shows why diversification is attractive. AI infrastructure offers more stable, contracted revenue. It also faces different regulatory pressures. Therefore, Bitfarms’ pivot aims to build a more resilient business model. The Future Focus: High-Performance Computing and AI Energy Infrastructure Bitfarms plans to reinvest the $30 million from the Paraguay sale. The capital will develop high-performance computing and AI-based energy infrastructure. Company executives have outlined a clear vision. They intend to leverage their existing expertise in large-scale electrical and thermal management. This expertise is critical for modern data centers. Specifically, AI training clusters generate immense heat. Efficient cooling solutions are paramount. Mining firms have years of experience solving this problem. The company’s existing facilities in the United States and Canada are potential candidates for conversion. These sites already have secured power contracts and robust grid connections. Furthermore, they are located in regions with supportive policies for technology investment. Redeveloping a portion of these sites for HPC could happen relatively quickly. This approach allows for a phased transition. It also mitigates risk by maintaining some Bitcoin mining revenue during the build-out. This strategic direction receives support from market forecasts. Demand for AI compute is projected to grow exponentially through the decade. Firms providing the physical infrastructure for this demand are well-positioned. Consequently, Bitfarms is entering a competitive but high-growth market. Their differentiator will be proven experience in managing megawatt-scale computing operations reliably and efficiently. Conclusion The sale of the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility represents a strategic inflection point for the company and reflects a wider evolution within the cryptocurrency mining industry. By exiting Latin America and reallocating $30 million toward high-performance computing and AI infrastructure, Bitfarms is proactively adapting to post-halving economics and capitalizing on the explosive demand for artificial intelligence compute capacity. This pivot highlights the increasing convergence between digital asset infrastructure and the broader technology sector, as firms leverage their core operational competencies to secure future growth in adjacent, high-value markets. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitfarms sell its Paraguay facility? Bitfarms sold the facility as part of a strategic shift to reallocate capital from pure Bitcoin mining toward developing infrastructure for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence, aiming for more diversified and potentially stable revenue streams. Q2: Who purchased the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility? The 70 MW facility in Paso Pe was purchased by Sympatheia Power Fund for a total of $30 million, as reported by GlobeNewswire. Q3: Does this sale mean Bitfarms is exiting Bitcoin mining entirely? No, the sale marks an exit from Latin America, but Bitfarms continues its Bitcoin mining operations in other regions, such as the United States and Canada. The move is a portfolio optimization, not a full exit from the industry. Q4: What is high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure? HPC and AI infrastructure refers to the specialized data centers that house powerful computing clusters (like GPUs and TPUs) used for complex tasks such as scientific research, data analysis, and training artificial intelligence models. These facilities require massive amounts of power and advanced cooling, similar to Bitcoin mining farms. Q5: How might this strategic shift affect Bitfarms’ future financial performance? The shift could lead to a more diversified revenue model with longer-term contracts from HPC/AI hosting, potentially reducing volatility compared to earnings solely dependent on Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty. However, success depends on execution and competition in the new market.

YBTC’s holdings are primarily US Treasury bills, with complex options positions rather than traditional covered calls on Bitcoin ETFs. We go over the return profile to illustrate why most covered call funds don't pass our tests. Today, we will focus on Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ). According to their website, this is what it does. The Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF is the first U.S. listed bitcoin covered call ETF. 1 The Fund offers exposure to exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) that have direct exposure to bitcoin * , subject to a cap, while providing the potential for current income. YBTC is an actively-managed ETF. Source: Roundhill The fund does not directly ""invest"" (we have to use the quotes here) in Bitcoin but uses exchange-traded products. When we read that, we thought it might just hold a Bitcoin ETF and then sell calls on that. You probably thought the same. Instead, when we examine the holdings, they present a drastically different picture. YBTC Their current AUM is around $224 million, so the entire AUM is invested in US Treasury bills. A tiny portion is also invested in Government Treasury mutual fund ($143,176), and some is held as cash ($798,464). The actual bitcoin-related holdings are strange, to say the least. Here's the first one. YBTC This appears to be a purchased call option. Normally with covered call funds, you would expect to see the underlying ETF, which in this case is iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), and then a call sold. So this would then appear with a negative sign. A purchased call is the opposite of what you would expect these funds to do. This is also right at the money ($49.72 strike) and close to expiration (Jan 16, 2026). Seeking Alpha So if Bitcoin stays here, the entire premium evaporates. That would be a 3.4% loss in one month on equity/AUM. But it gets more interesting. Against that purchased call, there is a sold call. This expires on January 2, 2026, and is of a higher strike price of $51.30. YBTC So the fund has created a long calendar call spread. Not something you would see in a typical covered call fund. This then brings us to our final position, which is one where significant premiums are sold. The fund has 45,048 contracts of the $49.72 put. YBTC For those that are unaware, cash-secured puts are identical to covered calls, adjusted for market interest rates. So if you sell a cash-secured put and in the interim park your money in a Treasury bill, you should get the same return profile as buying the stock and selling the identical strike covered call. There are some nuances depending on dividends and early exercise probabilities, but that all is not something we have to even think about with Bitcoin. So the overall position here is strange in some ways, as the fund did cash-secured puts for Bitcoin and then used that money to buy calls, partially offset by a calendar spread. Of course this is all just a moment in time, so we have no idea how this strategy has been changed over the course of the fund's history. What we do have is the pudding, where we can look for the proof. The Pudding If you run the price return profiles of IBIT and YBTC, you get a rather glaring contrast. Data by YCharts Of course the investor is now going, ""Wait, you didn't count my fat dividend checks."" We get that, and we will get to that. We always like to see this part first, as it gets to this decay principle where funds struggle to make the same dollars they did on day one as their NAV goes down. Now, there are some income investors who feel the rules of math don't apply. They seem to believe a fund with a $100 NAV per share can generate the same income even after its NAV drops 50%. But we made it past fourth grade (on the second attempt), so that is not a problem for us. Getting back to the total returns, we see that YBTC has been a real problem child here, lagging IBIT by a lot since inception. Data by YCharts That is a lot of ground to give up. The truly fascinating aspect about this fund is that it has delivered worse total returns in the recent bear market. Data by YCharts That's right. The fund has actually lagged IBIT during a rather steep drop. Verdict You couldn't pay us to speculate on Bitcoin. But if you are doing that, buy Bitcoin or IBIT and do your own covered calls. There are ways to do this intelligently that reduce your risk and improve your returns. Funds focused on generating income tend to miss the forest for the trees. There is too much emphasis on selling premiums rather than asking whether it is the right time to sell premiums. At the minimum, such funds should outperform strongly during bear markets to justify the loss of upside. You have to deliver on Sharpe if you can't deliver on Beta. Based on our opinion on Bitcoin and covered call funds and the data we have seen on this fund, we rate this a Strong Sell. Please note that this is not financial advice. It may seem like it, sound like it, but surprisingly, it is not. Investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult a professional who knows their objectives and constraints.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to an average price of $6.55, with a possible maximum trading value of $7.11 in 2028. In 2032, the target price for XRP is between $13.47 and $14.59, with an average price of $14.03. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future.

XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as buying momentum picked up, driving the coin’s price to $1.89. How much will XRP cost in 2026? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $2.81 by the end of 2026. Will XRP reach $5? If demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent, the coin could approach $5 by 2027. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 but not before 2032. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is expected to reach a maximum price of $14.59 by 2032, making it a valuable asset, particularly with the continued efforts of Ripple Labs. However, some regulatory uncertainties still exist for XRP. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that XRP trading was twice as volatile as BTC trading in 2025. On-chain data revealed that XRP recorded 80% realized volatility during the past year, highlighting a need for deeper liquidity to achieve stability. To maintain liquidity flow, Ripple released 1 billion XRP tokens in three tranches on January 1, 2026. 🚨 XRP ESCROW MOVE 🚨 1 BILLION $XRP unlocked from escrow in minutes, catching the market’s attention fast.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October through November, XRP traded around $1.83 to $3.10. At the start of December, XRP is trading around $1.99 to $2.18. XRP entered 2026 in a corrective phase, trending near $1.8, as the broader crypto market is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-02 13:48:25

This comprehensive analysis examines the technological, economic, and market factors that will determine Ethereum’s price trajectory through the coming years, providing evidence-based projections rather than speculative claims. Ethereum’s Current Market Position and Historical Context Ethereum maintains its position as the world’s leading smart contract platform with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion as of early 2025. The network’s transition to Ethereum 2.0 fundamentally changed its economic model through staking mechanisms and reduced issuance. Historical data shows Ethereum has experienced multiple market cycles since its 2015 launch, with each cycle establishing higher support levels. The platform’s dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continues to drive network utility and transaction volume. Market analysts consistently note Ethereum’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency trends while recognizing its unique value proposition. Unlike purely monetary cryptocurrencies, Ethereum functions as a global settlement layer for decentralized applications. This dual nature as both a store of value and utility platform creates complex price dynamics. Institutional adoption has accelerated through regulated investment products, including spot Ethereum ETFs approved in major markets during 2024. Technical Analysis: Ethereum Price Projections for 2026 Technical analysts employ multiple methodologies to project Ethereum’s 2026 price range. Fibonacci extension levels from previous market cycles suggest potential resistance between $8,000 and $9,500. However, these projections depend heavily on continued network development and adoption metrics. On-chain data provides crucial insights through metrics like active addresses, transaction volume, and gas fee trends. The following table summarizes consensus projections from major analysis firms: Analysis Firm 2026 Low Projection 2026 High Projection Key Assumptions Glassnode $6,200 $8,800 Moderate adoption growth CoinMetrics $5,800 $9,200 Continued DeFi expansion CryptoQuant $6,500 $9,500 Institutional inflow acceleration These projections assume several critical developments will continue: Layer-2 scaling solutions maintain adoption growth Regulatory clarity improves in major markets Network upgrades proceed according to roadmap Macroeconomic conditions remain favorable for risk assets Fundamental Factors Driving Ethereum’s 2027 Outlook Ethereum’s 2027 price trajectory depends fundamentally on network utility metrics rather than speculative trading. The platform’s revenue model derives primarily from transaction fees generated by decentralized applications. Major financial institutions project Ethereum’s annual transaction fee revenue could exceed $15 billion by 2027 if current growth rates continue. This revenue generation capacity provides fundamental value support distinct from purely speculative assets. Network development progress remains crucial for long-term valuation. The Ethereum roadmap includes several significant upgrades scheduled for 2026-2027: Verkle Trees implementation for improved stateless clients Further scalability enhancements through danksharding Account abstraction improvements for user experience Cross-chain interoperability standardization These technical developments could substantially increase Ethereum’s transaction capacity while reducing costs. Consequently, they may drive higher adoption across enterprise and institutional use cases. Market analysts particularly emphasize the importance of enterprise adoption for sustainable price appreciation beyond speculative cycles. Expert Perspectives on Long-Term Valuation Models Leading blockchain economists employ various valuation models to assess Ethereum’s fair value. Discounted cash flow models based on network fee revenue suggest a fundamental value range between $7,000 and $12,000 by 2027. However, these models contain significant assumptions about growth rates and discount factors. Network value to transaction ratios provide alternative valuation frameworks comparing Ethereum to traditional payment networks. Dr. Elena Martinez, blockchain economist at Stanford University, explains: “Ethereum’s valuation requires multi-faceted analysis combining traditional finance methodologies with novel crypto-economic models. The network’s value accrual mechanisms differ fundamentally from both corporations and commodities.” This hybrid nature makes price prediction particularly challenging but also creates unique investment characteristics. The $10,000 Threshold: Realistic Timeline and Requirements Reaching $10,000 per ETH requires specific market conditions and network developments. Quantitative analysis suggests this milestone becomes statistically probable when Ethereum achieves: Daily active addresses exceeding 5 million consistently Annual fee revenue surpassing $20 billion Staked ETH percentage maintaining above 40% of supply Institutional custody of over 25% of circulating supply Historical volatility patterns indicate Ethereum typically requires 12-18 months of accumulation before major price breakthroughs. The $10,000 level represents both psychological and technical resistance. Market structure analysis shows substantial sell-side liquidity around this price point from long-term holders. Consequently, reaching and sustaining above $10,000 likely requires multiple test attempts over several quarters. Macroeconomic conditions significantly influence cryptocurrency valuations. Federal Reserve policies, inflation rates, and global liquidity conditions historically correlate with crypto market cycles. Most projections assuming ETH reaches $10,000 by 2030 require moderately expansionary monetary policies during the latter half of the decade. Geopolitical stability and regulatory clarity also serve as necessary preconditions for sustained institutional investment. 2030 Horizon: Ethereum’s Maturation Phase By 2030, Ethereum may complete its transition to a mature blockchain platform serving global financial infrastructure. Price projections for this timeframe become increasingly speculative but follow identifiable trends. If Ethereum maintains its current market share in smart contract platforms, its valuation could reasonably reach between $15,000 and $25,000 based on total addressable market projections for decentralized finance. Several risk factors could alter this trajectory substantially: Technological disruption from competing platforms Regulatory intervention limiting utility or access Security vulnerabilities undermining trust Macroeconomic shocks reducing risk appetite Conversely, several potential catalysts could accelerate price appreciation: Central bank digital currency integration with Ethereum Mass adoption of decentralized identity solutions Enterprise migration of major financial infrastructure Tokenization of real-world assets at scale Conclusion Ethereum price prediction for 2026 through 2030 involves analyzing complex technological, economic, and market factors. While reaching $10,000 represents a plausible scenario under favorable conditions, investors should focus on fundamental network metrics rather than price targets alone. Ethereum’s evolution as a global settlement layer continues to create value through utility and adoption. Responsible analysis emphasizes evidence-based projections while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in rapidly evolving technological ecosystems. The Ethereum price prediction landscape remains dynamic, requiring continuous monitoring of both on-chain metrics and broader market developments. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic Ethereum price prediction for 2026? Most analysis firms project Ethereum trading between $6,000 and $9,500 in 2026, assuming continued network development and moderate adoption growth across decentralized applications and institutional products. Q2: What factors could prevent Ethereum from reaching $10,000? Several factors could impede this milestone, including regulatory restrictions in major markets, technological challenges in scaling solutions, increased competition from alternative platforms, or adverse macroeconomic conditions reducing cryptocurrency investment flows. Q3: How does Ethereum 2.0 affect long-term price predictions? The transition to proof-of-stake consensus reduces Ethereum’s inflation rate through decreased issuance and introduces staking mechanics that potentially decrease circulating supply. These changes fundamentally alter Ethereum’s economic model, making historical price comparisons less reliable for future projections. Q4: What percentage of Ethereum needs to be staked for price stability? Analysis suggests that staking participation above 30-40% of total supply contributes significantly to price stability by reducing liquid circulating supply. Current staking rates exceeding 25% already provide substantial network security and economic effects. Q5: How do institutional investments affect Ethereum price predictions? Institutional participation through regulated products like ETFs increases market depth and reduces volatility over time. Sustained institutional inflow typically supports higher valuation floors and may accelerate adoption timelines, though it also introduces correlation with traditional financial markets.

He adds that the sale of the Paso Pe site marks the culmination of a broader effort to exit Latin America and refocus the company’s management capital and operational priorities on North American power and infrastructure. Bitfarms Ditches BTC for AI After Shocking $46M Loss Bitfarms said it has increasingly positioned itself as an energy and digital infrastructure company expanding beyond bitcoin mining into high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads which it believes offer more long-term returns on invested capital. In November the company said it will wind down its Bitcoin operations over 2026 and 2027 after posting a steep $46 million loss in the third quarter nearly double its $24 million loss during the same period last year. @Bitfarms_io shares dropped 18% as it announced a wind-down in $BTC operations to pivot to AI infrastructure after a $46M Q3 loss. #Bitcoin #AI https://t.co/3Q7tsldFzS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2025 Deal Structure and Payment Timeline Under the terms of the agreement, the buyer will acquire the shares of a single-purpose subsidiary that holds all operating assets related to the Paso Pe project. The proposed transaction values the site at up to $30 million. Bitfarms expects to receive $9 million in cash at closing which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. This amount includes a $1 million non-refundable deposit that has already been paid by the buyer. The company may receive up to an additional $21 million over the ten months following closing, contingent on the achievement of certain payment milestones. The structure of the transaction is expected to improve Bitfarms’ liquidity profile by accelerating the monetization of the asset while providing short-term financing supported by the operation. Buyer Targets Operational Continuity A representative for Sympatheia Power Fund said the acquisition supports the fund’s regional expansion strategy in crypto infrastructure and emphasized the importance of a smooth transition. “Our priority is an uninterrupted, seamless transition from day one maintaining continuity at Paso Pe as we move into the next phase of growth,” said SPF representative Josh Murchie. Updated Energy Portfolio Post-Sale Following completion of the transaction, Bitfarms’ energy portfolio will be entirely North America–based. The company said it will operate 341 megawatts of energized capacity with an additional 430 megawatts under active development in the United States. Its total multi-year pipeline stands at 2.1 gigawatts with roughly 90% located in the U.S. The post Bitfarms to Exit Latin America Selling 70 MW Paraguay Mining Site for Up to $30M appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Bitfarms|Mining|Paraguay,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2026-01-02 13:55:59

Traders on Polymarket appear cautious, while some big-name firms keep calling for big gains in 2026. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Market Odds And Trader Caution According to Polymarket prices, Bitcoin has just a 23% chance of reaching $150,000 before 2027. The odds are higher at lower targets: 47% for $120,000, 35% for $130,000 and 29% for $140,000. Traders are most comfortable with $100,000, which carries about an 80% chance. That spread shows bettors are pricing risk tightly as the clock runs toward the new year. Bitcoin closed 2025 in the red, a fact that has likely cooled some enthusiasm. Reports have disclosed that gold and silver hit fresh highs in the fourth quarter of 2025, while crypto prices held mostly flat. The old four-year halving cycle that many chartists relied on is being questioned, and that doubt is being priced in. Technical Signals Based on the latest Bitcoin price outlook, BTC is expected to climb 3% to about $91,815 by February 1, 2026. Technical signals point to a Bearish mood, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 28, reflecting Fear. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin posted gains on 15 of those days, or 50%, with price swings averaging 2%. Policy Shifts Could Change The Math US President Donald Trump is expected to name a new Federal Reserve chair soon, and many market participants are betting that interest rates will be cut afterward. That idea has already helped send precious metals higher. At the same time, regulators in Washington are pushing crypto bills such as the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, which backers say could give clearer rules and, in time, more institutional interest. Analysts Still Offer Bullish Targets Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has publicly predicted that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by the end of 2026, citing stronger institutional interest and better regulatory clarity as reasons for his bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bear Market Might Not Be New: Data Points To A 2-Month Slide Analysts at JPMorgan have suggested a theoretical Bitcoin price around $170,000 in 2026, based on a model comparing Bitcoin’s behavior to gold and assuming continued capital flows into the crypto market. Grayscale’s 2026 digital asset outlook expects Bitcoin to exceed its previous all-time high in the first half of 2026, implying a move above its record peak of around $126,000 (though not giving a specific numerical target, the implication is toward significant upward momentum). Policymakers, traders and analysts are all weighing different risks. Market prices reflect caution today, while forecasts offer a brighter view for the months ahead. Which one proves right will depend on policy moves, investor appetite and whether new trading patterns replace the cycle many thought they could count on.

Ripple has long operated outside the approval of crypto purists, yet its institutional strategy continues to gain traction. As market participants reassess which networks stand to benefit most from real-world adoption, Ripple and XRP are returning to the center of serious debate. That renewed attention followed a clip shared by Jungle Inc Crypto News on X featuring comments from Empire Crypto podcast host Santiago Santos, commonly known as Santi. During the discussion, Santos delivered a notably bullish assessment of Ripple’s position in the digital asset landscape, describing the company as “a force to be reckoned with.” Ripple’s Execution Over Market Sentiment Santos framed his analysis around execution rather than narrative. He highlighted Ripple’s 2025 acquisition strategy , pointing to deals involving Hidden Road, SentBe, and Archax . He argued that these acquisitions strengthened Ripple’s grip on institutional payments, liquidity infrastructure, and regulated financial services. Bullish on Ripple and XRP: and they hate it Empire Crypto host Santi says “Ripple is a force to be reckoned with.” And this part surprised people He’s more bullish on XRP hitting a new ATH than ETH pic.twitter.com/JCfDiUkGyB — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) January 1, 2026 He emphasized that Ripple continues to expand while much of the crypto market remains distracted by short-term price action. In his view, this focus on building real financial rails separates Ripple from projects that rely heavily on speculative momentum. Why Ripple Commands Institutional Respect Santos acknowledged that many crypto natives still dismiss Ripple and XRP. However, he argued that institutional players evaluate networks through a different lens. He stressed that banks and financial firms prioritize reliability, compliance, and execution over community sentiment. By aligning its strategy with these priorities, Ripple has positioned itself as a serious contender in global payments. Santos made it clear that this progress persists regardless of online criticism. XRP’s Chances Against Ethereum Surprise Observers The most unexpected moment came when Santos compared XRP’s outlook to Ethereum’s. He stated that XRP has a higher chance of surpassing its 2018 all-time high in 2026 than Ethereum does. This statement surprised many listeners, given Ethereum’s dominant role in decentralized finance and smart contracts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Santos based this view on relative execution and market expectations. He suggested that Ethereum faces increasing structural complexity and valuation pressure, while XRP benefits from clearer institutional use cases and focused development. Bullish Analysis Without Personal Exposure Despite his positive outlook, Santos clarified that he does not hold XRP. He explained that he finds it difficult to underwrite XRP’s valuation due to its unique role in the market. This distinction added weight to his comments, as he separated objective analysis from personal investment behavior. His remarks reflected a broader shift in how analysts evaluate XRP. Many now assess it as financial infrastructure rather than a speculative asset. As Ripple continues to execute and expand its institutional footprint, opinions like Santos’ suggest that XRP may defy prevailing narratives in the next market cycle.

The pledge arrives as South Korea’s financial regulator and central bank remain locked in a prolonged dispute over stablecoin issuance rules that have pushed comprehensive digital asset legislation into next year. According to the local report, Jeong told attendees at the Korea Exchange’s Seoul headquarters that new investment products, including virtual asset ETFs and derivatives, would be introduced as part of efforts to overcome the “ Korea Discount ” and upgrade the capital market. He also committed to deploying AI-based monitoring systems and strengthening crackdowns on stock manipulation through a joint response team. Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo. | Source: Yonhap Korea Exchange Ready, Regulators Still Divided The Korea Exchange’s readiness to launch crypto products contrasts sharply with regulatory delays that have stretched back years. The Financial Services Commission submitted a roadmap in June proposing spot crypto ETFs for late 2025, but the plan has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, South Korea’s comprehensive Digital Asset Basic Act remains stalled in 2026 after the Financial Services Commission and Bank of Korea failed to reach an agreement on stablecoin governance . The central bank insists that stablecoins should be issued only by bank-led consortia, with lenders holding at least a 51% ownership stake. The FSC has resisted the fixed threshold, warning it could sideline technology firms and slow innovation in digital payments. Regulators also disagree on whether a new licensing committee is needed for stablecoin oversight. Beyond stablecoins, the draft law would introduce strict investor protections, including full-reserve custody requirements, and raise compliance standards for crypto service providers to match those in traditional finance. Initial coin offerings banned since 2017 could return under strict disclosure rules. Stablecoin issuers would be required to hold reserves entirely in bank deposits or government bonds, with 100% of those reserves entrusted to licensed custodians. South Korea’s comprehensive crypto law has been delayed to 2026 due to a dispute over who should be allowed to issue stablecoins. #Crypto #Regulation https://t.co/jKP9L9n63S — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 The regulatory impasse continues despite strong political momentum from President Lee Jae-myung’s administration, which campaigned on easing digital asset restrictions. The ruling Democratic Party introduced legislation in June to amend the Capital Markets Act, expanding the definition of underlying assets for ETFs to include Bitcoin and other digital currencies. A separate bill proposed legalizing stablecoin issuance by domestic firms with a minimum capital of 500 million won. However, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong has opposed the development of non-bank stablecoins due to monetary policy concerns. Enforcement Drive Continues Across Major Exchanges While policy debates drag on, enforcement actions have accelerated. The Financial Intelligence Unit imposed a ₩27.3 billion fine on Korbit in late December following approximately 22,000 anti-money laundering violations identified during October inspections. The regulator found failures in customer identification, unauthorized transactions with unregistered overseas platforms, and inadequate money-laundering risk assessments for new products. The Korbit penalty followed earlier sanctions against Upbit operator Dunamu, which received a three-month suspension on new customer accounts in February and a ₩35.2 billion fine in November. Bithumb, Coinone, and GOPAX remain under review as the FIU works through cases in inspection order, with total fines across the sector expected to reach hundreds of billions of won. South Korea is set to hit major crypto exchanges with new penalties over anti-money laundering failures, signaling a tougher enforcement phase for the industry. #SouthKorea #CryptoAML https://t.co/9r42trYMmE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 Authorities are simultaneously expanding transaction monitoring requirements. The same late last month, a task force led by the FIU is reviewing whether to extend the travel rule to cover crypto transfers below 1 million won, closing a gap regulators say has enabled smurfing techniques used to evade reporting thresholds. The proposed changes would require exchanges to collect sender and recipient information for all virtual asset transfers, regardless of size. Mixed Signals From Financial Authorities The regulatory uncertainty has created contradictory guidance for asset managers. In July, the Financial Supervisory Service issued verbal warnings restricting the proportion of crypto-related stocks , such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, in domestic ETF portfolios, citing administrative guidance from 2017 that remains in effect. Several Korean ETFs already hold double-digit allocations to these companies through passive index tracking. However, industry participants argued that the restrictions create unfair advantages for US-listed crypto products while failing to prevent capital outflows. “Restricting only domestic ETFs will not stop the flow of funds, and in reality, many investors are already bypassing the market with U.S. ETFs,” one source noted at the time.

Three Bullish Signals Investors Can't Ignore,https://coinpaper.com/13496/is-dogecoin-about-to-rally-three-bullish-signals-investors-can-t-ignore,"Dogecoin has emerged from a prolonged downtrend with notable momentum indicators suggesting a potential recovery. The meme coin has registered a significant gain. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at around $0.1315, having climbed 8.94% in the past 24 hours. This price action coincided with a substantial increase in market activity and investor participation across multiple metrics. Dogecoin’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex ) Trading Volume Jumps 41% as Market Interest Returns Market data shows Dogecoin's trading volume reached $1.55 billion, marking a 41.53% increase over the previous day. This surge represents a meaningful shift in market dynamics after weeks of declining prices. Volume spikes often signal genuine market interest rather than artificial price movements. The elevated trading activity suggests retail traders, institutional participants, and large-scale investors have returned to the market. For meme coins like Dogecoin, which rely heavily on community engagement and social momentum, increased volume can amplify price trends. Golden Cross Pattern Emerges on Technical Charts Technical analysis of Dogecoin's hourly chart reveals the formation of a golden cross pattern. This occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, creating a bullish signal that traders interpret. The specific pattern shows the 9-period simple moving average crossing above the 26-period simple moving average. While traditional golden cross formations typically involve 50-period and 200-period averages, shorter timeframe crosses can indicate the beginning of momentum shifts. Dogecoin Price Chart, Source: CoinMarketCap This technical development suggests short-term price strength is overtaking longer-term bearish trends. When combined with increasing volume, golden cross patterns carry more weight in predicting potential trend reversals. The pattern's emergence has prompted speculation about Dogecoin's ability to reach $0.2 in 2026. Technical analysts emphasize that sustained volume and continued buying pressure would be necessary to achieve such targets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-02 14:27:25

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,750, meaning it closed the year 2025 below $100,000. This price action has added pressure to sentiment, and higher-timeframe indicators are pointing to growing exhaustion. According to a 3-month candlestick analysis shared on X by analyst Greeny, the way Bitcoin closed 2025 may carry deeper implications than most traders currently understand. 3-Month Bearish Engulfing Points To Weakness Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action on the 3-month candlestick timeframe shows the cryptocurrency just printed a large bearish engulfing candle that fully overtook the prior quarterly advance. This type of candle is rare on such a high timeframe and typically points to a decisive shift in control from buyers to sellers. The chart shared by Greeny shows that this engulfing structure formed after Bitcoin failed to hold above its 2025 highs above $120,000 in October, and this shows that the year ended in distribution. Interestingly, $106,700 is now an important level moving forward because it corresponds with the bottom of the previous 3-month candle. With Bitcoin now trading below that zone, it flips from support into a heavy resistance area for price action in Q1. Any recovery attempt in early 2026 would need to reclaim this level convincingly to avoid further rejection. Furthermore, the stochastic level near $108,000 is another important level to look at for Bitcoin’s price action in Q1 2026. According to Greeny, if the Bitcoin price closes below this zone after the first quarter, it would indicate continued downside pressure. Together, these levels form a tight ceiling overhead, meaning even strong relief rallies could struggle to transition into sustainable uptrends as we move into the new year. Bitcoin 3-month Candlestick Price Chart: @greenytrades on X Stochastic Exhaustion Points To A Possible Cycle Peak Another concerning element of Greeny’s analysis centers on the stochastic indicator. According to the analyst, this is the first time in Bitcoin’s history that the stochastic has reached the 80th percentile on the 3-month timeframe. This is otherwise notable because this is a zone generally associated with exhaustion and a local or bull cycle top. The chart also shows the red moving average crossing above the blue while sitting well below the stochastic band, a configuration Greeny interprets as confirmation of a local top. This setup is likely pointing to the end of the current bull cycle and will only be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to close above $108,000 by the end of March. Liquidity conditions across the entire crypto market tightened through late 2025 as the Central Bank of Japan maintained higher interest rates. This has led to Bitcoin underperforming compared to other notable assets, while precious metals such as gold and silver pushed to new price highs.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-02 14:30:35

PepeNode (PEPENODE), the first mine-to-earn meme coin ecosystem, has officially entered its last seven days of presale, with investor interest accelerating after confirmation that early participants can access staking rewards of up to 539%. The project has already secured more than $2.5 million in funding, while the token is currently available at its final low entry price of $0.0012161. With the presale window narrowing, PEPENODE is attracting growing attention across both the meme coin and GameFi communities. Its hybrid approach blending resource-driven gameplay with efficient token mechanics places it among a small group of 2026 projects aiming to connect decentralized finance, active user participation, and sustainable token circulation. 539% Staking Rewards Point to a Strong Focus on Long-Term Sustainability At a point where many GameFi tokens lose momentum shortly after launch, PepeNode’s 539% staking rewards stand out not just because of the yield, but because of what they’re designed to achieve. The staking model rewards holders who lock their tokens in support of network stability and gameplay expansion, aligning the interests of long-term investors and active players instead of pushing fast sell-offs. Once the project goes live, stakers gain access to dynamic pools that are linked directly to in-game performance metrics. This is key, because staking rewards are not purely inflation-driven they are tied to real activity and engagement inside the PepeNode ecosystem. Even before mining officially begins, token holders can already stake and earn the dynamically adjusted yield. At its foundation, PEPENODE reshapes crypto gaming around the “mine-to-earn” concept. Rather than repeating simple actions for token rewards, players manage an entire virtual mining operation from the ground up. Every in-game choice from expanding hardware capacity to managing energy consumption impacts overall efficiency and, in turn, token generation. The economic design also mirrors real-world mining principles such as scarcity, efficiency, and capital allocation. By making strategy the core driver of rewards, PepeNode avoids the common traps that caused many GameFi projects to collapse under unchecked, inflation-heavy token emissions. Happy New Year from PEPENODE. An amazing 2025 turns into a 2026 takeover.

Specifically, respected on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez claims to have identified a Bitcoin death cross using the 10 and 50-day simple moving averages ( SMA ), per an X article published on January 1. Within the same article, the analyst explained that, in the past, such a signal preceded a BTC crash of between 53% – as in March of 2020 – and 67% – like in September of 2014. Historically, every Bitcoin $BTC death cross between the 10W and 50W SMA has led to a major correction: • Sep 2014: –67% • Jun 2018: –54% • Mar 2020: –53% • Jan 2022: –64% https://t.co/EWSDQeujJt pic.twitter.com/CEGle2ExXd — Ali Charts (@alicharts) January 2, 2026 Simultaneously, Martinez explained he expects that a Bitcoin correction to between $38,000 and $50,000 – between 57% and 44% from the press time value – is likely. Still, the trading expert also noted with his BTC prediction that, rather than a purely detrimental situation, such a crash would once again turn Bitcoin into an attractive long-term investment. The pullback would all but ensure that the cryptocurrency’s upside potential is significantly greater than the downward pressure. Top commodity strategist forecasts massive 2026 Bitcoin crash On the other hand, hopeful BTC traders might have to wait until at least 2027 to again witness a major rally. Mike McGlone, Bloomberg’s senior commodity analyst, explained that he expects Bitcoin might crash toward $50,000 in 2026. He also revealed that the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the cryptocurrency market – fell 19% in 2025, hinting at a more persistent downtrend. Bitcoin just broke a decade-long cycle Lastly, Bitcoin’s actual performance for the entire 2025 also indicates that the boom is, for the time being, over. Simultaneously, it showcased that the cryptocurrency market might be even harder to predict in the future. BTC 12-month price chart.

Nonetheless, some key factors hint that this could be a brief recovery that could soon be replaced by a renewed correction. SHIB Enters Green Territory The self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer pumped by 8% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at around $0.000007593 (per CoinGecko’s data). Its market capitalization neared $4.5 billion, solidifying SHIB as the 35th-biggest cryptocurrency. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most evident catalyst for the rebound is the overall revival of the broader meme coin sector. Dogecoin (DOGE), the undisputed leader of the realm, is up 10% on a daily scale, while other popular tokens such as Bonk (BONK), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Pump.fun (PUMP), and Pepe (PEPE) have charted even more impressive gains. Another factor that may have positively impacted SHIB’s valuation is the resurgence of the burning mechanism. Data shows that the team behind the meme coin and its community have scorched almost 200 million tokens in the past seven days, representing a 533% increase over the prior week. The program aims to reduce the overall supply of SHIB, thus making the asset scarcer and potentially more valuable in time. The total amount of coins burned since the initiative’s introduction in 2022 is more than 410.7 trillion, meaning the circulating supply currently stands at roughly 585.2 trillion. SHIB Supply, Source: shibburn.com Touching upon the recent price rally of SHIB was X user Anup Dhungana. He suggested that the asset is now retesting a key long-term support, which in 2021 and 2024 was followed by “explosive pumps.” The Bearish Scenario Despite the solid gains, SHIB is not out of the woods yet (as some key indicators signal). The token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above 70, indicating the price has rallied too fast over a short period and could be due for a pullback. The technical analysis tool ranges from 0 to 100, and readings below 30 are typically considered bullish territory.

56733844,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258010,1767365711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Stocks Open Higher with Optimistic Momentum as Tech Leads Market Gains,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stocks-open-higher-analysis-2/,"BitcoinWorld US Stocks Open Higher with Optimistic Momentum as Tech Leads Market Gains NEW YORK, April 10, 2025 – US stocks opened higher today, extending a recent pattern of cautious optimism as investors digested fresh economic data. The S&P 500 climbed 0.63%, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 1.06%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced a more modest 0.19% at the opening bell. This positive start follows a pivotal week of corporate earnings and precedes key inflation reports, setting a decisive tone for the trading session. US Stocks Open Higher: A Detailed Breakdown of Early Gains The opening rally displayed clear sector leadership. Technology and communication services stocks provided the most significant thrust, consequently driving the Nasdaq’s outperformance. Conversely, the Dow’s relatively tempered rise reflected mixed performances in its industrial and consumer staples components. Market breadth, a critical measure of participation, was moderately positive. Analysts immediately pointed to several catalysts for the upbeat opening. Firstly, overnight futures trading indicated a strong pre-market sentiment. Secondly, several major tech firms released better-than-expected preliminary quarterly figures. Thirdly, bond yields stabilized after recent volatility. This combination created a favorable environment for risk assets at the open. The VIX index, Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge,’ dipped slightly, signaling reduced short-term volatility expectations among traders. Contextual Drivers Behind the Market Momentum Today’s gains did not occur in a vacuum. They represent a continuation of the market’s response to evolving macroeconomic narratives. Recent commentary from Federal Reserve officials has emphasized a data-dependent approach, easing fears of aggressive policy shifts. Simultaneously, corporate America has demonstrated remarkable resilience in its latest earnings season. Over 70% of S&P 500 companies have surpassed profit estimates so far. Furthermore, labor market data continues to show strength without overheating. This balance supports the soft-landing scenario that many equity investors favor. International factors also played a role; Asian and European markets traded mostly higher overnight, providing a supportive global backdrop. The US dollar index held steady, minimizing currency-related headwinds for multinational corporations. Expert Analysis: Sector Rotation and Risk Appetite Financial analysts highlight a nuanced story beneath the headline numbers. “The market is engaging in a selective rotation, not a broad-based rally,” notes a senior strategist at a major investment bank. “Capital is flowing decisively into companies with visible growth trajectories and robust balance sheets, particularly within tech and select industrials.” This selectivity explains the performance gap between the indices. Evidence for this view comes from real-time fund flow data. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the technology and semiconductor sectors saw substantial inflows during the pre-market period. In contrast, utilities and real estate ETFs experienced minor outflows. This activity suggests investors are cautiously re-engaging with growth-oriented segments while maintaining a measured stance on interest-rate-sensitive sectors. Historical Performance and Comparative Analysis To understand the significance of today’s move, a comparative view is essential. The table below shows the year-to-date performance of the three major indices alongside today’s opening gains. Index Today’s Open Gain YTD Performance (Approx.) S&P 500 +0.63% +8.2% Nasdaq Composite +1.06% +10.5% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.19% +5.7% This data reveals a consistent trend of technology leadership in 2025. Today’s action amplifies that trend. Historically, openings with this configuration—where Nasdaq leads significantly—often correlate with positive market sessions, though past performance never guarantees future results. The magnitude of the gains remains within a normal range, avoiding signals of excessive speculation or fear. Economic Indicators and Forward-Looking Catalysts The market’s immediate focus now shifts to upcoming economic releases. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for March, due later this week, represents the next major hurdle. Investors will scrutinize it for signs of disinflation progress. Additionally, the start of the Federal Reserve’s quiet period ahead of its next policy meeting will limit official commentary, potentially reducing market-moving headlines. Key factors to monitor for the rest of the trading day include: Volume: Whether the early enthusiasm translates into sustained, high-volume buying. Bond Market Reaction: Movement in the 10-year Treasury yield in response to equity strength. Sector Performance: If leadership broadens beyond technology to include financials or healthcare. Mega-Cap Stock Action: The performance of the largest market-cap companies often dictates index direction. Market participants also await speeches from several Fed regional presidents. Their tone on inflation and employment could influence afternoon trading sentiment. Furthermore, geopolitical developments remain a perennial background factor that can swiftly alter market dynamics. Conclusion US stocks opened higher, building on recent momentum as investors balanced strong corporate fundamentals against ongoing economic uncertainties. The Nasdaq’s notable outperformance underscores continued confidence in the technology sector’s innovation and profitability. While the opening gains are encouraging, the market’s trajectory for the remainder of 2025 will hinge on inflation trends, corporate earnings sustainability, and central bank policy. Today’s positive start, however, provides a firm foundation for the trading session ahead, reflecting a market that is carefully weighing risks and opportunities in real time. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when US stocks open higher? When US stocks open higher, it means the major market indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones began the trading day at a price level above the previous day’s closing price. This indicates positive pre-market sentiment, often driven by overnight news, earnings reports, or economic data. Q2: Why did the Nasdaq gain more than the Dow Jones today? The Nasdaq Composite gained more than the Dow Jones because it is heavily weighted toward technology and growth stocks, which were in high demand today. The Dow Jones includes more established industrial and consumer companies, which often see smaller, more stable movements. Q3: Are opening gains usually maintained throughout the trading day? Not always. While a strong open can set a positive tone, intraday trends depend on news flow, economic data releases, and institutional trading activity. Markets can reverse or amplify early movements based on developments during the session. Q4: What economic data do traders watch when stocks open higher? Traders immediately watch bond yields, currency markets (especially the US Dollar Index), and sector-specific ETF flows. They also monitor for any scheduled speeches from Federal Reserve officials and the release of key indicators like jobless claims or purchasing managers’ indices. Q5: How does a higher open affect individual investors? For individual investors, a higher open can improve the value of existing holdings in broad market index funds or ETFs. It may also present specific opportunities, but professional advice typically cautions against making impulsive trades based solely on opening movements, emphasizing long-term strategy instead.

The token is currently in the presale phase and is worth $0.04, although there are some analysts who believe the value will grow substantially in the long run. The current inflow of capital, the increasing number of holders and the convenient DeFi use-case by MUTM qualify it as a serious contender in the list of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. With the growing early-stage momentum, analysts say that Mutuum Finance could potentially be able to surpass $8 by the close of 2026. Presale Rise Since presale started, Mutuum Finance has received 18,650 registered accounts bringing in $19,550,000. It is already at stage 7 where the token costs $0.04. Stage 7 is moving very fast in selling and is the last stage to join at this price. The price of the token will further increase up to the time of the market release. Waiting until then to buy could mean missing out on a near 4x profit. Mutuum Finance has fixed price of launch at $0.06 which places the early investors at an obvious advantage. Analysts forecast 10-20x shortly after the token enters the market. What’s more, MUTM could climb as high as $8 by the end of 2026. The growth will be influenced by user demand in the lending, borrowing, and collateral frontiers of the MUTM ecosystem. In addition, growth focused initiatives such as the MUTM buy-and-distribute mechanism and staking are set to trigger growth. Mutuum Finance will not be using hype; its value will be pegged to activity on its platform, which will aid projections far beyond 2026. The SHIB Parallel Explained When investigating the reasons behind an 8 target in late 2026, researchers reviewed the price trend of Shiba Inu in the end of 2020 and at the beginning of 2021. SHIB reached its lowest point of approximately. $000000000056 at the end of 2020, only to increase to. $00008 by October 2021. The meme-fueled surge by SHIB was mostly little more than that, but the rally indicates that position at such low prices has the potential to open up exponential large gains as the market changes. Mutuum Finance is the place where there is real DeFi utility, and it develops a more feasible way to get high multiple over time. Reason why $8 Forecast is justified The price forecast of the fourth quarter 2026 of $8 is not a speculation but a layered projection. To begin with, the adoption of platform will increase the demand of tokens by lending and borrowing programs. Second, a decrease in tokens under circulation through staking and buy-backs will boost price. In such circumstances, analysts project a smooth increase of the valuation instead of steep rises. In this case, out of a $1000 investment, it’s possible to see returns that grow the money past $30,000 in no time, which depicts the reason why it is believed that Mutuum Finance is the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Comparing the current state of Mutuum Finance with the achievements of similar projects in the past, such as SHIB, it is obvious that MUTM can be regarded as utilitarian, with audited code and strong growth strategy. Looking at this cheap crypto, it is critically justified that the target set at $8 is achievable.

This crucial shift, anticipated by leading researchers and enterprise leaders, represents a maturation where the focus pivots from building ever-larger models to solving tangible problems with efficiency and integration. Consequently, the narrative for AI 2026 is defined by deployment, not just discovery, signaling a new chapter where technology must prove its worth in daily workflows and physical environments. AI 2026: The End of the Scaling Era and a Return to Research For nearly a decade, the dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence has been scaling. This approach, fundamentally ignited by breakthroughs like AlexNet and later supercharged by models like GPT-3, operated on a simple premise: more data and more computational power would unlock new capabilities. However, experts now observe a clear plateau. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief AI scientist, has consistently argued against over-reliance on this path. Similarly, Ilya Sutskever recently noted that pre-training results have flattened, indicating diminishing returns. This consensus suggests the “age of scaling” is reaching its natural limit. Therefore, the industry is poised for a necessary transition back to fundamental research. Kian Katanforoosh, CEO of Workera, predicts the next five years will likely yield a significantly improved architecture beyond transformers. Without such innovation, the pace of improvement for core models will stagnate. This return to research-first thinking is the foundational shift enabling the pragmatic AI revolution of 2026. The Rise of Specialized, Efficient Models This pivot away from brute-force scaling directly fuels the rise of small language models (SLMs). These compact, agile models are becoming the workhorses of enterprise AI. Andy Markus, AT&T’s chief data officer, states that fine-tuned SLMs will become a staple for mature AI enterprises in 2026. Their advantage is clear: when properly tailored for specific domains, they can match the accuracy of giant, generalized models for business applications while offering superior cost-effectiveness and speed. This trend is accelerated by advancements in edge computing, allowing these efficient models to run directly on local devices. Jon Knisley, an AI strategist at ABBYY, emphasizes that the adaptability of SLMs makes them ideal for applications where precision is paramount. The move toward smaller, specialized models represents a core tenet of pragmatic AI—using the right tool for the job rather than the biggest tool available. Building Understanding: The Emergence of World Models While language models predict text, they lack a fundamental understanding of how the physical world operates. To achieve true reasoning and reliable action, the field is increasingly focusing on “world models.” These AI systems learn by simulating how objects interact in three-dimensional spaces, enabling them to make predictions and plan actions. Evidence suggests 2026 will be a landmark year for this technology. Major players are making significant bets: LeCun left Meta to start a world model lab, and Google DeepMind continues to advance its Genie project. Furthermore, startups are entering the arena; Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs launched its commercial model, Marble, and newcomers like General Intuition secured massive funding to teach agents spatial reasoning. Initially, the most immediate impact will likely be in video games, where world models can generate dynamic environments and realistic non-player characters. PitchBook analysts project the market for this technology in gaming could explode from $1.2 billion to $276 billion by 2030. Ultimately, world models are a critical step toward creating AI that can interact with and navigate the real world, a key requirement for physical AI applications. Key AI Trends for 2026: From Hype to Pragmatism Trend Description Key Driver Expected Impact Small Language Models (SLMs) Compact, fine-tuned models for specific tasks. Cost, speed, and edge deployment needs. Enterprise adoption, on-device AI. World Models AI that learns physics and 3D interactions. Need for spatial reasoning and prediction. Advanced gaming, robotics, simulation. Agentic Workflows AI assistants integrated into business systems. Standardization via Model Context Protocol (MCP). Automation of complex, multi-step tasks. Physical AI AI embedded in wearables, robots, and devices. Advances in SLMs, edge computing, and sensors. Mainstream smart devices and specialized robotics. The Agentic Breakthrough: From Demos to Daily Use AI agents promised autonomy in 2025 but often remained trapped in limited pilot programs. A primary obstacle was the lack of a standardized way to connect them to the software tools and databases where real work happens. The breakthrough came with Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), a framework that acts as a universal connector, allowing AI agents to securely interact with external tools and data sources. With backing from OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google—which donated MCP to the Linux Foundation—this protocol is rapidly becoming the industry standard. Rajeev Dham of Sapphire Ventures believes this reduced friction will allow agent-first solutions to take on “system-of-record roles” across sectors like healthcare, property technology, and customer support in 2026. As a result, agents will evolve from flashy demonstrations to reliable components of day-to-day business operations, handling complex, multi-step workflows with greater consistency. Augmentation Over Automation: The Human-Centric Shift This move toward practical agentic workflows coincides with a broader rhetorical shift in the industry. The early narrative of widespread job displacement by AI is giving way to a more nuanced focus on human augmentation. Katanforoosh declares that “2026 will be the year of the humans.” The realization is dawning that AI works best as a collaborative tool that enhances human capabilities rather than replacing them entirely. This shift is driven by both technological limitations and economic realities. Consequently, new roles are emerging in AI governance, transparency, safety, and data management. Pim de Witte of General Intuition encapsulates the sentiment: “People want to be above the API, not below it.” This human-centric approach is a hallmark of pragmatic AI, ensuring technology serves to empower rather than alienate the workforce. Physical AI Enters the Mainstream The convergence of smaller models, world models, and edge computing is finally enabling AI to step out of the digital realm and into the physical world. Vikram Taneja of AT&T Ventures predicts that “Physical AI will hit the mainstream in 2026.” This encompasses new categories of AI-powered devices, including advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, drones, and, most imminently, wearables. While robotics and AVs continue their steady development, wearables offer a faster path to consumer adoption. Products like AI-powered smart glasses, health rings, and next-generation watches are normalizing the concept of always-on, on-body inference. These devices leverage small, efficient models to provide contextual assistance, health monitoring, and environmental awareness. For this ecosystem to thrive, network providers must optimize infrastructure to support the low-latency, high-reliability demands of these new device categories. The rise of physical AI represents the ultimate expression of pragmatic technology—intelligence embedded directly into the objects and environments of everyday life. Small Language Models (SLMs): Enable efficient, specialized AI on edge devices. World Models: Provide the spatial understanding needed for physical interaction. Model Context Protocol (MCP): Standardizes how AI agents connect to tools and data. Edge Computing: Allows processing to happen on-device, enabling real-time responses. Conclusion The pragmatic AI revolution of 2026 signifies the industry’s vital maturation from a pursuit of raw scale to a focus on applied value. This transition is characterized by the strategic use of specialized small models, the foundational development of world models for understanding, the standardized integration of agentic workflows, and the tangible emergence of physical AI. Ultimately, the success of AI 2026 will not be measured by parameter counts or demo videos, but by its seamless, reliable, and augmentative integration into human-centric systems and real-world environments. The era of pragmatic AI is fundamentally about building technology that works, quietly and effectively, in the background of progress. FAQs Q1: What is the main difference between AI in 2025 and the predicted trend for 2026? The key shift is from hype and experimentation to pragmatism and deployment. 2026 will focus on making AI usable, cost-effective, and integrated into real business workflows and physical devices, moving beyond just building larger models. Q2: Why are Small Language Models (SLMs) considered important for 2026? SLMs are smaller, more efficient AI models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. They offer significant advantages in cost and speed, can run on local devices (edge computing), and often match the performance of giant models for specialized enterprise applications, driving wider adoption. Q3: What are “world models” in AI? World models are AI systems designed to learn and simulate how objects interact in physical or 3D spaces. Unlike language models that predict text, world models aim to understand physics and causality, which is crucial for applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and advanced simulation. Q4: How will AI agents become more practical in 2026? The widespread adoption of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) will standardize how AI agents connect to software tools, databases, and APIs. This reduces development friction, allowing agents to move from limited demos to being reliably integrated into daily business processes across various industries. Q5: What does “Physical AI” mean, and what are examples? Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence embedded into and interacting with the physical world. Examples expected to grow in 2026 include AI-powered wearables (like smart glasses and health monitors), more advanced robotics, drones, and autonomous vehicle systems, all leveraging smaller models and edge computing.

The plan positions Coinbase to compete directly with traditional brokerages while expanding beyond its core digital asset business into tokenized securities and event-based markets that have attracted billions in recent trading volume. Armstrong outlined three priorities in a post on X: Building out the Everything Exchange globally Scaling stablecoins and payments Bringing users onchain through Coinbase’s developer tools, Base blockchain, and consumer app. “ Goal is to make Coinbase the #1 financial app in the world ,” he wrote, adding that the company is making major investments in product quality and automation to support the expansion. Here are our top priorities for 2026 at Coinbase: 1) Grow the everything exchange globally (crypto, equities, prediction markets, commodities – across spot, futures, and options) 2) Scale stablecoins and payments 3) Bring the world onchain through @CoinbaseDev , @base chain,… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 1, 2026 Prediction Markets and Tokenized Stocks Take Center Stage Coinbase moved aggressively into prediction markets in late 2025, partnering with Kalshi, a federally regulated platform approved by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Leaked screenshots in November revealed a Coinbase-branded prediction interface supporting USDC or USD trading across economics, politics, sports, and technology categories. The product operates through Coinbase Financial Markets, the exchange’s derivatives arm, using Kalshi’s regulatory framework to offer event contracts structured as simple yes-or-no questions. Beyond prediction markets, Coinbase plans to issue tokenized equities in-house rather than through external partners, marking a departure from rivals like Robinhood and Kraken that rely on third-party providers for stock tokens in select jurisdictions. Leaked screenshots show @Coinbase developing a prediction markets platform built on @Kalshi ’s regulated infrastructure. #Kalshi #Coinbase https://t.co/2aWPAEBQcV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 19, 2025 Monthly transfer volumes for tokenized equities have climbed roughly 76% over the past 30 days to about $2.46 billion, according to rwa.xyz , as platforms experiment with bringing traditional assets onchain. The push fits Coinbase’s ambition to become an “ everything app ” for digital assets where customers can trade crypto, tokenized securities, and event-based markets under one roof. Prediction markets have experienced explosive growth over the past year, attracting interest from both traditional exchanges and crypto-native firms that see them as a new way to monetize information and order flow. Gemini recently secured CFTC approval to launch its prediction platform, Gemini Titan, for American customers. At the same time, Crypto.com struck deals with partners , including Trump Media & Technology Group, to help build prediction markets. Robinhood and trading firm Susquehanna also agreed to buy 90% of the regulated venue LedgerX, deepening their exposure to the crypto prediction market sector. Regulatory Tailwinds and Institutional Momentum Build Coinbase executives see favorable conditions ahead as regulatory clarity improves and institutional participation deepens. David Duong, the exchange’s head of investment research, said in a year-end outlook that 2025 marked a turning point for digital assets, with regulated spot ETFs opening broader investor access and stablecoins becoming more embedded in traditional financial workflows. “ We expect these forces to compound in 2026 as ETF approval timelines compress, stablecoins take a larger role in delivery-vs-payment structures, and tokenized collateral is recognized more broadly across traditional transactions, ” Duong wrote. @Coinbase expects ETFs, stablecoins and tokenization to reinforce each other and drive faster crypto adoption in 2026. #Coinbase #Crypto https://t.co/TN8aoyEUEE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 1, 2026 Armstrong emphasized the regulatory shift during a February earnings call, telling investors, “ it’s hard to overstate the significance of the change that’s happened in the last few months. ” He argued that the transformation in US attitudes toward crypto is prompting global markets to follow, while Coinbase benefits from a playbook for international expansion. According to its Q3 shareholder letter , the exchange managed $516 billion in assets, equivalent to 16% of total crypto market capitalization. Source: Coinbase Armstrong projected that up to 10% of global GDP could run on crypto rails by decade’s end, comparing the shift to how companies adapted to the internet in the early 2000s. “ It’s a little bit like the early 2000s when every company had to figure out how to adapt to the Internet, ” he said during the call. Regarding stablecoins, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, recently warned that restrictions on stablecoin rewards could weaken the United States’ position in digital payments, as China allows commercial banks to pay interest on digital yuan wallets starting January 1, 2026. The People’s Bank of China unveiled the framework to shift its central bank digital currency beyond a cash substitute, triggering Chinese investors to pour more than $188 million into digital yuan-related stocks following the announcement.

56734130,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93855,1767366350,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Spots An XRP Warning Signal. Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-spots-an-xrp-warning-signal-heres-what-to-expect/,"Crypto markets often reveal major trend shifts on higher timeframes long before price action confirms them on shorter charts. XRP now trades at a level that has historically separated long-term bullish phases from extended bearish cycles. This positioning has placed XRP under renewed technical scrutiny as traders assess whether the broader trend remains intact. The discussion intensified after STEPH IS CRYPTO shared a detailed technical breakdown on X, highlighting a recurring signal on XRP’s monthly chart. In his analysis, Steph focused on XRP’s interaction with the monthly trend ribbon, an indicator that has previously marked decisive shifts in long-term momentum. Why the Monthly Trend Ribbon Matters for XRP The monthly trend ribbon acts as a long-term momentum filter rather than a short-term trading signal. When XRP trades above the ribbon, the market typically operates within a bullish regime where trend support remains intact. When the price moves below the ribbon, momentum often flips negative and signals a confirmed bearish environment. Because the ribbon relies on slow-moving averages, it minimizes noise and highlights structural changes in market direction. Traders, therefore, treat monthly closes around this level with heightened importance. On $XRP ’s monthly chart, losing the trend ribbon has historically marked the shift into full bearish momentum. In 2018 and 2022, the moment XRP lost the monthly trend ribbon, it wasn’t just a pullback — it confirmed a broader bearish trend, followed by –65% and –54%… pic.twitter.com/kf3uzl5Bgt — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 1, 2026 Historical Breakdowns and Their Consequences Steph pointed to two historical periods where XRP lost the monthly trend ribbon with significant consequences. In 2018, XRP confirmed a break below the ribbon and entered a sustained bearish trend that produced a decline of roughly 65%. In 2022, XRP repeated this behavior and followed with an additional drop of approximately 54%. In both instances, the loss of the ribbon did not signal a temporary pullback. Instead, it confirmed a broader trend reversal that unfolded over multiple months. XRP Approaches a Critical Monthly Decision Point XRP currently hovers directly at the monthly trend ribbon, placing the market at a technical inflection point. Steph emphasized that the warning signal only activates after a confirmed monthly close below the ribbon, not during brief intramonth volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This distinction matters because price often tests key levels before choosing a direction. A successful hold above the ribbon would preserve XRP’s long-term structure and invalidate the bearish signal. What a Confirmed Breakdown Could Signal If XRP closes below the monthly trend ribbon, historical behavior suggests that downside momentum could accelerate. Such a move would likely shift long-term sentiment into a bearish regime and increase the probability of deeper retracements toward established demand zones. Conversely, a sustained hold above the ribbon would reinforce trend support and reduce the likelihood of a prolonged decline. Why Traders Are Watching This Signal Closely Steph’s analysis relies entirely on XRP’s historical price behavior rather than external narratives. Long-term technical signals often carry greater predictive value because they reflect collective market positioning over extended periods. XRP stands at a defining technical moment. The market’s reaction to the trend ribbon may determine whether XRP maintains its broader bullish structure or transitions into a renewed bearish phase, making this level one of the most important on the chart.

56734241,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258016,1767366611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Soars: BTC Achieves Monumental $90,000 Milestone in Market Rally",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-90000-milestone-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Soars: BTC Achieves Monumental $90,000 Milestone in Market Rally In a landmark moment for digital assets, the Bitcoin price has decisively broken the $90,000 barrier, trading at $90,040 on the Binance USDT market as of early trading on April 2, 2025. This surge represents a significant psychological and technical achievement for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, fueling discussions about its evolving role in the global financial landscape. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this rally, from macroeconomic shifts to institutional adoption trends. Bitcoin Price Breaches a Critical Threshold The ascent of the Bitcoin price above $90,000 marks a new chapter in its volatile history. This movement is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of sustained buying pressure observed over recent weeks. Data from multiple trading platforms confirms the breakout, with Binance’s USDT pair serving as a key liquidity benchmark for the global market. Furthermore, this price action follows a period of consolidation below previous resistance levels, suggesting a fundamental shift in market sentiment. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated a pattern of reaching round-number milestones that later become support zones. The journey from $70,000 to this new high involved navigating regulatory announcements, macroeconomic data releases, and shifting investor risk appetites. For instance, the asset’s performance often correlates inversely with traditional market fears, positioning it as a potential hedge for some portfolios. Therefore, the breach of $90,000 is being analyzed through both technical chart patterns and broader economic narratives. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Several interconnected factors are contributing to the current cryptocurrency rally. Primarily, renewed institutional interest has provided substantial buy-side volume. Major asset managers have continued to expand their digital asset offerings, channeling traditional capital into the space. Simultaneously, macroeconomic conditions, including concerns about currency devaluation and inflation in certain regions, have driven retail and institutional investors toward scarce digital assets. Institutional Adoption: Increased integration by payment processors and treasury allocations by public companies. Macroeconomic Hedge: Perceived as a digital store of value amid expansive fiscal policies. Network Upgrades: Continued improvements to the Bitcoin protocol enhancing its utility and security. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in key jurisdictions providing a more stable framework for investment. Moreover, the supply dynamics of Bitcoin play a crucial role. The predictable, diminishing rate of new coin issuance—a process known as the halving—creates a built-in scarcity mechanism. As adoption increases against this constrained supply, basic economic principles of supply and demand exert upward pressure on the Bitcoin price. This fundamental aspect distinguishes it from traditional fiat currencies and remains a core tenet of its investment thesis. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Market analysts emphasize the importance of volume and derivative market positioning in assessing the rally’s health. Notably, open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has risen alongside the price, but funding rates have remained relatively neutral. This suggests a balance between long and short positions, potentially indicating a healthier, less speculative advance compared to past parabolic moves. Experts from major financial research firms point to on-chain data, such as the growth in long-term holder supply and low exchange reserves, as signs of strong conviction among investors. Comparatively, the current rally exhibits distinct characteristics from the 2021 bull market. The table below outlines key differences: Market Aspect 2021 Cycle 2025 Cycle (Current) Primary Drivers Retail frenzy, meme coins, excessive leverage Institutional inflows, ETF products, macroeconomic narrative Leverage Levels Extremely High Moderate to High Regulatory Environment Highly uncertain Evolving with clearer frameworks On-chain Holder Behavior High exchange inflows Accumulation & withdrawal to cold storage This shift in market structure implies a potentially more mature and stable foundation for current price levels. However, analysts universally caution that cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, and past performance never guarantees future results. Risk management, therefore, is paramount for all market participants. The Ripple Effect Across Digital Asset Markets The breakthrough in the Bitcoin price invariably influences the broader digital asset ecosystem. Often termed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s performance frequently sets the tone for altcoins and other blockchain-based assets. In this instance, the rally has restored overall market capitalization to levels not seen in years, improving liquidity and investor confidence across the board. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have often shown correlated momentum, though the strength of this correlation can vary based on independent network developments. Simultaneously, the infrastructure surrounding cryptocurrency continues to evolve rapidly. Custodial services, regulatory-compliant exchanges, and financial products like spot Bitcoin ETFs have created more accessible pathways for traditional capital. This institutional gateway effect is a critical component of the current market phase, differentiating it from earlier cycles dominated primarily by retail traders on less regulated platforms. The growing integration with legacy finance presents both opportunities for growth and new complexities regarding systemic interconnectedness. Conclusion The Bitcoin price surpassing $90,000 is a definitive milestone, reflecting a complex interplay of adoption, macroeconomics, and technological maturity. This achievement underscores Bitcoin’s persistent resilience and its growing absorption into the broader financial conversation. While volatility remains a defining feature, the market’s underlying structure appears to be evolving toward greater participation and sophistication. Ultimately, the journey toward and beyond this price point will be closely watched as a barometer for the entire digital asset class’s integration into the global economic system. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $90,040 on Binance USDT mean? This means that on the Binance exchange, one Bitcoin (BTC) can be purchased or sold for 90,040 Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is a key pricing pair that reflects real-time global supply and demand. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin’s price is rising? Primary drivers include increased institutional investment through new financial products, its perceived role as a hedge against inflation, continued adoption as a payment method, and its fixed, scarce supply schedule which contrasts with expansive monetary policy. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s current rally compare to 2021? The current rally appears more institutionally driven, with significant capital flowing through regulated ETFs and corporate treasuries. In contrast, the 2021 peak was characterized by higher retail leverage and excitement around meme coins and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Q4: Is Bitcoin’s price sustainable at this level? Sustainability depends on continued adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions. While on-chain data and institutional interest provide a stronger foundation now, cryptocurrency markets are still young and subject to high volatility and unpredictable corrections. Q5: What is the impact of Bitcoin’s price on other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often sets the overall market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin price typically increases capital flows into the entire crypto sector, boosting the prices of major altcoins. However, individual project fundamentals ultimately determine long-term performance relative to Bitcoin.

This surprising turn of events, reported by DL News in early 2025, follows his November 2024 sentencing to five years for orchestrating one of cryptocurrency’s most infamous thefts. Consequently, his release under the U.S. First Step Act raises profound questions about justice, rehabilitation, and the evolving legal landscape for digital asset crimes. Bitfinex Hacker Early Release Details and Legal Mechanism The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Ilya Lichtenstein’s early release this week. Authorities applied provisions of the First Step Act of 2018. This bipartisan federal law specifically aims to reduce recidivism. Furthermore, it promotes inmate rehabilitation through earned time credits. Lichtenstein reportedly qualified for these credits by participating in prison programming. His original five-year sentence stemmed from a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges connected directly to the 2016 Bitfinex security breach. Prosecutors originally charged Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, in February 2022. Their arrest followed a multi-year investigation by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Agents traced the movement of 119,754 Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex. At the time of the theft, the cryptocurrency was worth approximately $71 million. However, by the time of their arrest, its value had ballooned to a staggering $4.5 billion. This case remains one of the largest financial seizures in U.S. history. The 2016 Bitfinex Breach and Investigation Timeline Understanding the early release requires examining the original crime’s scale. The Bitfinex hack occurred on August 2, 2016. Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the exchange’s multi-signature wallet service. They successfully initiated over 2,000 unauthorized transactions. These transactions drained customer and corporate funds. The exchange immediately suspended all trading. It also announced a 36% socialized loss across all user accounts. For nearly six years, the stolen funds remained dormant. Then, in 2022, blockchain analytics and traditional investigative work converged. The IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Cyber Crimes Unit and HSI followed a complex trail. They linked the funds to wallets controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan. A court-authorized search of their cloud storage accounts revealed private keys. These keys directly accessed the wallets holding the stolen Bitcoin. Key Events in the Bitfinex Case Date Event Aug 2, 2016 Bitfinex hack occurs; 119,754 BTC stolen. Feb 8, 2022 Lichtenstein and Morgan arrested in New York. Aug 2022 Both plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy. Nov 2024 Lichtenstein sentenced to 5 years in prison. Early 2025 Early release granted under First Step Act. The investigation showcased unprecedented collaboration. Agencies combined blockchain forensic tools with classic financial sleuthing. This approach set a new standard for prosecuting cryptocurrency crimes. First Step Act Provisions and Application to Cybercrime The First Step Act represents a significant shift in federal sentencing policy. Its primary goals include: Reducing mandatory minimum sentences for certain non-violent drug offenses. Expanding early release programs through earned time credits. Increasing rehabilitation programming within federal prisons. Improving conditions and reducing recidivism rates. Inmates earn credits by participating in Evidence-Based Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) programs. These programs address needs like vocational training, education, and substance abuse treatment. Lichtenstein’s eligibility suggests he engaged with such programming. The Act does not distinguish between crime types for credit eligibility. Therefore, non-violent financial crimes like money laundering qualify. This application to a high-profile cybercrime case is particularly noteworthy. Impact on Cryptocurrency Security and Legal Precedents Lichtenstein’s early release sends ripples through the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, it tests the deterrent effect of prosecution for digital asset theft. Secondly, it highlights the tension between punishment and rehabilitation for technical crimes. The case already established several key legal precedents: Asset Forfeiture: The government successfully seized and sold billions in stolen crypto. Jurisdiction: U.S. courts asserted authority over crimes involving globally dispersed digital assets. Investigation Methods: The use of blockchain analytics as evidence gained judicial acceptance. Security experts note the hack forced major exchanges to overhaul their protocols. Today, most leading platforms use sophisticated cold storage solutions. They also employ multi-party computation (MPC) for key management. The Bitfinex incident remains a cautionary tale for the entire industry. Expert Analysis on Sentencing and Release Legal scholars specializing in cyberlaw offer critical perspectives. Professor Elena Carter of Stanford Law School notes, “The First Step Act focuses on rehabilitation for non-violent offenders. The court likely viewed the technical nature of the crime as non-violent, despite its massive financial scale.” Meanwhile, blockchain forensic analyst David Chen observes, “This early release doesn’t diminish the investigative breakthrough. The real victory was tracing and recovering the funds, which returned value to victims.” The case also involved Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan, a rapper and entrepreneur. She received a shorter sentence and was released earlier. Their combined story of tech savvy, money laundering through complex transactions, and unconventional public personas captured global media attention. Conclusion The early release of Bitfinex hacker Ilya Lichtenstein under the First Step Act concludes a landmark chapter in cryptocurrency legal history. This case demonstrated the formidable reach of U.S. law enforcement into the blockchain. It also tested new sentencing reforms on a high-stakes financial crime. Ultimately, the recovery of $4.5 billion in stolen assets stands as the investigation’s enduring legacy. The industry now watches how this precedent influences future prosecutions of digital asset theft and money laundering. FAQs Q1: What was the First Step Act, and why did it apply to Ilya Lichtenstein? The First Step Act is a 2018 U.S. federal law designed to reform sentencing and promote inmate rehabilitation. It applied to Lichtenstein because he qualified for earned time credits by participating in prison programming aimed at reducing recidivism, and his crime was classified as non-violent. Q2: How much Bitcoin was originally stolen in the 2016 Bitfinex hack? The hackers stole 119,754 Bitcoin from Bitfinex in August 2016. At the time of the theft, this was worth about $71 million. By the time of the arrest in 2022, the value had appreciated to approximately $4.5 billion. Q3: What happened to the stolen Bitcoin after the seizure? The U.S. government successfully seized the vast majority of the stolen Bitcoin. It then sold portions of the cryptocurrency through authorized auctions and market sales. The proceeds are held as recovered assets, with processes in place for potential victim restitution. Q4: How does this early release affect future cryptocurrency crime prosecutions? Legal experts believe the core precedent—successful investigation, seizure, and conviction—remains intact. The early release reflects sentencing policy, not investigative failure. It may, however, influence plea negotiations and sentencing arguments in future digital asset cases. Q5: What role did Ilya Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, play in the crime? Heather Morgan pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and defraud the United States. Prosecutors alleged she helped launder the stolen funds through complex transactions, shell companies, and false invoices. She received a sentence shorter than Lichtenstein’s and was released earlier.

The network associated with the world’s largest exchange, Binance, trailed Solana, which came in first. Notably, BNB Chain did not completely lag in other metrics, which could be comforting for network proponents and investors. According to data from Nansen , BNB generated $259.06 million, coming in fourth place, while Solana generated $605.66 million. Ethereum, with its barely active memecoin community, trails behind at $521.98 million, and the Tron chain remains in number 2, even though it is not so far behind Solana at $581.65 million. Analysts had high hopes for Bitcoin at the beginning of 2025. However, Nansen data shows it came in fifth with just $172.53 million. BNB generated $259.06 million, coming in fourth place. Source: Nansen Still, while BNB Chain’s revenue, compared to others, was lower, it did not completely lose in every key metric. It did well as far as active addresses are concerned, with many reports claiming it had the highest compared to other chains. It also did not perform terribly on the adoption end, with its total value locked rising over 40% while transactions grew to 150% year-over-year. Its stablecoin capitalization also doubled to roughly $14 billion at its peak, with real-world assets surpassing $1.8 billion, supported by major institutional issuers like BlackRock’s BUIDL, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, and VanEck’s VBILL. Why did BNB Chain trail in fee generation? As for why BNB Chain has not performed well regarding fees, analysts have linked it to a change in trend with people leaning more toward chains that offer utilities like Tron or high volume like Solana. While Tron offers real-world utility as a payment rail and hosts between 50 to 60% of the global USDT supply, Solana continues to dominate with its high volume, mostly from its overactive memecoin culture. Tron not only offers real-world utility, but it also does so at low cost. Investors have especially taken advantage of its low fees for microtransactions, which have kept it ahead of chains like Ethereum and BNB Chain. BNB Chain has tried to optimize its fee generation, especially as competition between chains intensifies, with average gas prices dropping as low as 0.05 gwei. While that has helped, it has not closed the gap to Solana or Tron. With help from Changpeng Zhao, it even revived its memecoin culture via Four.meme in October, a meme launchpad similar to Pump.fun. Will 2026 be better for BNB Chain? In 2025, key upgrades like the Lorentz and Maxwell upgrades significantly cut block times, reduced finality, and lowered fees roughly 20 times without harming validator rewards, all achievements that the team plans to build on directly in 2026. For the new year, the team plans to transform the network into a highly optimized trading chain after proving it has the capacity to operate at scale with zero downtime last year, even though it lagged in some key metrics. The team is focused on scaling the network to roughly 20,000 TPS with sub-second finality while maintaining low transaction costs. There are also plans to roll out a dual-client strategy, including Geth for stability and a new Rust-based Reth client for performance, alongside upgrades to parallel execution, storage, and database architecture to manage long-term state growth.

Ethereum is firmly entrenched as the second-largest cryptocurrency, while XRP is following closely behind, although it was recently overtaken by BNB in market cap rankings. This disparity naturally leads to a valuation exercise that many investors revisit during periods of interest: how much would each XRP token be worth if its market cap matched Ethereum’s, both at current levels and at Ethereum’s all-time high? XRP With Ethereum’s Current Market Capitalization At the time of comparison, Ethereum is trading around $3,035, having increased by about 1.9% in the past 24 hours. This gives it a market capitalization of roughly $366 billion. XRP, on the other hand, is trading at $1.88, holds a market cap of about $113.8 billion. Related Reading: Here’s The XRP Fractal That Says Price Is Headed To $27 Using MarketCapOf’s circulating-supply-based calculation, XRP would trade at approximately $6.04 if its total valuation matched Ethereum’s current market cap. This represents a 3.21x increase from XRP’s present price level. In relative terms, XRP is shown to be valued at roughly 0.31x of Ethereum’s market capitalization. The comparison is purely mathematical and does not factor in changes to supply. It only shows how much additional capital would be required for XRP to stand on equal footing with Ethereum as things stand today. XRP’s Valuation If It Reaches Ethereum’s All-Time High The picture changes further when Ethereum’s all-time high valuation is used as the benchmark. Ethereum’s peak market cap, which was recorded during its all-time high price of $4,946 in August, is around $583.8 billion. If XRP were to command that same valuation, MarketCapOf estimates that each XRP unit would be priced at about $9.64. This implies a 5.13x increase from XRP’s current price. Related Reading: XRP Stochastic RSI Just Touched 0.0 For The Second Time In History Under this scenario, XRP is valued at roughly 0.20x of Ethereum’s all-time high market capitalization. An investor holding 1,000 XRP today would see that position valued at about $1,880 at current prices, around $6,040 if XRP matched Ethereum’s present market cap, and $9,640 if it reached Ethereum’s peak valuation. The numbers show the scale of the gap that still exists between the two assets, even as XRP is now starting to attract institutional attention. That institutional angle has become increasingly relevant following the launch of Spot XRP exchange-traded funds, which have begun pulling in fresh capital from both professional and traditional investors. Interestingly, the valuation levels implied by the MarketCapOf comparison are conservative when placed next to XRP price projections circulating among crypto analysts. Matching Ethereum’s current or peak market capitalization places XRP in the $6 to $9.64 range. These figures are notably lower than some of the double-digit and triple-digit targets above $100 proposed by a few crypto analysts.

Officials now allegedly expect Russia’s crude oil supply to India to drop below 1 million barrels per day for the first time in months. The decision to demand tighter oil reporting came from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office, with the Ministry of Petroleum’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) relaying the instructions to refineries nationwide. This is the first time India has ever required weekly purchase disclosures, replacing the older system that relied on monthly customs figures and private sector trackers. Modi’s government wants tighter control of energy trade data while it tries to cool tensions with Washington. India is dealing with tariff threats and failed negotiations with Washington Trump had already been looking for ways to cut the U.S. trade deficit with India when he returned to power. Last year, he doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50% after India increased its intake of Russian barrels. Those punitive steps came while both countries were in early negotiations for a bilateral trade deal. But talks fell apart in late July 2025, after India refused to open its market to U.S. farm exports and didn’t publicly recognize Trump’s involvement in resolving a border flare-up with Pakistan. Yet despite the rocky road, Trump and Modi have kept communication open, and trade discussions are back on the table, though India’s Russian oil addiction remains the biggest elephant in any room the boys are. To make matters worse, Russia is locked in a maritime standoff with the U.S. over a vessel named the Bella 1. The ship had reportedly started its journey in Iran and was on its way to collect oil from a South American country, but was intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard. The New York Times reported that Russia has filed a formal diplomatic request asking Washington to back off and end the pursuit across the Atlantic Ocean. The U.S. accounted for 6.6% of Indian crude imports in 2025, Kpler data showed. Russia supplied 35%. Meanwhile, on the first trading day of 2026, Brent crude stabilized around $61 per barrel, and West Texas Intermediate stayed slightly above $57, both struggling to recover from an 18% drop in 2025, which was the steepest fall since 2020. OPEC+ members, led by Saudi Arabia, are preparing for a January 4 virtual meeting, where they’re expected to maintain current production cuts, according to a press briefing on Friday. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted that the world could face a glut of 3.8 million barrels per day this year.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $88,961.21 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This sudden Bitcoin price movement has captured the attention of traders and analysts worldwide, prompting a deep dive into the underlying market mechanics and historical context. The drop represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges and introduces fresh volatility into the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Context The descent below $89,000 marks a clear technical breakdown. Consequently, market participants are now scrutinizing order book liquidity and exchange flows. Major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken show similar price action, confirming a broad-based sell-off. Furthermore, the 24-hour trading volume has spiked by approximately 35%, indicating heightened activity. This Bitcoin price decline follows a period of consolidation just above the $90,000 psychological barrier. Market data reveals increased selling pressure from large wallet addresses, often called ‘whales.’ Historically, such movements often correlate with broader financial conditions. For instance, the current macroeconomic backdrop includes shifting expectations around central bank policies. Analysts frequently compare present volatility to past cycles, like the Q2 2024 correction. A short-term sell-off can sometimes establish a stronger foundation for future growth. Therefore, understanding the immediate catalysts is crucial for a complete market picture. Technical Indicators and On-Chain Data Key technical levels provide further insight into the Bitcoin price trajectory. The 50-day moving average, a closely watched metric, now acts as dynamic resistance. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory. On-chain analytics from Glassnode show a net outflow from exchanges, suggesting some investors are moving holdings to cold storage. This ‘hodling’ behavior often signals long-term conviction despite short-term price pain. The network’s hash rate remains robust, underscoring fundamental security strength. Analyzing Potential Catalysts for the Decline Several interrelated factors may have contributed to this cryptocurrency market downturn. First, regulatory developments continue to create uncertainty in major economies. Second, profit-taking after a sustained rally above $85,000 was a widely anticipated risk. Third, movements in traditional markets, like bond yields or equity indices, can trigger correlated sell-offs in digital assets. Finally, leveraged positions being liquidated on derivatives exchanges can exacerbate downward momentum. It is essential to distinguish between causation and correlation. For example, not every market move has a single, identifiable news trigger. Often, a confluence of minor factors creates the conditions for a shift. Market sentiment, measured by tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, had been in ‘Extreme Greed’ territory. A reversion to a more neutral or fearful reading is a common market-clearing event. Macroeconomic Pressure: Shifts in inflation data or interest rate expectations. Overleveraged Markets: Cascade of long position liquidations on futures platforms. Regulatory Headlines: News flow concerning digital asset legislation or enforcement actions. Profit-Taking: Natural sell pressure after a multi-week appreciation cycle. Historical Volatility and Bitcoin Market Cycles Bitcoin’s history is defined by volatility. A pullback of 5-15% during a bull market phase is statistically normal. For context, the 2021 cycle saw over a dozen corrections exceeding 10% before reaching its all-time high. This perspective helps investors maintain a long-term view. The current Bitcoin price action fits within established patterns of advance, consolidation, and correction. Seasoned analysts often view these dips as potential entry points rather than signals of a trend reversal, provided core fundamentals remain intact. Comparing asset classes highlights Bitcoin’s unique risk profile. Traditional safe-haven assets like gold typically exhibit lower volatility. However, Bitcoin’s potential for asymmetric returns attracts a different investor profile. The digital gold narrative persists, but its trading patterns remain distinct. This latest move serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent price discovery process, which is often volatile and inefficient. Expert Commentary and Market Sentiment Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize context. ‘Market corrections are healthy,’ notes a veteran trader from a major digital asset fund. ‘They flush out weak leverage and reset derivatives markets.’ Another analyst points to on-chain metrics showing accumulation by long-term holders during dips. This behavior suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Sentiment on social trading platforms has quickly shifted from bullish to cautious, reflecting the fast-paced nature of crypto markets. Impact on the Broader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The Bitcoin price decline has a pronounced ripple effect. Altcoins, which often correlate with BTC, have generally moved in tandem, with some experiencing more severe losses. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has dipped accordingly. However, this correlation sometimes decouples, with select projects showcasing independent strength. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) trading volumes may see secondary impacts if the downturn persists. Institutional investment flows, tracked through products like Bitcoin ETFs, will be a key metric to watch in the coming days. Sustained inflows during a price drop could signal strong institutional conviction. Conversely, outflows might indicate a broader risk-off move. The interaction between spot market selling and derivatives market liquidations creates a complex feedback loop that analysts will study closely. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $89,000 represents a significant moment in the 2025 market cycle. This movement underscores the volatile and interconnected nature of digital asset markets. While short-term price action captures headlines, the long-term narrative around Bitcoin’s adoption, technological development, and role as a digital store of value remains multifaceted. Investors are advised to focus on risk management, fundamental research, and a time horizon that aligns with their financial goals. The coming days will be critical for observing whether this level holds as support or if further downside exploration occurs. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $89,000? The decline likely resulted from a combination of profit-taking after a rally, liquidations of leveraged long positions, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. It is a typical correction within a volatile market. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions depend on individual strategy. Some view corrections as potential buying opportunities, but timing the market is notoriously difficult. Conduct thorough research and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q3: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Most major altcoins have high correlation with Bitcoin and often move in the same direction, at least in the short term. The entire crypto market cap typically reacts to significant BTC movements. Q4: What key level should traders watch next? Traders are monitoring the $88,000 and $85,000 levels as potential next supports. A reclaim of $90,000 would be viewed as a bullish signal for a potential recovery. Q5: Does this price drop change Bitcoin’s long-term outlook? A single price correction rarely alters long-term fundamental theses based on adoption, scarcity, and utility. Volatility is an inherent feature of the asset class, and long-term investors often look through short-term fluctuations.

As has usually been the practice, one billion XRP was freed from escrow, but the vast majority of it did not enter active circulation. Specifically, the company has once again re-locked 70% of the release, or 700 million XRP, in long-term storage. The remaining 300 million tokens are set to fuel liquidity and expand the ecosystem, with any unused portion likely to be returned to escrow to prevent market disruption. With the new release, the token’s total circulating supply has reached 65.78 billion, while a total of 34.18 billion XRP has been escrowed, judging by XRPSCAN data available on Friday, January 2.

Source: XRPSCAN The first Ripple XRP escrow of 2026 Ripple’s first escrow of 2026 represents no change from the December 2025 unlock , when roughly 1 billion XRP was released, but 70% of it promptly re-locked in three installments. While headline figures such as “1 billion” and “700 million” may at first appear startling, the result has historically been a muted price reaction. The asset was trading near $1.84 on the day of release, extending a steady decline that had been going on since September 2025. By press time, January 2, the price had somewhat improved, with XRP changing hands at $1.91 after a 2.74% daily uptick. XRP daily price.

At the same time, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed its 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.87 and registered a bullish MACD crossover, meaning its apparent strength is backed by solid technicals, too.

The facility will be acquired by the Sympatheia Power Fund, a crypto infrastructure investor. Bitfarms will sell its 70 MW facility in Paraguay, as it rebalances its portfolio of reliable centers and focuses on North America. With the sale, Bitfarms leaves its South American mining operations. The Paso Pe site in Paraguay is expected to transfer within 60 days, under the management of the Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. ‘ I’m pleased to announce the strategic sale of our Paso Pe site and decisive rebalancing of our energy portfolio to 100% North American. This transaction brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations to be reinvested into our North American HPC/AI energy infrastructure in 2026, where we believe we will be able to generate much stronger returns on our invested capital with HPC/AI, ’ said Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon. Bitfarms is a mid-range mining company with 19.5 EH/s in total BTC mining power. The company is also within the top 100 of BTC treasury holders, retaining 1,827 BTC from its mining activity. The Paraguay center will go toward Sympatheia Power Fund’s expansion plans for Latin America. The mining center will retain operations, with no outages during the transfer of ownership. Bitfarms sells BTC mining center for $30M Bitfarms will sell the Paso Pe BTC mining facility at a $30M valuation, with $9M in cash and up to $21M over a 10-month period. After the deal, Bitfarms will focus solely on North American energy assets while improving its liquidity profile for further expansion. Bitfarms negotiated a $300M long-term debt facility in April 2025 as part of its energy expansion plans. Bitfarms retains 341 MW in energy capacity, with another 430 MW in active development. The multi-year plan is to reach a total of 2.1 GW in data centers, of which 90% will be based in the USA. Bitfarms has been on an expansion track since 2017, and is one of the leaders in North American mining infrastructure. Bitfarms benefits from AI data center boom The sale arrives at a time when Bitcoin mining operations are often converted to high-uptime AI centers, based on existing contracts for reliable electricity. Following the deal announcement, BITF shares were trading at $2.96 (3.93 CAD), up over 32% net for the past year. The period coincided with revenue growth for BITF, as the miner benefited from the growing prices. In early 2026, BTC miners are still operating at near peak capacity, despite the distressing market conditions. Even smaller mining companies are viewed as potential bets with high returns. BITF is expected to break out based on its ongoing data center plans. BITF is competing with other recently hot mining companies like Riot and IREN, with stocks rising despite the slower BTC market growth.

The cryptocurrency’s price actions have been choppy and uncertain for several weeks. It dipped to a local low of $84,500 on December 19, shortly after the US CPI numbers for November came out, but quickly tightened its trading range. In the following ten days or so, it stood between $90,500 and $86,500. It tried to take down the upper boundary on at least three occasions since then, but each attempt was met with an immediate rejection and a subsequent retracement to the lower boundary. The current business week began similarly, as BTC spiked to $90,500, where the bears stepped up and pushed it south to under $87,000. The bulls intercepted the move and provided an immediate relief rally to $88,000. Sideways action continued in the following days, but BTC ultimately closed 2025 below $88,000, which was a 6-7% yearly decline. January 1 was expectedly a dull trading day, but bitcoin went on the offensive earlier today. It tapped $90,000 once again, only to be stopped and driven south by a grand and a half. Nevertheless, it has managed to bounce off and now sits above $89,000. This means that it’s over 2% up weekly, but its market cap has declined by 0.6% weekly as most alts have marked bigger gains since last Friday. These include ETH, BNB, SOL, and ADA, all of which are up by 5-6%. DOGE has risen by more than 9%, and so has ZEC. XMR, HYPE, and BCH are among the few alts in the red weekly.

The memecoin now trades above a reclaimed structural level that previously acted as resistance. At the time of writing, the token trades at approximately $0.00000558, suggesting a 34% increase in the last 24 hours. This marks a significant shift from the consolidation pattern observed throughout November and December 2025. Volume metrics indicate increased participation across both spot and derivatives markets. PEPE’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex ) Technical Structure Confirms Bullish Reversal PEPE price action broke decisively above its accumulation base in late December. The breakthrough occurred when the asset reclaimed the $0.0000050 threshold. This price level had consistently rejected upward attempts during the fourth quarter of 2025. The recovery pattern displays characteristics of an Adam and Eve formation. A gradual, rounded transition bottomed out and then moved sharply upward. This combination suggests building confidence among buyers who absorbed the available supply during the consolidation phase. Momentum indicators support the bullish thesis. The Directional Movement Index showed a constructive shift on December 31. The positive directional indicator crossed above the negative directional indicator on that date. This technical event preceded the rally that followed. The Average Directional Index currently stands at approximately 28. This value indicates trend strength without suggesting overextension. Readings above 25 typically reflect sustained directional movement rather than exhaustion. Key Price Levels Define Near-Term Trajectory The $0.0000050 support level now serves as the primary reference point for market structure. Continued acceptance above this zone maintains the bullish framework. A breakdown below would invalidate the current setup and expose the asset to renewed downside pressure. Resistance emerges near $0.00000623. This represents the next logical target if buying pressure persists. A sustained break above that threshold would open the path toward $0.0000075. The memecoin sector has shown renewed interest in recent weeks. Trading volumes across major exchanges reflect this shift. Both retail participants and institutional traders have increased their engagement with PEPE and similar assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|PEPE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-02 15:53:57

This $0.04 New Cryptocurrency Hits 300% Growth,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-this-0-04-new-cryptocurrency-hits-300-growth/,"Cryptocurrency markets tend to have silent moves which burst into attention. Headlines do not necessarily be at the beginning of price action. The process normally begins with organization, growth, and initial positioning. As a new crypto starts to rise steadily, when most of the market is shifting laterally, it is an indication that something larger is taking shape. It can now be observed in the DeFi crypto space. A new cryptocurrency with a price of $0.04 USD has given 300% growth since its launch during its initial stage. More to the point, this growth is growing in tandem with development milestones and not a hype spurt. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Going To Build Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a developing DeFi crypto. It is aimed to develop a protocol that facilitates borrowing and lending needs rather than short term encouragement. It is based on structured lending markets. Users will be able to be asset providers and earn yield, and borrowers will be able to acquire liquidity through collateral provision. This establishes the direct connection between usage and value. Use of mtTokens is one of the major characteristics. When users post assets to the protocol, they are issued with mtTokens which act as a reflection of their ownership of the pool. Such tokens increase in value as interest is accrued. This renders the yield clear-cut and directly proportional to protocol activity. Mutuum Finance also is looking forward to V1 protocol launch . As per the official updates on X, V1 will trigger the initial live version of the protocol. This is where build mode switches to the execution. Such a time tends to alter the way the market rates a new crypto.. Participation and Growth Numbers Mutuum Finance has not emerged without entering the scene. Since early 2025, its growth has been taking a steady trajectory. The project has already raised approximately $19.5M and created a community worth more than 18,650 investors. The price of the initial token was 0.01. The current price sits near $0.04. That represents a 300% increase. This kind of expansion, which is distributed across several stages, is usually an indication of a long-term demand and not a temporary speculation. This is important to the investor since it will indicate that the interest has increased with the development. It also indicates that the market is already in a position that has already internally taken several price increases without stuttering. Why Supply Counts The total supply of Mutuum Finance is 4B. Out of this figure, 45.5% or approximately 1.82B tokens goes to early distribution phases. Approximately, 820M of tokens were already sold. This implies that a significant part of the initial supply will be under the control of which it is not sitting along the fringes. The further distribution occurs, the smaller the supply will be left. This usually alters the buyer behavior particularly when utility milestones are reached. The 24 hour leaderboard also operates in the project. The active participation is observed by this system and is rewarded by cooperative use of MUTM incentives. It promotes a repeat interaction rather than a one time purchase. Also, support of card payments has been introduced. This makes it more attractive since it involves new users without exposing them to complex crypto onramps. Greater participation is commonly achieved through ease of access. Security and Trust Layers One of the largest threats of DeFi is security. Mutuum Finance has made visible efforts to deal with this early. A CertiK token scan of the project conducted includes 90 out of 100 points. This marks a high score of contract design and indicators of low risk. To add to this, Halborn Security finished the essential smart contracts audit line by line. The bug bounty program is also an initiative of $50k. This encourages independent researchers to test the code and give feedback on the problems before the full scale adoption is made. The layers decrease the technical uncertainty and this is the most serious obstacle that may halt serious investors. Phase 7 has now been achieved at Mutuum Finance. The level caused the token price to shoot up by approximately 20%. Raising of prices at specific intervals is usually an indicator of constrained supply and an upward demand. In the recent past, a whale fund of $100K was documented. These huge one-offs are no surety of future performance, but a good indicator that one or the other of the experienced market players has confidence in a Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-ignore-xrp-at-your-peril-heres-why/,"Crypto markets often hide the most important moves behind quiet accumulation rather than flashy headlines. While retail chatter and media narratives dominate daily attention, institutional actors frequently position themselves well ahead of obvious catalysts . XRP now sits at one of these critical inflection points, signaling that large-scale players may be preparing for a major market shift. The insight came from X Finance Bull, who shared recent institutional flow data on X, highlighting XRP’s unusual stability compared to other top cryptocurrencies. According to the analysis, while Bitcoin and Ethereum saw billions in outflows over November and December 2025, XRP maintained steady net inflows, signaling deliberate accumulation rather than retail-driven speculation. Institutional Flows Highlight Strategic Positioning X Finance Bull pointed out that Bitcoin experienced $3.48 billion in outflows in November and $1.09 billion in December, while Ethereum lost $1.42 billion and $616 million in the same period. XRP, however, saw only $666 million in November and $499 million in December, all positive net inflows. These numbers suggest that institutions actively moved capital into XRP while other major assets faced liquidity drains. IGNORE $XRP AT YOUR PERIL INSTITUTIONS ARE FRONT-RUNNING THE MARKET If you still think ETFs are only about Bitcoin and Ethereum, you’re missing what’s right in front of you Bitcoin saw outflows of $3.48B in November and $1.09B in December. Ethereum lost $1.42B in… https://t.co/gC79IXRRoW pic.twitter.com/V35OxMkYFM — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 1, 2026 This pattern demonstrates more than casual interest. Institutions anticipate regulatory clarity, infrastructure upgrades, and new liquidity corridors, often positioning themselves before these changes reach the public eye. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that professional investors view it as a strategically vital asset in the emerging digital finance ecosystem. ETFs and XRP’s Overlooked Potential Many investors still associate crypto ETFs primarily with Bitcoin and Ethereum. X Finance Bull emphasizes that this narrative overlooks a critical development: institutional capital increasingly targets XRP as regulatory frameworks and market infrastructure evolve. Unlike retail-driven surges, these flows reflect structured positioning in anticipation of XRP’s adoption as a bridge asset in regulated payments and cross-border settlements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This approach underlines XRP’s growing independence from short-term market sentiment. Institutions prioritize utility, liquidity, and compliance over hype, and XRP now benefits from these long-term fundamentals. Following Capital Flows Over Headlines The data reinforces a key principle: flows often lead markets. While headlines highlight trending stories, institutional movements reveal where smart money expects value to materialize. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that investors are betting on its future as an essential infrastructure asset, rather than short-term gains. As financial institutions integrate blockchain solutions and liquidity corridors expand, XRP stands poised for broader adoption. Ignoring these signals risks missing early positioning in what may become one of the most structurally significant crypto assets in the next market cycle. By tracking institutional flows rather than narratives, market participants gain a clearer perspective on XRP’s strategic importance and its potential to outperform other major cryptocurrencies.

On the first official trading day of the year, Jeong Eun-bo, KRX’s chairman, indicated that the exchange is prepared to handle crypto ETFs, even as regulators evaluate their legitimacy under current rules. “We have built market infrastructure, and we are ready to list and trade crypto‑linked ETFs,” Jeong said. He also announced plans to increase trading hours. South Korea is still evaluating crypto regulations According to Jeong, South Korea’s new exchange initiative is designed to help counter the “ Korea discount ,” the tendency for South Korean equities to be priced beneath their global peers. In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin often trades at a premium in South Korea compared to international markets. He remarked, “Our capital market is on pace for normalization, with the benchmark KOSPI breaking the 4,000-mark point and other market indexes, such as PER (price-to-earnings ratio), showing signs of improvement. The local capital market should overcome the ‘Korea Discount’ and advance into the premium market.” In his speech, however, Jeong did not announce regulatory changes, although he emphasized the need for increased collaboration between market operators and policymakers. He added that the exchange plans to roll out an AI-based monitoring system and step up its crackdown on unfair trading through a joint response team formed last year to combat stock price manipulation. Regulators in South Korea are still gauging the legal status of crypto investment products. Currently, regulations do not permit crypto assets to be classified as qualifying underlying securities, and thus, bar crypto ETFs, despite rising interest from investors. The FSC has mentioned that it is considering reforms through a dedicated committee to determine whether digital assets could be incorporated into the Capital Markets Act framework. Although the much-awaited DABA, which was expected to implement broad norms for the cryptocurrency trading and issuance arena, has been pushed back amid unresolved questions regarding stablecoin regulation. Authorities have officially delayed the submission of the bill until 2026. At the core of the proposal is a no-fault liability, which could imply that digital asset providers need to be held responsible for their losses even without any wrongdoing to substantiate the claim. The proposal also seeks to address systemic risks in stablecoins by mandating that issuers hold reserves of more than 100% of the tokens in circulation in either banks or certified entities. However, a consensus has still not been reached on which body should be responsible for reserve rules and oversight. Nonetheless, over the last 12 months, support for crypto products, particularly ETFs, has grown throughout South Korea’s financial and political circles. Last February, the leader of the Korea Financial Investment Association (KOFIA) stated that the sector plans to explore domestic Bitcoin and Ether ETF listings, aiming to grant regulated access to the market for cryptocurrencies. The subject gained political traction ahead of the June election. In May, Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate at the time, pledged to approve spot crypto ETFs if he was elected — a race he ultimately won. The KRX appointed new executive managers Recently, the Korea Exchange (KRX) appointed new executive managers to enhance its market surveillance capabilities. The new appointments will boost leadership in the Market Surveillance Division and accelerate efforts, including extended transaction hours and increased product listings. The exchange also recently filled executive positions across its core divisions: securities, derivatives, market surveillance, and clearing and settlement. Park Sang-uk, formerly the deputy head of Derivatives Markets, has been appointed senior managing director of the Clearing and Settlement Division. Additionally, two managing directors were appointed in each of the Market Surveillance, KOSDAQ Market, and Derivatives Market divisions, totaling six.
