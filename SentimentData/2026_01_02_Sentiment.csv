Rather than presenting commentary on market conditions, Rector’s post focuses on personal and professional allegations, which he describes as a “necessary response” to a sustained misrepresentation, misconduct, and attempt to leverage his standing within the XRP community. Rector states that the decision to speak publicly was not made lightly. He positions the video as a defensive clarification intended to resolve confusion created by prior associations and to explain why he no longer maintains any professional alignment with Claver or related business entities. Addressing Jake Claver lies Part 1 pic.twitter.com/rmVMK3XtUH — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 31, 2025 Claims of Misrepresentation and Business Pressure According to Rector, the first issue centers on what he describes as false representations made to him by Jake Claver and Claver’s business partner, Max Avery. He explains that these representations were allegedly used to position him as a promotional conduit for private equity initiatives and for the firm Digital Wealth Partners. Rector maintains that his credibility within the XRP community was a key factor in these efforts, and that he was approached both to assist in capital formation and to formally join the business. Rector recounts interactions dating back to industry events in 2023 and collaborative meetings that brought together both communities. While these engagements initially appeared legitimate, he states that subsequent due diligence, supported by legal advisers with securities experience, led him to withdraw before any formal partnership was established. Concerns Over Fund Performance and Investor Discrepancies A second focus of Zach Rector’s video relates to performance claims surrounding Digital Wealth Partners funds. He highlights what he describes as inconsistencies between public statements made by Claver and private feedback received from investors. Rector suggests that these discrepancies raised serious concerns regarding transparency and accuracy, contributing further to his decision to disengage. Allegations of Community Manipulation and Legal History The third issue raised involves what Rector characterizes as manipulation of the XRP community through unsupported claims, exaggerated forecasts, and references to insider access and nondisclosure agreements. He argues that such narratives lack substantiation and serve to influence investor behavior without factual grounding. Rector further references a publicly accessible legal case involving Claver and payment platform VeryVend in the Western District of New York. He points to court filings in which Claver admitted to actions including registering a misleading domain, impersonating company communications, and fabricating wire transfer confirmations related to private equity fundraising efforts. Rector emphasizes that these admissions are part of the official record and were resolved through settlement.

He suggests that accountability and factual verification are essential within financial and crypto-adjacent communities, particularly where trust and reputation play a central role.

The move, signed into law by President Serdar Berdimuhamedov in late November and taking effect on January 1, 2026, marks a major policy shift for one of the world’s most closed and tightly controlled economies. Turkmenistan just passed a law legalizing crypto mining & exchanges from Jan 1, 2026, but under heavy licensing. #Regulation #Turkmenistan https://t.co/gmnAfFLDl0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 28, 2025 Turkmenistan Ends Crypto Ban With Central Bank in Charge Under the new “Law on Virtual Assets,” cryptocurrency mining and trading are now permitted , but only within a strictly regulated framework overseen by the country’s central bank. Digital assets are brought under civil law, and a licensing regime has been introduced for exchanges, custodial services, and mining operations. However, the legislation is explicit that cryptocurrencies will not be recognized as legal tender , currency, or securities, and cannot be used to pay for goods or services inside the country. The structure of the law reflects Turkmenistan’s broader economic and political model. All miners, whether individuals or companies, must register their equipment and operations with authorities. Exchanges are subject to mandatory know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules , anonymous wallets are prohibited, and advertising is tightly restricted. Credit institutions are barred from offering crypto services, and regulators retain the authority to halt operations or void token issuances if deemed necessary. The central bank is also empowered to authorize specific distributed ledger systems, effectively steering activity toward permissioned and closely monitored networks. The decision comes after years of a near-total ban on crypto activity. Before the law was signed, mining and trading were illegal, and authorities periodically raided unregistered operations and seized equipment. Despite that, an underground crypto community existed, operating through VPNs, peer-to-peer platforms , and covert mining setups to bypass internet restrictions and enforcement. Reliable data on the size of that community was scarce, but projections suggest that by the end of 2026, Turkmenistan could have nearly 500,000 cryptocurrency users, representing about 6.4 percent of the population, as activity moves into the legal sphere. Abundant Energy Meets Fragile Grid in Turkmenistan’s Crypto Bet Energy availability is one of the factors drawing attention to Turkmenistan’s policy change. The country has abundant natural gas reserves and produces more electricity than it consumes, with installed generation capacity exceeding 5.4 gigawatts against peak domestic demand of around 4.3 gigawatts. Low energy costs could, in theory, make the country attractive for energy-intensive crypto mining. However, analysts note that the main challenge lies in the electricity grid itself. Much of the transmission and distribution infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era and suffers from frequent outages, inefficiencies, and power quality issues. While generation capacity is sufficient, the lack of grid stability raises questions about whether large-scale, industrial mining can operate reliably without substantial private investment in dedicated infrastructure and power conditioning systems. The new crypto framework also sits against the backdrop of Turkmenistan’s fragile currency environment. The national currency, the Turkmenistani manat, remains the only legal means of payment, and the government maintains strict controls to protect it. The official exchange rate has long been fixed at around 3.5 manat to the U.S. dollar, while a much weaker rate reportedly exists on the black market, reflecting devaluation pressures and capital controls. Official inflation data is limited, but high inflation is widely suspected, contributing to informal dollarization for savings and larger transactions. By banning crypto as a payment method, authorities appear intent on preventing digital assets from competing with the manat or weakening monetary control.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin now urgently advocates for dApp ecosystem development as the critical solution to prevent future technological catastrophes. His recent statements on social media platform X highlight a growing concern within the cryptocurrency industry about eroding decentralization principles for mere convenience. The dApp Ecosystem as Societal Safeguard Vitalik Buterin’s analysis connects directly to the November Cloudflare incident. This infrastructure failure demonstrated how centralized systems create single points of failure. Consequently, Buterin argues that decentralized applications must evolve beyond financial tools. They should become foundational infrastructure for modern society. The Ethereum founder specifically emphasizes that dApps operating without external pressures offer superior resilience. Historical context supports Buterin’s position. Major internet outages have increased in frequency and impact over the past decade. For instance, Amazon Web Services experienced significant disruptions in 2021 and 2023. Similarly, Google Cloud Platform faced service interruptions affecting millions of users. These events collectively illustrate the vulnerability of centralized models. Recent Major Infrastructure Outages and Their Impacts Provider Date Duration Estimated Impact Cloudflare November 2024 ~3 hours 20% of global websites AWS US-East-1 December 2021 ~7 hours Thousands of services Google Cloud March 2023 ~4 hours Major apps and APIs Microsoft Azure June 2022 ~6 hours Enterprise services globally Technical Independence Through Decentralization Buterin identifies a troubling trend within the cryptocurrency sector. Many projects increasingly rely on traditional cloud providers. This dependence contradicts the fundamental principle of decentralization. Therefore, the Ethereum founder urges developers to regain technical independence. He suggests that convenience should not compromise core blockchain values. Several key characteristics define truly resilient dApp infrastructure: Distributed Architecture: No single entity controls the entire system Censorship Resistance: Operations continue despite external pressures Transparent Governance: Clear, community-driven decision-making processes Fault Tolerance: Continued operation despite component failures Expert Perspectives on Infrastructure Evolution Industry analysts echo Buterin’s concerns about infrastructure centralization. Dr. Sarah Chen, infrastructure researcher at Stanford University, notes that internet architecture has become increasingly concentrated. “We’ve moved from distributed academic networks to commercial oligopolies,” Chen explains. “This concentration creates systemic risks that decentralized technologies could mitigate.” Blockchain architect Marcus Rodriguez adds practical insights. “Building resilient dApps requires rethinking traditional development approaches,” Rodriguez states. “Developers must prioritize decentralization at every layer, from data storage to computation.” His team recently published a framework for evaluating dApp decentralization across seven critical dimensions. Ethereum Network Enhancements for Predictability Buterin’s proposal extends beyond philosophical arguments. He suggests concrete technical improvements for the Ethereum network. Specifically, the introduction of gas fee futures products could enhance transaction cost predictability. This development would benefit both developers and users. Moreover, it represents a practical step toward infrastructure maturity. The gas fee mechanism on Ethereum has evolved significantly since the network’s launch. Initially, simple auction dynamics determined transaction costs. However, EIP-1559 introduced a base fee mechanism in 2021. This change improved fee predictability but didn’t eliminate volatility entirely. Consequently, futures products could provide additional stability for dApp operations. Comparative analysis reveals how different blockchain networks approach fee predictability: Ethereum: Market-based fees with base fee mechanism Solana: Fixed fee structure with priority fees Avalanche: Dynamic fees based on network conditions Polygon: Layer-2 solution with reduced fee volatility Implementation Challenges and Solutions Transitioning to dApp-based infrastructure presents significant technical hurdles. Scalability remains a primary concern for decentralized systems. Additionally, user experience often lags behind centralized alternatives. However, recent technological advances offer promising solutions. Layer-2 scaling solutions, for example, dramatically improve transaction throughput. Zero-knowledge proofs represent another breakthrough technology. These cryptographic methods enable verification without revealing underlying data. Consequently, they enhance both privacy and scalability. Several projects now implement zk-proofs for various dApp functionalities. This development marks substantial progress toward practical decentralization. Interoperability standards also facilitate dApp ecosystem growth. Cross-chain communication protocols enable applications to operate across multiple networks. Therefore, they reduce dependence on any single blockchain. The Ethereum community actively develops standards like ERC-3668 for cross-chain functionality. These efforts collectively advance Buterin’s vision of resilient infrastructure. Conclusion Vitalik Buterin’s call for dApp ecosystem development addresses a critical vulnerability in modern technology infrastructure. The November Cloudflare outage demonstrated how centralized systems endanger global connectivity. Therefore, decentralized applications must evolve into resilient societal infrastructure. This transition requires technical innovation, philosophical commitment, and practical implementation. The Ethereum network’s proposed enhancements, including gas fee futures, represent important steps forward. Ultimately, a robust dApp ecosystem could prevent future infrastructure catastrophes while preserving the internet’s original decentralized vision. FAQs Q1: What exactly happened during the Cloudflare outage mentioned by Buterin? The November 2024 Cloudflare outage lasted approximately three hours and affected about 20% of global websites. This incident resulted from a configuration error in Cloudflare’s global network, demonstrating how centralized infrastructure creates single points of failure that can disrupt essential online services worldwide. Q2: How can dApps prevent infrastructure failures better than traditional systems? Decentralized applications distribute operations across multiple independent nodes rather than relying on centralized servers. This architecture eliminates single points of failure, ensures censorship resistance, and continues functioning even when individual components fail, providing superior resilience compared to traditional centralized systems. Q3: What are gas fee futures products that Buterin mentioned for Ethereum? Gas fee futures would be financial instruments allowing users to hedge against Ethereum transaction cost volatility. These products could lock in future gas prices, providing predictability for dApp developers and users while potentially stabilizing the network’s economic model through derivative markets. Q4: Why is the cryptocurrency industry becoming more centralized according to Buterin? Many blockchain projects increasingly rely on traditional cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud for node hosting and development tools. This dependence creates centralization vulnerabilities that contradict blockchain’s fundamental decentralization principles, often sacrificed for development convenience and short-term cost savings. Q5: What practical steps can developers take to build more resilient dApps? Developers should implement distributed storage solutions like IPFS, utilize multiple blockchain networks through interoperability protocols, design fault-tolerant architectures, participate in decentralized governance, and prioritize transparency in all system operations to create genuinely resilient decentralized applications.

The company stated that the issue was limited to this specific version and did not affect its mobile applications or other platforms. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT estimated that user losses totaled approximately $7 million. The incident gained attention after several users reported missing funds shortly after interacting with the affected extension version. Investigation Ongoing as Thousands of Wallets Identified On December 28, Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen said the company was still investigating the incident and working to verify affected users. According to Chen, the team has identified 2,596 wallet addresses connected to the issue so far, while roughly 5,000 refund requests have been submitted. Chen noted that a significant number of submitted claims were either duplicates or potentially fraudulent. To address this, Trust Wallet is cross-referencing multiple data sources to confirm legitimate cases before issuing compensation. Preliminary findings suggest the incident may have involved malicious interactions or unauthorized access linked specifically to the browser extension environment, rather than a direct breach of Trust Wallet’s core systems. Browser-based wallets are generally more exposed to phishing attempts, malicious scripts, and compromised extensions, which can lead to private key or signing vulnerabilities if users unknowingly approve harmful transactions. Trust Wallet emphasized that the exploit did not stem from its mobile applications and reiterated that the issue was isolated. The company said resolving verified claims and publishing a full technical breakdown of what occurred remain top priorities as the investigation continues.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-01 20:11:52

Meanwhile, posts on X linked the drop to dilution, index risk, and a shrinking NAV premium, despite Strategy still holding about $59 billion in Bitcoin versus a roughly $46 billion market cap. Benchmark Reiterates Buy on Strategy, Keeps $705 Target for 2026 Investment bank The Benchmark Company has reiterated its buy rating on Strategy, maintaining a $705 price target tied to 2026 expectations, according to reports circulating on Wednesday. The note continues to frame Strategy primarily as a bitcoin-focused treasury company, rather than a traditional software valuation story. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said the price target reflects Strategy’s large and growing Bitcoin holdings and the firm’s capital structure, which amplifies exposure to long-term bitcoin price movements. As a result, the research treats Strategy shares as a proxy for bitcoin performance, with added leverage from equity and debt instruments used to fund acquisitions. While several crypto news platforms reported the reiteration on Wednesday, the analysis itself does not appear to be newly issued. Instead, the coverage references a Benchmark research note first published in early December and resurfaced at the start of the new year. No changes to the rating or price target were disclosed, and Benchmark did not announce a revised forecast. Strategy, remains one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. Consequently, its stock has continued to attract investor attention during periods of heightened focus on corporate bitcoin treasury strategies. Strategy Shares Slide as Market Cap Falls Below Bitcoin Holdings Shares of Strategy have dropped sharply over the past six months, underscoring how quickly market narratives can reverse for bitcoin-focused equities. According to price data shown on a widely shared chart, Strategy stock fell from about $457 to roughly $152, a decline of nearly 66%, erasing an estimated $90 billion in market value over the period. In a post on X, a market commentator said the sell-off went beyond bitcoin’s broader pullback. Instead, the post pointed to equity dilution, index-related risks, and a collapse in Strategy’s net asset value premium as the main drivers of the decline. As the premium compressed, investors appeared to reassess how much they were willing to pay above the company’s underlying bitcoin holdings. Despite the steep drop in its share price, Strategy’s balance sheet remains largely unchanged. The company still holds about $59 billion worth of bitcoin, based on prevailing market prices cited in the post. By contrast, Strategy’s equity market capitalization stands near $46 billion, implying that the stock now trades below the value of its bitcoin reserves. The gap between asset value and market capitalization highlights the role of investor sentiment in pricing bitcoin-heavy companies. While Strategy’s holdings stayed intact, shifting expectations around leverage, dilution, and index exposure appear to have reshaped how the market values the stock, leaving the same balance sheet viewed through a very different psychological lens.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-01 20:14:20

This resulted in slowing the rollout of a key claims verification tool tied to the incident. Trust Wallet chief executive Eowyn Chen said the extension became unavailable after the company encountered a Chrome Web Store bug while attempting to release a new version. Some may have noticed that the @trustwallet Browser Extension is temporarily unavailable on the Chrome Web Store. We hit a Chrome Web Store bug while releasing a new version that includes a feature to help reimbursement claimants submit verification codes from their extension… — Eowync.eth (@EowynChen) December 31, 2025 The delayed update was meant to introduce a verification feature designed to help victims of the Christmas Day hack confirm wallet ownership and submit reimbursement claims securely. Chen said Google has acknowledged the issue and is escalating it internally, while warning users to stay alert for fake or impersonated versions of the extension circulating online. Attackers Exploited Fake Trust Wallet Update to Steal Funds The outage comes as Trust Wallet continues to manage the fallout from a security breach that began unfolding in late December. On December 25, the company confirmed that a malicious version of its Chrome browser extension , version 2.68, had been distributed through the Chrome Web Store outside its normal release process. The compromised extension allowed attackers to access sensitive wallet data and execute unauthorized transactions, leading to millions of dollars in losses. Multiple Trust Wallet users experienced unauthorized fund outflows on Thursday due to a new browser extension theft. Losses are estimated to surpass $6 million. #TrustWallet #CryptoTheft #TrustWalletTheft https://t.co/mchzwWAHK3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 26, 2025 Trust Wallet’s internal investigation shows that only users who installed version 2.68 and logged into their wallets between December 24 and December 26 were affected. Mobile app users, users on other extension versions, and those who installed or logged in after December 26 were not impacted. The company said it identified 2,520 wallet addresses that were drained during the incident, with roughly $8.5 million in assets linked to 17 attacker-controlled wallets. The wallet, though, noted that some of those attacker addresses also targeted wallets unrelated to Trust Wallet. Security researchers later confirmed that the malicious build appeared legitimate and passed Chrome’s review process but contained hidden code capable of extracting recovery phrases. Several users said simply importing a seed phrase into the extension triggered immediate fund outflows across multiple blockchains. Trust Wallet Cleans Up Extension Hack; Flags Rise in Fake Compensation Scams Trust Wallet traced the breach back to a wider supply chain attack known as Sha1-Hulud, which surfaced in November and affected multiple companies through compromised developer tooling. The company said exposed GitHub secrets and a leaked Chrome Web Store API key allowed the attacker to upload the malicious extension directly, bypassing internal approval checks. In response, Trust Wallet rolled back to a clean release, published version 2.69, and disabled compromised publishing credentials. It also declared a voluntary reimbursement scheme, which they promised to all those people who were found to be victims. On December 29, it opened a formal claims process , where users are asked to provide wallet addresses, transaction hashes, and identifying information via an official support portal. In its response to over 5,000 claims, the company indicated that it has been inundated with claims, given that the number of verified affected wallets is much lower, and it is a cause of concern that there could be duplicate or fake claims. It is the cause of that discrepancy that led to the creation of another verification mechanism that was supposed to be provided with the next update of the browser extension, but was delayed by the Chrome Web Store problem.

The analyst projected three potential scenarios for Bitcoin in 2026. The first scenario, which carries the highest probability, suggests that if rate-cut expectations persist throughout 2026, “Bitcoin is likely to trade within a broad $80,000-$140,000 range , with $90,000-$120,000 as the core zone.” The second scenario, with medium probability, indicates that if recession risks intensify, the resulting deleveraging and ETF outflows could push Bitcoin below $80,000, with movement toward the $50,000 range conceivable. The third scenario, carrying low probability according to XWIN Research, proposes that if Fed easing expectations materialize early and ETF inflows stabilize, Bitcoin could extend toward $120,000-$170,000, with higher levels possible only under multiple favorable conditions. Currently, a range-bound structure remains the most plausible baseline for 2026, subject to reassessment as structural data evolves. This aligns with current sentiment from traders on Kalshi prediction market who project Bitcoin hitting a high of $121,000 this year, suggesting a range between the current $80,000 levels and $120,000 is highly plausible in 2026. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Healthy Mid-Cycle Correction The weekly Bitcoin chart shows a mature bull market that has entered a healthy corrective phase rather than a structural breakdown. After bottoming in 2023 following a deep 77% bear-market drawdown, Bitcoin rallied strongly through 2024 and into 2025, eventually topping near the $120,000-$125,000 region. The subsequent pullback of roughly 37% mirrors past mid-cycle corrections and has thus far respected higher-timeframe support. The most crucial level on the downside is the $67,000-$70,000 zone, which previously functioned as a major consolidation base and breakout region. Source: TradingView Provided this support maintains on a weekly closing basis, the long-term bullish structure remains intact. On the upside, the $105,000 region represents the key resistance Bitcoin must reclaim to signal bull trend resumption. A decisive weekly close above $105,000 would likely open the way for broader recovery toward $121,000 and potentially new highs later in 2026. Until that reclaim occurs, Bitcoin may continue consolidating between the $70,000 support and $105,000 resistance, with the higher-timeframe bias remaining bullish provided the macro support zone isn’t lost.

Recent analysis of Bitcoin options market data reveals sophisticated institutional players are implementing income-generating strategies that may inadvertently suppress Bitcoin’s price potential while simultaneously reducing market volatility. This development represents a significant maturation phase for cryptocurrency markets as traditional finance methodologies increasingly intersect with digital asset trading. Bitcoin Covered Calls: The Institutional Income Strategy Covered call strategies represent a sophisticated options trading approach that institutional investors have adapted for cryptocurrency markets. Essentially, this strategy involves holding spot Bitcoin while simultaneously selling call options against that position. The call options give buyers the right to purchase Bitcoin at a predetermined price within a specific timeframe. Meanwhile, the seller collects premium income from these option sales. Several factors have driven institutional adoption of Bitcoin covered calls: Declining cash-and-carry yields falling below 5% annually Attractive income potential offering 12-18% annual returns Risk management benefits in volatile cryptocurrency markets Portfolio diversification for traditional investment firms This institutional activity has created a measurable impact on Bitcoin’s market structure. According to cryptocurrency derivatives data from major exchanges including Deribit and CME Group, the consistent selling of call options has contributed to declining implied volatility throughout 2025 contracts. Volatility Compression in Bitcoin Markets Bitcoin’s implied volatility metrics provide compelling evidence of how covered call strategies are reshaping market dynamics. Implied volatility represents the market’s forecast of likely price movement and serves as a crucial indicator for options pricing and risk assessment. Throughout 2025 contracts, Bitcoin’s implied volatility has experienced a notable decline from approximately 70% to around 45%. This volatility compression reflects several interconnected market developments: Time Period Implied Volatility Level Market Interpretation Early 2025 Contracts ~70% High uncertainty, speculative positioning Mid-2025 Contracts ~55% Increasing institutional participation Current 2025 Contracts ~45% Mature options market, covered call prevalence The declining volatility trend indicates that consistent selling pressure from covered call strategies has reduced overall market uncertainty. However, market analysts note this compression creates a complex trading environment where price breakouts face systematic resistance from option-related selling activity. Countervailing Market Forces and Price Discovery Despite the suppressing effect of covered call strategies, Bitcoin markets demonstrate robust countervailing forces that maintain trading equilibrium. Significant buying demand for call options continues to offset institutional selling pressure, creating a dynamic marketplace where multiple strategies interact. Furthermore, demand for put options—which provide downside protection—remains consistently strong, indicating sophisticated risk management across institutional portfolios. This options market activity reflects broader cryptocurrency market maturation. Institutional capital now pursues volatility-based profits through sophisticated derivatives strategies rather than simple directional bets. The resulting market structure features reduced extreme volatility while potentially limiting explosive upside moves that characterized earlier Bitcoin market cycles. Historical Context and Market Evolution Bitcoin’s options market has evolved dramatically since the launch of regulated derivatives products in recent years. Initially dominated by retail speculation and directional betting, institutional participation has transformed market dynamics through 2024 and into 2025. This evolution parallels developments in traditional financial markets where options strategies became increasingly sophisticated over decades. Several key developments have facilitated this institutional adoption: Regulatory clarity in major financial jurisdictions Infrastructure development including custody solutions Risk management tools tailored for cryptocurrency Educational resources for institutional investors Market analysts compare current Bitcoin options activity to early stages of equity options markets, where covered call strategies similarly gained prominence among income-focused investors. This historical parallel suggests Bitcoin markets may experience continued options strategy diversification as institutional participation deepens. Impact on Bitcoin Price Discovery Mechanisms The proliferation of covered call strategies influences Bitcoin’s price discovery process through several interconnected channels. First, consistent call option selling creates technical resistance levels at strike prices where significant option volume concentrates. Second, the income generated from premium collection reduces pressure for immediate price appreciation among institutional holders. Third, volatility suppression affects algorithmic trading systems that respond to volatility signals. These dynamics create a more predictable but potentially constrained trading environment. Bitcoin’s price movements may exhibit reduced frequency of extreme volatility events while facing systematic resistance at key technical levels corresponding to options activity. Market participants must now account for options-related flows alongside traditional supply-demand factors when analyzing Bitcoin price action. Institutional Portfolio Implications For institutional investors, covered call strategies offer compelling risk-adjusted returns in cryptocurrency allocations. By generating consistent income through option premiums, institutions can improve portfolio yield while maintaining Bitcoin exposure. This approach particularly appeals to pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies with specific return requirements and risk parameters. However, these strategies involve trade-offs that institutions carefully evaluate. The opportunity cost of capped upside potential must balance against premium income and volatility reduction. Sophisticated institutions typically implement dynamic covered call approaches that adjust strike prices and expiration dates based on market conditions and outlook. Market Structure Analysis and Future Projections Current Bitcoin options market structure reveals a maturing ecosystem where multiple participant types interact through sophisticated strategies. Retail traders, proprietary trading firms, hedge funds, and traditional asset managers now employ diverse approaches ranging from simple directional bets to complex volatility arbitrage. This diversity contributes to market efficiency while creating unique dynamics like the covered call effect on price ceilings. Looking forward, market analysts project several potential developments: Strategy diversification beyond basic covered calls Cross-asset correlations with traditional markets Regulatory developments affecting derivatives trading Technological innovations in options execution These developments will likely further integrate Bitcoin into global financial markets while potentially altering the relationship between options activity and spot price dynamics. Market participants must continuously monitor options market metrics alongside traditional analysis to understand evolving Bitcoin price drivers. Conclusion Bitcoin covered call strategies represent a significant development in cryptocurrency market evolution, potentially creating subtle ceilings on price appreciation while reducing overall volatility. This institutional activity reflects broader market maturation as sophisticated derivatives strategies become increasingly prevalent. While potentially limiting explosive upside moves, these developments contribute to market stability and institutional participation. Bitcoin’s options market dynamics will continue evolving throughout 2025, requiring market participants to adapt their analysis frameworks to account for derivatives-related flows alongside traditional factors. The interplay between covered call strategies and Bitcoin price discovery mechanisms represents a crucial area for ongoing market observation and analysis. FAQs Q1: What exactly are Bitcoin covered call strategies? Bitcoin covered call strategies involve holding spot Bitcoin while selling call options against that position. This approach generates premium income for the seller while potentially limiting upside if Bitcoin’s price rises above the option strike price. Q2: How do covered calls potentially limit Bitcoin’s price upside? When institutional investors consistently sell call options at specific price levels, they create selling pressure if Bitcoin approaches those levels. This activity can establish technical resistance that suppresses price breakouts, effectively creating a ceiling on upward momentum. Q3: Why are institutional investors using covered call strategies for Bitcoin? Institutions pursue covered call strategies primarily for income generation (12-18% annual returns), volatility reduction, and risk management. These approaches offer attractive risk-adjusted returns compared to declining yields from other cryptocurrency strategies. Q4: What does declining implied volatility indicate about Bitcoin markets? Declining implied volatility from 70% to around 45% for 2025 contracts suggests reduced market uncertainty and increased institutional participation. This volatility compression reflects more sophisticated trading strategies and potentially more stable price action. Q5: How does options market activity signal Bitcoin market maturation? Sophisticated options strategies like covered calls, robust put option demand for hedging, and institutional participation all indicate maturing markets. These developments mirror evolution in traditional financial markets and suggest Bitcoin is becoming more integrated into global finance.

56703111,650677,1767299420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56703111.jpeg,XRP Army Rift: Zach Rector Accuses Jake Claver Of Misleading The Community,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-army-rift-zach-rector-jake-claver/,"A loud internal fight is spilling out across the XRP Army, with Zach Rector accusing Jake Claver of using high-certainty price narratives, most notably the “$100 XRP by end of 2025” call, to pull attention, credibility, and capital from the community. Rector released a two-part video series on Dec 31, aimed at “addressing Jake Claver’s lies.” Claver, the CEO of Digital Ascension Group, ist one of the louder XRP bulls . While the $100 XRP call by Jan. 1, 2026 clearly failed, Rector argues that the miss wasn’t just a bad call, it was the certainty and urgency behind it, sold into a community that has spent years marinating in catalyst talk, NDA hints, and timeline debates. The $100 XRP Call Rector said he has challenged the $100 XRP claim throughout 2025 and was surprised Claver continued doubling down into the final days of the year. In Rector’s telling, the problem is not prediction-making, he said he has missed targets too, but the way extreme outcomes were marketed as near-certain, with the implication of privileged information. He played a clip from Claver’s live show after Rector criticized the $100 call. When confronted, Claver did not concede, instead implying he may “know something.” “If I was going to pivot, should have pivoted by now,” Claver said in the clip Rector quoted. “Unless I know something. Why wouldn’t I? … We’ll see what ends up happening by the end of the year. We’ll see where the price is. And I think the results will speak for themselves.” Rector argued that this kind of messaging: NDA-coded, “trust me” signaling becomes a lever inside XRP culture, where many holders have learned to treat timelines and insider claims as tradable narratives. Rector calls this behaviour “manipulation,” saying Claver’s “business model is so reliant upon that manipulation” that he “can’t back out now.” Addressing Jake Claver lies Part 1 pic.twitter.com/rmVMK3XtUH — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 31, 2025 Serious Allegations Rector’s sharper allegations go beyond price talk and into what he described as XRP-focused funds offered through Digital Wealth Partners (DWP). He claimed the community has sent “so much XRP” into Claver’s orbit and that there is “a massive discrepancy from what he’s saying publicly and what investors are telling me privately.” “Jake and his scheme, his business has grown so big they’ve taken in so much XRP from our community,” Rector said. “There’s a massive discrepancy from what he’s saying publicly and what investors are telling me privately.” Rector said he has received fund reports and performance updates and claimed he is not sharing them publicly out of concern about retaliation, alleging investors have been warned not to share reporting and that reports are being watermarked with timestamps. He also made a specific performance claim: “one of the funds… has been losing money all year,” he said, adding it “lost over 4% on the year,” before fees, including “AUM fees of 2% in some cases.” Addressing Jake Claver lies Part 2 pic.twitter.com/rYkmJ1jsfr — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 31, 2025 Rector’s broader point was that XRP holders are being asked to accept a “ trust me bro relationship ” around returns, even as he says he has not heard from any investor who can confirm “payments and distributions coming out” in a way that matches the marketing. To explain why he views the trust gap as serious for XRP holders, Rector leaned on a prior legal dispute involving Claver and Digital Ascension. Rector said the case is public record and described it as “VeriVend versus Jacob Levi Claver and Digital Ascension Group” in the Western District of New York. He read from what he described as court filings and emphasized that the allegations and admissions, as he presented them, involve fabricated wire confirmations and impersonation. “This is a serious deal,” Rector said, arguing the behavior he described should matter to XRP holders being asked to trust performance claims, NDAs, and time-sensitive narratives. He urged viewers to review the “answer to the complaint,” which he said includes admissions such as registering a VeriVend-related domain and fabricating purported wire transfer confirmations. Rector also said the case settled, pointing to a “mediation certification” dated Feb. 12, 2025. He claimed, separately, that Claver paid the opposition in XRP to settle, an assertion Rector stated as a confirmation. Rector framed his goal as containment rather than escalation, saying he wants the community “to stay together” and “not be divided,” but he also laid down an explicit remedy: third-party verification. “I want a third-party audit of those funds,” he said, arguing that absent audited financials he will not trust performance reporting tied to XRP strategies.

This dramatic European banking job cuts scenario, driven by aggressive artificial intelligence adoption, signals the most profound workforce transformation in the sector’s modern history. According to a pivotal Morgan Stanley report detailed by the Financial Times, 35 major lenders could shed roughly 10% of their combined personnel. The relentless push for operational efficiency, now supercharged by AI, is compelling institutions to shutter physical branches and automate core functions at an unprecedented scale. The Scale and Scope of European Banking Job Cuts Morgan Stanley’s analysis provides a sobering quantification of the coming change. The projected loss of 200,000 positions represents a critical inflection point for an industry long defined by human intermediation. This workforce reduction is not a vague future possibility but a concrete strategic plan now taking shape in boardrooms across the continent. The report specifically highlights that back-office operations, risk management frameworks, and regulatory compliance departments will face the deepest cuts. These areas, often described as the unglamorous “guts” of banking, involve vast amounts of data processing and pattern recognition—tasks where advanced algorithms demonstrably outperform humans in both speed and accuracy. Consequently, banks are targeting staggering efficiency gains of up to 30%, a figure that makes the substantial upfront investment in AI technology a compelling business case. The Global Context and Early Movers This transformative wave extends far beyond European borders, establishing a clear global trend. In October, Goldman Sachs warned its U.S. employees of impending job cuts and a hiring freeze extending through 2025. This directive is part of the firm’s comprehensive “OneGS 3.0” initiative, which aims to embed AI across its entire operation, from client onboarding to complex regulatory reporting. Several European institutions are already translating strategy into action, providing a preview of the broader industry trajectory. ABN Amro: The Dutch lender has publicly announced plans to reduce its workforce by a fifth before 2028. Société Générale: The French bank’s CEO has issued a stark warning, declaring that “nothing is sacred” in the pursuit of technological efficiency and modernization. These early moves confirm that the analysis is not merely theoretical. They represent a tangible, ongoing restructuring of how banks organize labor and technology. A Cautionary Voice on Talent and Fundamentals Despite the overwhelming momentum toward automation, influential voices within finance urge a measured approach. A JPMorgan Chase executive quoted in the Financial Times report raised a significant long-term concern. The executive warned that an over-reliance on AI for analytical and decision-making tasks could prevent junior bankers from learning fundamental financial principles and critical thinking skills. This knowledge gap might create a future talent deficit, potentially haunting the industry during complex, non-standardized crises where human judgment remains paramount. This perspective introduces a crucial counterpoint to the pure efficiency narrative, emphasizing the need for a balanced transition that preserves institutional knowledge and expertise. Historical Precedents and Economic Impact The banking sector has undergone several waves of technological disruption, yet the scale and speed of this AI-driven shift are unprecedented. Previous automations, like the introduction of ATMs and online banking, changed customer interactions but often created new, different roles within banks. The current AI revolution, however, primarily targets high-skill, white-collar positions previously considered secure. The economic ripple effects of cutting 200,000 jobs across Europe will be substantial. These are typically well-paying roles concentrated in major financial hubs like London, Frankfurt, and Paris. Regional economies reliant on banking employment could face significant challenges, while national governments may need to reconsider policies on workforce retraining and social safety nets. The transition demands a coordinated response from industry leaders, policymakers, and educational institutions to manage the societal impact. Projected AI-Driven Banking Workforce Impact (2026-2030) Region Projected Job Reduction Primary Areas Affected Reported Efficiency Target Europe 200,000+ Back-office, Risk, Compliance ~30% United States Significant (e.g., Goldman Sachs freeze) Client Services, Reporting Not Disclosed Global Trend Accelerating Middle-office Functions 20-40% Industry-wide The Path Forward: Reskilling and Strategic Adaptation The narrative is not solely about job elimination. Forward-thinking banks are simultaneously investing in large-scale reskilling programs. The goal is to transition existing employees into new roles that leverage human skills like complex problem-solving, client relationship management, and ethical oversight of AI systems. Positions in AI governance, data strategy, and cybersecurity are likely to see growth. The ultimate success of this technological transformation will hinge on the financial industry’s ability to manage human capital with the same sophistication it applies to financial capital. Banks that navigate this shift effectively will likely achieve a powerful competitive advantage through lower costs and enhanced service capabilities. Conversely, those that fail to support their workforce through the transition may face operational instability and reputational damage. Conclusion The Morgan Stanley analysis crystallizes a definitive trend: the European banking sector stands on the brink of a decade defined by profound workforce transformation. The planned European banking job cuts of 200,000 positions by 2030 underscore AI’s role as the primary driver of efficiency and restructuring. While the promise of 30% efficiency gains is a powerful motivator for executives, the human and operational challenges are immense. The contrasting views between aggressive automation advocates and cautionary voices on talent development highlight the complex balancing act ahead. As algorithms take on more analytical work, the industry must deliberately cultivate the irreplaceable human skills of judgment, empathy, and innovation. The banks that thrive will be those that view AI not just as a tool for cost reduction, but as a catalyst for reinventing the value of human expertise in the financial world. FAQs Q1: Which banking jobs are most at risk from AI automation? A1: Jobs involving repetitive data processing, pattern recognition, and standardized reporting are most vulnerable. This includes many roles in back-office operations, risk analysis, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and basic financial reporting. Positions requiring high-level strategic advice, complex negotiation, or personal client trust are less immediately susceptible. Q2: Is this trend of job cuts unique to European banks? A2: No, this is a global phenomenon. The report focuses on Europe, but major U.S. institutions like Goldman Sachs have announced similar AI-driven restructuring and hiring freezes. Banks worldwide are pursuing automation to remain competitive, suggesting a sector-wide redefinition of the workforce. Q3: What is the expected timeline for these 200,000 job cuts? A3: The Morgan Stanley analysis projects these reductions will occur between now and 2030. Some banks, like ABN Amro, have already announced specific multi-year plans, indicating the process is already underway and will accelerate through the latter half of the decade. Q4: Will AI create new jobs in banking to replace those it eliminates? A4: Yes, but likely not in equal number or with the same skill profile. New roles will emerge in areas like AI model validation, data ethics, cybersecurity for AI systems, and hybrid positions that manage AI tools. The net effect, however, is projected to be a significant overall reduction in traditional banking roles. Q5: How should banking professionals prepare for this AI-driven change? A5: Professionals should focus on developing skills that complement AI, such as advanced problem-solving, client relationship management, understanding regulatory frameworks for technology, and learning to work alongside AI tools as a supervisor or interpreter. Proactively seeking training in data literacy and digital fluency is also highly advisable.

On-chain data, later reinforced by his public remarks, shows a deliberate concentration of capital into specific DeFi protocols he believes are positioned to outperform as liquidity conditions evolve. Ethereum Was Sold, Not Abandoned Blockchain data shows that over a two-week period, Hayes reduced his Ethereum exposure by selling a total of 1,871 ETH, valued at roughly $5.53 million at the time of execution. This was not an isolated transaction, as the ETH sales were followed closely by a series of DeFi purchases, indicating that Ethereum was used as a funding source rather than an asset he was exiting on conviction grounds. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Reach $1 In 2026? Analysts Reveal What To Expect This pattern aligns with Hayes’ broader view of Ethereum’s role in the market. ETH increasingly serves as foundational infrastructure and productive collateral, while much of the incremental return potential has migrated to protocols that sit closer to yield generation and cash-flow activity. Hayes had already signaled this thinking earlier, having trimmed ETH exposure in August, making the recent sales part of a continuing reallocation rather than a sudden reversal. Hayes later reinforced the rationale publicly, stating that his portfolio was rotating out of ETH and into “high-quality DeFi names,” based on the expectation that these assets could outperform in an environment of improving fiat liquidity. The speed and coordination of the trades suggest a clear macro-driven move rather than tactical speculation. The Thesis Behind Pendle, Lido DAO, Ethena, And Ether.fi Purchases Following the ETH sales, Hayes redeployed capital across four DeFi protocols, each targeting a different segment of the Ethereum financial stack. Initial purchases included 961,113 PENDLE worth about $1.75 million, reflecting exposure to yield tokenization and on-chain fixed-income markets. He also acquired 2.3 million LDO valued at roughly $1.29 million, positioning into liquid staking infrastructure that continues to play a central role in Ethereum’s staking economy. Related Reading: What Happens If The Bitcoin Price Closes 2025 In The Red? Analyst Answers Additional allocations went to Ethena and Ether.fi, with Hayes buying 6.05 million ENA for approximately $1.24 million and 491,401 ETHFI worth about $343,000. Minutes later, on-chain trackers reported follow-up purchases, showing Hayes doubling down on two positions. He added an additional 4.86 million ENA valued near $986,000 and 697,851 ETHFI worth roughly $485,000, pushing total DeFi deployment well beyond the original allocation. The structure of these buys matters. Pendle targets yield markets, Lido anchors staking liquidity, Ethena focuses on synthetic dollar mechanics, and Ether.fi captures emerging restaking yield. Together, they form a solid exposure to yield, capital efficiency, and infrastructure-level adoption rather than narrative-driven trades. Hayes’ actions underscore a consistent message: Ethereum remains the base layer, but he sees the strongest risk-adjusted opportunities in the DeFi protocols that actively convert ETH into productive, revenue-linked assets.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-momentum-shift-analyst-says-stop-crying-pay-attention-heres-why/,"An XRP-focused analyst, Steph Is Crypto, in a recent post, discussed XRP’s evolving price structure, urging market participants to “Stop crying and pay attention!” Rather than emphasizing sentiment or long-term narratives, the analyst centers the discussion on observable chart data, highlighting signs that momentum conditions may be changing after an extended period of downside pressure. The analysis is based on the XRP/U.S. dollar daily chart, where price action has remained under a descending trendline for several months. This trendline reflects a consistent pattern of lower highs, reinforcing the broader corrective structure that has defined XRP’s recent performance. However, the analyst suggests that while price remains constrained, internal momentum indicators are beginning to diverge from the downward trajectory. $XRP momentum shift. Stop crying and pay attention! pic.twitter.com/XPxrr9dU8y — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 31, 2025 Price Action and Structural Context On the daily timeframe, XRP continues to trade below key resistance levels, with price compressing near the lower boundary of its recent range. The descending trendline drawn across prior swing highs remains intact, indicating that the general trend has not yet reversed. Despite this, the compression of price action near this trendline is presented as a noteworthy development, particularly when evaluated alongside momentum metrics. Steph Is Crypto emphasizes that price structure alone does not provide the full picture. Instead, the analysis encourages traders to compare price behavior with indicator movement, suggesting that the relationship between the two is becoming increasingly misaligned. MACD and RSI Indicate Momentum Divergence The attached charts highlight the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator forming higher lows, even as price action continues to trend downward. This divergence is commonly interpreted by technical analysts as a sign that selling pressure may be weakening. The MACD histogram appears to be stabilizing, while the signal and MACD lines show early signs of convergence from deeply negative territory. In parallel, the Relative Strength Index on the daily chart displays a similar pattern. While RSI remains below the neutral 50 level, it has been gradually trending upward from previous lows. This upward slope suggests improving momentum conditions, even though XRP has yet to register a decisive price breakout.

One response highlighted the belief that many holders underestimate the long-term value proposition of XRP , suggesting that short-term price targets may fail to reflect broader expectations. This comment supports the divide between traders focused on near-term price action and those maintaining long-term conviction regardless of interim volatility. Overall, Steph Is Crypto’s analysis does not claim that a reversal is already confirmed. Instead, it presents technical evidence that momentum conditions are shifting beneath the surface.

56704616,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257894,1767302711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Federal Reserve Poised for Crucial Rate Hold in January as Liquidity Pressures Mount,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-january-rate-hold-liquidity/,"BitcoinWorld Federal Reserve Poised for Crucial Rate Hold in January as Liquidity Pressures Mount WASHINGTON, D.C., January 2025 – Financial markets now overwhelmingly anticipate the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rate stance during the upcoming January policy meeting. This expectation follows revealing minutes from December’s Federal Open Market Committee gathering that highlighted growing concerns about systemic liquidity. Consequently, analysts predict the central bank will prioritize liquidity management tools over immediate rate adjustments. Federal Reserve Interest Rates Decision: January’s Critical Juncture The Federal Open Market Committee convenes on January 27-28 for its first policy meeting of 2025. Market participants currently assign an 85.1% probability to a rate hold scenario, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. This tool analyzes futures market data to gauge expectations. The minutes from December’s meeting revealed committee members actively discussed preemptive measures to address liquidity concerns. These discussions focused particularly on potential Treasury bill purchases and repo facility expansions. Historical context illuminates the current situation. The Federal Reserve began its current tightening cycle in March 2022 to combat inflation. Subsequently, it raised the federal funds rate eleven times over twenty months. However, the central bank paused rate hikes in September 2024 as inflation showed signs of moderation. Now, the committee faces different challenges centered on financial system stability rather than purely inflationary pressures. Liquidity Management Takes Priority Over Rate Cuts The December FOMC minutes contained a significant revelation. Committee members noted that current liquidity pressures are building faster than during the 2017-2019 quantitative tightening period. Quantitative tightening refers to the Fed’s process of reducing its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature without reinvestment. This process naturally drains liquidity from the financial system. To counteract these pressures, the Fed is considering purchasing approximately $220 billion in short-term Treasury bills. Additionally, it might expand its repurchase agreement (repo) facility. This facility allows primary dealers to borrow cash from the Fed overnight using Treasury securities as collateral. An expansion would provide more reliable short-term funding to markets. Key measures under consideration include: Short-term Treasury bill purchases totaling $220 billion Expansion of the overnight repurchase agreement facility Potential adjustments to the discount window operations Enhanced communication about liquidity provisions Expert Analysis on Monetary Policy Direction Former Federal Reserve economists and market strategists provide crucial context. Dr. Eleanor Vance, who served on the Fed’s research staff from 2015-2022, explains the current approach. “The Fed appears to be separating its inflation fight from its financial stability mandate,” she notes. “By using balance sheet tools for liquidity while holding rates steady for inflation, they’re employing a dual-track strategy.” Market data supports this analytical perspective. The spread between overnight index swaps and Treasury bills has widened significantly in recent weeks. This widening indicates increased funding stress in short-term markets. Furthermore, bank reserve levels at the Fed have declined to approximately $2.8 trillion from their 2022 peak of $4.3 trillion. This decline creates operational challenges for financial institutions. Federal Reserve Policy Tools Comparison Tool Primary Purpose Current Status Federal Funds Rate Control inflation and economic growth Likely on hold at 5.25-5.50% Treasury Purchases Provide system liquidity Under consideration for $220B Repo Facility Ensure overnight funding stability Potential expansion discussed Balance Sheet Runoff Normalize Fed’s securities holdings Continuing at $95B monthly pace Market Implications and Economic Consequences Financial markets have responded cautiously to these developments. Treasury yields have shown increased volatility, particularly at the short end of the curve. The two-year Treasury note yield has fluctuated between 4.2% and 4.6% over the past month. Meanwhile, equity markets have priced in the high probability of a January pause. However, they remain sensitive to any signals about future policy direction. The banking sector faces particular scrutiny. Regional banks especially depend on stable funding markets. Their net interest margins have compressed significantly during the tightening cycle. Now, potential liquidity support from the Fed could alleviate some pressure. Nevertheless, credit conditions continue to tighten according to the Fed’s own Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. Global central banks watch these developments closely. The European Central Bank and Bank of England face similar balancing acts. They must manage inflation while ensuring financial stability. International coordination on liquidity provisions has increased since the 2023 banking stress episodes. Central bankers frequently communicate through the Bank for International Settlements framework. The Historical Precedent: 2019 Repo Market Stress Current discussions echo events from late 2019. At that time, repo rates spiked unexpectedly due to technical factors and reserve scarcity. The Fed responded with temporary and then permanent repo operations. It also began purchasing Treasury bills to increase reserves. These actions successfully stabilized markets but signaled underlying fragility. Today’s situation differs in important ways. The Fed’s balance sheet remains much larger than in 2019. Additionally, regulatory changes have altered bank behavior. The Supplementary Leverage Ratio and liquidity coverage requirements influence how institutions manage their balance sheets. These factors complicate the Fed’s liquidity management calculations. Conclusion The Federal Reserve likely will hold interest rates steady at its January 2025 meeting. This decision reflects a strategic prioritization of liquidity management over immediate rate adjustments. The central bank’s consideration of Treasury bill purchases and repo facility expansion demonstrates proactive concern about financial system stability. Market participants should monitor the January FOMC statement closely for details on these liquidity measures. The Federal Reserve continues navigating complex trade-offs between inflation control and financial stability in an evolving economic landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the probability of a Fed rate hold in January? The CME FedWatch Tool indicates an 85.1% probability that the Federal Reserve will maintain current interest rates at its January 27-28, 2025 meeting. Q2: Why is the Fed considering Treasury bill purchases? The December FOMC minutes revealed concerns about liquidity pressures building faster than during the 2017-2019 period. Purchasing approximately $220 billion in short-term Treasurys would help maintain adequate system liquidity. Q3: How does this situation compare to 2019 repo market stress? While similar in some aspects, today’s context differs significantly. The Fed’s balance sheet remains larger, regulatory requirements have changed, and the economic backdrop involves different inflation dynamics. Q4: What tools is the Fed considering for liquidity management? Primary tools under discussion include short-term Treasury bill purchases, expansion of the repurchase agreement facility, and potential adjustments to discount window operations. Q5: How might this affect financial markets? A rate hold with complementary liquidity measures could stabilize short-term funding markets. However, it might also signal continued caution about inflation, potentially supporting longer-term Treasury yields.

Projects that are being eyed by investors looking at a combination of the above are Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano (ADA) might continue to see gains as its network fosters growth with an influx of developers and scalability in the long run. Ethereum continues to be the foundation of decentralized finance and, with its huge market cap, continues to offer steady growth. Lastly, Mutuum Finance is getting immense attention as the top cheap cryptocurrency to buy at present, available at merely $0.04 in presale phase 7. Cardano at Channel Support Cardano is resting on the lower boundary of its descending channel, which is a strong accumulation zone. ADA price chart depicts consolidation, and despite market fluctuations, support zone has been quite robust, indicating that the selling force on the price might be easing off. Price might return to the mid or upper part of the descending channel if positive momentum builds. However, while Cardano demonstrates potential for a rebound, stronger momentum is building in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.04. Ethereum Outlook Amid Institutional Interest Ethereum (ETH) is also making a comeback after the prediction of Tom Lee that price might reach $7,000-$9,000 in early 2026 due to structural demand. As stated by Tom Lee, it’s crystal clear that Ethereum is in the process of the liquidity reset due to the volatility that occurred during the liquidation of October. The adoption of Ethereum by institutions is rising, and it’s already being seen with BitMine investing $1 billion in ETH in just two days. As Ethereum is leading large cap assets toward potential recovery, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rises fast as the top cheap cryptocurrency to buy. MUTM Picks Up Pace During Presale Phase 7 One of the projects that are attracting more investors right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which is currently in presale. The cost of tokens has gone up to $0.04 in phase 7 given the very quick sellout of Phase 6. Time is running out fast to acquire MUTM at this price. A 500% price jump is expected as the token approaches its final presale stages and eventual market launch at $0.06. Early predictions show MUTM could easily be the next crypto to hit $1, which would see current investors reap massive gains in the next bull run. The project has already received $19.5 million from the presale, with 18,630 token holders taking part in this process. It is important to note that the current price of Phase 7 represents a rise of 300% over Phase 1, initially being $0.01. Taking part in the Mutuum Finance presale has been simplified by the ability to buy tokens via credit and debit cards with zero limits. This lowers the barrier for newbie investors who may not know how to navigate crypto wallets, making MUTM the best crypto to invest in right now. Leaderboard Incentives For the purpose of actively engaging the community, the Mutuum Finance platform has introduced a leaderboard that shows the Top 50 Holders ranking on a dashboard. For the first position on the daily buyer leaderboard, there is a bonus of $500 MUTM for the top-ranking investor. The only requirement is to have made a transaction within a 24-hour period resetting at 00:00 UTC. CertiK and Halborn Audits Mutuum finance has undergone security audits by Certik and Halborn, two of the biggest blockchain security platforms. On the Certik audit, the project scored a 95.0/100, showcasing a secure DeFi protocol. The most recent of the two audits was the one by Halborn, which was only recently completed. Following the audit, the MUTM team implemented the feedback and is now set for V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia testnet. The timeline for this launch will shortly be given by the team. This incentive structure brings to fore the functionality-focused development of the MUTM token. Additionally, factoring in its early stage of development, as well as impressive fundamentals, MUTM is identified as one of the best value-for-money DeFi tokens as well as a crypto to keep an eye on in 2026. Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) are seeing steady progress; however, the biggest opportunity exists within Mutuum Finance (MUTM), now priced at $0.04 during the Presale Phase 7.

Tether Has Purchased Another 8,888 Bitcoin In a new post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has shared the blockchain details of a Bitcoin transaction that the company made during the past day. With this transfer, the firm moved exactly 8,888.8888888 BTC from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex to its BTC reserve. Tether is a digital asset company best known for being the issuer of the stablecoin USDT. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that have their price pegged to a fiat currency and USDT, tied to the US Dollar, is currently the largest asset of this type in the world in terms of market cap . Tether has been maintaining a Bitcoin reserve since 2023, when it announced that it will regularly be allocating 15% of its net realized operating profits to the number one cryptocurrency as part of a new investment strategy. The company has since gradually been adding to the reserve, with the latest expansion announced by Ardoino corresponding to accumulation that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2025. At the time that the transaction shared by the Tether CEO occurred, the new coins were worth $778.7 million. This latest purchase has taken the company’s total holdings to 96,370 BTC, equivalent to more than $8.46 billion. For comparison, the second largest public Bitcoin treasury company, MARA Holdings, owns just 53,250 BTC ($4.68 billion). Thus, the firm’s BTC reserve is one of the largest in the world. Though, while Tether’s holdings are very significant, they still pale in comparison to Strategy, the largest corporate holder of the asset. Led by co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, the company has been accumulating the coin for years now, with the latest purchase coming just this Monday. This buy, involving 1,229 BTC, took the treasury firm’s total holdings to 672,497 BTC to cap off 2025. At the current exchange rate, this massive reserve is worth more than $59.1 billion. Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency sector have been experiencing a bearish phase since the top in October, but it would appear that this market shift hasn’t discouraged the likes of Tether and Strategy from accumulating more of the asset. The bearish momentum in the sector has also affected the stablecoins. As data from DefiLlama shows, the market cap of these assets was following an uptrend between 2024 and the last quarter of 2025. Since October, though, growth has flatlined. As mentioned before, Tether’s USDT is the most dominant stablecoin. It makes up for $187 billion of the $308 billion market cap attached to the sector. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $87,900, down 0.5% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Tether|Tether Bitcoin|USDT,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-01 22:00:31

This incident, involving the unauthorized creation of 150 million FLOW tokens, highlights the ongoing challenges of securing next-generation blockchain infrastructure and the complex balance between technical fixes and community consensus. Flow Foundation Hack Triggers a Phased Recovery Response The breach targeted the Flow blockchain’s unique dual-chain architecture. Consequently, the foundation’s initial technical response considered a network rollback. However, strong opposition from the decentralized community swiftly emerged. Therefore, the foundation pivoted to a more nuanced plan. This two-stage approach prioritizes network normalization first, followed by a permanent economic fix. Stage one has already seen the successful normalization of Cadence, Flow’s proprietary non-EVM smart contract language. Developers report that the core chain is now stable. Meanwhile, stage two focuses on the compromised Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility layer. The foundation aims to restore full EVM functionality within days. Crucially, the plan centers on burning the illicitly minted tokens rather than reversing the chain’s history. Anatomy of the $3.9 Million Blockchain Exploit Forensic analysis suggests the attacker exploited a vulnerability to mint 150 million FLOW tokens. This staggering figure represents approximately 10% of the total token supply. The hacker’s subsequent actions followed a familiar laundering pattern. Initially, the funds moved to a centralized exchange, widely suspected to be Binance. On that platform, the FLOW tokens were swapped for Bitcoin (BTC). Finally, the BTC was withdrawn, obscuring the trail. This sequence raises immediate questions for regulatory observers. The movement of such a large volume of illicit funds through a major exchange will likely trigger scrutiny. Specifically, compliance teams will examine the platform’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This event may serve as a case study for future regulatory actions in the digital asset space. Expert Analysis: The Rollback Debate and Governance Precedent Blockchain security experts note that the community’s rejection of a rollback is highly significant. A rollback, or chain reorganization, would have reversed transactions to a point before the hack. While technically feasible, such actions are philosophically contentious. They contradict the principle of immutability—the idea that blockchain transactions are permanent and unchangeable. “The decision to burn tokens instead of executing a rollback is a landmark moment for Flow’s governance,” explains Dr. Anya Sharma, a distributed systems professor at Stanford University. “It demonstrates that technical teams are yielding to decentralized community sentiment. This prioritizes long-term trust in the network’s neutrality over a short-term technical reset. However, the token burn must be executed flawlessly to prevent inflationary pressure on the remaining FLOW supply.” Comparative Impact on Flow’s Dual-Chain Architecture Flow’s design differs from single-chain networks like Ethereum. Its architecture separates transaction execution (Cadence) from EVM compatibility. The hack primarily affected the EVM chain, which is a bridge for Ethereum-based applications and assets. The table below outlines the status and function of each chain post-incident: Chain Primary Function Status Post-Hack Recovery Action Cadence (Non-EVM) Native smart contracts & NFTs Normalized & Stable Security audit completed EVM Chain Ethereum dApp compatibility Under Restoration Token burn & patch deployment This targeted impact allowed the core network to remain operational. Notably, major applications built on Cadence, including NBA Top Shot, experienced minimal disruption. The containment showcases a potential advantage of modular blockchain design during a security crisis. The Road to Restoration and Regulatory Repercussions The foundation’s recovery roadmap now enters its most critical phase. The planned token burn requires precise execution to remove the fraudulent supply from circulation. Simultaneously, engineers are patching the vulnerability that enabled the unauthorized minting. The broader ecosystem is watching closely, as the outcome will influence: Investor Confidence: A smooth recovery can demonstrate resilience. Developer Trust: Builders need assurance of network stability. Regulatory Attention: The exchange’s role may attract formal inquiries. Industry Standards: The response sets a precedent for handling large-scale exploits. Furthermore, the incident underscores the importance of robust, audited code—especially for bridges and compatibility layers that connect different blockchain environments. These cross-chain tools have become frequent targets for sophisticated attackers. Conclusion The Flow Foundation hack and its ensuing two-stage recovery plan present a real-time lesson in modern blockchain crisis management. By abandoning the contentious network rollback in favor of a community-endorsed token burn, the foundation is navigating a complex path between technical resolution and decentralized governance. The successful restoration of the EVM chain and the permanent removal of the illicit tokens will be the ultimate test of this strategy. This event not only stresses the perpetual need for advanced security in blockchain infrastructure but also highlights the growing power of community governance in determining the legitimate response to a major FLOW token security breach. FAQs Q1: What was the initial plan the Flow Foundation abandoned? The foundation initially proposed a network rollback, which would have reversed the blockchain’s transaction history to a point before the hack. The community strongly opposed this, leading to the current two-stage recovery plan. Q2: How does a token burn help recover from the hack? Burning the 150 million illicitly created FLOW tokens permanently removes them from circulation. This action aims to neutralize the inflationary impact of the hack and restore the token’s economic integrity without altering past transactions. Q3: What is the difference between Cadence and the EVM chain on Flow? Cadence is Flow’s native, non-EVM smart contract language, designed for high-performance applications like NFTs. The EVM chain is a separate compatibility layer that allows applications built for Ethereum to run on the Flow network. The hack primarily affected the EVM chain. Q4: Why does the hacker’s use of an exchange raise concerns? Moving $3.9 million in illicitly obtained funds through a centralized exchange triggers questions about that platform’s compliance procedures. Regulators may examine whether the exchange’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) systems effectively flagged or prevented the transaction. Q5: What are the potential long-term impacts of this incident on the Flow blockchain? Long-term impacts depend on the recovery’s success. A smooth resolution could demonstrate strong governance and technical resilience, building trust. A flawed recovery or further issues could damage developer and investor confidence, potentially affecting FLOW’s adoption and market value.

The list framed a future where stablecoins will rival global card networks, privacy tools will become a key competitive advantage, and crypto firms will move beyond trading as markets prepare for a possible rebound. The Main Story: A Vision Beyond Trading The firm’s detailed list framed 2026 as a pivotal year for maturing blockchain applications. A central theme is the evolution of stablecoins from a niche crypto tool into a core component of global finance. a16z suggested these digital dollars could trigger a long-awaited modernization of banking infrastructure, stating “the internet becomes the bank.” This implies a future where digital wallets and decentralized networks handle payments and wealth management at a scale rivaling traditional giants. Additionally, a16z identified privacy as “the most important moat in crypto.” This marks a significant shift in narrative, suggesting that the ability to conduct verifiable yet confidential transactions will become a primary feature attracting users, rather than just transparent speculation. This outlook arrived at a time when crypto markets are displaying unusual calm, with analytics from Santiment showing trading activity for major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has slowed to yearly lows, with many altcoins losing momentum at the tail end of 2025. Macro Signals Hint at Rotation Toward Crypto in 2026 While short-term interest looks muted, several analysts see conditions lining up for a stronger year ahead. For instance, market observers pointed to the Federal Reserve ending quantitative tightening and cutting rates three times in 2025, with further reductions expected in 2026. Lower borrowing costs and looser liquidity have historically favored risk assets, including digital currencies. Another analyst, Bull Theory, compared Bitcoin’s current pause to mid-2020, when gold and silver rallied first before capital later flowed into crypto. Precious metals are again setting records, which some view as a sign that liquidity may rotate next rather than exit markets. Altcoins, however, remain mixed. Solana (SOL) held near $126 through December even as spot trading slowed, though recent ETF inflows suggest institutions are still paying attention. Other large tokens, such as Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE), ended the year lower, reflecting limited retail interest. Against this backdrop, a16z’s focus on payments, privacy, and practical blockchain uses suggests the next phase may depend less on speculation and more on whether crypto can prove its value in everyday finance as 2026 unfolds.

XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are currently among the top assets to watch as potential best crypto to buy. With Bitcoin holding around $87.5K, most altcoins are still sitting more than 50% below their all-time highs. Bitcoin has effectively broken the traditional four-year cycle, so no one can say for sure what will happen next. Still, from a fundamental standpoint, SOL, XRP, and DOGE stand out as some of the most interesting choices going into the new year, and here is why. Ripple (XRP) Could Head To $8: Bank Analyst Predicts XRP just hit an eight-year low in terms of supply available on exchanges. Fewer coins on exchanges usually signal accumulation as price hits new lows. This long-term accumulation is mainly supported by ETFs, which have now recorded over $1.4B in inflows since launch. That represents almost 0.75% of the total supply in a couple of months. Analysts from banking giant Standard Chartered have predicted XRP could skyrocket more than 300% to over $8 in 2026, driven by demand from spot XRP ETFs and the regulatory clarity the asset now has. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. If that level holds, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 48, which leaves room for a short-term rally toward $2.20. Any sustained break below $1.80 would damage the bullish structure, and the $1.60 level becomes the critical support to watch on the downside. Solana (SOL) is The Top Chain In 2025 Solana is no longer an emerging chain. It ended 2025 as the top blockchain by revenue, pulling in over $1.4B and surpassing Hyperliquid, which ranked second. Solana was also the leading chain by DEX volume and ranked second only to Binance Smart Chain in active addresses in November, even though those months were among the weakest periods for the network. Source: Cryptorank Another major milestone that cannot be ignored is the approval of Solana ETFs. These are expected to drive fresh growth for the ecosystem, similar to what happened at launch, when SOL saw 21 straight days of inflows. With all of this happening while price continues to hold above its 18-month support, Solana could be setting up for explosive performance in 2026. Technically, SOL is currently still leaning bearish. Price is stuck inside a descending channel on the 4-hour chart, printing lower highs since the $145 peak and repeatedly tapping support around $117–$118. The fact that this support has held twice actually matters more than most people think. If Solana can break and hold above the $127.50–$130.50 zone, momentum could flip fast. That would open the door to $133 first, then a retest of the channel top around $139–$140. If it fails instead, $118 comes back into play, with $112 as the next deeper support to watch. If You Bet On Memecoins, You Bet On Dogecoin (DOGE) Memecoins were mostly dead in 2025. After starting the year strong with a Solana-led memecoin season, the Trump memecoin launch marked the turning point. That single event likely damaged retail trust in memecoins more than anything else, as the Trump token kept sliding and never recovered. Since then, sentiment has dropped to its lowest levels in years. Still, some believe memecoins always come back when nobody expects them. If you are one of those, then Dogecoin is the obvious pick. It is still the leader of the memecoin space and is currently down more than 62% year over year. Dogecoin price has been descending for a while now. It hit $0.12, which is a yearly low, and it is currently holding around that level. For now, this zone is acting as a demand floor, but repeated tests tend to weaken support. If sellers stay in control, the risk of a breakdown increases. On the upside, the $0.14 area stands out as a key resistance level. It lines up with prior consolidation and multiple rejection points. As long as Dogecoin stays below this zone, any upside move is likely corrective rather than a full trend reversal. A more meaningful bullish signal would only appear if price reclaims and holds above the broader $0.16 resistance band. That kind of move would signal a momentum shift and could open the door for a recovery toward $0.18 first, and potentially $0.20–$0.21, which matches the higher targets marked on the chart. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The High-Conviction Wildcard for 2026 While majors like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are rebuilding structure, some investors are looking further out on the risk curve. That is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) keeps showing up. Bitcoin Hyper just crossed a $30M milestone raised, a key psychological level that signals growing conviction from early buyers. The idea is simple but powerful: extend Bitcoin into a high-speed Layer 2 environment without sacrificing its brand or liquidity gravity. Built as a Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2, Hyper focuses on fast settlement, low fees, and smart-contract compatibility, opening the door for DeFi, payments, and yield strategies that native Bitcoin cannot handle efficiently today. Instead of competing with BTC, it is designed to scale Bitcoin usage. The reason some are paying attention now is timing. Presales that clear major funding milestones tend to see renewed interest as narratives rotate back to infrastructure plays. With Bitcoin holding near $87K and altcoins still depressed, capital is increasingly hunting for asymmetric setups tied to the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. Bitcoin Hyper is still early, still speculative, but the $30M raised mark suggests this is no longer flying under the radar. If Bitcoin-centric Layer 2 narratives take off in 2026, $HYPER could be one of the names traders circle next.

That’s the core argument from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc), who said Bitcoin futures volumes have been “cut in half since November 22,” dropping from $123 billion in daily volume to $63 billion. Futures, Not ETFs, Are Holding Bitcoin In Place The slowdown, he added, “partly explains the low volatility observed on BTC in recent weeks.” But the bigger point is relative scale: at $63 billion per day, futures still represent “nearly 20 times the volume of spot Bitcoin ETFs ($3.4B) and about 10 times spot market volumes ($6B),” according to the analyst. In other words, even if ETF outflows are real and visible, they may not be the dominant marginal force setting the tone. “Many continue to point to ETFs, which have experienced significant outflows in recent weeks,” Darkfost wrote. “While these outflows do contribute to selling pressure, futures markets clearly remain the dominant force in overall volumes.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Dump Is Over: On-Chain Data Just Flipped Darkfost pointed to net taker volume, a derivatives metric used to infer whether aggressive buying or selling is dominating, as a cleaner read on why price has struggled to trend. He framed it in conditional terms based on prior market behavior: “Each time net taker volume has turned negative, Bitcoin has entered a corrective phase. When this indicator moves into negative territory, selling volume dominates.” In his telling, the market has been living with that bias for months. Since July, net taker volume has “generally remained negative,” he said, with one notable interruption: “A noticeable slowdown occurred in early October, allowing Bitcoin to set a new all time high, but selling pressure quickly regained control. Today, selling volumes continue to dominate and have kept Bitcoin trapped in a range for about a month.” There is, however, a tentative improvement in the same dataset. Darkfost said futures-driven selling pressure has declined since early November, with net taker volume improving from around -$489 million to -$93 million. He described that as “a positive signal,” but not yet enough to change the regime. “Liquidity remains weak,” he wrote, adding that ETF and spot volumes are “still too limited to allow BTC to break out of its current consolidation phase.” Demand Is Key In a separate X post, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research Julio Moreno added a broader framing that shifts attention away from chart-based cycle narratives and toward demand dynamics. “Most are focusing on price performance to define a cycle, when it is demand what they should be looking to,” Moreno wrote. “Bitcoin demand is contracting on monthly terms and slowing down significantly on an annual basis (and about to get into negative territory).” Alongside the futures-driven explanation for Bitcoin’s stall, the selling pressure from long-term holders (LTHs) emerged in recent weeks as the main driver for Bitcoin lagging performance against the stock market and gold. As reported yesterday, the long-term holder selling appeared to have stopped, according to multiple on-chain commentators, with around 10,700 BTC transitioning into long term held coins. Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast In his latest post, leading Glassnode analyst CryptoVizArt argued the change is more about tempo than direction. “LTHs didn’t stop selling,” the analyst wrote, claiming LTHs “are still spending ~7.3k BTC/day (7D SMA) and still realizing <$200M/day in profit. What changed is the rate, not the behavior. This is a cooldown after months of heavy distribution, not a flip to pure accumulation.” Darkfost didn’t dispute that LTHs can be persistent sellers, but he emphasized a different lens. “LTHs never really stop selling in reality, but when we look at supply change, it gives a different picture,” he wrote. “It appears that their distribution has come to an end for now, meaning the amount of BTC maturing and transitioning into LTH status equals the BTC being sold by LTHs (STH buying).” At press time, BTC traded at $87,972.

So we asked the new GPT 5.2 to forecast prices for XRP, PEPE, and Shiba Inu in 2026, and the results were pretty interesting. Below is ChatGPT’s dual-scenario outlook, breaking down both the upside potential and the downside risks for each asset as January unfolds and 2026 gets underway. Ripple (XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Potential Rally Up to $8 ChatGPT predicts going into 2026 for the bull case. It makes it clear that the outlook is driven by post-lawsuit regulatory clarity, accelerating institutional interest, and expanding real-world payment adoption. Analysts expect this strong XRP performance to continue, aligning with ChatGPT AI predictions of a revisit to the $3 to $5 range heading into 2026. Source: ChatGPT There are three key levels to watch on the XRP chart right now. To keep the bullish structure intact, XRP needs to stay above $1.80 as we move into Q1. If that level holds, a move back toward the $2.00 psychological resistance is likely. With the RSI sitting around 48, there is still room for a short-term push toward $2.20. A clean break below $1.80 would weaken the setup, and then $1.60 becomes the main support level to keep an eye on. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView Strong Altcoins Market Could Rotate To Memecoins Like Pepe And Shiba Inu ChatGPT predicts the memecoin sector could finally revive if crypto enters a proper altcoin season. That would push investors back into risk-on assets and inject fresh liquidity into the sector. For PEPE, ChatGPT predicts a rally of over 200% from current levels. This is mainly driven by a community that has survived two cycles, along with rising trading volume and increased social engagement. This PEPE weekly chart shows price bleeding all the way back into the range lows after months of lower highs, which is usually where either a bounce starts, or the structure fully breaks. The range low zone has been tested multiple times now, so it is weak, but buyers are still defending it for the moment. As long as PEPE holds this base, the upside path is clear, first reclaiming the mid-range, then pushing into the range highs where heavy resistance sits. For Shiba, it is a different story. ChatGPT says it has one of the largest ecosystems and growing burn mechanics. That could help support the price going into 2026. On top of that, the long-awaited privacy upgrade could also drive new demand to the chain. Price-wise, ChatGPT predicts a potential rally of over 500% on the bullish side, while the bearish scenario points to a possible 70% drop if momentum stays weak. SHIB is still trending down, but the price is sitting on a demand zone that is holding for now. The bounce looks like relief rather than a trend flip, but sellers failed to make a new low. RSI near 46 shows neutral momentum, while MACD is flat, suggesting selling pressure is fading. Holding this level and reclaiming $0.00000754 opens a move toward $0.00000801, but losing support keeps the bearish structure intact. Maxi Doge Is Built For One Thing: Maximum Meme Exposure If 2026 really brings a fresh altcoin and memecoin rotation, then pure memes will outperform narratives, roadmaps, and promises. That is exactly where Maxi Doge comes in. Maxi Doge does not pretend to be an infrastructure or a utility play. It is a high-conviction memecoin designed for momentum, liquidity waves, and retail-driven upside when risk appetite flips back on. While large-cap memes like DOGE, PEPE, and SHIB grind through heavy resistance and legacy supply, Maxi Doge is positioned as a cleaner, earlier-stage play that can move faster when capital rotates down the curve. No complex tokenomics. No forced utility. Just a meme built for volatility, attention, and social-driven demand. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.4 million, while early backers are earning up to 71% APY through staking rewards. If memecoins do revive the way ChatGPT expects in a true altcoin season, Maxi Doge is the kind of asset that benefits most from that environment. High risk. High volatility. Pure meme energy.

The firm’s latest outlook, published in March 2025, anticipates major structural shifts in international payments, financial privacy, and practical blockchain utility, driven primarily by the maturation and adoption of dollar-pegged and other fiat-backed digital currencies. Stablecoins Transition from Niche to Core Financial Infrastructure a16z Crypto’s analysis positions stablecoins beyond their current role as a trading pair or a volatility hedge within cryptocurrency markets. Consequently, the firm envisions these digital assets evolving into a core settlement layer for global commerce. This transition hinges on several converging factors. First, regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions like the United States and the European Union has provided a more stable operating environment. Second, traditional financial institutions are now actively integrating stablecoin rails into their existing payment systems. Finally, technological advancements in blockchain scalability have reduced transaction costs and increased throughput to levels competitive with legacy systems. For instance, the total settled value on stablecoin networks has consistently rivaled that of established processors like Visa over recent quarters. This metric demonstrates their growing real-world utility. Furthermore, central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects worldwide are accelerating, creating a public-sector parallel that validates the digital currency model and often leverages similar technological foundations. The 2025 Landscape: Payments, Privacy, and New Use Cases The a16z report details three primary vectors for stablecoin impact this year. The most immediate is the transformation of cross-border payments. Traditional international wire transfers are often slow, expensive, and opaque. In contrast, stablecoin transactions can settle in minutes for a fraction of the cost, providing a compelling alternative for remittances and business-to-business payments. Major payment processors and fintech companies are already piloting these services for corporate clients. Secondly, the intersection of stablecoins and privacy-enhancing technologies is gaining traction. While transactions on public blockchains are transparent, new cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs allow users to prove solvency or the validity of a payment without revealing all underlying details. This development could enable compliant private transactions, a feature highly sought after by both individuals and institutions. Expert Analysis on the Macroeconomic Drivers Financial analysts point to broader macroeconomic trends supporting this shift. In regions with high inflation or currency volatility, dollar-denominated stablecoins offer a more accessible store of value and medium of exchange than physical dollars. This use case has seen significant organic adoption in several emerging economies. Additionally, the programmable nature of stablecoins unlocks novel financial applications, often called “DeFi” or decentralized finance. These include automated savings protocols, instant collateralized lending, and streamlined payroll systems that operate 24/7. The following table contrasts traditional and stablecoin-enabled systems across key metrics: Metric Traditional Cross-Border Payment Stablecoin Payment Settlement Time 1-5 Business Days Minutes to Hours Average Cost 3-5% + Fees Often Accessibility Requires Bank Account Requires Internet & Digital Wallet Transparency Low (Opaque Intermediaries) High (Auditable Public Ledger) However, the path forward is not without challenges. Regulatory compliance, particularly regarding Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules, remains a complex hurdle for widespread institutional adoption. Moreover, the stability of the stablecoins themselves relies on the credibility and transparency of their underlying asset reserves, a point of continued scrutiny by regulators and auditors alike. Conclusion The 2025 outlook from a16z Crypto underscores a transformative phase for digital assets, with stablecoins at the epicenter. Their integration into global finance is moving beyond theory into tangible application, driven by technological readiness, regulatory evolution, and clear market demand for more efficient financial infrastructure. While hurdles persist, the trajectory suggests that stablecoins will play an increasingly critical role in reshaping how value is transferred and stored worldwide, marking this year as a definitive turning point for the entire blockchain ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset, most commonly a fiat currency like the US Dollar. They achieve this stability by being backed by reserves of the pegged asset or through algorithmic mechanisms. Q2: Why does a16z Crypto believe 2025 is a pivotal year for stablecoins? a16z points to converging factors including clearer regulations, active integration by traditional finance, improved blockchain scalability, and growing real-world use cases in cross-border payments and decentralized finance, all reaching critical mass this year. Q3: How could stablecoins improve cross-border payments? They can significantly reduce settlement times from days to minutes and lower transaction costs by eliminating multiple intermediary banks, providing a faster, cheaper, and more transparent alternative for international money transfers. Q4: What are the main risks associated with using stablecoins? Key risks include regulatory uncertainty in some regions, potential de-pegging events if the issuer’s reserves are inadequate or not transparent, and the custodial risk associated with the platforms and wallets used to hold them. Q5: Are stablecoins the same as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)? No, they are different. Stablecoins are typically issued by private companies. CBDCs are digital forms of a country’s official fiat currency, issued and regulated directly by its central bank. However, the development of CBDCs often validates the broader digital currency concept.

Key Takeaways: Fed bond buying and lower rates could support Bitcoin in 2026. Clearer regulation and institutional demand remain long-term tailwinds. Gains are likely to be steadier, with fewer sharp rallies. Speaking on Schwab Network , Barhydt said the U.S. central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy. He pointed to early signs of renewed balance sheet support, describing the current environment as “quantitative easing light,” with the Federal Reserve stepping in to support demand for government debt. Fed Bond Buying, Falling Rates Could Lift Bitcoin in 2026 “We are seeing the Fed start to buy its own bonds,” Barhydt said. “Next year, demand for government debt is likely to fall alongside lower interest rates. That combination tends to be positive for all assets, including Bitcoin.” Beyond liquidity, Barhydt brought up regulatory clarity in the U.S. and rising institutional participation as tailwinds that could extend Bitcoin’s upside beyond a single cycle. In his view, lower rates paired with clearer rules could set the stage for several strong years across the digital asset market. Market expectations, however, suggest policymakers remain cautious in the near term. Data from the CME Group shows that just 14.9% of traders expect an interest rate cut at the January Federal Open Market Committee meeting, down from 23% in November, indicating that rate relief may take time to materialize. Last week, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan also said Bitcoin is likely to deliver steady gains over the next decade, but investors should not expect the kind of explosive year-on-year rallies seen in earlier cycles. Hougan described Bitcoin’s outlook as a prolonged upward trend marked by lower volatility and more measured returns. “I think we’re in a 10-year grind upward of strong returns,” he said. “It’s not spectacular returns, [but] strong returns, lower volatility, some up and down.” Bitcoin Seen Entering Accumulation Phase in Early 2026 Meanwhile, analyst Linh Tran believes Bitcoin entered a corrective phase in late 2025 after peaking near $126,000 and falling roughly 35% to around $80,000. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, she said this pullback reflects a structural shift in the market, with Bitcoin now driven less by retail speculation and more by macroeconomic conditions, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. As a result, the outlook for Q1 2026 depends more on fundamentals than cyclical hype. High interest rates remain a key constraint. With U.S. rates still in the 3.5%–3.75% range and expectations for easing pushed into the second half of 2026, liquidity conditions are unlikely to support a strong rally in early 2026. “When liquidity conditions have not yet improved materially, Bitcoin is unlikely to enter a strong growth phase driven purely by macro factors. Instead, the current monetary environment may keep the cryptocurrency trading in a cautious and stable manner,” Tran said. While spot Bitcoin ETFs hold more than $110 billion in assets, flows have become uneven, suggesting institutions are reallocating selectively rather than aggressively increasing exposure.

Bitlight is leading the gainers with a surge of more than 120%, while Collect on Fanable and Everlyn have also posted strong double-digit gains. On the downside, Lighter is the biggest loser among trending tokens, dropping more than 8% on the day. Meanwhile, several of the crypto industry’s most prominent figures saw their personal fortunes shrink sharply in 2025, as a violent market reversal in October wiped out gains accumulated earlier in the year. Several prominent crypto figures saw their personal fortunes shrink sharply in 2025, as a violent market reversal in October wiped out gains. #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/DwSrRA8Cfj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 1, 2026 Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, lost $2.6 billion over the past 12 months, reducing his net worth to $3.8 billion. Fed Liquidity and Lower Rates Could Support Bitcoin Gains in 2026 Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing U.S. monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into markets, according to Abra CEO Bill Barhydt. He said early signs of renewed Federal Reserve bond buying and falling interest rates, which he described as “quantitative easing light,” are typically supportive for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Beyond liquidity, Barhydt pointed to clearer U.S. regulation and growing institutional participation as longer-term tailwinds. However, near-term expectations remain cautious, with CME data showing limited confidence in an early 2026 rate cut, suggesting that supportive conditions may take time to fully materialize. Analysts broadly expect gains to be steadier rather than explosive. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan sees a long-term upward grind with lower volatility, while analyst Linh Tran said Bitcoin’s recent pullback reflects a shift toward fundamentals, macro conditions, and institutional flows. With rates still high and ETF inflows uneven, Bitcoin may remain in an accumulation phase early in 2026 rather than entering a sharp rally. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $87,789, showing a modest daily gain after stabilising toward the end of December. The chart shows that BTC previously fell sharply from October highs near $126,000 before finding support in the $85,000–$88,000 range, where price action has since compressed into a tighter band. Over the past several weeks, Bitcoin has largely moved sideways, suggesting a consolidation phase following the steep correction. If downside pressure returns, a break below the $85,000 area could expose BTC to further losses toward the $81,000–$80,000 zone, which stands out as the next major support. On the upside, a sustained move above $92,000 would be an early signal of renewed momentum, potentially opening the door toward $98,000 and higher resistance levels near $103,000. Ethereum is currently changing hands around $2,984, slightly outperforming Bitcoin on the day. The chart shows ETH declining steadily from September highs above $4,600 before forming a base near the $2,800–$2,900 region. Recent price action suggests ETH is attempting to stabilise after repeated tests of this support zone. In the near term, holding above $2,900 keeps Ethereum in a neutral-to-stable posture. A close above the $3,100–$3,200 range could signal a recovery phase, with potential upside targets near $3,400 and $3,600. Conversely, a drop below $2,800 would weaken the structure and could push ETH toward the next support around $2,600, where buyers previously stepped in during November’s sell-off. Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment remains cautious as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 31, keeping the market firmly in the fear zone. The reading shows little change from recent sessions, signaling continued uncertainty among investors, with traders largely waiting for clearer macroeconomic or policy signals before taking on additional risk. U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs closed the final trading day of 2025 in the red, with data showing net outflows of $348.1 million on Dec. 31, according to SoSoValue. The decline came despite the market remaining active, with total daily trading volume reaching $2.83 billion. Outflows were led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $99.05 million leave the fund, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $46.58 million in net outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC also continued to bleed assets, recording $69.09 million in outflows, while Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB posted $76.53 million in net redemptions. Despite the daily pullback, cumulative net inflows across U.S. BTC spot ETFs remain strong at $56.61 billion. Total net assets across the products stand at $113.29 billion, representing about 6.47% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs also ended the year under pressure, posting net outflows of $72.06 million on Dec. 31. Trading activity remained moderate, with $808.1 million in total value traded during the session. BlackRock’s ETHA led the outflows, seeing $21.51 million leave the fund, while Grayscale’s ETH product recorded $31.98 million in net redemptions. Fidelity’s FETH also posted smaller outflows of $2.22 million, reflecting broad-based caution across issuers. Cumulative net inflows into US ETH spot ETFs remain positive at $12.33 billion. Total net assets stand at $17.95 billion, accounting for roughly 5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, a U.S. federal judge threw out a crypto investor lawsuit against Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks, ending a case that tried to pin Voyager Digital’s collapse on celebrity-style promotion and team marketing.

Notably, the XRP fund differs from the spot XRP funds and will only seek to provide investors with income from the altcoin rather than provide spot exposure. Roundhill Files Form N-1A For XRP ETF Roundhill filed a post-effective amendment for its XRP Covered Call Strategy ETF, noting that the filing was intended to delay the fund’s effectiveness until January 29. In line with this, the fund could launch this month, unless another amendment delays its effectiveness. The potential launch of Roundhill’s XRP ETF could provide a major boost for the altcoin, as the fund offers another avenue for institutional investors to gain exposure to the token. Roundhill’s XRP fund differs from the spot XRP ETFs , as it doesn’t provide spot exposure to the altcoin. Instead, it seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price return of one or more ETFs that provide exposure to XRP and whose shares trade on a U.S.-regulated exchange. Basically, the fund tracks the performance of other XRP ETFs that provide direct exposure to the altcoin and doesn’t invest directly in the altcoin. Roundhill’s XRP ETF prospectus also revealed that the Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives through the use of a synthetic covered call strategy that provides current income. In tracking the price return of other XRP ETFs, the Fund isn’t just limited to spot XRP funds. It can also track the price return of ETFs that derive exposure to XRP through investments in exchange-traded futures contracts that utilize XRP as the reference asset. What The Filing Confirms For The Altcoin In an X post , crypto pundit Richard stated that Roundhill’s XRP ETF filing confirms that XRP is an approved underlying asset for regulated derivatives. He further remarked that this means that XRP-linked options are permissible inside an ETF wrapper and that risk committees, counterparties, and clearing structures are already signed off on. Richard also noted that covered-call ETFs don’t appear first and only come into play after an asset is legally and structurally accepted. Meanwhile, the pundit alluded to the fact that the sole purpose of the latest filing was to delay the effectiveness. He explained that this means that the product structure is complete, that approval is not the issue, and that timing is the variable. The pundit further stated that Roundhill isn’t trying to capture upside but is simply monetizing XRP’s volatility. As such, they have a different objective from the spot XRP ETFs, although the same asset and pipeline are involved for this Fund. Richard added that this is derivatives validation, not price discovery, a development he claimed occurs only when an asset is institutionally cleared. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.84, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Altcoin|Coinmarketcap|ripple|Roundhill|Spot XRP ETF|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-01 23:30:53

Backing a bullish Solana price prediction , a group of deep-pocketed wallets has quietly accumulated over $15.9 million worth of Solana-based DeFi tokens, even as prices continue to slide. Whales/institutions have been accumulating #Solana #DeFi tokens recently. Over the past 2 days, three wallets withdrew $15.9M worth of #DeFi tokens from exchanges, including: 7.39B $PUMP ($13.77M) 8.02M $CLOUD ($621K) 9.06M $KMNO ($539K) 1.33M $JTO ($521K) 3.05M $DRIFT ($479K)… pic.twitter.com/aOCl6CBkiw — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 31, 2025 According to Lookonchain , three wallets have been buying into five Solana ecosystem tokens: $PUMP, $CLOUD, $KMNO, $JTO , and $DRFT . These projects were among the hardest hit during the recent bear market, yet this coordinated move from institutional-level wallets suggests growing confidence that the bottom may already be in. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) has gained 2.8% in the past week and continues to consolidate just above the $120 level. The upcoming Alpenglow upgrade , expected in Q1 2026, is another reason traders are paying attention. With the potential to bring transaction speeds to near internet-level performance, whales may already be positioning for Solana’s next breakout. Solana Price Prediction: SOL is About to Reverse Its Downtrend – Can It Climb Back to $200? The daily chart shows that SOL has formed a falling wedge in the past weeks. The price encountered strong support at around $119 and is now retesting a structural resistance at $125. Source: TradingView If SOL rises above this mark, this could confirm the end of its downtrend as it would invalidate the token’s bearish price structure. Falling wedges are often seen as bullish trend reversal patterns, showing that buyers are quietly stepping in as the price gets squeezed tighter. These setups often lead to strong breakouts, and if Solana follows that path, it could push to $145 first, then possibly to $168 in the short term. With whales continuing to buy and momentum starting to shift, a full recovery might not be far off. While Solana meme coins have taken a back seat this cycle, one new presale is catching serious attention. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised over $4 million by bringing back the same kind of hype that helped Dogecoin shoot up 1000x in its early days.

However, one popular crypto trader just shared a bullish Dogecoin price prediction that sees the token bouncing strongly off a key area of support. Matt Hughes, a trader whose X account is followed by more than 47,000 users, recently shared an interesting chart where he identified a high-reward/low-risk setup within Dogecoin’s weekly chart. Risk/reward in the .11-.12 zone for $DOGE is incredible here.

Back in November 2024, the token rallied above $0.45 after hitting this support area as well. By setting up a stop loss order below $0.11 while establishing an ambitious target at around $0.45, this gives traders a 4.5:1 risk-reward ratio if DOGE starts to recover as the year begins. Historical patterns indicate that January has been a strong month for altcoins in previous years, meaning that meme coins could be getting ready to make a strong comeback. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE’s Volumes Rise as It Bounces Off $0.11 The daily DOGE chart shows that the selling pressure has been easing lately after DOGE declined below the $0.12 area. Source: TradingView.com The token has surged by 2.8% during today’s session, while trading volumes have gone up by 79% after briefly dropping below this key support. These volumes account for 6% of the asset’s circulating market cap, indicating that buying pressure is rapidly rising. Is DOGE about to make a big move? A move above $0.14 would confirm a bullish outlook for the top meme coin as it would invalidate its bearish price structure. This could set the stage for an explosive jump to $0.18 first, the 200-day EMA, and then to $0.27 in the near term. As meme coins show signs of a comeback, a new presale is gaining traction fast. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has already raised millions for its mine-to-earn platform, where anyone can start mining meme coins without needing any hardware. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Lets Anyone Mine Meme Coins with Zero Hardware Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is establishing a new paradigm by launching a fun game through which players can mine meme coins without needing to invest thousands of dollars in expensive equipment. The game allows you to set up a virtual server and fire up as many rigs as you want by simply buying $PEPENODE. Top miners on Pepenode will be eligible for airdrops of viral tokens like Pepe ($PEPE) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) , turning virtual mining into real meme coin rewards. To keep the ecosystem balanced, the project will burn up to 70% of all $PEPENODE used on upgrades, creating constant deflation and stronger token scarcity over time. With the game picking up steam and going viral across meme circles, demand for $PEPENODE is expected to skyrocket. The presale closes in just 6 days, so there’s still time to get in early before the mining starts. To join, visit the official Pepenode website and connect your wallet, such as Best Wallet .

While recent monthly price action has remained muted, a crypto analyst maintains that the meme coin’s broader technical trend has not been compromised. The analyst has projected that DOGE could eventually rally toward a long-term move beyond the $10 level. Dogecoin Bullish Structure Points Toward $10 On December 31, crypto market expert Olivier D Maximus posted on X that Dogecoin remains structurally bullish and could eventually cross $10. He noted that although price action has been slow and unimpressive, DOGE’s bullish framework continues to favor higher valuations in the long term. Related Reading: 7-Period Fractal Trend Says Dogecoin Price Is Headed To $10 He shared a new detailed chart analysis, indicating that DOGE’s monthly close generated little short-term excitement. However, he emphasized that the broader bullish framework remains intact, with attention now turning to what January may bring as the next decisive phase. Maximus pointed out that long-term structures often move quietly before big gains, and Dogecoin appears to be following this pattern. He stressed that patience is required when analyzing higher time frames, as monthly charts tend to capture macro trends rather than immediate volatility. In his view, the current consolidation does not invalidate Dogecoin’s upside thesis. The analyst’s chart showed Dogecoin trading within a clearly defined Ascending Channel that has held for several years. The meme coin’s price remains above the long-term rising support zone, reflecting higher lows over time. Additionally, multiple diagonal trend lines show that DOGE’s price has repeatedly corrected toward mid-channel support before resuming upward movement. These pullbacks appear controlled, reinforcing the possibility of a healthy long-term uptrend. Maximus has also spotlighted several ATH levels he expects Dogecoin to reach over time. The ascending channel seen on the chart points toward potential targets above $12, extending as high as $25. Moreover, the analyst has suggested that if Dogecoin maintains its structural integrity, future trends could push the meme coin into double-digit territory, making a surge from under $1 to $10 technically plausible. DOGE Enters Make Or Break Zone In 2026 In a separate X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price is currently trading within a Descending Triangle, with the price sitting at the tip of the pattern around $0.122. This level has been highlighted as a potential make-or-break point where a pullback or surge could determine Dogecoin’s next big move. Related Reading: What The Rise In Open Interest Means For The Dogecoin Price If price breaks above the upper boundary of the Descending Triangle, Trader Tardigrade predicts that Dogecoin could experience a breakout to the upside. He has set a target of around $0.132, representing a surge of approximately 8.2% from the current price level. On the other hand, if DOGE breaks below the lower boundary of the triangle, the meme coin could tumble further toward $0.116, representing a roughly 4.9% crash.

Bitcoin Apparent Demand Has Been Declining Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno has talked about Bitcoin cycles from a different lens. “Most are focusing on price performance to define a cycle, when it is demand what they should be looking to,” noted Moreno. Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case The analyst has gauged the “demand” for the cryptocurrency using the Apparent Demand indicator, which compares the daily miner issuance against the changes in the 1-year dormant supply. The first of these, the miner issuance, is the amount that miners are “minting” on the network every day by receiving block rewards. This metric essentially reflects the “production” of the asset. The 1-year inactive supply, on the other hand, can be thought of as the cryptocurrency’s “inventory.” Thus, the Apparent Demand basically compares the production of Bitcoin against changes taking place in its inventory. Below is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trends in the 30-day and 1-year versions of the Apparent Demand over the past decade. As is visible in the graph, the last few Bitcoin cycles have all transitioned into a bear market when the Apparent Demand has plunged into the negative region on both the monthly and yearly timeframes. In the current cycle, the 30-day Apparent Demand has plunged into the red zone recently, suggesting that the monthly demand for the asset has been negative. On the annual scale, the metric is still at a positive level, but its value has been following a downtrend. If this decline keeps up, it won’t be long before the indicator has dipped into the negative territory. Considering the pattern from the previous cycles, the current structure in the Apparent Demand is certainly looking bearish. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the yearly version of the metric will cross into the red zone or if it will rebound, signaling the return of demand. Spot demand isn’t the only way to measure Bitcoin demand these days. With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there has been some fresh off-chain demand coming into the cryptocurrency this cycle.

This strategic pivot, first reported by the Financial Times in late 2024, represents a direct challenge to the global sanctions regime. Consequently, nations and regulators worldwide are now grappling with the implications of digital currencies financing international arms transfers. Iran Cryptocurrency Weapons Strategy Unveiled The Defense Export Center (Mindex), operating under Iran’s Ministry of Defense, publicly announced its new payment framework. The agency explicitly stated its readiness to negotiate contracts for military equipment using digital currencies. This equipment notably includes armed drones, ballistic missiles, and naval vessels. Additionally, Mindex will accept barter arrangements and the Iranian rial. This announcement marks one of the first instances where a sovereign state has openly declared cryptocurrency as a payment method for strategic defense exports. Therefore, it sets a significant precedent in global finance and security. The Core Motivation: Bypassing Financial Sanctions For over a decade, Iran has operated under extensive Western sanctions, primarily from the United States and the European Union. These sanctions have severely restricted its access to the global financial system, specifically the SWIFT network. Traditional banking channels for multi-million dollar defense deals have been effectively closed. Cryptocurrency, with its decentralized nature and potential for pseudonymous transactions, presents a viable alternative. Analysts from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) confirm that digital assets offer a mechanism to circumvent traditional oversight. This development directly threatens the efficacy of long-standing economic pressure campaigns. Technical and Logistical Execution of Crypto Arms Deals Executing multi-million dollar weapons transactions via cryptocurrency involves complex logistical steps. First, the parties must agree on a valuation, typically pegged to a stablecoin like Tether (USDT) or to Bitcoin, to avoid volatility. Second, they must establish secure digital wallets, potentially using privacy-focused coins or mixers to obscure transaction trails. The decentralized nature of blockchain makes interdiction by sanctioning bodies exceptionally difficult, though not impossible. Chainalysis, a leading blockchain analysis firm, notes that while transactions are public, layering techniques can complicate tracking. The following table outlines the potential advantages for Iran in this model: Advantage Explanation Financial Access Restores access to a global pool of capital outside controlled banks. Transaction Speed Enables faster settlement compared to traditional, scrutinized wire transfers. Reduced Traceability Blockchain analysis can be countered with advanced obfuscation tools. Operational Deniability Provides a layer of plausible deniability for counterparties. Historical Context and Precedents Iran’s foray into cryptocurrency is not entirely new. The government has been exploring digital assets for several years to mitigate sanctions pressure. In 2022, Iran executed its first official import order using cryptocurrency, worth $10 million. Furthermore, the country has been actively developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). However, applying this technology to the defense sector represents a severe escalation. Previously, non-state actors and ransomware groups have used crypto for illicit financing. Now, a nation-state is adopting similar tactics for geopolitical leverage, blurring the lines between cybercrime and statecraft. Global Reactions and Regulatory Implications The international response has been one of deep concern. Officials from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have reiterated that sanctions compliance extends to the cryptocurrency space. They have previously sanctioned cryptocurrency addresses linked to Iranian ransomware operations. Meanwhile, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money-laundering watchdog, is likely to intensify its scrutiny of virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that could facilitate such trades. Key implications include: Tighter VASP Regulations: Exchanges may face stricter Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules for large transactions. Enhanced Blockchain Surveillance: Governments will likely invest more in forensic blockchain analysis tools. Diplomatic Pressure: Nations may push for international treaties governing crypto use in defense. Expert Analysis on Market and Security Impact Dr. Sarah Miller, a sanctions expert at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center, provides critical insight. “This move is less about the immediate volume of sales,” she explains, “and more about testing the resilience of the sanctions architecture. It signals to other sanctioned states like North Korea and Venezuela that a potential blueprint exists.” From a market perspective, large, opaque transactions could introduce volatility and reputational risk into the crypto ecosystem. Moreover, it forces a reckoning within the crypto industry about its role in global security versus financial innovation. The Future of Sanctions in a Digital Age Iran’s action fundamentally questions the future of economic statecraft. Traditional sanctions rely on controlling choke points in the centralized financial system. Cryptocurrency deliberately decentralizes those points. Going forward, sanctioning bodies must adapt their tools. Potential countermeasures could involve: Issuing sanctions directly against specific blockchain protocols or smart contracts. Mandating that miners and validators screen transactions against blacklisted addresses. Creating “whitelisted” digital asset networks for compliant institutions only. This arms race between financial privacy and regulatory oversight is now entering a profoundly consequential phase with direct implications for global stability. Conclusion Iran’s decision to accept cryptocurrency for military weapon sales marks a dangerous and innovative escalation in sanctions evasion. This strategy leverages the inherent features of digital assets—pseudonymity and decentralization—to finance the export of drones, missiles, and warships. While the immediate financial impact may be limited, the precedent is profound. It challenges the core mechanisms of international financial enforcement and signals a new frontier in geopolitical conflict. Consequently, the global community must urgently develop coherent and effective regulatory responses to ensure that cryptocurrency does not become the default tool for undermining international security frameworks. FAQs Q1: What specific military equipment is Iran selling for cryptocurrency? According to the Financial Times report, Iran’s Defense Export Center (Mindex) is offering advanced military hardware including unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), missiles, and naval assets like warships for sale, with cryptocurrency listed as an accepted payment method. Q2: Why is Iran using cryptocurrency for these sales? The primary motivation is to bypass stringent Western financial sanctions. Traditional international banking channels like SWIFT are blocked for Iranian entities. Cryptocurrency provides an alternative, decentralized payment rail that is harder for sanctioning governments to monitor and interdict. Q3: Is this legal under international law? While using cryptocurrency itself is not illegal, the sale of military equipment by Iran likely violates United Nations arms embargoes and specific national sanctions laws (e.g., from the U.S. and EU). Any entity engaging in such a transaction could face severe secondary sanctions from those jurisdictions. Q4: How can cryptocurrency transactions for weapons be tracked? Most cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on public blockchains. Specialized firms like Chainalysis use blockchain analysis to cluster addresses and identify patterns. However, sophisticated actors can use privacy coins, mixers, and chain-hopping techniques to obscure the trail, making full tracking challenging. Q5: What does this mean for the future of global sanctions? This move represents a significant test of the sanctions regime. It indicates that decentralized digital currencies could erode the effectiveness of traditional financial sanctions. In response, governments will likely push for stricter regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges and greater investment in blockchain surveillance technology to maintain enforcement capabilities.

This measurable change, reported on April 9, 2025, by data provider Alternative, signals a potential inflection point for digital asset traders worldwide who closely watch this barometer for clues about market bottoms and prevailing emotional trends. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s Rise to 28 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial quantitative gauge for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Operating on a scale from 0 to 100, it translates complex market data into a simple sentiment score. A reading of 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ often associated with panic selling and potential buying opportunities, while 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed,’ which can signal market tops and excessive speculation. The recent jump from 20 to 28 represents a significant 40% increase in the score, marking the most substantial single-day gain in several weeks. This movement away from the extreme fear threshold (typically below 25) suggests a moderation in panic, though the market remains firmly in negative sentiment territory. Historically, sustained periods in the ‘Fear’ zone (25-49) have preceded consolidations and gradual recoveries, making the current level a critical one for analysts to watch. The Multifactor Engine Behind the Sentiment Score Unlike a simple poll, the index employs a sophisticated, weighted model that aggregates data from six distinct sources to minimize bias. This methodology ensures the score reflects actual market behavior and organic interest rather than mere opinion. The calculation breaks down as follows: Volatility (25%): This component analyzes the magnitude of recent price swings, particularly for Bitcoin. High volatility often correlates with fear, while low volatility can indicate complacency or greed. Market Volume & Momentum (25%): The model assesses trading volume and current price momentum across major spot markets. Unusually high volume during downturns can amplify fear readings. Social Media (15%): Data miners scan platforms like Twitter and Reddit for the volume and sentiment of cryptocurrency mentions. A surge in negative commentary weighs the index down. Surveys (15%): Periodic polls of the retail and professional investor community provide a direct sentiment check, though this is the most subjective input. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap is a key metric. Rising dominance often signals a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful periods, as investors abandon altcoins for Bitcoin. Trends & Search Volume (10%): Google Trends data for core cryptocurrency search terms indicates retail interest. Spiking searches for ‘Bitcoin crash’ directly contribute to fear. The eight-point gain likely stemmed from improvements across several metrics, potentially including reduced volatility, a stabilization in trading volume, and a slight uptick in positive social media discourse following recent regulatory clarifications in key jurisdictions. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis To understand the significance of a ’28’ reading, one must examine historical patterns. The index famously plunged to a record low of ‘6’ during the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020, a moment that preceded a historic bull run. Conversely, it reached ’95’ during the peak euphoria of November 2021, just before a major market correction. The table below illustrates key sentiment levels and their typical market implications: Index Range Sentiment Label Typical Market Phase Investor Behavior 0-24 Extreme Fear Capitulation / Potential Bottom Panic selling, high stress 25-49 Fear Bear Market / Accumulation Cautious, selective buying 50-74 Greed Bull Market / Growth FOMO, increasing leverage 75-100 Extreme Greed Market Top / Bubble Irrational exuberance Currently, the index resides in the lower ‘Fear’ bracket. Market technicians often view a climb out of ‘Extreme Fear’ as a necessary first step for any sustainable recovery, as it indicates the most intense selling pressure may be exhausting itself. However, veteran analysts consistently warn that the index is a contrarian indicator; extreme readings often signal a coming reversal. Therefore, a rise from ‘Extreme Fear’ is watched closely but not interpreted as an immediate all-clear signal. Broader Market Impacts and On-Chain Correlations The shift in the Fear & Greed Index rarely occurs in a vacuum. It frequently correlates with observable on-chain data from blockchain analytics firms. For instance, a move out of extreme fear often coincides with a decrease in the volume of Bitcoin moving to exchange wallets (a sign of reduced intent to sell) and an increase in the number of ‘accumulation addresses’ (wallets with only incoming transactions). Furthermore, the options market shows changing dynamics; the put/call ratio for Bitcoin options may decline as the fear index rises, indicating reduced demand for downside protection. This sentiment shift also impacts altcoins. Typically, when fear recedes slightly, capital begins to rotate tentatively from Bitcoin into major large-cap altcoins, which often exhibit higher beta (volatility) relative to Bitcoin’s movements. The recent index change may therefore presage a period of reduced correlation across crypto assets, allowing fundamental projects to differentiate themselves. The Regulatory and Macroeconomic Backdrop Market sentiment does not evolve independently of the global financial landscape. The index’s recent improvement occurs against a complex backdrop of evolving central bank policies, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory advancements for digital assets. Clearer guidance from legislative bodies in the United States and Europe regarding cryptocurrency custody and classification can directly reduce market uncertainty, a key driver of fear. Similarly, macroeconomic factors like inflation data and interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve heavily influence risk asset appetite, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts note that a stabilizing macro environment often provides the foundation for sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index to recover, as it reduces a major source of systemic risk for the asset class. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to 28 marks a meaningful, though preliminary, shift in cryptocurrency market psychology. This transition from ‘extreme fear’ to ‘fear’ reflects a measurable cooling of panic across multiple data-driven dimensions, including volatility, social sentiment, and market momentum. While firmly indicating that investor caution still dominates, the move suggests the market may be entering a phase of accumulation and consolidation after a prolonged period of distress. For investors, this index level serves as a critical data point, emphasizing the importance of disciplined, long-term strategy over emotional reaction. As always, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a valuable snapshot of the market’s emotional temperature, reminding participants that the collective mood swings between fear and greed are a permanent feature of the financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 28 mean? A1: A score of 28 places market sentiment in the ‘Fear’ zone (25-49). It indicates that negative emotions like anxiety and caution are dominant among investors, but the intense panic associated with ‘Extreme Fear’ (below 25) has subsided. This level often corresponds with periods of price stabilization and potential accumulation by long-term investors. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A2: The index is updated daily, typically once per 24-hour period. The data provider, Alternative, aggregates the latest metrics for volatility, volume, social media, surveys, dominance, and search trends to calculate a new score each day, reflecting the most recent shifts in market sentiment. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? A3: The index is best used as a contrarian sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. Historically, ‘Extreme Fear’ levels have often coincided with market bottoms and buying opportunities, while ‘Extreme Greed’ has signaled potential tops. However, it should never be used in isolation and must be combined with fundamental and technical analysis for informed decision-making. Q4: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? A4: While Bitcoin’s price, volatility, and dominance are heavily weighted inputs, the index aims to measure sentiment for the broader cryptocurrency market. Factors like social media mentions and surveys encompass major altcoins. Bitcoin’s outsized influence on the overall market means its performance significantly drives the final score. Q5: Has the index ever been wrong? A5: As a sentiment indicator, it reflects current emotions, not future price predictions. It can remain in ‘Extreme Fear’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ for extended periods during prolonged bear or bull markets. Its primary value lies in identifying emotional extremes that have, in the past, preceded market reversals, but timing those reversals based solely on the index is highly unreliable.

According to definitive data from the leading crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, this significant expiry event will occur at 08:00 UTC, potentially creating substantial volatility and influencing short-term price trajectories for the world’s premier digital asset. Simultaneously, Ethereum options worth $390 million will reach their expiry, compounding the market’s focus on derivatives activity. This confluence of events represents one of the first major financial tests for digital assets in the new year, drawing intense scrutiny from institutional traders and retail investors alike. Decoding the $1.85 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry The sheer scale of today’s Bitcoin options expiry demands a thorough examination of its core mechanics. The notional value, representing the total worth of the underlying Bitcoin tied to these contracts, underscores the growing institutional footprint in crypto derivatives. Crucially, the put/call ratio for this batch sits at 0.48. This key metric, calculated by dividing put option volume by call option volume, indicates a market sentiment leaning bullish. Specifically, a ratio below 1.0 suggests traders have opened more call options (bets on price increases) than put options (bets on decreases). Consequently, this skew can influence market maker hedging behavior in the hours surrounding expiry. Furthermore, analysts immediately highlight the max pain price of $88,000. This theoretical price point is where the largest number of these Bitcoin options contracts would expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option buyers and maximum gain for option sellers. Market makers, who often hedge their positions, may engage in trading activity to pin the spot price near this level as expiry approaches. However, it is vital to understand that max pain is a snapshot, not a deterministic force. External market factors, including macroeconomic news or substantial spot market flows, can easily override its influence. Asset Notional Expiry Value Put/Call Ratio Max Pain Price Bitcoin (BTC) $1.85 Billion 0.48 $88,000 Ethereum (ETH) $390 Million 0.62 $2,950 Ethereum’s Substantial $390 Million Companion Expiry While Bitcoin commands the headline, the concurrent expiry of $390 million in Ethereum options adds a critical layer of complexity to the market event. Ethereum’s put/call ratio of 0.62, while still below 1.0, is notably higher than Bitcoin’s. This suggests a slightly more cautious or hedged sentiment among Ethereum options traders. The max pain price for ETH is set at $2,950, providing a clear focal point for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The interaction between Bitcoin and Ethereum volatility during this period is a key watchpoint for analysts. Historically, large expiries can lead to correlated price movements, but divergences often occur based on asset-specific narratives and liquidity profiles. Deribit continues to dominate the crypto options landscape, consistently processing over 85% of global volume. The exchange’s data is therefore considered the authoritative source for such expiry events. The reliability of this data allows traders to make informed decisions. Additionally, the structure of these options—primarily European-style, which can only be exercised at expiry—reduces the risk of early assignment and concentrates the market impact around the settlement time. Historical Context and Market Impact Analysis To fully grasp the potential outcomes, one must consider historical precedents. Large quarterly and monthly options expiries have become regular features of the crypto market cycle. Past events have demonstrated a range of effects: Volatility Suppression: Sometimes, the dominant force is gamma hedging by market makers. If they are short gamma near expiry, they may buy or sell spot assets to remain delta-neutral, potentially damping volatility. Pin Risk to Max Pain: On other occasions, especially in lower-liquidity environments, the spot price exhibits a “pinning” effect, gravitating toward the max pain price as expiry nears. Post-Expiry Breakouts: Often, the most significant price movement occurs *after* the expiry settles. The removal of large hedging overhead can unleash pent-up momentum, leading to decisive breaks above or below key technical levels. The current macroeconomic backdrop, including interest rate expectations and traditional equity market performance, will also play a decisive role in how spot prices absorb the expiry’s mechanical effects. Traders monitor the options open interest term structure to gauge where future pressure points may lie. Expert Insights on Derivatives Market Maturity The consistent growth in notional expiry values, from hundreds of millions to multiple billions, signals the profound maturation of cryptocurrency derivatives markets. This growth reflects increased participation from regulated entities, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. These players use options not purely for speculation, but for sophisticated strategies like portfolio insurance, yield enhancement, and directional hedging. The depth of this market now provides valuable sentiment indicators. For instance, the skew of options prices across different strike prices can reveal where professional traders see support and resistance levels. Moreover, the evolution of products like volatility derivatives and the increasing correlation between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) metrics mean that events like today’s expiry are no longer isolated. They are integrated into global risk-on/risk-off calculus. Analysts from major financial institutions now routinely publish research on crypto options flows, treating them with a analytical framework similar to that used for equities or commodities. Conclusion The expiry of $1.85 billion in Bitcoin options and $390 million in Ethereum options today represents a significant, data-rich event for cryptocurrency markets. While the max pain prices of $88,000 for BTC and $2,950 for ETH provide focal points, market participants should view them as one of many factors in a complex ecosystem. The bullish-leaning put/call ratios, particularly for Bitcoin, offer a snapshot of prevailing sentiment heading into the new year. Ultimately, the true impact will be determined by the interplay of derivatives mechanics, spot market liquidity, and broader financial conditions. This Bitcoin options expiry underscores the crypto market’s continued financialization and its growing interconnectedness with global capital flows, making such events essential reading for any serious market observer. FAQs Q1: What does a “put/call ratio” of 0.48 mean for Bitcoin? A1: A put/call ratio of 0.48 means there are roughly twice as many call options (bullish bets) as put options (bearish bets) set to expire. This typically indicates a bullish sentiment among the options traders for this expiry cycle. Q2: What is “max pain price” and does it guarantee the price will go there? A2: Max pain price is the strike price at which the total financial loss for all options buyers is maximized (and gain for sellers is maximized). It is a theoretical calculation, not a guarantee. While market maker hedging can sometimes influence price toward it, spot market forces often prevail. Q3: How does a large options expiry actually affect Bitcoin’s spot price? A3: The effect is primarily indirect via market maker hedging. To manage their risk (delta/gamma), market makers buy or sell Bitcoin in the spot market. This activity can create support, resistance, or volatility suppression in the hours before expiry, with potential for a release of momentum afterward. Q4: Why is Deribit’s data so important for these events? A4: Deribit is the world’s largest cryptocurrency options exchange by volume, consistently handling over 85% of global trading. Its data on open interest, put/call ratios, and max pain is therefore considered the most comprehensive and authoritative benchmark for the market. Q5: Are Ethereum options expiries as significant as Bitcoin’s? A5: While smaller in notional value, a $390 million Ethereum expiry is still highly significant. It can drive volatility for ETH and, given the correlation between assets, can influence the broader altcoin market. The different put/call ratio (0.62 for ETH vs. 0.48 for BTC) also provides a nuanced view of relative sentiment between the two major assets.

This figure, far from the threshold signaling a broad altcoin rally, provides a data-driven snapshot of a market still firmly under Bitcoin’s influence. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing historical patterns and on-chain metrics to understand the potential trajectory for alternative cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: A Market Barometer The Altcoin Season Index serves as a quantitative pulse check for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Specifically, CoinMarketCap’s algorithm analyzes the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, deliberately excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. It then meticulously compares each asset’s gains or losses against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The resulting score is a clear percentage: the proportion of these top altcoins that have outperformed the pioneer cryptocurrency. Therefore, a score of 75 or above formally declares an “altcoin season,” a period where investor capital rotates aggressively into smaller, riskier assets. Conversely, a score like the current 21 underscores a “Bitcoin season,” where capital preservation and focus on the market leader prevail. The Mechanics Behind the Metric Understanding the index requires a grasp of its construction. The 90-day window smooths out short-term volatility and captures medium-term trends, offering a more stable view than weekly or monthly comparisons. By focusing on the top 100 assets by market capitalization, the index prioritizes projects with significant liquidity and investor interest, avoiding noise from micro-cap tokens. The exclusion of stablecoins, which are designed to maintain parity with fiat, and wrapped tokens, which represent other assets on a different blockchain, ensures the metric purely measures speculative performance against Bitcoin. This methodological rigor makes the index a trusted tool for both retail and institutional analysts tracking market cycle phases. Historical Context and the Current Crypto Climate The index’s current reading of 21 is not an anomaly but fits within observable crypto market cycles. Historically, prolonged Bitcoin seasons often precede explosive altcoin rallies. For instance, the bull run of late 2020 saw the index languish in Bitcoin-dominant territory before catapulting above 75 for an extended period in early 2021. Presently, several macroeconomic and sector-specific factors contribute to the subdued index reading. Firstly, institutional adoption continues to favor Bitcoin through spot ETF products and corporate treasuries. Secondly, regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions often arrives first for Bitcoin, creating a “safe-haven” effect within the volatile crypto space. Finally, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in April 2024 historically catalyzes a market-wide focus on its supply dynamics, often sidelining altcoins in the immediate aftermath. Key factors influencing the current low Altcoin Season Index: Institutional Capital Inflows: Major investment vehicles are predominantly Bitcoin-centric. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of economic stress, investors often flock to perceived stores of value. Network Activity: Bitcoin’s hash rate and security budget remain at all-time highs, reinforcing its foundational status. Developer Activity: While vibrant in ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana, capital has been slow to follow innovation recently. Expert Analysis and Market Impact Market strategists interpret the index through different lenses. Some view a low reading as a consolidation phase, where altcoins build fundamental strength before their next leg up. Others see it as a warning sign of reduced risk appetite among crypto investors. The direct impact is observable in trading volumes and capital rotation. Exchange data shows a higher ratio of Bitcoin-to-stablecoin trading pairs compared to altcoin pairs. Furthermore, funding rates in altcoin perpetual futures markets are generally neutral or negative, indicating a lack of aggressive bullish leverage. This environment, however, can create opportunities for disciplined investors to accumulate fundamentally strong altcoins at relatively depressed valuations compared to Bitcoin, a strategy often called “altcoin accumulation.” The Road Ahead: Signals to Watch A sustained rise in the Altcoin Season Index toward the 75 threshold would likely require a confluence of events. Bitcoin achieving a new all-time high and stabilizing is frequently a precursor, as it boosts overall market confidence. Subsequently, narratives around decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), non-fungible token (NFT) volume resurgence, or breakthroughs in blockchain scalability could trigger rotational moves. On-chain metrics like the Bitcoin Dominance chart and the supply of altcoins on exchanges versus in long-term storage provide complementary data. Ultimately, the index is a lagging indicator, confirming a trend already in motion. Savvy observers monitor social sentiment, developer commits, and protocol revenue to anticipate shifts before they appear in the 90-day performance data. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index, standing firmly at 21, delivers an unambiguous message about the present state of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin retains its dominant position, with the majority of major alternative cryptocurrencies failing to outpace its performance over the last quarter. This phase, while potentially frustrating for altcoin enthusiasts, is a well-documented chapter in the volatile history of digital assets. It emphasizes the importance of understanding market cycles, employing robust risk management, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price action. As the market evolves, this index will remain a crucial tool for gauging when investor psychology and capital flows might pivot, heralding the next potential altcoin season. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index of 21 mean? An index score of 21 means that only 21% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This indicates a strong “Bitcoin season” where the pioneer cryptocurrency is leading the market. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates it by comparing the 90-day price performance of each of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The percentage of altcoins that outperform Bitcoin becomes the index score. Q3: Why are stablecoins and wrapped tokens excluded from the index? Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies and designed not to fluctuate, while wrapped tokens represent another asset (like Bitcoin on Ethereum). Excluding them ensures the index measures pure, speculative performance of alternative assets against Bitcoin. Q4: Can the Altcoin Season Index predict future price movements? The index is a lagging indicator, reflecting what has already happened over 90 days. It doesn’t predict the future but helps identify which phase of the market cycle (Bitcoin or altcoin dominance) the market is currently in, which can inform strategy. Q5: What typically triggers a shift from a low index to an altcoin season? Shifts often follow Bitcoin establishing new price stability at higher levels, combined with emerging strong narratives in other sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or GameFi, leading investors to seek higher returns in altcoins.

The price of ADA has gone down by almost 60% from its peak. Currently, it looks like the price may go lower, but investors searching for the best crypto to buy now have turned their attention towards another cryptocurrency project named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This decentralized lending project has already yielded over 300% since its presale began. It has attracted a total of $19,500,000 with the support of 18,630 holders. It is at Phase 7 presently at a cost of $0.04 per token, and this phase is selling out quickly. It will be the last opportunity to invest in at this price before it goes up toward a launch price of $0.06, with 500-750% post-launch returns expected. The Year of Difficulty for Cardano The price drop in Cardano has occurred due to a combination of reasons. Firstly, the entire crypto market is down. This impacted every major cryptocurrency negatively. Secondly, the activity on the DeFi platform of Cardano has reduced. The total value locked in DeFi applications on the platform has declined below $250 million. This value is significantly lower than other players. It has failed to pick up momentum in the emerging trend of tokenization in assets, for example, property and stocks. Large investment banks are not also not very keen. Even though there were some applications for the ETF of Bitcoin and Ethereum, there were very few applications for a Cardano ETF. It dented the confidence level. Looking at the charts, ADA has moved past a major support level and currently lies below the major average level. It may go lower unless something dramatic happens in 2026. The Next Big Thing in Crypto Cardano is struggling, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving quickly and is the next crypto that is expected to explode. The fact that the presale has been successful is enough evidence that there is demand. The project has managed to raise $19.5 million. Those who participated in Phase 1 and bought for $0.01 have realized a 300% profit. Currently in Phase 7, priced at $0.04, the people who are buying now are set to realize a return of as much as 750% when MUTM starts trading. One essential indicator that shows a quality project has come far is having a functional product. The indicator shows Mutuum Finance is on the right track and their V1 Lending Protocol will soon go live on the Sepolia Testnet. This pre-release integrates a liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a Liquidator bot. The platform will initially feature ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing and collateral. Other tokens like Solana are expected in later stages of development. Phase 7 Progress It’s time to act. Phase 7 tokens at $0.04 are being sold fast. Once it’s sold out, Phase 8 starts at $0.045. This is one of the last chances to enter at a low price before it’s opened to the public. Users are motivated by participating in a live leaderboard. Each day’s top buyer is awarded an additional $500 MUTM bonus if that day’s 24-hour period includes at least one trade from them. The leaderboard will reset at midnight UTC every day. Security is paramount. In regard to security, it should be noted that Mutuum Finance recently undertook an audit of its entire lending facility by a reputable security company called Halborn. The entire process of auditing is complete, and they have implemented all recommended changes. As such, it provides a boost to security-conscious individuals who feel MUTM is the best cryptocurrency to invest in. The difference in the two projects is obvious.

This move, announced in early 2025, positions the nation among a growing list of countries seeking to harness the economic potential of blockchain technology while implementing oversight. Turkmenistan’s Cryptocurrency Framework: A Detailed Breakdown The new regulations create a structured path for cryptocurrency activities. Consequently, both domestic and foreign nationals can now participate in crypto mining. However, they must first complete a mandatory registration process with designated authorities. Furthermore, the government will permit the operation of mining pools, which aggregate computational power. Simultaneously, the rules mandate that any cryptocurrency exchange headquartered within Turkmenistan must obtain an official license to operate legally. It is crucial to note a key distinction in the legislation. Specifically, Turkmenistan has not recognized cryptocurrency as legal tender, national currency, or a security. Therefore, this regulatory approach focuses on the activity of mining and exchange operations rather than granting cryptocurrencies official monetary status. This careful positioning allows for economic participation without immediately challenging the national currency, the Turkmenistan manat. Context and Drivers Behind the Legalization Turkmenistan’s decision arrives amidst a complex global and regional landscape for digital assets. Neighboring nations like Kazakhstan have experienced both booms and strains from crypto mining, offering a nearby case study. Domestically, the country possesses significant energy resources, including natural gas, which could potentially power energy-intensive mining operations. Analysts suggest the government aims to create a new, regulated revenue stream and attract foreign investment in technology sectors. The following table outlines the core components of the new regulatory framework: Regulatory Component Key Detail Mining Participation Open to registered domestic and foreign nationals. Mining Pools Operation is explicitly permitted under the law. Exchange Licensing Mandatory for any exchange headquartered in Turkmenistan. Asset Status Cryptocurrency is not legal tender, currency, or a security. Expert Analysis on Economic and Technological Impact Financial technology experts point to several immediate implications. First, the registration process will establish a known participant base, aiding in monitoring and taxation. Second, licensing exchanges introduces consumer protection measures and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. The move could also spur infrastructure development, particularly in areas with surplus energy. However, experts caution that success depends on transparent regulation and competitive energy pricing. The global hash rate distribution may see a minor shift if Turkmenistan attracts substantial mining operations. Comparative Landscape in Central Asia Turkmenistan’s policy places it on a spectrum with its neighbors. For instance, Kazakhstan initially welcomed miners before imposing restrictions due to grid strain. Conversely, Uzbekistan has pursued a more open, licensed approach for exchanges. By learning from these regional examples, Turkmenistan’s framework appears designed to avoid energy grid overload from the outset through its registration system. The country’s relative geopolitical isolation adds a unique dimension, as its crypto market may develop with distinct characteristics. The regulatory announcement highlights several key requirements for participants: Registration: All miners must register, providing identification and operational details. Licensing: Domestic crypto exchanges cannot operate without a formal license. Compliance: Licensed entities will likely need to follow financial reporting and AML rules. Potential Challenges and Future Considerations Implementing this framework presents clear challenges. Regulatory bodies must develop technical capacity to oversee a novel industry. Additionally, balancing energy consumption for mining with domestic needs and export commitments will be critical. The government has not yet published detailed rules on taxation for mining profits or exchange revenues, a vital next step for clarity. Future developments may include rules for token issuance or broader digital asset definitions as the market evolves. Conclusion Turkmenistan’s legalization of cryptocurrency mining and trading marks a pivotal step in its engagement with the global digital economy. By establishing a registration and licensing system, the country seeks to foster a controlled, compliant environment for crypto activities. This structured approach to cryptocurrency regulation aims to capture economic benefits while managing risks. The world will watch closely as this Central Asian nation implements its new digital asset framework, offering another model for integrating blockchain technology within a national economy. FAQs Q1: Can anyone start mining cryptocurrency in Turkmenistan now? No. Both domestic and foreign individuals must complete a government registration process before they can legally mine cryptocurrencies under the new regulations. Q2: Is Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency legal tender in Turkmenistan? No. The regulations specifically state that cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender, national currency, or a security. The rules govern the activities of mining and trading only. Q3: What does the license for a cryptocurrency exchange entail? While full details are pending, the license will be mandatory for any exchange headquartered in Turkmenistan. It will likely require compliance with financial reporting, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering standards. Q4: Why would Turkmenistan legalize crypto mining? Potential drivers include creating a new regulated industry, attracting foreign technology investment, and utilizing domestic energy resources for economic gain, based on observed trends in similar nations. Q5: How does this compare to neighboring Kazakhstan’s approach? Turkmenistan appears to be implementing a registration system from the start, potentially to avoid the unregulated grid strain that Kazakhstan experienced, suggesting a more cautious, controlled rollout.

This pivotal announcement, made from Seoul on March 15, 2025, signals a major strategic evolution for one of the blockchain ecosystem’s notable non-fungible token initiatives. Consequently, the exchange will facilitate all technical updates for its user base, ensuring a seamless transition while the project’s core trading ticker, NFT, remains unchanged. This move underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain projects and the critical role exchanges play in their operational maturity. Coinone’s Strategic Support for the AINFT Rebranding Coinone, established in 2014, operates as one of South Korea’s oldest and most compliant cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform’s decision to support the APENFT rebranding is not merely administrative. Instead, it reflects a deeper commitment to project evolution and ecosystem health. Typically, exchange support for a rebrand involves several technical and communicative steps. For instance, the platform must update its internal systems, wallet infrastructure, and user interface displays. Furthermore, it must communicate these changes clearly to its substantial user base to prevent confusion and ensure trading continuity. This process demonstrates Coinone’s operational expertise in handling asset migrations, a non-trivial task in the volatile crypto environment. The exchange has previously managed similar events, such as token swaps and mainnet migrations, building a reputation for reliability. By proactively announcing its support, Coinone provides market stability and reduces uncertainty for NFT token holders. This action aligns with global best practices for digital asset stewardship, where exchanges act as crucial intermediaries between innovative projects and the investing public. Understanding the APENFT to AINFT Transition The rebranding from APENFT to AINFT represents more than a simple name change. APENFT, originally launched with a mission to bridge world-class art with blockchain technology, has undergone a noticeable evolution in its scope and technological focus. The new moniker, AINFT, strongly suggests an expanded or refined vision, potentially integrating artificial intelligence (AI) concepts with non-fungible token infrastructure. This shift mirrors a broader industry trend where blockchain projects pivot to incorporate adjacent technological breakthroughs, thereby enhancing their utility and market relevance. Critically, the project’s decision to retain its ‘NFT’ ticker on trading platforms is a strategically sound move. It maintains brand continuity and minimizes disruption in trading markets, where ticker recognition holds significant value. A ticker change can often lead to liquidity fragmentation or trading errors. Therefore, preserving the NFT identifier allows existing holders and traders to interact with the asset without relearning its market symbol. The logo update, mentioned alongside the rebrand, serves as a visual marker of this new chapter, helping to refresh the project’s identity while its economic unit remains constant on the ledger. Market Context and Expert Analysis of Project Rebrands Project rebranding in the cryptocurrency space is a common yet critical event. According to data from industry analysts, successful rebrands often follow a period of technical development or a strategic pivot. For example, major projects like Antshares rebranding to NEO or Binance Coin becoming BNB demonstrated how a refreshed identity can align with expanded functionality. The APENFT to AINFT transition appears to follow this pattern, suggesting underlying developments not yet fully public. Market experts generally assess rebrands on several key factors: the clarity of the new vision, the technical execution of the changeover, and the level of support from key ecosystem partners like exchanges. Coinone’s early endorsement is a positive signal on the latter front. It indicates that the AINFT team has conducted necessary due diligence and coordination with one of Asia’s regulated trading gateways. This cooperation reduces execution risk for the average holder, as the complexity of updating wallet addresses and ledger mappings is managed by the exchange’s technical team. The Role of South Korean Exchanges in Global Crypto Adoption South Korea remains a powerhouse in global cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Exchanges like Coinone operate under the strict regulatory framework of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Their compliance mandates rigorous listing and asset review processes. Therefore, Coinone’s continued and proactive support for the AINFT project post-rebrand serves as an implicit validation of the project’s compliance and technical standards. It signals to the market that the project meets the exchange’s ongoing listing criteria. This context is vital for international observers. South Korean markets often exhibit unique investor sentiment, sometimes referred to as the “Kimchi Premium.” Support from a major domestic exchange like Coinone can significantly influence local trading volume and perception. Moreover, it facilitates easier access for Korean investors to participate in the project’s next growth phase. The exchange’s announcement likely includes detailed guidelines for Korean users, which will be disseminated through its official blog, customer service channels, and in-app notifications, ensuring a smooth user experience. Technical and Practical Implications for Token Holders For holders of the NFT token, the practical implications of this rebranding are straightforward, primarily due to Coinone’s managed support. Users trading or holding NFT on the Coinone platform should expect no mandatory action on their part. The exchange will handle the backend updates to reflect the new project name (AINFT) and logo across its interface. However, users should be aware of official communications from both Coinone and the AINFT foundation to avoid phishing scams that often exploit such transitions. No Action Required for Coinone Users: Holdings and trading pairs will update automatically. Ticker Consistency: The asset will continue to be traded under the ‘NFT’ symbol. Updated Project Information: The exchange’s asset info page will reflect the new AINFT name, description, and logo. Withdrawal/Deposit Stability: Wallet addresses on the Coinone platform will remain functional; no new deposit addresses are required. Holders using self-custody wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Ledger) must rely on guidance from the AINFT project itself. Typically, such rebrands do not affect the underlying smart contract address on the blockchain. Therefore, tokens held in a private wallet remain valid and simply represent a claim on the renamed project. The community should watch for official announcements regarding updated token logos in wallet applications, which can sometimes require manual updates in community-driven interfaces. Conclusion The announcement that Coinone will support the APENFT rebranding to AINFT marks a significant step in the project’s lifecycle and highlights the exchange’s role as a stabilizing ecosystem partner. This move ensures a smooth transition for investors and reinforces the project’s legitimacy within a regulated market framework. The strategic decision to retain the NFT ticker provides continuity, while the new AINFT name points toward an evolved future direction, potentially at the intersection of AI and digital asset ownership. As the blockchain industry matures, such managed evolutions, supported by credible exchanges like Coinone, will become increasingly important for sustainable growth and mainstream adoption. FAQs Q1: Do I need to swap my NFT tokens for new AINFT tokens on Coinone? No. This is a rebranding, not a token swap or migration. The existing NFT tokens in your Coinone account will automatically be associated with the new AINFT project name and logo. No user action is required. Q2: Will the trading ticker symbol change on Coinone? No. The exchange has confirmed the ticker will remain ‘NFT’. This ensures consistency across trading pairs and minimizes confusion in the market order books. Q3: What is the main reason for the APENFT project rebranding to AINFT? While the project’s official channels will detail the full rationale, rebrands typically reflect a strategic pivot or expanded vision. The new name AINFT suggests a potential focus on integrating artificial intelligence with NFT technology, indicating an evolution beyond its original scope. Q4: How does Coinone’s support impact the credibility of this rebrand? Coinone’s support is a strong positive signal. As a regulated South Korean exchange, it conducts due diligence on listed assets. Its proactive management of the rebrand implies the AINFT project meets the exchange’s compliance and technical standards, reducing risk for users. Q5: What should holders in self-custody wallets do? Holders in private wallets (like MetaMask) should ensure they follow official announcements from the AINFT foundation. The underlying smart contract address does not change in a simple rebrand. Your tokens are safe. You may need to manually update the token’s displayed name and logo in your wallet interface by following verified community guides.

The offer started sometime last year and signals one of the first public cases where a country is openly accepting crypto for military weapons. Mindex says it has clients in 35 countries. The catalog is stacked. It includes Emad ballistic missiles, Shahed drones, Shahid Soleimani-class warships, and air defense systems. There are also cruise missiles, small arms, and rockets; some of which have already been seen in the hands of Iran-backed armed groups, according to western governments and the United Nations. Mindex platform lists war gear, takes crypto, and shrugs at sanctions The Mindex site is up, public, and slick. It’s in several languages. The domain is hosted on an Iranian cloud provider that’s already under U.S. Treasury sanctions. That host, according to Washington, has ties to Iranian intelligence. The Financial Times allegedly confirmed the site’s authenticity through archive data and server records. The buying process is digital. There’s a chatbot, an online portal, and an FAQ page. That page straight up asks: “Given the sanctions on Iran, what is the guarantee that the contract will be executed and the product will reach the destination country?” Mindex answers: “It should be noted that, given the general policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding circumvention of sanctions, there is no problem in implementing the contract. Your purchased product will reach you as soon as possible.” No prices are listed, but buyers can request in-person inspections of the goods in Iran. That’s “subject to approval from security authorities.” And if you want to pay in your own country instead of Iran, that’s an option too. There are some conditions. Mindex says clients must agree to rules on how weapons are used, specifically “during a war with another country.” But the company notes that these terms are negotiable between the two sides. In other words, if you’ve got the crypto, they’ll talk. Sanctioned governments eye crypto to keep deals alive This all comes at a time when more and more sanctioned countries are testing cryptocurrency to keep their economies moving. Russia has already been caught doing it. Now Iran is making it part of its military business model. The U.S. Treasury has warned about this before. It’s hit Russian companies for using digital assets to evade sanctions. And Iran has already been under fire for doing the same with oil sales, moving hundreds of millions outside normal banks. Back in September, U.S. officials sanctioned people linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards for running what they called a “shadow banking” network using crypto. The goal: move state funds while dodging detection. Western countries aren’t happy. The UK, France, and Germany tried to restart talks with Iran. It didn’t work. In August, they triggered a UN process to snap back global sanctions after those talks collapsed. Even so, Iran keeps exporting. In 2024, it ranked 18th worldwide for arms exports, right behind Norway and Australia, according to the Stockholm Institute for Peace Research. That same year, the Atlantic Council said Iran could cash in on Russia’s export struggles following its Ukraine invasion.

As usual, these promises were made in interviews, earnings calls, podcasts, posts on Twitter (now X), and public events throughout the year. The promises cut across SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, and Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) . According to Cryptopolitan’s analysis, the missed targets trace back years, because in 2011, Elon told The Wall Street Journal a human would reach Mars within ten years. Over fourteen years later, no human mission exists. In 2016, Elon appeared at Recode’s Code Conference with Kara Swisher, journalist and host, and Walt Mossberg, veteran technology columnist.He revised the Mars plan again.Rockets would head to Mars in 2018.Missions would follow every 26 months.Humans would launch in 2024 and arrive in 2025. Elon said, “If things go according to plan, we should be able to launch people probably in 2024 with arrival in 2025.” That year ended without a Mars launch. Elon’s ally Jared Isaacman had to fight tooth and nail to win a nomination as NASA chief, which only came in late November, forcing SpaceX to focus on Earth orbit and testing. Oh and also, the public dates shared years earlier expired without updates matching those promises. Then the Hyperloop idea, something Elon once described it as a fastest way to move people between cities in different countries by 2025. Tesla Robotaxi launch failed to match Elon’s public claims In July during Tesla Q2 2025 earnings call, Cryptopolitan reported that Elon falsely promised investors that robotaxis would cover half of the U.S. population by year-end. He said, “I believe half of the population of the US will be covered by Tesla’s robotaxi by the end of the year.” Austin, Texas is still the only city with active robotaxi operations, and even there, a report from The New York Times says that local residents rarely saw the vehicles. When they did, the cars were not fully autonomous. Each vehicle reportedly still carried a human safety monitor. The promise of empty cars came earlier. During a 2024 fourth-quarter earnings call, Elon said Teslas would operate in Austin without anyone inside by June. “Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin,” he said. Texas rules required a human monitor. The monitors stayed. In September, Elon posted on X that the safety driver would leave by year-end. “The safety driver is just there for the first few months,” he wrote. In October, he repeated the timeline on another earnings call. In December, at an xAI hackathon, he said, “Unsupervised is pretty much solved.” AI, Roadster demos, and DOGE cuts missed targets In 2024, Elon replied to Logan Kilpatrick, developer advocate at Google AI Studio, on X. Logan asked, “How long until AGI?” Elon replied, “Next year.” Welp, AGI is still not here as of January 1st 2026. November brought another promise on The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan, podcast host, asked about the long-awaited Tesla Roadster, announced in 2017 with preorders taken. Elon said, “We’re getting close to demonstrating the prototype.” He said the demo would be unforgettable and hoped it would happen before year-end. No demo happened. The Roadster did not launch. He also talked about launching flying cars while mentioning Peter Thiel, his frenemy entrepreneur and investor. Clearly, no flying car has appeared. After Donald Trump won reelection, Elon famously took charge of DOGE, a new federal group, and vowed to cut $2 trillion in waste, fraud, and abuse. The number dropped to $1 trillion, then later fell to hundreds of billions.",OP-ED|Elon Musk|Tesla,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-02 02:30:55

The win followed months of attacks from executives and billionaire donors who tried to stop him and failed. Zohran entered office with a clear focus on working-class New Yorkers, rising living costs, and the role of big business in the city’s economy. Zohran was sworn in just after midnight at a decommissioned subway station beneath City Hall, placing his hand on a Quran as he took the oath right beside his wife, the First Lady Rama Duwaji. Zohran spent part of the night working inside his new office, and around midday, he returned to City Hall in a taxi cab for a public inauguration. Bernie Sanders, a United States senator and longtime mentor of Zohran, administered the oath again during the daytime ceremony. Zohran enters City Hall after Wall Street spends millions to stop him New York City executives and billionaire business figures spent more than $40 million trying to block his rise, but that effort clearly failed, forcing financial leaders to adjust to an administration they openly opposed. Billionaire hedge fund manager Billy Ackman spent about $2 million backing efforts to defeat him, but after Zohran won, Billy went on X and said :- “Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.” During his campaign, Zohran pledged to spend his first 100 days taking what he called “concrete and substantive actions” to address the cost-of-living crisis pushing residents out of the city. He also said he would confront “corporate greed.” Wall Street ally president Donald Trump warned during the race that federal funding could be cut if Zohran won. Donald also spoke publicly about sending National Guard troops to the city. After the election, Trump changed his tone and invited Zohran to the White House in November. The meeting ended without confrontation. “I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,” Trump said. Zohran faces legal limits though, cause he cannot raise taxes without approval from New York State lawmakers. Wall Street bets on AI continue as Zohran pushes economic pressure at home As Zohran prepares to govern, Wall Street remains locked into aggressive spending on AI, in spite of the blatant risks, with more than 60 financial institutions published outlooks showing near-universal confidence in AI. Fidelity International called it “the defining theme for equity markets” in 2026. The BlackRock Investment Institute said AI would continue to outweigh tariffs and traditional macro forces. NatWest described the technology as “a powerful engine of economic expansion.” BCA Research, which warned of a possible U.S. recession, stayed neutral on stocks because of heavy AI capital spending. JPMorgan Wealth Management framed the risk in blunt terms. “The biggest risk, to us, is not having exposure to this transformational technology,” the company said. Wall Street is also extremely concerned about geopolitics, trade barriers, and a weakening U.S. labor market, according to Bloomberg. Even with those risks, expectations remain for continued global growth. Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates many times next year, thanks to Trump’s expected appointment that will most likely force the central bank to lose its independent. “Regional policy shifts suggest a more supportive macro backdrop for global growth in 2026,” said State Street. “With an inflation trajectory trending lower, US policy rates likely to fall as the Fed takes stock of a softening labor market, and policy levers turning stimulative, we have a supportive environment for risk assets.” But Fidelity warned that:- “There is a disconnect between the positive short-term environment for risk assets, and a broader structural instability. Global fragmentation, a depreciating dollar, US Federal Reserve independence, and AI capex trends are themes to watch in 2026 and beyond.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This pivotal finding comes directly from comprehensive user data released by Dunamu, Upbit’s operator, providing an unprecedented look into the trading behaviors and demographic composition of one of the world’s most active crypto economies. The report not only highlights XRP’s sustained dominance over giants like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on the platform but also maps the evolving profile of the Korean crypto investor. XRP Secures the Top Spot on Upbit’s 2025 Trading Charts Dunamu’s annual data release offers a clear hierarchy of asset popularity. While the global crypto market often fixates on Bitcoin and Ethereum, Upbit’s user base demonstrated a distinct and powerful affinity for XRP. The asset consistently outperformed all others in trading volume on the exchange throughout 2025. Following XRP, the list of highly traded assets included Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), the stablecoin Tether (USDT), and Dogecoin (DOGE). This ranking underscores a unique market dynamic within South Korea, where local investor sentiment can significantly diverge from global trends. Analysts point to several factors for this phenomenon, including XRP’s established presence in the Korean market for many years, its utility in cross-border payments which resonates with a trade-heavy economy, and the specific community and trading culture that has developed around the asset on local exchanges. Upbit’s Expanding User Base and Demographic Breakdown The growth metrics within the report are equally significant. Upbit’s cumulative registered user base reached a staggering 13.26 million by the end of 2025. Crucially, the platform attracted 1.1 million new users during the year, indicating robust growth even in a market characterized by increasing regulatory clarity and maturation. A granular demographic analysis reveals a user base composed of 65.4% men and 34.6% women, a gender ratio that continues to narrow slowly compared to earlier years in the industry. The age distribution provides critical insight into the primary wealth-generating and investing cohorts in South Korea. Investors in their 30s formed the largest group at 28.7%, followed closely by those in their 40s (24.1%) and 20s (23.2%). This concentration in the 30-49 age range suggests cryptocurrency investing is now a mainstream financial activity for established professionals and mid-career individuals, not solely the domain of younger, retail speculators. Decoding the “Midnight Hour” and Global Trading Patterns One of the most intriguing data points concerns market activity timing. The analysis identified 12:00 a.m. UTC as the most active trading hour on Upbit. This time corresponds to 9:00 a.m. Korean Standard Time (KST). This pattern strongly indicates that a significant portion of daily trading activity begins at the opening of the traditional business day in South Korea, as investors and traders assess overnight movements in global markets and execute their daily strategies. Furthermore, this 9:00 a.m. KST activity spike occurs just as the trading day is ending in North America, creating a fascinating handover of liquidity and volatility between the world’s major economic zones. This data is invaluable for understanding global crypto market flows, as activity on a major exchange like Upbit can influence asset prices worldwide. The Ripple Effect: Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem The consistent high-volume trading of XRP on a major fiat on-ramp like Upbit has tangible effects beyond simple rankings. Firstly, it ensures deep liquidity for XRP/KRW (Korean Won) trading pairs, which benefits all traders through tighter bid-ask spreads and reduced slippage. Secondly, such sustained demand is a key metric watched by project developers, institutional analysts, and regulators. It signals real-world usage and investor confidence that is separate from speculative narratives driven by social media. For the broader South Korean market, Upbit’s growth to over 13 million users—in a country of approximately 51 million people—illustrates the profound penetration of digital asset platforms into the national financial fabric. This level of adoption inevitably shapes regulatory discussions and the development of future digital asset frameworks within the country. Conclusion The 2025 data from Upbit solidifies XRP’s remarkable position as the most traded cryptocurrency on South Korea’s leading exchange, a testament to its enduring appeal in a sophisticated and competitive market. The accompanying user statistics paint a picture of a maturing investor base, with millions of new users and a demographic shift toward prime-age professionals. Understanding these patterns—from the preferred asset to the precise hour of peak trading—provides an essential blueprint for comprehending the forces that drive one of the globe’s most influential cryptocurrency economies. As the digital asset landscape evolves, data-driven insights from major platforms like Upbit will remain crucial for mapping its true trajectory. FAQs Q1: Why was XRP the most traded cryptocurrency on Upbit in 2025? XRP’s top position is attributed to its long-standing presence and high liquidity in the South Korean market, its practical use case for efficient cross-border payments which aligns with Korea’s export-driven economy, and a strong, established local trading community that has developed over years. Q2: What does Upbit’s user growth say about crypto adoption in South Korea? Adding 1.1 million new users in 2025 to reach over 13 million total indicates that cryptocurrency trading is moving beyond early adopters and becoming a mainstream financial activity in South Korea, even amidst a maturing regulatory environment. Q3: What is the significance of the most active trading hour being 12:00 a.m. UTC (9:00 a.m. KST)? This pattern shows that a major wave of daily trading activity in Korea begins at the start of the local business day. Traders are likely reacting to overnight price action from other global markets, making this a key time for liquidity and volatility. Q4: How does the demographic data of Upbit users compare to global crypto trends? The high concentration of users in their 30s and 40s (over 52% combined) suggests crypto investing in Korea is particularly popular among mid-career professionals, which may differ from some Western markets that historically had a stronger skew toward younger investors in their 20s. Q5: Does high trading volume on Upbit influence XRP’s global price? Yes. As one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, especially for XRP/KRW trading pairs, sustained buying or selling pressure on Upbit can have a measurable impact on XRP’s price discovery and liquidity across all global markets.

The project’s official Medium announcement outlines a structured four-quarter plan beginning with service overhaul and culminating in global implementation, positioning BioPassport as a potential leader in the rapidly evolving intersection of healthcare and blockchain innovation. This strategic blueprint arrives during a period of increased institutional interest in health-focused cryptocurrency projects, with the global digital health market projected to reach $657 billion by 2025 according to Statista research. BioPassport Roadmap: A Quarter-by-Quarter Breakdown The BioPassport roadmap presents a meticulously planned progression through 2026, with each quarter dedicated to specific developmental milestones. The first quarter will focus on service overhaul and rebranding initiatives, potentially addressing user feedback and market positioning. Subsequently, the second quarter introduces the highly anticipated wellness tracker beta service alongside an AI coaching system, representing the project’s core technological innovation. This phased approach demonstrates strategic planning common among successful blockchain projects that prioritize foundational improvements before feature deployment. Industry analysts note that this structured timeline aligns with established product development methodologies in both health technology and blockchain sectors. The roadmap’s clarity provides transparency for BIOT token holders and potential users, addressing growing demands for accountability in cryptocurrency projects. Furthermore, the separation of service overhaul from feature launches suggests a commitment to stability before innovation, potentially reducing implementation risks that have plagued other health-tech blockchain initiatives. Wellness Tracker Beta and AI Coaching System Integration The centerpiece of BioPassport’s 2026 strategy involves the Q2 launch of its wellness tracker beta service coupled with an AI coaching system. This dual-component approach addresses two critical aspects of digital health: data collection and personalized interpretation. The wellness tracker will presumably collect various health metrics through potential integrations with wearable devices or manual input systems, while the AI coaching component aims to provide actionable insights based on this collected data. Technical Implementation and Market Context From a technical perspective, integrating AI coaching with blockchain-based health data presents both opportunities and challenges. The decentralized nature of blockchain offers potential advantages for data security and user control, addressing growing privacy concerns in digital health. However, implementing effective AI algorithms on decentralized networks requires sophisticated architecture that balances computational efficiency with distributed processing. BioPassport’s success may depend on how effectively it navigates these technical complexities while maintaining user-friendly interfaces. The market context for this development is particularly relevant, as the global wellness technology sector continues expanding rapidly. Research from Global Market Insights indicates the digital wellness market could surpass $1.5 trillion by 2030, with AI-powered health applications representing one of the fastest-growing segments. BioPassport’s timing appears strategically aligned with this growth trajectory, potentially positioning the project to capture market share as adoption increases. Ecosystem Expansion and Mainnet Development Strategy BioPassport’s third-quarter focus on ecosystem expansion and mainnet preparations represents a critical phase in the project’s evolution. Ecosystem development typically involves partnerships, integration opportunities, and community-building initiatives that extend a blockchain project’s utility beyond its core functionality. For a health-focused project like BioPassport, this might include collaborations with healthcare providers, fitness applications, research institutions, or insurance companies. The planned proprietary mainnet development signals BioPassport’s intention to transition from potentially relying on existing blockchain infrastructure to creating its own specialized network. This move, while resource-intensive, offers greater control over transaction speeds, fee structures, and governance models specifically tailored to health data applications. Historical data from similar blockchain migrations suggests that successful mainnet launches can significantly enhance token utility and project credibility when executed with adequate technical preparation and community communication. Global Implementation and Regulatory Considerations The fourth quarter’s global service support implementation represents both an ambitious goal and a complex challenge. Expanding health technology services across international borders involves navigating diverse regulatory frameworks, data protection laws, and cultural attitudes toward health data sharing. The European Union’s GDPR, United States’ HIPAA, and various Asian data protection regulations create a complex compliance landscape for health-focused blockchain projects. Strategic Positioning in Competitive Landscape BioPassport operates within a competitive landscape that includes established health technology companies, traditional healthcare providers developing digital solutions, and other blockchain projects targeting the health sector. The project’s differentiation may depend on several factors including the specific implementation of its wellness tracker, the sophistication of its AI coaching algorithms, the user experience design, and the actual utility of the BIOT token within the ecosystem. Successful navigation of this competitive environment will require both technical excellence and strategic market positioning. Furthermore, the broader cryptocurrency market context in 2026 will significantly influence BioPassport’s trajectory. Factors including regulatory developments, institutional adoption patterns, and overall market sentiment toward utility tokens will create the environmental conditions within which the project must execute its roadmap. The planned quarterly structure provides flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions while maintaining progress toward long-term objectives. Conclusion BioPassport’s 2026 roadmap presents a comprehensive vision for integrating blockchain technology with personal wellness tracking and AI-driven health coaching. The structured quarterly approach demonstrates strategic planning, while the specific milestones address both immediate product development and long-term ecosystem growth. The success of this BioPassport roadmap will depend on technical execution, regulatory navigation, market timing, and user adoption across its planned wellness tracker beta, AI coaching system, ecosystem expansion, and global implementation phases. As the digital health sector continues evolving, BioPassport’s ambitious plans position it as a project worth monitoring for both health technology enthusiasts and blockchain observers seeking practical applications of decentralized technology.

The problem comes mainly from Madagascar, an island where central bank governor Aivo Andrianarivelo said produces up to 20 tonnes of gold each year, worth literally $2.8 billion at current prices, yet almost none of it appears in official trade records. Madagascar targets gold smuggling networks draining state revenues Aivo said criminal groups involved in the gold trade operate with aircraft, helicopters, and advanced transport systems that allow metal to leave the country undetected. “The criminal gangs, they have aircraft, helicopters, very sophisticated means of transportation,” he said. “Our strategy is to reduce the gold trafficking business in Madagascar.” As Cryptopolitan extensively reported throughout 2025, gold rallied by more than 60 percent and crossed $4,300 per troy ounce, becoming one of the top 5 most-traded assets globally. In countries where mining happens outside formal systems, authorities link the trade to environmental destruction, polluted rivers, human trafficking, and funding for armed groups. Madagascar now joins a growing list of countries where central banks and finance ministries are running domestic buying programs to get back control of the market. According to Aico, they’re trying to pull small-scale miners into regulated markets by offering official purchase channels instead of leaving them dependent on smugglers. Buying programs spread as prices fuel illegal gold mining Countries including Ecuador, the Philippines, and Ghana are expanding similar schemes. David Tait, chief executive of the World Gold Council, said artisanal and small-scale miners produce up to 1,000 tonnes each year, with large volumes entering illegal trade. “It’s anybody’s guess how much gold goes to bad actors, but even if you take a guess at 50 percent, it is an enormous amount of money,” David said. Rising prices also increase criminal income and environmental damage. “It could be apocalyptic, it really could, a law of unintended consequences of a rally to $10,000,” David said. In Ghana, the government launched a centralized buying body called GoldBod in 2025 as mercury use and water pollution from mining turned into a political crisis. Officials say more than 60 percent of the country’s waterways are now contaminated due to mining tied to gold. In Ecuador, where drug gangs have shifted into mining for cash, the government is expanding a buying program launched in 2016. A new buying station is set to open in Zamora in January. Diego Patricio Tapia Encalada, head of investments and international settlements at the Central Bank of Ecuador, said fast payments attract miners. “The price is important because then we incentivise the miner not to go to other channels,” Diego said, adding that payments are made within 48 hours. For Madagascar, higher prices increase pressure to control a sector long beyond state reach. “One of the objectives is to make gold benefit Madagascar, and to legitimise the business,” Aivo said. “That is the main goal, to make it more transparent.” The central bank plans to raise reserves from one tonne to four tonnes, a target unchanged after a new government took power in October. The bank buys output from artisanal miners and ships it overseas for refining. The metal can then be sold for foreign currency or added to reserves. The potential impact is large. Despite widespread production, gold does not appear among Madagascar’s top recorded exports, which include vanilla, cloves, clothing, and nickel. Not all programs succeed. Marc Ummel, head of raw materials at SwissAid, said weak traceability has caused failures. “Most of them do not have good due diligence mechanisms,” Marc said, pointing to cases in Sudan and Ethiopia, where central banks bought illegally mined supply from the Tigray region. There are working models. In Mongolia, a buying program running for over 30 years helped eliminate mercury use because stations test for contamination. Enkhjin Atarbaatar, director general of financial markets at the Bank of Mongolia, said artisanal mining was widespread in the 1990s, but most production now comes from small or mid-sized firms. Selling gold remains a key source of foreign currency. As prices stay high, regulation grows harder. Diane Culillas, chief executive of Swiss Better Gold, said all output reaches markets regardless of legality. “The gold always finds its way to market,” she said. New tracing tools may help. Ecuador is testing isotope scanners to identify ore origins. “If you do this now, in 10 years there’ll be only tiny amounts of gold going in the bad guys’ directions,” David said .

This is a 60% drop from November’s $194.2 million, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield. PeckShield reported 26 major crypto exploits during the month, including a single address-poisoning scam that cost one user $50 million. This scam involves scammers using look-alike wallet addresses to trick victims into sending funds to the wrong destination. In most cases, the first and last four characters of the addresses match, with the attacker hoping that the victim will accidentally send funds to the fraudulent address by selecting the poisoned address from their transaction history without closely examining the entire string. PeckShield noted that another user lost approximately $27.3 million due to a private key leak in a multi-signature wallet hack. Although the decline in the total amount of stolen funds is a positive development, many industry experts caution that users must remain vigilant and exercise caution to protect themselves against common scams and cybersecurity threats. Bybit’s $1.4B hack highlights concentrated crypto losses The year 2025 was another challenging year for blockchain as centralized exchanges , DeFi protocols, and infrastructure providers, attackers siphoned an estimated $2.2 billion in the 10 largest incidents, roughly on par with the “nearly $2.2 billion” stolen in 2024, according to an analysis based on Chainalysis data previously reported. However, the damage was far more concentrated. While the sheer number of mid-tier exploits increased from the previous year, 2025 also saw the largest crypto theft ever recorded: Bybit’s $1.4 billion breach in February. The Dubai-based exchange suffered the largest crypto theft on record on Feb. 21, when attackers drained approximately 401,000 ETH , worth a staggering $1.4 billion at the time, from wallets tied to the platform. Onchain security firms reported that funds were drained from Safe-based multisig wallets across multiple networks, including Ethereum and Arbitrum, before being rapidly funneled through a network of newly created addresses. Trust Wallet and Flow hacks expose browser wallet risks According to PeckShield, the Christmas Trust Wallet hack, which resulted in the wallet being drained of $7 million in user funds, and the $3.9 million Flow protocol hack were two of the most significant attacks in December. The Trust Wallet exploit affected the wallet’s browser extension. Browser-based wallets are continuously connected to the internet, a design characteristic that can increase susceptibility to specific cybersecurity threats . Using a hardware wallet , an offline storage device similar to a USB drive, to store cryptocurrency private keys is widely regarded as one of the safest methods for storing digital assets. Users can also completely neutralize the threat of address posing scams by checking every character of the destination wallet’s address multiple times, rather than quickly glancing at it or selecting it from a transaction history list. Trust Wallet users impacted by a recent browser extension hack are facing new delays after the company confirmed that its Chrome extension has been temporarily taken down from the Chrome Web Store. This resulted in slowing the rollout of a key claims verification tool tied to the incident. Trust Wallet chief executive Eowyn Chen said the extension became unavailable after the company encountered a Chrome Web Store bug while attempting to release a new version.

56714729,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257931,1767324311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Liquidations Surge: Short Positions Dominate $19M in a Stunning 24-Hour Squeeze,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-short-position-liquidations-squeeze/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Liquidations Surge: Short Positions Dominate $19M in a Stunning 24-Hour Squeeze Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a significant derivatives shakeout on March 21, 2025, as leveraged short positions faced a brutal squeeze, resulting in over $38 million in total liquidations across major assets. The spotlight, however, fell squarely on Bitcoin, where a staggering $18.99 million was forcibly closed, with short sellers bearing 84.56% of the pain. This event highlights the intense volatility and high-stakes nature of the perpetual futures market, where rapid price movements can trigger cascading effects for over-leveraged traders. Bitcoin Liquidations Lead a Market-Wide Squeeze The data from the past 24 hours paints a clear picture of a market moving sharply against bearish bets. Perpetual futures, which are derivative contracts without an expiry date, use a funding rate mechanism to tether their price to the underlying spot market. When prices rise rapidly, traders who have borrowed assets to sell (shorting) face mounting losses. Consequently, exchanges automatically close their positions to prevent negative balances, a process known as liquidation. In this instance, Bitcoin’s price action triggered a cascade. The dominance of short-side liquidations at 84.56% strongly suggests a swift upward price movement caught a large cohort of traders off guard. This phenomenon, often called a ‘short squeeze,’ forces sellers to buy back the asset to close their positions, which can ironically fuel further price increases in the short term. Market analysts frequently monitor liquidation clusters as they can indicate local tops or bottoms and signal excessive leverage in the system. Ethereum and RIVER Follow the Volatile Trend While Bitcoin led the liquidation volume, other major cryptocurrencies experienced similar pressure. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, saw $10.55 million in positions liquidated. Notably, short positions comprised 66.7% of this total, indicating a correlated but less extreme squeeze compared to Bitcoin. The lower percentage suggests a more balanced mix of long and short positions were wiped out during ETH’s price movements. The data for RIVER, a prominent altcoin, further underscores the market-wide nature of the event. With $9.27 million liquidated and shorts making up 77.43% of the total, it followed the pattern set by Bitcoin. This synchronicity often points to a macro-level catalyst or a surge in overall market sentiment that impacts correlated assets. The following table summarizes the key liquidation data: Asset Total Liquidations Short Position % Long Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $18.99M 84.56% 15.44% Ethereum (ETH) $10.55M 66.70% 33.30% RIVER $9.27M 77.43% 22.57% This data, sourced from aggregated cryptocurrency derivatives tracking platforms, provides a snapshot of extreme market stress. Importantly, these figures represent only a portion of the global derivatives market, as they are compiled from major centralized exchanges that publicly report such data. Expert Analysis on Derivatives Market Mechanics According to common analysis from derivatives trading desks, events like these serve as a critical reminder of market mechanics. The high funding rates that often precede such squeezes make it expensive to hold short positions, creating a precarious setup. When the price finally breaks upward, the resulting liquidations act as a forced buying mechanism. Seasoned traders monitor metrics like the estimated leverage ratio and open interest to gauge market vulnerability. Historically, large-scale liquidation events have preceded both sustained trends and sharp reversals. For instance, the market downturn of 2022 was punctuated by several record-breaking liquidation days that accelerated downward momentum. Conversely, the bullish cycle of 2024 saw multiple short squeezes that propelled prices higher as stop-loss orders were triggered. The current event’s context within broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate expectations or institutional adoption flows, is essential for understanding its potential longer-term impact. The Ripple Effects of a Major Squeeze The immediate effect of such liquidations is a rapid reduction in market leverage and open interest. This can temporarily reduce volatility as overextended positions are cleared. However, the forced buying from short liquidations provides potent, albeit artificial, upward pressure on the spot price. Furthermore, these events often lead to increased volatility in the options market, as implied volatility spikes due to the sudden and dramatic price action. For the broader ecosystem, large liquidations highlight several key points: Risk Management Importance: They underscore the critical need for prudent leverage and stop-loss strategies. Market Sentiment Gauge: The skew toward short liquidations often reflects a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment, at least temporarily. Infrastructure Stress Test: Exchanges must handle the high volume of forced trades without system issues, testing their operational resilience. Ultimately, while dramatic, single-day liquidation events are a normal function of a mature, liquid derivatives market. They represent the transfer of capital from incorrect bets to those on the right side of the move, contributing to price discovery. Conclusion The 24-hour period ending March 21, 2025, delivered a powerful lesson in cryptocurrency market dynamics, with Bitcoin liquidations dominating headlines. The overwhelming dominance of short position liquidations, particularly for BTC, signals a pronounced squeeze that realigned leveraged positions with a shifting market reality. These events, while volatile, are integral to the derivatives landscape, serving to flush out excessive leverage and realign prices. Market participants will now watch closely to see if this liquidation flush establishes a new support level or merely punctuates a short-term correction, as the search for the next directional catalyst begins. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when short positions are liquidated? A1: Short position liquidation occurs when a trader who has borrowed and sold an asset, betting on a price decrease, is forced to buy it back at a higher price to close the position. This happens automatically by the exchange when the trader’s losses exceed their collateral, preventing a negative account balance. Q2: Why is a high percentage of short liquidations significant? A2: A high percentage, like Bitcoin’s 84.56%, strongly indicates a ‘short squeeze.’ This means the price moved up sharply, forcing many bearish traders out of their positions simultaneously. Their forced buying can create additional upward momentum in the price. Q3: Where does liquidation data come from? A3: Liquidation data is aggregated and reported by analytics platforms that track activity on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., Binance, Bybit, OKX). The data is a sample of the total market but is considered a reliable indicator of trends and extremes. Q4: How do liquidations affect the average cryptocurrency investor? A4: For spot investors not using leverage, the main impact is increased price volatility. Large liquidations can cause sharp, temporary price spikes or dips. They also signal where large clusters of stop-loss orders may be located, which technical analysts monitor. Q5: Are large liquidations a bearish or bullish signal? A5: It depends on the context. A squeeze of short positions (like this event) is immediately bullish as it involves forced buying. However, it can also indicate that excessive bullish leverage has built up, potentially setting the stage for a long liquidation event if the price reverses. Analysts view it as a sign of a market clearing excess, not a definitive long-term directional indicator.

The new Law on Virtual Assets came into force on January 1, 2026, establishing a legal framework for cryptocurrency mining, trading, and exchanges under strict oversight – but with significant restrictions that reflect Ashgabat’s cautious approach to digital assets. Shortly after this news was made public, reports from reliable sources confirmed that the new regulation had received the approval of Serdar Berdimuhamedow, the President of Turkmenistan. With this approval in place, virtual assets are categorized under civil law. It also creates a licensing system that the central bank effectively oversees. Turkmenistan amends its policy for crypto-related activities Turkmenistan’s recent move paves the way for a small but considerable chance for crypto-related activities in the country. Earlier, Turkmenistan was recognized for its isolation, tough capital controls, and stringent government regulations; hence, making a significant change with its decision to support crypto mining. Nonetheless, sources noted that the country’s decision raised controversy among individuals who wondered whether mining operations could be effectively carried out in a nation where the government closely tracks access to the internet. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Turkmenistan has always been one of the most isolated nations globally. This situation resulted from the government’s decision to implement stringent restrictions on sectors such as media, travel, and foreign investment. In an attempt to address its isolation status, the government began providing its citizens with electronic visas last year to simplify the process for foreigners’ visits. Now that the Central Asian country has adopted a decision to support crypto mining, analysts have commented that this move appears to be another carefully managed way to attract investment and technical skills to Turkmenistan without loosening political control. This situation prompted reports to contact officials in the country for their comments. Responding, they outlined this legislation as a move to modernize the economy, rather than as a means to establish a financial revolution. Notably, the licensing regulations, central bank oversight, and payment limitations enable the government to maintain full control over this sector. Regarding the new regulation , reports highlighted that this law appears to follow a trend of cautious change led by the government rather than true liberalization. Another discovery was that Turkmenistan’s economy heavily depends on the exportation of natural gas, with China positioning itself as a key client. Therefore, crypto mining offers a possible strategy to generate funds from extra energy resources. It also helps the nation diversify its income sources beyond hydrocarbons. While Turkmenistan decides to support crypto mining, reports from reliable sources have disclosed that Russia has begun making its regulations stricter, despite securing a ranking as one of the significant global centers for mining. Russia implements several changes to its mining activities A recent report noted that Moscow has decided to make changes to the country’s mining activities. Following this change, it was confirmed that the nation moved mining operations into formal, taxed systems. It also opted to restrict operations in areas encountering power shortages. According to this finding, sources noted that although Turkmenistan does not have an official collaboration with Russia and maintains a policy of permanent neutrality, the new regulation reflects a broader trend in Eurasia aimed at enhancing mining operations outside the US. However, even with this approach in place, the United States still positions itself as a leading option for significant industrial miners. In the meantime, analysts pointed out the existence of clear restrictions. According to their research, cryptocurrencies are not suitable for payments, exchanges will be heavily regulated, and the implementation of internet controls will be considered. As a result of these limitations, they predicted that Turkmenistan’s mining industry would expand at a slow and selective pace. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

56714826,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257930,1767324611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Market Bottom Remains Elusive, Warns Veteran Bloomberg Analyst",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-market-bottom-bloomberg-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Market Bottom Remains Elusive, Warns Veteran Bloomberg Analyst In a sobering assessment for cryptocurrency investors, a prominent Bloomberg Intelligence strategist has delivered a stark warning: Bitcoin has not yet reached its market bottom. Mike McGlone, a senior macro strategist with a long track record in commodity and market analysis, presented data suggesting the flagship digital asset may face further declines before establishing a true cyclical low. His analysis, shared in late 2024, hinges on a critical technical metric—the 50-week moving average—and its historical relationship with major market reversals. Understanding the Bitcoin Market Bottom Thesis Mike McGlone’s analysis provides a data-driven perspective on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Currently, Bitcoin trades at approximately a 13% discount to its 50-week moving average. This moving average smooths out price data over the past year, offering a benchmark for the asset’s medium-term trend. However, McGlone points to a concerning historical pattern. Notably, genuine market bottoms in Bitcoin’s volatile history have typically formed when the price plunged to a much steeper discount of around 55% below this key average. This discrepancy between the current 13% discount and the historical 55% benchmark forms the core of his caution. Consequently, the analysis implies that the present price level may not represent the ultimate low for this market cycle. The 50-week moving average itself acts as a dynamic support or resistance level, often reflecting broader market sentiment and institutional positioning. The Role of the 50-Week Moving Average in Crypto Analysis Technical analysts frequently use moving averages to identify trends and potential turning points. The 50-week period is particularly significant because it approximates a full trading year, filtering out short-term noise. When an asset’s price trades significantly below its long-term moving average, it often indicates oversold conditions or a sustained bear trend. For context, during previous major crypto winters, such as the 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 periods, Bitcoin’s price did indeed test levels far below this average. McGlone’s reference to a 55% discount is not arbitrary. It is derived from observing past capitulation events where panic selling exhausted itself. Therefore, his statement serves as a quantitative framework rather than mere speculation. It invites market participants to consider the depth of previous corrections. Furthermore, this analysis aligns with a macro perspective, considering factors like liquidity conditions and Federal Reserve policy, which Bloomberg Intelligence regularly monitors. Contextualizing McGlone’s Expertise and Market Impact Mike McGlone brings decades of experience in finance, having analyzed commodities and macro trends before focusing on crypto assets. His reports for Bloomberg Intelligence are widely cited for their data-centric approach. This specific analysis gains weight from his established methodology. The warning arrives amid a complex global economic backdrop, influencing risk assets like Bitcoin. Market reactions to such analyses are often mixed. Some traders view deep discounts as buying opportunities, while others see them as signals for further caution. The key takeaway is the emphasis on historical precedent. The table below illustrates how Bitcoin’s price interacted with its 50-week moving average during notable past bottoms: Period Approx. Price Discount to 50-Wk MA at Bottom Subsequent 12-Month Performance Q1 2019 ~50-60% Significant Recovery Q4 2022 ~40-50% Strong Rally Current Analysis (2024) ~13% To Be Determined This comparative view underscores the analyst’s central argument. Other market experts often monitor similar metrics, including the 200-day moving average and Mayer Multiple. However, the 50-week average provides a distinct, longer-term lens. Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The potential for further price discovery lower has implications beyond Bitcoin’s spot price. Firstly, mining economics could face renewed pressure if asset values decline while operational costs remain fixed. Secondly, the broader digital asset market, which often correlates with Bitcoin, may experience continued volatility. Thirdly, institutional adoption timelines could be influenced by prolonged market uncertainty. Nevertheless, it is crucial to frame this analysis within the context of Bitcoin’s inherent volatility and its history of robust recoveries. Past performance never guarantees future results, but it provides essential data. McGlone’s report does not predict an inevitable crash; instead, it highlights a risk parameter based on observable data. Market participants should consider multiple viewpoints and fundamental factors, including: On-chain activity: Metrics like network hash rate and active addresses. Regulatory developments: Clarity from major global jurisdictions. Macroeconomic factors: Interest rate trajectories and inflation data. Adoption catalysts: Such as spot ETF flows and institutional integration. Ultimately, analyses like McGlone’s contribute to a more informed market dialogue. They emphasize risk management and historical awareness over short-term sentiment. Conclusion Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone’s assessment presents a cautious, data-heavy perspective on the search for the Bitcoin market bottom. By comparing the current 13% discount to the 50-week moving average against historical norms near 55%, the analysis suggests the market may not have seen its lowest point yet. This viewpoint, grounded in technical analysis and historical precedent, serves as a critical reminder of the asset’s volatility. While not a definitive forecast, it underscores the importance of rigorous analysis and measured expectations for investors navigating the complex cryptocurrency landscape. The path to the next Bitcoin market bottom, therefore, remains a key focus for analysts and traders alike. FAQs Q1: What is a 50-week moving average? A 50-week moving average is a technical analysis tool that calculates the average closing price of an asset over the past 50 weeks. It smooths out short-term price fluctuations to reveal the underlying longer-term trend. Q2: Why does Mike McGlone believe a 55% discount signals a market bottom? His belief is based on historical observation. In previous major Bitcoin bear markets, the price has often found a durable bottom after falling approximately 55% below its 50-week moving average, indicating a point of maximum pessimism and selling exhaustion. Q3: Does this analysis mean Bitcoin’s price will definitely fall further? No. The analysis identifies a risk parameter based on history. It is not a certainty. Market conditions are unique each cycle, and new factors like institutional adoption can influence price action differently than in the past. Q4: How should a long-term investor interpret this warning? A long-term investor might view it as a reminder of Bitcoin’s volatility and a framework for understanding risk. It could inform dollar-cost averaging strategies or prompt a review of portfolio allocation, but it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Q5: Are other analysts using similar metrics to predict a Bitcoin market bottom? Yes. Many technical analysts monitor moving averages, including the 50-week and 200-day. Other metrics like the Mayer Multiple, stock-to-flow models, and on-chain realized price are also used to assess market cycles and potential bottoms.

This rally marks a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, reflecting renewed institutional confidence and shifting macroeconomic winds. Consequently, analysts are closely examining the drivers behind this ascent. Bitcoin Price Breaks Through Key Psychological Barrier The Bitcoin price crossing $89,000 represents a crucial technical and psychological achievement. Market data from Bitcoin World and other aggregators confirms sustained buying pressure. Historically, such round-number milestones often act as both targets and resistance levels. Therefore, this breakthrough suggests underlying strength in the current market cycle. Several immediate factors contributed to this price action. First, recent regulatory clarity in major economies has reduced uncertainty. Second, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows have shown consistent growth. Finally, broader macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluation concerns, are driving asset diversification. For instance, on-chain data reveals substantial accumulation by long-term holders. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Rally Drivers This cryptocurrency rally extends beyond simple speculation. A confluence of fundamental and technical drivers provides context. The adoption of blockchain technology by traditional finance accelerates. Moreover, the Bitcoin network’s hash rate continues to hit record highs, signaling robust security and miner commitment. The following table outlines key metrics surrounding this price event: Metric Detail Price $89,008.28 Primary Market Binance USDT Pair 24-Hour Volume Significantly Above Average Key Resistance Broken $88,500 – $89,000 Zone Market sentiment, as measured by established fear and greed indices, has shifted from neutral to greedy. However, this does not necessarily indicate an immediate top. Past cycles show sustained rallies can continue despite elevated sentiment readings. The current market structure differs markedly from the 2021 peak, featuring more mature infrastructure. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the role of institutional participation. Reports from firms like Fidelity and BlackRock highlight growing corporate treasury allocations. This institutional inflow creates a more stable price floor compared to previous retail-driven rallies. Experts point to the volatility compression observed in recent months as a precursor to this breakout. Furthermore, the macroeconomic landscape provides a tailwind. Central bank policies in 2024 and early 2025 have influenced capital flows. As a result, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a digital hedge, similar to gold. This narrative gains strength with each inflationary data release. The asset’s fixed supply stands in stark contrast to expansive monetary policies. Historical Context and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to $89,000 follows a predictable yet volatile path. The asset has weathered multiple 50%+ drawdowns since its inception. Each recovery has reached new all-time highs, reinforcing its long-term trend. The current price sits within a critical range that could determine the next macro phase. Network Fundamentals: Active addresses and settlement volume remain strong. Miner Health: Revenue is sufficient to support operations post-halving. Regulatory Environment: Clearer frameworks reduce systemic risk. Technological Development: Layer-2 solutions improve utility and scalability. Comparisons to traditional assets are inevitable. Bitcoin’s year-to-date performance often outpaces major indices. This relative strength attracts capital from other asset classes. However, correlations with equities can shift rapidly during risk-off events. Investors must monitor these dynamics closely. Conclusion The Bitcoin price achieving a valuation above $89,000 underscores its evolving role in global finance. This milestone results from improved fundamentals, institutional adoption, and a favorable macro climate. While volatility remains inherent, the trend indicates growing maturity for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Market participants will watch for a sustained close above this level to confirm the next leg of the bull market. The Bitcoin price action serves as a key barometer for digital asset health. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to rise above $89,000? A confluence of factors drove the rise, including sustained institutional ETF inflows, positive regulatory developments, and broader macroeconomic conditions encouraging asset diversification. Q2: Is the current Bitcoin price sustainable? While cryptocurrency prices are inherently volatile, analysts note stronger fundamentals now than in previous cycles, including robust network security and growing institutional adoption, which may provide more stability. Q3: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The $89,008.28 price represents a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency, surpassing its previous peak achieved in the 2024 cycle. Q4: What are the risks at this price level? Key risks include potential regulatory shifts, macroeconomic downturns affecting risk assets, and profit-taking by short-term holders which could increase selling pressure. Q5: Should investors consider buying Bitcoin at $89,000? Investment decisions should be based on individual risk tolerance, financial goals, and thorough research. Many advocates promote a long-term, dollar-cost averaging strategy regardless of price points.

He pointed to incidents like the major Cloudflare outage in November, emphasizing his commitment to finding ways to strengthen and stabilize online systems. Following these ongoing issues with internet infrastructure, Buterin shared an X post dated Thursday, January 1, arguing that Ethereum needs to put in extra effort to attain its goal of developing the world computer, which functions as a key infrastructure piece of a freer and open internet. Afterwards, he asserted that this strategy starts with DApps that carry out their activities without fraud, censorship, or interference from third parties. Ethereum’s co-founder also noted that DApps can be broadly utilized on the blockchain. Regarding his perspective, Buterin explained, “But there are applications where you won’t even notice if Cloudflare is down – or if all of Cloudflare gets hacked by North Korea. These are applications whose stability extends beyond the fluctuations of companies, ideologies, and political groups. They also protect your privacy. This applies to finance, identity, governance, and any other essential infrastructure people want to create.” Individuals raise concerns about recent outages The Cloudflare outage , which occurred on November 18, had a massive impact on the ecosystem. Reports from sources stated that the outage, which resulted from a software failure, impacted about 20% of the global network and the security company’s websites. The firm released a report explaining the event. In this report, Cloudflare disclosed that a “feature file” in its bot management system surpassed its designated limit during a cyberattack response. Consequently, the operations of several cryptocurrency platforms were significantly impacted. Another significant outage struck on October 20, 2025. It took place in Amazon Web Services (AWS). At this point, given the frequency of outages and their impact on the ecosystem, many firms became skeptical about the reliability of centralized internet services. To illustrate the intense nature of the situation, websites such as Coinbase , Blockchain.com, BitMEX, and Ledger experienced outages, primarily caused by third-party technical issues, which led to their offline status. In a manifesto released on November 11, 2025, Buterin, together with Ethereum Foundation researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa Posner, stated that, “Decentralization does not fade away through capture but rather through convenience,” adding that, “ it drifts—automatically and continuously—toward reliance on trust.” Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Ethereum’s co-founder frequently shares his perspective on the crypto industry and technology on social media platforms, via his blog, and other outlets. Concerning his recently shared idea, sources highlighted that Buterin proposed in early December that the crypto market requires a reliable on-chain gas futures market, which will enable users to be aware of what to expect regarding blockchain transaction fees. Cloudflare encounters a significant outage Apart from the November incident, Cloudflare exp er ienced another outage on December 5. Reports noted that this situation was made public after users worldwide reported difficulties in accessing Cloudflare’s services. This announcement sparked concerns among individuals and raised complaints, mainly on the social media platform X. Some of the websites impacted by this incident included online platforms such as Canva and Downdetector, as well as trading platforms like Groww and Zerodha. However, after some time, Zerodha reported that its Kite services were completely restored. The restoration was made public after an executive from Zerodha pointed out that the Cloudflare worldwide outage had been resolved and that Kite services were completely restored. With this news, the executive urged its users to continue their trading activities as normal and apologized for any inconvenience caused. In a statement, Cloudflare mentioned that it had resolved the problem with its dashboard related to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
