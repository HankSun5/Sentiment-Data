Whale Transactions Signal BlockDAG’s Unprecedented Growth & a Shift in Layer-1 Networks,https://thecoinrise.com/over-201m-raised-whale-transactions-signal-blockdags-unprecedented-growth-a-shift-in-layer-1-networks/,"The current landscape of digital currencies shows notable shifts. Bitcoin’s price experiences regular changes, causing liquidations and strategic moves by large financial entities. Regular individuals now seek clear direction. One project, BlockDAG (BDAG), draws attention as its presale surpasses $201 million, indicating strong interest. BlockDAG offers a different approach to network structures. It uses a parallel system for processing transactions, low fees, and a $30 million fund to encourage use. With upcoming listings on exchanges, people try to acquire BDAG at its presale price. BlockDAG’s technology is a key factor. The BlockDAG structure allows for simultaneous transaction handling. This removes slowdowns found in other networks. This feature is important for decentralized finance, non-fungible items, and high-speed trading. Why BlockDAG Attracts Attention Now Many seek stable assets in a changing market. Those who acquired BDAG early see a 2,380% increase in value. The opportunity remains available. Here is why the BlockDAG project is considered a strong digital asset option for 2025: $201 Million Presale and Ten Exchange Listings BlockDAG’s presale raised over $201 million. 18.7 billion BDAG units sold at $0.0248 each in batch 27. Demand remains high as ten major exchanges plan to list BDAG. These listings could increase BDAG’s value after its launch. The BlockDAG project has seen strong support. Parallel Processing For Better Scale Unlike other networks that slow down with high usage, BlockDAG uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for parallel processing. This improves speed. This makes it suitable for many uses, including decentralized finance and non-fungible items. The BlockDAG technology is designed for efficiency. March 2025 Test Network Launch BlockDAG’s test network will be available in March 2025. This is a step towards the main network. The test network includes: Rewards for those who help run the network early. Tools to watch the network’s performance. Testing for decentralized finance applications. Successful tests will increase confidence in BlockDAG. This could lead to higher presale prices. $30 Million Support Program A healthy community is important for any network. BlockDAG allocates $30 million for developers. Support ranges from $10,000 to $100,000. It supports: Web3 development. Decentralized finance applications. Non-fungible item markets. Business network solutions. BlockDAG also works with HackerEarth to bring developers through events. This helps the network grow. The BlockDAG team wants to encourage development. Large Entity Interest and Accumulation Large financial entities acquire BDAG. They see the potential of BlockDAG’s technology. This mirrors the early phases of other successful projects. These entities recognize the network’s design and upcoming listings. The BlockDAG presale sees large purchases. Could BDAG Reach $1 After Launch? With its current path, BlockDAG could see a price increase after exchange listings. Experts think BDAG could follow a pattern seen with other networks, possibly reaching $1. Factors that could drive this include: Exchange listings: This increases access and demand. Low initial value: This helps with price growth. Network growth: Support programs and events to help with use. Large entity purchases: They see the network’s advantages. The Presale Opportunity Nears Its End Those interested in BDAG should act quickly. Presale prices increase over time. Once exchange listings begin, prices will change. With over $201 million raised, a new network model, and a plan with key events, BlockDAG is more than a presale. It represents a change. The BlockDAG project shows a new direction. Will you acquire BDAG at presale prices or watch as it rises towards $1?

CZ says pitching tents with credible projects is a better investment strategy in the long term for investors in the space.# A Fortune Is Spent Investing In Shady Projects, Says Binance Founder CZ has taken swipes at “degen” activity in cryptocurrency circles following a string of high-profile rug pools. According to the Binance founder, investors are sinking in massive fortunes to clutch at quick rewards in the ecosystem. The Binance founder disclosed on X (formerly Twitter) that investors rarely recoup their funds in the pursuit of quick gains. Degens typically invest in low-cap tokens and memecoins, aping into leveraged positions without proper research. CZ advises investors to turn their gaze to “ethical teams” building projects for long-term growth, rather than short-term hype. Investors chasing trends and hype have lost a fortune in rug pulls, liquidity drains, and exit scams. The US SEC has disclosed that memecoins are not securities , urging investors to be wary of speculative investment in the asset class. “In crypto, too much money is spent chasing small, quick gains,” said CZ. “Focus on ethical teams that build for the long term. Big money is built slowly with stamina.” While the Binance founder did not expressly mention credible crypto projects, his comments allude to teams with established members and communities building projects with real utility. CZ Offers Suggestions on Tokenomics For Crypto Projects The Binance founder has offered suggestions for crypto project tokenomics designed to reduce rug pulls. According to CZ’s plan, only 10% of tokens will be unlocked while the remaining tokens will require the fulfillment of strict conditions before an unlock. Under the proposal, issuers will unlock new tokens after every six months with only 5% of tokens allowed to be unlocked. CZ’s tokenomics plan will rely on smart contracts to control the vesting schedule and third parties to hold the keys. CZ has since rolled out support for victims of BROCCOLI and TST memecoin crashes, raising over $1 million in cryptocurrencies. The Binance founder says that AI projects can leverage L1 and L2 blockchains to achieve efficiency and decentralization objectives.

However, only a handful of digital assets can deliver astronomical returns. For investors looking for the top crypto coins to invest in, three contenders stand out: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Celestia (TIA), and Terra Classic (LUNC). These projects cater to different market segments, offering varying levels of innovation, narrative, and investment potential. Whether it’s a meme coin revolutionizing storytelling, a blockchain redefining scalability, or a revived ecosystem driven by its community, each project presents an exciting prospect for investors in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Legendary Crypto Expedition Deep within the frozen tundras, where myths blur with reality, Arctic Pablo embarks on a journey that defies imagination. The fearless explorer ventures into uncharted territories, unearthing mystical $APC coins—tokens infused with the magic of forgotten lands. But this isn’t just a fantasy; it’s an investment opportunity. Unlike traditional meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin redefines the game by merging adventure, scarcity, and financial potential. Each presale phase corresponds to a new location, making investors feel on an exhilarating journey alongside Pablo. Arctic Pablo has arrived at ChillVille, the 13th stop in this epic expedition, where $APC is available at just $0.000070. With over $1.78 million already raised and a launch price of $0.008, early investors stand to gain an incredible 11,285.71% ROI. For instance, a $100 investment today would get 1,428,127 APCs, ballooning to $11,425.02 once Arctic Pablo reaches its final destination. But that’s not all—staking opportunities with a 66% APY ensure holders can multiply their tokens while awaiting the journey’s culmination. With a robust token burn mechanism, Arctic Pablo Coin continuously increases in scarcity, driving long-term value. Any unsold tokens are burned weekly during the presale, and all remaining supply will be incinerated post-launch. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), $APC accepts BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, SOL, and BNB, making it accessible to many investors. As Arctic Pablo continues his legendary voyage, investors can claim their own piece of the adventure. The question is: Are you ready to join the top crypto coins to invest before it’s too late? Celestia: The Future of Modular Blockchain Technology While Arctic Pablo Coin turns heads with its immersive storytelling, Celestia (TIA) is making waves in the blockchain world with its groundbreaking modular architecture. Unlike traditional monolithic blockchains, Celestia separates the consensus and data availability layers, allowing developers to build scalable and flexible blockchains without compromising security. Investors looking for the top crypto coins to invest in should keep an eye on Celestia, as it’s at the forefront of blockchain evolution. With partnerships growing and adoption increasing, TIA’s potential for explosive growth is undeniable. Celestia is positioned as a scalability, security, and efficiency leader as blockchain infrastructure expands. Terra Classic: The Community-Driven Comeback Story Terra Classic (LUNC) proves that a strong community can revive even the most battered projects. Once an empire in the stablecoin industry, Terra’s ecosystem suffered a catastrophic collapse. However, rather than fading into obscurity, LUNC has been reborn as a decentralized, community-driven network determined to restore its former glory. Recent improvements have strengthened Terra Classic’s transaction speeds, security, and utility, again making it a viable competitor in the DeFi space. With developers continuing to innovate and expand its ecosystem, LUNC is steadily climbing back up the ranks of crypto’s most resilient assets. For investors willing to bet on the power of community-driven projects, LUNC remains a solid contender. Its resurgence underscores the importance of decentralization, adaptability, and collective governance in shaping the future of blockchain. Conclusion: The Next Big Crypto Investments Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Celestia, and Terra Classic stand out as some of the top crypto coins to invest in 2025. Each offers distinct advantages, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) combines high ROI, narrative-driven investment, and a 66% APY staking program, making it the perfect choice for meme coin enthusiasts seeking substantial gains. Celestia (TIA) spearheads the modular blockchain revolution, providing the foundation for scalable, secure, high-performance blockchain applications.

The platform even confiscated proceeds from the market maker to compensate affected users of $GPS and $SHELL. Binance will reveal its compensation plan in the coming days According to Binance, it’s prepared to act against market makers that fail to comply with its policies, which became very clear with the latest incident. One of Binance’s market makers, a single market-making entity for the $GPS token, was found coincidingly participating in $SHELL’s market activities, violating the exchange’s policies. Thus, the crypto exchange quickly offboarded the market maker and even permanently banned any future market participation. Additionally, the exchange confiscated all the funds the market maker received from its non-compliant activities, saying that they would use the proceeds to pay back affected token $GPS and $SHELL token holders. However, the exchange has yet to disclose how all affected users will be properly compensated. Nevertheless, it said that it would release its compensation plan in the next few days, detailing eligibility criteria, distribution mechanisms and timelines. A Binance representative commented on the matter, saying, “Protecting our users and maintaining a fair trading environment remain our top priorities. This incident underscores our proactive approach to identifying and addressing misconduct, and we will continue to enhance our monitoring systems to prevent future breaches.” Binance even insisted that all its project market makers needed to comply with its rules, including providing bids and asks in tandem with the market size of each security, maintaining a stable spread for market activity as well as preventing market disruption from high-frequency order placement and cancellations. Binance revealed a new mechanism for listing and delisting despite GPS troubles at the time On Friday, the crypto exchange announced new listing and delisting rules, which included putting the entire process up for community vote. The exchange explained that users with more than 0.01 BNB will now be allowed to ‘Vote to List’ or ‘Vote to Delist’ the exchange’s tokens. However, the platform still reserves the right to choose the tokens being voted on. However, the GPS ecosystem was still under close observation at the time of the announcement. Just a few days after its listing, the GPS token was under the Monitoring tag, with the exchange concerned over its sudden price dips and what they thought to be intentional price manipulation. The exchange later discovered that a market maker caused the price drop when he quickly sold roughly 70 million tokens, siphoning about $5 million in liquidity from the market. The exchange even detailed that the market maker failed to place matching buy orders, thus contributing to losses for early traders. At the time, Binance only put the market maker’s account on hold.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has collected $2.5 million throughout its two-phased presale process which has managed to pull in more than 4,600 holders. The 75% adjustment level in Phase two indicates growing market demand because the token price will jump to $0.02 during its upcoming stage. Individuals who acquire Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens early during these presales will experience a 33% increase before the third phase begins while the tokens will list for $0.06 after the increase represents over 400% higher than the current value. Research analysts predict MUTM tokens will surpass $3.50 valuation by 2025 because of its distinct lending technology and built-in token distribution system. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum The second presale phase of MUTM by Mutuum Finance occurs at $0.015 price before the exchange listing phase starts with currently the lowest entry cost. Early contributors who participate in the presale will achieve a 400% profit once the project lists at $0.06 since this value has been incorporated into the tokenomics design. The urgency to invest in Mutuum Finance continues to grow since phase two shows almost full capacity and the project has already raised $2.5 million. The initial phase sold out at a rate which exceeded projections which demonstrated increasing market belief in the decentralized lending approach. Bringing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from conventional DeFi tokens becomes possible through its dual revenue structure. MUTM platform fees create an automatic system to repurchase MUTM tokens that distribute them to users with long-term stake positions. The flourishing demand cycle driven by this mechanism works to reduce temporary sales activities in addition to generating repetitive revenues that resemble established blue-chip protocols. The $100,000 presale giveaway for participants has elevated investor interest since ten investors will receive $10,000 each which simultaneously strengthens engagement with holders. Real-World Utility Driving Forecasts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its investment value based on concrete financial services operations rather than relying on meme coins or speculative assets. The platform allows users to put ETH or DAI cryptocurrencies as deposits which generates interest-bearing mtTokens. The tokens increase in value during periods of accumulation and users can utilize them both for swapping and DeFi transactions on different platforms. This fusion of liquidity and passive income enables users to benefit. Users applying for loans secure their transactions by providing assets comparable to the loan amount thus the system reduces default risk and maintains stability. Users will gain enhanced functionality through the forthcoming peer-to-peer lending tools that let them conduct swaps involving Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a flexible platform within an industry which many 때 criticizes for absent real-world use. The project implements an Overcollateralized stablecoin development alongside its ecosystem growth efforts which aim to establish itself against established platforms like Aave and Compound. Price Trajectory and Strategic Positioning Market analysts identify Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token distribution policies as the key factor behind its ongoing expansion. Liquidity incentives with staking rewards receive almost 40% of available tokens to maintain continuous user participation. Another 20% supports partnerships and exchange listings, critical for maintaining post-launch stability. Meme coins base their value solely on hype although MUTM provides investors with tangible plans instead of unproven expectations. The current market forecasts project MUTM tokens to hit $3.50 by 2025 thus creating a 23,233% boost in value from the initial presale cost. The platform’s revenue-sharing system generates these projections because token demand represents an initiating factor that correspond with user participation levels. People who purchase $2,500 worth of MUTM today would receive $60,000 when the price reaches $0.06 after the initial launch and could earn even greater returns because of growing adoption rates. The period to buy tokens at cheap rates is running out for investors. Phase 2 will soon reach its 75% completion mark as the platform shows similar frenetic behavior like phase 1 preceding the next price increase.

Web3Bay’s $1.6M Presale Takes Over the Crypto Spotlight!,https://thecoinrise.com/is-cardano-out-web3bays-1-6m-presale-takes-over-the-crypto-spotlight/,"Once a stalwart in the altcoin community, Cardano (ADA) has seen a marked decline in investor enthusiasm as its efforts to reach previous peaks falter. Amidst uncertain market conditions, ADA’s performance has been lackluster, prompting traders to seek out more promising opportunities elsewhere. In contrast, Web3Bay (3BAY) presale is attracting significant attention, drawing investors who are keen on securing growth opportunities slated for 2025. Having already amassed over $1.6 million, Web3Bay is establishing itself as a more stable and profitable investment compared to faltering options like Cardano. Challenges for Cardano as Investor Confidence Wanes Throughout 2025, ADA’s market behavior has not inspired investor confidence, with its current trading price pegged at $0.7405. The token has experienced a slight dip of 1.35% in the last day and a more notable 2.85% drop over the week. Looking at the past month, ADA’s minimal gain of 1.86% does little to alleviate concerns, especially given its 22.55% and 25.87% falls over the past three and six months, respectively. Despite a significant market cap of $27.82 billion, ADA is struggling to keep pace with newer, more agile blockchains, particularly in the rapidly expanding DeFi sector, where it has notably lagged in adoption and investor interest. Why Investors Are Drifting from Cardano to Web3Bay As Cardano flounders, many are redirecting their investments toward the burgeoning presale of Web3Bay, which has swiftly exceeded the $1.6 million mark. But why this shift? DeFi Hurdles for Cardano vs. Practical Applications of Web3Bay Cardano’s slow embrace of DeFi contrasts sharply with Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain, which have quickly capitalized on this sector. Cardano’s transaction volumes remain low, and adoption is sluggish. Conversely, Web3Bay is poised to disrupt the trillion-dollar e-commerce market by addressing issues like steep transaction fees, transparency, and data control. Web3Bay’s practical applications provide a solid basis for sustained growth, unlike ADA’s reliance on market speculations. Predictable Returns with Web3Bay Versus ADA’s Market Volatility Web3Bay’s structured presale model offers early investors low entry prices before its official launch, setting the stage for substantial future gains. This approach presents a more predictable growth path compared to the volatile swings of Cardano, which is heavily influenced by broader market sentiments. A More Secure Option in Unstable Times With ongoing instability in Bitcoin and broader markets, investors are increasingly allocating their capital to presale tokens like Web3Bay. These investments are less affected by immediate market volatility, providing a safer bet during downturns. This strategy is a key factor in the growing appeal of Web3Bay’s presale, even as ADA faces challenges in attracting new investment. Web3Bay’s Presale: A Prime Investment Prospect Despite general market volatility, Web3Bay’s successful presale, which has raised over $1.6 million and sold over 400 million tokens, highlights the shift towards assets with robust long-term prospects, as opposed to speculative bets like ADA. Web3Bay’s model, which leverages real-world applications for robust early-stage growth, distinguishes it from the challenges ADA faces with adoption and investor demand. Which Crypto Is Worth Your Investment? The struggles of Cardano in both price and innovation within the DeFi space have left many investors disillusioned, prompting them to explore superior alternatives. Web3Bay’s thriving presale represents a compelling investment choice, demonstrating the significant advantages of early-stage projects with tangible utility in the current market cycle. As Web3Bay continues its presale phase, investors are presented with a fleeting chance to participate at the most advantageous prices before the next uptick. The critical question now is whether you will capitalize on this opportunity or let it pass by.

This new development has ignited some reflection as both brothers ponder how they moved from intense regulatory scrutiny involving Gemini to where they are currently. Crypto Czar Engage Winklevoss Brothers Speaking on the matter, Crypto czar David Sacks acknowledged an earlier statement made by Cameron Winklevoss. “I think you said something earlier that I thought was really profound,” Sacks said. “You said that a year ago, you thought it would be more likely that you’d end up in jail than at the White House.” At first, Cameron clarified that Tyler made the statement. Then, he pointed out how they were surprised at how everything turned out with Gemini Earn. In his opinion, an attack was the last thing they expected from doing “the right thing for so many years and always trying to raise the bar with respect to regulations.” SEC Sues Gemini For Earn Program The Winklevoss brothers’ cryptocurrency exchange was under intense scrutiny a few years ago. It had to do with their Earn Program, which ordinarily allowed users to earn interest on their assets. All they had to do was lend the crypto assets to Genesis Global Capital, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG). However, the program turned negative when FTX imploded in 2022, and Gemini Earn users could not access their funds. It got worse when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued both Gemini and Genesis, citing that the Gemini Earn was an unregistered offering of securities. This allegedly violated securities laws. Amidst this, the Winklevoss twins had a fallout with Barry Silbert, the CEO of DCG. Where is Gemini Now? On the progress of the Gemini Earn Program, the crypto exchange has paid out $50 million settlement to compensate the investors. The resolution, announced by the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office, ensured the fund’s recovery. Moving beyond the lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny, the Winklevoss brothers took a significant step toward going public. The company confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) and enlisted financial giants Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to guide the process.

Institutional investors are offloading ETH, increasing downside risks. Ethereum Price Dives Below $2,000 as US NFP Tilts Markets Bearish Ethereum (ETH) experienced significant losses over the weekend as the highly anticipated White House Summit failed to lift market sentiment. Instead, the latest US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report dominated investor outlook, highlighting rising unemployment and increasing inflation pressures. As a result, ETH price tumbled below the psychological $2,000 level, trading as low as $1,998 on Binance on March 9, marking an 8% daily decline. The drop exceeded Bitcoin’s 4% losses within the same timeframe, signaling stronger bearish momentum within ETH spot markets. Ethereum Price Action The selling pressure has been exacerbated by mounting fears of further Federal Reserve tightening in response to rising inflation metrics. With investors now eyeing the next Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, ETH price could struggle to gain meaningful traction unless macroeconomic conditions shift favorably. BlackRock ETF Led Outflows with $11 Million Sell-off After US NFP Data Amid rising unemployment and inflation triggers, institutional investors are reallocating capital away from crypto markets toward fixed-income securities, driving bond yields higher across global markets. This shift in investor sentiment has translated into substantial outflows from Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock Spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF Flows, March 2025 | Source: SosoValue According to on-chain analytics provider SosoValue , Ethereum ETFs recorded $23 million in outflows on Friday, the same day the US NFP report was released. Among the largest liquidations, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF saw an $11 million capital flight, the highest single-day outflow among Ethereum-focused funds. The rapid outflows in Ethereum ETFs suggest that institutional investors are repositioning their portfolios in anticipation of further downside in crypto markets. If Ethereum ETF outflows continue into the coming week, ETH price could struggle to mount a sustained recovery. Ethereum Price Forecast: Death Cross Pattern Signals Deeper Decline Toward $1,850 Ethereum price forecast signals have taken a decisive bearish turn, with ETH plunging 8.3% on March 9 to test support near $2,000. The daily chart reveals a concerning technical setup, as ETH struggles below key moving averages, with a confirmed Death Cross between short-term EMAs signaling prolonged downside risks. If Ethereum closes below the critical $2,000 level, selling pressure could accelerate, targeting the next major support at $1,850, where historical demand has previously stabilized declines. Ethereum Price Forecast | ETHUSD The Bollinger Bands show ETH trading at the lower band, suggesting it is in oversold territory. However, the absence of a significant bullish reaction underscores weak buying momentum. The MACD histogram remains in deep negative territory, with its signal line widening against the MACD line—affirming that bearish momentum is strengthening rather than reversing. While a relief bounce cannot be ruled out, any recovery toward $2,250 or $2,433 would likely face intense resistance as sidelined sellers look to re-enter. The heightened leverage in derivatives markets could amplify price swings. If ETH loses $2,000 decisively, long liquidations may accelerate a cascade effect, making $1,850 the next crucial test for bulls. Conversely, a close above $2,200 could shift sentiment toward a bullish retracement. Ethereum Price Outlook: Key Levels to Watch This Week For Ethereum to break its bearish grip, ETF inflows must show signs of stabilization, particularly from major asset managers like BlackRock. If institutional demand returns, ETH could attempt to reclaim the $2,100 level and challenge the $2,250 resistance zone. On the flip side, if macroeconomic headwinds persist and ETF outflows accelerate, Ethereum risks dropping below $1,950, potentially testing lower support at $1,850. With US CPI data and Federal Reserve commentary on the horizon, traders should remain cautious, as Ethereum’s price action could see heightened volatility in response to broader market shifts. Overall, Ethereum remains vulnerable to further downside unless it reclaims key resistance levels and sees a resurgence in institutional demand.

The announcement was made following President Donald Trump’s White House Crypto Summit on March 7. “FIFA is very, very interested in developing a FIFA coin to do it from here, from America, and to conquer the 5 billion football fans in the world,” Infantino said. “If there is anyone here who wants to cooperate with FIFA, we are here with the United States and we will conquer the world of football with the FIFA coin.” While specific details or timelines regarding the potential FIFA token remain unclear, Infantino’s statements suggest the organization is exploring blockchain technology as a means of fan engagement and revenue generation. Related News: Analytics Company Shares Critical Level That Must Be Maintained To Avoid Aggressive Bitcoin Decline US President Donald Trump, who hosted the summit, responded enthusiastically to Infantino's statement. “This coin could end up being more valuable than FIFA. It could actually be a pretty big coin,” he said.

This article explores three coins with strong fundamentals that are poised for a significant rebound once this decline ends. Stay tuned to discover which digital assets are set to surge and make the most of this rare chance. Ethereum Faces Downturn Amid Bearish Pressures Ethereum saw a decline in its prices over the past month with a drop of nearly 19%. Over the last six months, the fall was around 8%, reflecting a steady bearish sentiment. The price volatility is evident as it has fluctuated within a range from approximately $1,766 to $3,021. The market has experienced a mix of pressures and minor recoveries, illustrating the coin’s sensitivity to broader trends and news. Indicators such as momentum and oscillator readings have been in negative territory, reinforcing the downward movement. Current levels present significant technical challenges with support around $1,294 and immediate resistance near $3,804. Bulls appear to be scarce with the RSI reading below 40 and negative momentum indicators, suggesting that bears control the market right now. Traders might consider strategies within these levels, watching closely for any sign of a reversal before testing the next resistance near $5,058. Jupiter’s Bearish Momentum and Key Levels in Play Jupiter has shown notable declines with a one-week drop of 26.40%, a one-month fall of 32.87%, and a six-month decrease of 24.54%. The performance over these periods highlights ongoing bearish pressure, indicating that the market has been challenged to regain strength recently. The coin currently trades between $0.57 and $1.01, with support at $0.38 and resistance at $1.26, nearing a second resistance at $1.71. Bearish indicators such as negative momentum and a low RSI of 33.44 suggest that sellers still dominate. A potential trading approach could involve seeking entries near the support level while monitoring the resistance for any breakout signals. Celestia Price Trends Ahead of Altcoin Season Last month showed a modest rally with a 13.63% increase, while the six-month outlook recorded a 22.09% drop. Price action over these periods reflects fluctuations that have tested investor sentiment and demonstrated recovery followed by noticeable corrections. Current trading sees Celestia oscillating between a price range of $2.83 and $4.89, with the nearest resistance at $5.71 and clear support identified at $1.57. The absence of a strong trend, along with bearish momentum indicated by the negative Awesome Oscillator and moving average recommendations, suggests cautious trading. Traders may consider buying on dips and targeting resistance while monitoring for potential directional shifts. Conclusion ETH , JUP , and TIA show great promise for growth. ETH, with its new updates, is attracting more developers. JUP’s unique features make it stand out. TIA’s innovation and tech advancements are impressive. As the market stabilizes, these coins are likely to gain significant value. Investors watching these assets may find rewarding opportunities ahead.

With thousands of digital assets out there, only a handful manage to capture attention and redefine what blockchain can do truly. While some projects fade into obscurity, others cement themselves as indispensable assets in the digital economy. So, which projects are making waves right now? One name that keeps showing up is Qubetics , the world’s first Web3 aggregator, currently leading one of the top crypto presales of the year. Alongside industry giants like Binance and Algorand, it’s proving that crypto isn’t just a passing trend—it’s a full-fledged alternative to traditional investments. Let’s break down how these projects have established themselves and why their momentum isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Qubetics: The Top Crypto Presale That’s Turning Heads Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, is transforming asset ownership by enabling interoperability in blockchain refers to the seamless exchange and utilization of assets, data, and functionalities across different networks without restrictions. With the top crypto presale already raising over $14.8 million, Qubetics has been gaining traction fast. Currently, in Stage 24, the presale price of $TICS tokens is currently $0.0976, with over 497 million tokens sold and 22,600+ holders already in. It’s solving a problem that most crypto buyers face—fragmentation. Right now, managing assets across multiple blockchains is a nightmare. Imagine having Bitcoin on one chain, Ethereum-based NFTs on another, and stablecoins locked in DeFi protocols. Switching between them is time-consuming, costly, and inefficient. Qubetics changes that with interoperability, meaning assets from different blockchains can be managed seamlessly in one place. Businesses can finally run cross-chain transactions without friction, professionals can manage crypto assets without hopping between wallets, and everyday users can trade effortlessly. Whether sending money across networks, bridging NFTs, or using DeFi tools across chains, Qubetics makes life easier. With price projections soaring—analysts eyeing $TICS at $0.25 by presale’s end (156% ROI), $1 post-presale (924% ROI), and $15 after mainnet launch (15,256% ROI)—the top crypto presale of the year isn’t just talk. It’s setting up to be a major player in the blockchain industry. Binance: The Undisputed Crypto Powerhouse Binance stands as one of the most influential entities in the cryptocurrency industry, recognized for both its market dominance and its adaptability in an evolving regulatory landscape. As one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, it has consistently catered to the growing demand for digital asset investments, offering a comprehensive suite of services, including spot trading, futures, staking, and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Beyond its trading functionalities, Binance has positioned itself as a cornerstone of blockchain innovation by supporting a vast array of crypto projects, providing staking incentives, and bridging the gap between decentralized and traditional finance. Its ability to navigate regulatory challenges while maintaining a strong presence in the market underscores its resilience and strategic foresight. Algorand: The Blockchain for Real-World Solutions Unlike many other crypto projects, Algorand has always been focused on bridging the gap between blockchain technology and real-world utility. Its pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) model offers high-speed transactions with minimal energy consumption, making it a favorite for projects that prioritize sustainability. Algorand has been gaining traction in sectors like digital identity, asset tokenization, and cross-border payments. Governments and institutions have taken note, with Algorand being chosen for major projects, including central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives. For those looking for a blockchain that can handle real-world applications with efficiency, Algorand continues to prove its worth. Final Thoughts: Why These Cryptos Are Worth Watching From Qubetics’ top crypto presale solving cross-chain issues to Binance’s market dominance and Algorand’s real-world adoption, these projects are solidifying their positions in the crypto world. While traditional investments still hold value, the rapid growth and innovation in blockchain technology make these digital assets impossible to ignore. For those keeping an eye on emerging projects, Qubetics’ presale isn’t just another crypto launch—it’s an evolution in blockchain interoperability. With a growing number of backers and analysts forecasting huge potential upside, missing out might not be an option. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics’ presale gaining so much attention? Qubetics’ top crypto presale is attracting buyers due to its unique interoperability features, making it easier to manage assets across multiple blockchains. How does Qubetics’ interoperability benefit users? Instead of juggling multiple wallets and networks, Qubetics allows users to seamlessly interact across different blockchains. Whether transferring tokens, staking, or trading, the process is faster, cheaper, and hassle-free. What makes Binance and Algorand stand out in the crypto world? Binance dominates as the largest crypto exchange, offering a vast ecosystem of trading, DeFi, and blockchain services.

At just past 7:00 pm ET, bitcoin had slumped to exactly $80,000, down 7% over the past 24 hours. The world's largest crypto did manage the most modest of bounces from there, trading at $80,700 at press time. Ether (ETH), solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) were lower by similar amounts, while cardano (ADA) and dogecoin (DOGE) had plunged closer to 12%. ""There could be a little disruption,"" said U.S. President Donald Trump in a Fox News appearance on Sunday when asked about the impact of his tariff and budget-cutting policies. ""If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective … we go by quarters,"" he continued. ""What we’re doing is building a foundation for the future."" Trump's comments were dubbed ""Volckering"" by some on social media — a reference to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Shortly after being appointed to the position by Jimmy Carter in 1979, Volcker moved to break the back of a decade-long inflation by jacking up short term rates to unheard of levels, knowing that by doing so, the U.S. would surely have to experience a brutal recession. By the time Volcker had finished tightening policy roughly 18 months later, the Fed funds rate had hit 20% and the economy indeed had gone through a difficult contraction. Inflation, however, was broken and the stage was set for growth throughout most of the following decade. In early Sunday evening action, U.S. stock index futures were lower by about 0.85% across the board.",Markets|Bitcoin|Breaking News,EN,0,0,BTC|ADA|DOGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-09 23:20:56
41403861,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689949,1741562652,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41403861.jpeg,"CZ criticizes short-term greed in crypto, urges focus on ethical, long-term growth",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cz-criticizes-short-term-greed-in-crypto/,"Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has criticized the short-term crypto investment culture, in which investors are driven by greed to accumulate wealth in short-term projects at the expense of ethical long-term projects. On his X page , CZ wrote, “Unpopular opinion: In crypto, too much money is spent chasing small, quick gains. Focus on ethical teams that build for the long term. Big money is built slowly with stamina.” CZ remarks point to the speculative nature of altcoins, which are not sustainable due to their instability and risk of market manipulation Chasing short-term gains harms crypto’s stability Cryptocurrency has historically been synonymous with making a fortune in a single night, and investors are attracted to it because it promises to make them wealthy quickly. CZ’s worries reflect a larger problem for the sector—the unpredictability of speculative assets. Excessive hype of projects by short-term traders also enables low-quality projects and mispricing of assets. However, when speculative bubbles burst, that can lead to market crashes, and investors are left holding the bag. In addition, the search for quick returns stifles actual blockchain innovation since purely concentrating on project hype provides zero solutions. This short-termism results in many promising projects never being able to realize their actual potential, hurting the credibility of the industry. The crypto landscape continues to evolve at a fast pace, and we have much to learn about the virtues of patience and the need for slow-burn development. To some, this industry’s tried-and-tested projects include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. These projects have withstood the test of time by sticking true to their fundamental missions and ensuring that they only focus on developments that make steady and meaningful progress. No wonder Bitcoin, the so-called digital gold, remains the first and the leading crypto game in town based on the nature of decentralization and the secured path network. This seems against the rampant market speculation, with institutional investors viewing Bitcoin as an increasingly certain store of value. Ethereum is also accepting long-term development. It moved on to Ethereum 2.0, which has a proof-of-stake model which increases the blockchain’s scalability and sustainability. Unlike others, however, Cardano was built on peer-reviewed research, meaning the team is focused on making gradual changes and improvements to the protocol instead of rushing headlong into radical improvements, some of which have the potential to compromise security and transparency. The future of success in crypto will have much less to do with price pumps and much more to do with building a unique society. Having a dependable society is more secure for investors as it results in a more sustainable long-term market. Investors supporting such initiatives can help construct the industry of the future, one sourced from technology rather than speculation. CZ’s message is a good reminder that crypto investing isn’t just about getting rich in the short term but creating sustainable returns — by keeping the key pillars of this industry, discipline, patience, and ethics, at the forefront of its daily operations. Short-term thinking risks undermining crypto’s future Long-term investment strategies have their virtues, but most investors cannot resist the volatility of crypto. The wild swings of digital currencies reveal the craving for quick profits, so speculative trading is one option for cashing in on price or market action. Almost every action with such advantages as high risk is characterized by tremendous market spin, scams, scrutiny from authorities, and emotional burnout. Most traders lose tremendously, even in a short-term trick. There are many scams and rug pulls, too, with some new projects providing “give-it-to-you” numbers to new investors and crashing when early investors do lockups. This destroys market confidence and affects mainstream adoption the most. In addition, states and regulatory authorities are currently facing this contemporary issue of speculative trading and have thus already legislated against such practices to combat market manipulation and protect the interests of retail traders. These incidents are symptomatic of the dangers of pursuing short-term growth at the cost of long-term sustainability. Today, the arguments over short- and long-term investment strategies lie at the heart of all crypto activity as the market matures. CZ’s perspective is “off the deep end,” and it advocates a beaten-down order of crypto investment. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Per a release from Japan’s top regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) , and a news report from the Japanese media outlet CoinPost , the government has approved a Cabinet decision to amend the Payment Services Act. Relaxed Rules for Crypto Brokerages, Stablecoin Issuers Tokyo has sent a bill to finalize the amendments to the National Diet. The Diet is all but certain to vote in favor of the amendments in the coming days. Japan proposes crypto tax cuts (55% 20%) and ETF approval under new reforms, aiming to become a global crypto hub. #Crypto #Japan https://t.co/9a6cw4LgFG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 6, 2025 In its history, the Japanese parliament has never voted against any crypto-related legal change approved by the Cabinet. And the Cabinet, in turn, has never rejected a legal change proposed by the FSA, which has something of a carte blanche when it comes to Japanese crypto regulatory matters. The bill will allow crypto companies to operate as “intermediary businesses.” That means that brokers will no longer need to apply for the same kind of permits that crypto exchanges and crypto wallet operators use. The bill also allows stablecoin issuers to enjoy more flexibility when it comes to the type of assets they can use to back their coins. Currently, Japanese firms need to match the amount of tokens they have in circulation 1:1 with cash deposits in regulated bank accounts. @FirstDigitalHQ announces a partnership with @Ledger Enterprise Tradelink to enable institutions to leverage $FDUSD for off-exchange settlements. #Stablecoin #Ledger https://t.co/XJe0IeER8W — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 7, 2025 The amendments will instead allow firms to use assets like certain Japanese and US government bonds instead. However, not all bonds will be eligible: The bill stipulates that only certain types of bonds can be used, including bonds with a remaining maturity of three months or less. Stablecoin issuers can also hold funds in fixed-term, high-interest bond accounts “that allow early cancellation.” Issuers will only be allowed to use bonds to back their coins by a maximum of 50%. The remainder will need to be held in current accounts.

This, CoinPost wrote, will “lower the barrier to entry.” To qualify for these new licensees, brokerages will have to prove that they do not directly handle any of their clients’ funds. Media reports claim that some of Japan’s biggest (and most crypto-keen) businesses are already eyeing brokerage operations. These include Mercari, SBI Securities, and Monex Securities.

Meme coins are among such assets. On-chain data from the blockchain analytics platform Dune reveals that meme tokens created using the Solana-based meme coins generator Pump.fun have declined to lows from September 2024. As of this writing, the total tokens launched on the meme token generator have dropped below 12,000. Pump.fun Tokens Down Since its debut in January 2024, Pump.fun has become a go-to platform to create meme coins on the Solana blockchain. This is mainly because the platform allows users to deploy meme tokens with minimal or zero programming language knowledge and technical expertise in creating and managing a cryptocurrency. According to Dune, the meme coin generator has birthed hundreds of thousands of meme tokens in just over a year. Pump.fun saw its peak number of created tokens in a single day on January 23rd when over 71,700 meme coins were launched. Notably, Pump.fun aided the creation of viral meme coins like TRUMP. Although TRUMP made waves shortly after its debut, it failed to garner attention weeks later. An earlier report shed light on how low the Trump-themed meme token has gone, dropping from being the second-largest meme coin by market cap ranking to a cataclysmic 82% decline from its all-time high. This unsustained long-term growth and other legal issues facing Pump.fun and its tokens have likely triggered users to refrain from using the platform. After the sudden mid-February crash of the Solana-based meme coin LIBRA tied to the Argentine president Javier Milei, Pump.fun saw reduced engagement in fees, users, and tokens generated. Way Back Up? It remains uncertain how Pump.fun will garner the attention and user engagement it once had. Still, crypto experts believe meme coin projects with sustainable utilities will weather the ongoing bearish trend. These utilities/use cases can include incorporating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized applications (dApps), artificial intelligence (AI) tools, etc., into their ecosystem.

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s value struggled throughout February, enduring significant downturns. On February 27, the cryptocurrency dropped steeply, falling below $78,000 for the first time in more than three months. Analysis of on-chain data suggests that the decrease was largely driven by sell-offs from “Bitcoin tourists”—newcomers to the trading scene. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $85,999 Market cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating supply 19,719,062 All-time high $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $86,224 24-hour low $85,783 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $85,999 Price Prediction $ 123,720 (46.23%) Fear & Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 4.86% Green Days 12/30 (40%) 50-Day SMA $ 98,051 200-Day SMA $ 82,082 14-Day RSI 25.03 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows a consolidation around $86K.

BTC Price Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $85,091, beginning a bearish trend to $81,008. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin uptoday? Following the overall buying sentiment, BTC price faced a buying demand and surged toward the high of $88K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs faced $275.83 million in net outflows on Feb. 27, 2025, pushing the week’s total net outflows to $2.71 billion. Bitcoin price prediction March 2025 February was the reddest month for Bitcoin since June 2022, when the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s performance was -37.28%. According to crypto data provider Santiment, Bitcoin whales and sharks have dumped ~6,813 coins since last week, which is the largest drop since last July. Will the BTC price recover in March 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $89,000 and be pushed further, at least $95,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $72,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction March 2025 $72,000 $89,000 $95,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October.

May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K.

BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum capture much of the attention, several lower-priced digital assets are making considerable progress and could experience substantial growth in 2025. Some of the best crypto projects to observe are still priced under $1 and are gaining traction due to key developments such as upgrades, partnerships, and increasing community support. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are among the top digital assets demonstrating strong potential to rise next year. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) The successful presale of BlockDAG (BDAG) has positioned this new project as one of the best crypto projects to monitor, appealing to those seeking an affordable digital asset. With a current price of $0.0248 in its current Batch 27, BDAG is gaining significant traction, raising over $201 million while distributing 18.7 billion coins. The BDAG price has jumped 2380% across its presale, and analysts predict a $1 valuation for this year. Those who participated in Batch 1 have seen a 2,380% return, highlighting the coin’s steady climb in value. Currently, in Batch 27, BDAG offers a 400% bonus on all BDAG purchases using the code BDAG800 . Its structured pricing model has consistently drawn attention, as each batch has marked an increase, rewarding early participants. With affordability and consistent growth, BDAG continues to be a digital asset under $1 worth considering, particularly for those tracking potential breakout assets. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) In early 2025, Grayscale introduced the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, providing institutional participants with an easier method to engage with DOGE. Frankenmuth Credit Union has expanded its services by adding Dogecoin, allowing customers to buy, sell, and manage it through online banking. Bitwise Asset Management has applied for a Dogecoin ETF with the U.S. SEC, aiming to simplify DOGE accessibility. At present, Dogecoin trades around $0.2057. Analyst Alon Mask sees $0.20 as a key support level and $0.315 as resistance, with potential for a breakout toward $1. 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at around $0.6507 and continues to be a strong player in the blockchain sector. Known for its research-driven development and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, Cardano is built for scalability and energy efficiency. Ongoing advancements in smart contracts and increasing adoption suggest steady long-term growth. With a dedicated development team and a large, engaged community, ADA remains one of the top digital assets to watch in 2025. Rising interest from major entities and its expanding real-world applications indicate a potential value increase soon. Cardano is often included in lists of the best crypto projects due to its strong tech. 4. Stellar (XLM) Stellar is gaining attention for its role in simplifying cross-border transactions and making money transfers faster and more affordable. Its network is widely used for remittances and financial services. XLM, priced at $0.343 with a 0.0295% increase, has shown resilience despite market fluctuations. Recognized as one of the best crypto projects to watch, Stellar continues to grow with support from banks and fintech firms. As demand for blockchain payments increases, its adoption could expand. With clearer regulations and institutional interest, XLM may see further gains, strengthening its position in global finance. Wrapping Up These four digital assets show strong growth potential, standing as key digital assets to watch in 2025 for those seeking accessible entry into the digital currency market without high costs. Dogecoin (DOGE) is aiming for a push toward $1 with growing institutional support. Cardano (ADA) remains strong with its advanced blockchain technology and rising adoption. Stellar (XLM) is expanding its role in cross-border payments, gaining traction in the financial sector. BlockDAG (BDAG), with its structured growth and accessible pricing, is gaining attention as a high-potential digital asset predicted to reach $1 this year. Unlike other coins facing market volatility, BDAG is set to see consistent growth in its presale and beyond—especially with analysts predicting a jump to $1 this year. Those who understand the market closely recognize these as the best crypto projects available today.

41405091,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689957,1741564920,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41405091.jpeg,Bitcoin crashes to $80k as Ether tumbles below $2k. How low can prices get?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-crashes-80k-ether-tumbles-below-2k/,"Bitcoin just collapsed to $80,000, wiping out over $200 billion from the crypto market in one of the worst single-day crashes over the past year, according to data from CoinGecko. Ether also crashed , tumbling below $2,000 to trade at $1,992, a level we haven’t seen in over six months. The sudden sell-off came after Donald Trump signed an Executive Order on Thursday, officially launching the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve—a decision you’d expect would boost prices, not tank them. Source: Jai Hamid/TradingView Friday’s White House Crypto Summit was set to be the big event, but Trump threw a curveball by announcing the reserve ahead of schedule. Traders were betting on a bullish rally, but instead, Bitcoin dropped from $90,000 to $85,000 within minutes of the announcement. The market reaction was brutal, with options traders unwinding long positions, volatility spiking, and put contracts gaining demand as traders scrambled to hedge against deeper downsides, per data from Coinglass. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve triggers sell-off instead of rally The Executive Order confirms the US government’s plan to stockpile Bitcoin, but there’s a catch—there’s no new funding for purchases yet. The initial reserves will be built using Bitcoin seized from criminal or civil asset forfeitures, which means no immediate demand pressure. Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, and Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, have been given the job of figuring out “budget-neutral” ways to add more Bitcoin to the reserve without costing taxpayers a dime. That wasn’t what traders wanted to hear. The market was looking for aggressive government buying, not just a relabeling of old holdings. With no sign of new demand, the sell-off gained momentum. As trading company QCP explained in its Friday Telegram note, risk reversals in the crypto market flipped, meaning traders started pricing in more downside risk than upside potential, which only made the crash worse. Recession fears and US debt crisis fuel the fire Meanwhile, the broader economic picture is looking worse by the day, and traders are bracing for a recession. The US is staring at a $9.2 trillion debt refinancing problem in 2025, with most of that debt maturing between January and June. The government needs lower interest rates—badly. The easiest way to get them? A recession. Over the last two months, the 10-year Treasury yield has dropped by 60 basis points, a sign that markets are pricing in economic trouble. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been working hard at spending cuts with a target of $2 trillion, but those guys aren’t working fast enough to fix the debt problem. President Donald Trump has been pushing for lower oil prices to fight inflation, even calling on OPEC to drop prices. But the fastest way to kill inflation? A recession that crushes demand. That’s why traders are keeping a close eye on the Atlanta Fed, which recently slashed its Q1 2025 GDP growth estimate to -2.8%, according to an analysis from The Kobeissi Letter. Markets have been expecting the Federal Reserve to cut rates at some point during the first half of 2025, but inflation keeps getting in the way. Source: Adam Kobeissi X/Twitter US consumer expectations for inflation just jumped to 6.0% over the next 12 months, the highest since May 2023. That’s the third straight month of rising inflation expectations—a problem for rate-cut hopes. Trump doesn’t even care about the stock market anymore. As Cryptopolitan reported on March 6, he said, “I’m not watching the market,” though during his first term, he was obsessed with it. That’s not just an offhand comment—it’s a message. Wall Street is on its own. Bitcoin braces for $75K as liquidation risks increase With Bitcoin now at $80,000, traders are already looking at the next danger zone—and it’s ugly. According to Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, things could get a lot worse before they get better. “An ugly start to the week. Looks like BTC will retest $78K. If it fails, $75K is next in the crosshairs. There are a lot of options open interest at $70K-$75K, and if we get into that range, it will be violent,” Arthur warned in a post on X. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data shows that Bitcoin exchange reserves are dropping rapidly, which means there is a potential supply shock—but right now, that doesn’t matter. When the market is in freefall, supply-side fundamentals take a backseat to sheer panic selling. But while most traders are running for the exits, President Nayib Bukele is buying the dip. El Salvador, which has been steadily accumulating Bitcoin, bought 5 more BTC today—up from its usual 1 BTC daily purchase. Only thing that’s gonna save these markets now is a rate cut, and the only way we’re gonna get that is through a recession. Buckle up, folks.

Based on thousands of simulated price paths, the forecast offers a range of possible outcomes that illuminate both potential gains and risks. According to the Results, Bitcoin Could Drop Below $51,000 with a 5% Chance According to MarktQuant, the simulation used a starting Bitcoin price of $82,655.52. The results show an average final price of $258,445.24 According to MarktQuant, the simulation used a starting Bitcoin price of $82,655.52. The results show an average final price of $258,445.24 ve bu da önemli bir potansiyel artışa işaret ediyor. Bununla birlikte, sonuç aralığı geniş olup, 5’lik yüzdelik dilim sonuç 51.430,23 dolara kadar olası bir düşüş öngörürken, 95’lik yüzdelik dilim sonuç Bitcoin’in 712.118,81 dolara kadar ulaştığını gösteriyor.

Amidst the complex signals from Ethereum (ETH) whale activity and the impressive 208% weekly surge of the Story (IP) Token, the market is a hotbed of activity. While Ethereum’s upcoming “Pectra” upgrade promises enhanced smart contract capabilities and Story Protocol’s strategic partnerships fuel the rise of its IP token, a newcomer is positioning itself as a top crypto to buy. Web3Bay (3BAY) is carving a niche with its innovative zero-fee e-commerce model, catching the eye of early investors with its presale, setting them on a path towards potentially game-changing gains in 2025. The allure of the 3BAY token’s affordable presale price offers significant financial advantages that are increasingly hard to overlook. Web3Bay: A Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 In the midst of Ethereum (ETH) whale activity’s cautionary tale and the robust ascent of the Story (IP) Token, Web3Bay is forging a promising path forward. The ongoing momentum of its presale is notable, with the 3BAY token already attracting $1.6 million through the sale of over 400 million tokens. The anticipated launch price of $0.1959 hints at a potential 3890% gain, presenting a substantial opportunity for swift movers. The zero-fee e-commerce marketplace that Web3Bay offers extends beyond just an enticing presale. By cutting out middlemen, it ensures a direct buyer-to-seller connection, enhancing transparency and reducing costs. Early backers of the 3BAY token can also enjoy a 5% discount on purchases, adding an extra layer of incentive. As Ethereum refines its upgrades and Story Protocol leverages its new partnerships, Web3Bay’s practical perks and clear financial benefits position it as a top crypto to buy in 2025. With plans for staking rewards, a shift towards DAO governance, and an upcoming NFT marketplace, Web3Bay is laying the groundwork for a comprehensive ecosystem. The limited-time presale price and the growing excitement surrounding the project suggest significant advantages for early participants. It’s this blend of immediate practical benefits, growth potential, and early entry perks that distinguishes Web3Bay in the bustling market. Ethereum (ETH) Whale Activity Suggests Market Watchfulness Ethereum is trading at $2,348.60, with current dynamics reflecting a cautious market stance. Significant Ethereum (ETH) whale transactions have led to $94.27 million existing spot ETFs, underscoring a wary attitude among major investors. This, combined with a 20% reduction in futures open interest, suggests a broader market retreat, impacting Ethereum’s price negatively. Despite this cautious market sentiment, Ethereum’s “Pectra” upgrade illustrates its enduring robustness. Operational on the Holesky testnet since February 24, 2025, it features 11 major improvements, such as EIP-7702, which enhances smart contract capabilities for wallets. Although initial tests have seen some hurdles, the forthcoming March 5, 2025, test on the Sepolia testnet is set to continue Ethereum’s steady developmental journey. Story (IP) Token Thrives Despite Market Downturn While Ethereum (ETH) whale activity indicates caution, Story (IP) Token emerges as a beacon of market defiance, surging 208% in the past week to $6.64. The growth of Story Protocol is driven by smart strategic moves, including collaborations with StabilityAI and acquiring rights through its Aria Protocol to BTS’s track “The Truth Untold.” Launched on February 13, 2025, its mainnet introduced innovative mechanisms for creators to tokenize and monetize their intellectual property effectively. While Ethereum grapples with its Pectra upgrade challenges, Story (IP) Token’s robust performance offers an attractive alternative, showing that strategic timing and smart partnerships can lead to substantial market gains. This dynamic underlines the importance of selecting the right crypto assets in a fluctuating market. In Summary Ethereum (ETH) whale activity may be signaling caution, while Story (IP) Token demonstrates growth through effective partnerships, but Web3Bay offers something uniquely compelling—a solid chance for substantial financial returns. With the 3BAY token priced at just $0.00524 and a potential launch price of $0.1959, early investors are well-positioned for a 3890% return. Web3Bay’s zero-fee marketplace, coupled with its strategic roadmap including staking rewards, DAO transition, and NFT integration, establishes it as a top crypto to buy in 2025 . Those who seize this opportunity now could be paving their way towards a significant financial transformation. In a market presenting mixed signals, Web3Bay’s distinct potential provides a clear and strategic choice for those aiming to maximize this year’s crypto opportunities.

The meme coin market has produced some of the most insane returns in crypto history, and right now, the three best new meme coins to invest in today are catching fire: BTFD Coin (BTFD) , Brett (BRETT), and SPX6900 (SPX). With new investors pouring into the market and meme coins outperforming traditional assets, the opportunity to jump in before prices explode is here. But while Brett and SPX6900 are solidifying their places as top-tier meme tokens, BTFD Coin is in its final presale stretch, offering investors a chance at a staggering 3650% ROI. The Bulls Squad is rallying, and those who move now will be locking in what could be the most lucrative play of 2025. Let’s explore the best new meme coins to invest in today. BTFD Coin – Bulls Squad Leads the Charge to a 3650% ROI Moonshot The final countdown has begun on one of the best new meme coins to invest in today, and those who get in on BTFD Coin’s presale at just $0.00016 are staring at the kind of return most traders only dream of. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement built around seizing market dips and turning them into generational wealth. More than 71 billion BTFD tokens have already been sold to over 11,300 investors, with a total of $6.27 million raised so far. BTFD’s Bulls Squad is leading the charge, proving that smart money doesn’t chase hype—it buys early, before the surge. The time to act is now because once this presale ends, the price will skyrocket to $0.0006, locking in an easy 275% gain for presale buyers before the $0.006 moon target potentially delivers that massive 3650% return. The Bulls Squad and Staking Rewards Joining the Bulls Squad isn’t just about buying tokens; it’s about maximizing returns. BTFD’s staking just went live at a 90% APY on December 2, meaning holders can compound their gains while waiting for the bull run. Unlike passive holding, staking ensures a continuous flow of rewards. Play-to-Earn Game – More Than Just a Token The BTFD P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, giving investors another way to earn while having fun. Play, win, and stack up BTFD tokens as you battle through levels, complete challenges, and boost your portfolio just by gaming. With in-game earnings seamlessly converted into real BTFD tokens, this project goes beyond the hype—it’s utility-driven, rewarding, and primed for mass adoption. Investment Breakdown – Why This Price Won’t Last At Stage 14, an investment of $1250 buys 7.81 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, that same investment is worth $4,687—an easy 275% gain. But when BTFD reaches its projected moon price of $0.006, that same $1250 investment turns into a massive $46,875. The opportunity is here with this best new meme coin to invest in today, but the presale is ending fast. Visit the BTFD presale site now, connect your wallet, and secure your tokens before prices surge! Brett (BRETT) – The People’s Meme Coin While BTFD is leading the presale race, Brett (BRETT) has carved its own path as a community-powered token. Launched as a spin-off from the Pepe ecosystem, Brett has cultivated a loyal following, making it one of the most discussed meme coins in 2025. Brett has seen whales accumulate massive holdings, pushing speculation that another leg up is on the horizon. It recently hit an all-time high of $2 billion in market cap, proving that meme coins are more than just a passing trend—they’re shaping up as serious investment plays. Whether it’s for speculation or community-driven growth, Brett continues to dominate the scene. SPX6900 (SPX) – The Unstoppable Meme Market Sensation SPX6900 is one of the most volatile yet exciting meme tokens in the game. Recently, its market cap soared past $570 million, fueled by its Coinbase listing and record-breaking trading volume. The appeal of SPX lies in its ability to tap into meme culture while offering serious liquidity and trading volume, something most meme coins struggle to maintain. As more investors shift toward meme coins with high speculation potential and exchange listings, SPX6900 remains a dominant force. Those who bet on it early have already seen incredible returns, making it one of the most talked-about meme tokens this year. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Before It’s Too Late If history has taught us anything, it’s that getting in early on high-potential meme coins is how life-changing returns are made. BTFD Coin is standing at the final presale stretch, and investors are rushing in before the price jumps.

Ordinals co-founder Casey Rodarmor noted that Bitcoin’s prestige and Solana’s speed could be the final nail in Ethereum’s coffin. Bitcoin and Solana Threaten Ethereum’s Rise While Ethereum’s recent decline has left investors in shock, the Ordinals co-founder Casey Rodarmor has proffered a theory for the asset. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Rodarmor disclosed that the duo of Bitcoin and Solana negatively affects Ethereum. Rodarmor says Bitcoin’s age and first-mover advantage gives it a keen advantage over Ethereum’s claim as “better money.” Conversely, Rodarmor says Solana is living up to its reputation as an ETH killer, improving on a range of metrics. “Ethereum is getting squeezed by Bitcoin and Solana,” said Rodarmor. “Ethereum has nowhere to go.” Rodarmor hinged Solana’s speed and scalability to its “centralization,” sparking a reaction from Solana cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko. Yakovenko downplayed Solana’s decentralization claims while pointing accusing fingers of centralization at Rodarmor. Bitcoin has enjoyed a streak of positives including the executive signing of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve while Solana is gearing up for a potential ETF approval. ETH Continues To Falter In Troubling Fashion Ethereum’s on-chain indicators are painting a sorry picture for the largest altcoin. After falling below $2,000, analysts say the possibility of ETH falling to $1,000 is highly likely. After losing over 6% over the day, the asset is trading at $2,045, triggering a resistance by investors to buy ETH. However, whales continue to scoop ETH at a discount while institutional interests inch forward. Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje attempted to rationalize Ethereum’s underperformance , citing a boatload of Layer 2 projects dumping the assets. For Cronje, a below-par user experience contributes to waning interest in Ethereum with rising competition from newer blockchains. Cronje shut down speculation that he could buy ETH, noting that the project’s roadmap and lack of clear representation are major stumbling blocks. “Hell, I don’t invest, but if I did, I would choose Solana, Tron, and XRP over ETH,” remarked Cronje.

The decentralized lending project has captured more than $2.5 million investment which attracted 4,600 token holders into its system that unites decentralized finance with tokenomic structures. Phase 2 has reached 75% completion and provides a shrinking opportunity for investors to buy tokens at the current market-low price which will quickly become important for immediate substantial ROI gains. Experts agree that the upcoming exchange listing will occur at $0.06 and this will generate instant 400% returns for investors. External forecasts indicate an astonishing rise of MUTM tokens to $3.50 during 2025 which spurs strategic investors to buy immediately. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has exceeded all initial market prediction levels because its presale program gives first adopters increased benefits. The opening phase reached its maximum capacity quickly and now during the present phase tokens cost $0.015. The approaching Phase 3 increase will double the existing pricing and makes unwillingness to participate increasingly perilous. New investors who join now will profit from the current $0.015 market value plus attain the future $0.06 per token price which represents a total four times better value than present pricing. The market experiences heightened pressure because of this multiple-level pricing system which adds a $100,000 worth of incentives for early investors. The current Phase 2 fundraise has brought in over $1.5 million while displaying a quickly rising level of investor agreement that failing to engage now will result in lost exceptional market possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers an appeal based on its buy-and-distribute model that allocates platform earnings for continuous perpetual token acquisitions. The mechanism of platform revenue purchase drives an ongoing support of mtToken stakers through continuous buying and caps potential selling activities. The protocol features integration between its lending features which let users stake ETH and DAI to obtain interest-bearing mtTokens. The collected value of these tokens grows steadily until they reach full value through passive operations that maintain decentralized assets while other tokens have no functional use. System stability emerges from borrowers who obtain loans through positions requiring more collateral than the requested amount which strengthens lender confidence. MUTM stands unique among DeFi assets because its combined earning potential and borrowing attributes create a valuable and scarce instrument. Post-Launch Trajectory Sparks Optimism The $0.06 initial listing price at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates immediate profitability opportunities but users already perceive MUTM as resembling established leaders in DeFi. The predictions for MUTM’s price growth to $3.50 in 2025 would generate a staggering 23,233% profit from its current presale value. Platform analysts base their overcollateralized stablecoin and peer-to-peer lending estimates on future MUTM platform development plans for niche assets and stablecoin releases. The value of MUTM depends on user growth and earned revenue since experts describe this presale foundation as “unusually robust” for projects at this development stage. The token builds credibility through stake rewards and adjustable interest rates and security audits and retains its path as a successor of established crypto projects by adopting transparent systems. Investors now have limited opportunity to take advantage of the Phase 2 pricing at $0.015. The time has arrived for investors to confirm their position ahead of the price increase since MUTM continues its upward trajectory. The official portal of Mutuum Finance currently awaits visitors who want to take part in the financing opportunity before upcoming market changes occur.

Currently, that standout is BlockDAG (BDAG) , which has accumulated $201 million across 27 presale batches, marking a 2,380% price increase from its initial batch. With rising scrutiny in the crypto space, security concerns often accompany new projects. BlockDAG is proactively addressing this by undergoing rigorous audits by two well-known firms—Halborn and Certik. But what sets BlockDAG apart, making analysts project a potential 30,000x ROI? Let’s dive in. Advancing Crypto with DAG and Hybrid PoW Technology BlockDAG brings a fresh approach to blockchain technology with its DAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchain structures, which process blocks in a linear sequence, DAG’s framework allows each block to link to multiple previous ones. This structure improves scalability by permitting multiple validators to add blocks simultaneously, enhancing the system’s efficiency. Another significant feature is BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. This method further boosts scalability by optimizing transaction validation. The system currently supports a speed of 10 blocks per second, with the capability to scale beyond 100 blocks per second in future updates. Halborn Audit Confirms BlockDAG’s Strong Security Framework BlockDAG is not just about speed and scalability—it places significant importance on security. To ensure the network’s resilience against threats, BlockDAG has implemented a layered security strategy. This began with an internal assessment, followed by a comprehensive review by two of the most recognized auditing firms, Halborn and Certik. Halborn was the first to conduct an extensive evaluation, focusing on BlockDAG’s smart contracts and infrastructure. Once the findings were reviewed, BlockDAG swiftly addressed any identified areas of improvement, strengthening its security. Halborn’s audit report is accessible to the public, reinforcing the project’s commitment to transparency. Following this, Certik was engaged to conduct a secondary audit, ensuring an even more rigorous assessment. While this process is ongoing, the additional evaluation further solidifies BlockDAG’s security measures. As the final step in its security initiative, BlockDAG plans to launch a bug bounty program in collaboration with HackerOne. Security is a continuous process, and BlockDAG remains committed to maintaining and improving its protective measures as it moves toward its mainnet launch this year. BlockDAG’s Presale Gains Momentum— Is 30,000x ROI Achievable? With its advanced technology and structured security measures, BlockDAG’s presale success is not by chance—it is a result of calculated planning and execution. Crypto buyers are capitalizing on the potential, rapidly acquiring BDAG coins. Over 18.6 billion coins have been sold, raising $201 million in presale. Currently, in its 27th batch, BlockDAG is priced at $0.0248. Those who purchased BDAG early in batch one have already witnessed a 2,380% return. Experts anticipate that once the mainnet launches this year, BDAG’s price could reach $1, reflecting strong confidence in the project. Given its current price momentum, extensive security framework, and exceptional scalability, the possibility of achieving a 30,000x ROI appears within reach. For those looking to accumulate a promising digital asset in 2025, BlockDAG presents a compelling opportunity. Long Story Short! BlockDAG is making strides in security and scalability, pushing the boundaries of what blockchain can achieve. With its ability to process 10 blocks per second and plans to scale beyond 100 blocks, it offers a powerful framework for long-term growth. Alongside its scalability, BlockDAG has placed security at the forefront, undergoing thorough evaluations from respected audit firms. Taking a proactive approach to vulnerability assessments ensures ongoing protection and reliability. Beyond technical achievements, BlockDAG’s crypto presale has drawn immense interest, reaching $201 million in sales. Analysts predict that once the mainnet goes live, BDAG could reach $1, setting the stage for long-term success. The potential for a 30,000x ROI remains an enticing possibility, making BlockDAG a project worth following closely before it gains mainstream traction.

Despite strong bullish factors over the past week, its recent price movement is far from the high expectations set by analysts following the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Bitcoin Drops Over 6% Bitcoin is currently trading at $80,909, down over 6% in the past day. Bitcoin has dropped 3.37% over the past week, with trading volumes down 53%. Despite the declining figures, Bitcoin whales are actively buying, accumulating more than 22,000 BTC in just three days. Whales have bought over 22,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/gVuFsijOqt — Ali (@ali_charts) March 9, 2025 Despite a week full of positive news, including the signing of an executive order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a Crypto Summit at the White House, and encouraging statements from the OCC, Bitcoin’s price is unexpectedly falling and could drop below $80K. The Out-of-sync Price Action! On March 7, President Trump signed an executive order to use seized Bitcoin rather than purchasing it from the market. This move caused Bitcoin’s price to drop over 6%, from $90,400 to $84,979. “The knee-jerk reaction lower likely stems from the realization that no actual budget has been allocated for BTC purchases in the near term,” QCP Capital shared in a recent note . However, it also noted that while this wasn’t the bullish catalyst as many expected, it’s still positive for crypto. The risk of random Silkroad BTC sales disrupting the market is gone, and the U.S. government has reaffirmed its commitment to a long-term crypto strategy, it noted. An analyst expressed surprise, saying that in his 8 years with Bitcoin, he never saw the price action so out of sync with the news. This week was one of the most bullish in Bitcoin’s history, yet the market is facing decline. What is Causing The Drop? Several factors are behind Bitcoin’s recent price drop. Macroeconomic issues, like new tariffs from the US, have sparked sell-offs in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Besides, the release of the non-farm payrolls (NFP) report on Friday suggests that the Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy, which could hurt Bitcoin’s price. Experts noted that while the executive order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the Crypto Summit were positive, the lack of concrete policies might have cooled investor enthusiasm. Besides, Bitcoin’s decline is also dragging altcoins down, with ETH, XRP, and BNB losing over 6%, 6% and 4% respectively in the last 24 hours.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-10 02:30:44

In the past 24 hours, the market downturn caused $616 million in liquidations, with long positions taking the biggest hit at $540 million. Bitcoin alone saw $231 million in losses. Trump Says There Might Be Some Disruption In his Fox News appearance on Sunday, President Donald Trump addressed the potential effects of his policies, including tariffs and budget cuts. When asked about the impact, he acknowledged that there could be some short-term disruptions but emphasized the long-term vision behind his approach. “There might be some disruption. China has a 100-year plan, while we focus on quarterly results. What we’re doing is laying the groundwork for the future,” he said. Trump’s Approach Compared To Former Fed Chair’s Trump’s comments were dubbed “Volckering” on social media, likening his approach to that of former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in the 1980s. Volcker raised interest rates to extreme levels to combat persistent inflation, fully aware that it would trigger harsh recession. His tough measures eventually broke inflation and set the stage for long-term economic growth. The comparison suggests that Trump’s policies, while disruptive now, could have long-term benefits. The recent decline in Bitcoin comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China are set to worsen on Monday, with Beijing imposing tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods in response to President Trump’s latest import hike.

David Sacks, appointed as 'Crypto & AI Czar,' divested from Bitwise's Crypto Index Fund to avoid conflicts of interest, fueling speculation about the government's crypto reserve plans. Despite initial speculation, the exact cryptocurrencies included in the reserve were Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple XRP, Solana, and Cardano, leading to mixed investment outcomes. The executive order restricts the government from significantly impacting the Bitcoin market and mandates budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional BTC. This has led to a let-down of expectations, which may fuel further short-term losses in the crypto market, but may be a positive in the long run. Introduction Over the last few months, politics have caused volatility to rise . This is especially true over the last two weeks. Much of this volatility has to do with the uncertainty around certain assets that were caught up in the 'Trump Trade,' or assets that were popular with now-President Trump on his campaign trail. Bitcoin was a large part of the Trump Trade. On the campaign trail, in late September 2024, Trump posted: X (Twitter) The world began to speculate on what cryptocurrencies would make the list for this kind of project, and who would decide its form. The Crypto Czar Skip to December 2024 with the appointment of David Sacks as 'Crypto & AI Czar,' or the lead advisor to the President on matters of cryptocurrencies and AI. Sacks is notable for a few things, like being one of the founders of PayPal ( PYPL ). Also notable is that since 2017, he has been running a venture capital firm called Craft Ventures. It, alongside Sacks himself, were first-round investors in Bitwise's Crypto Index Fund (BITW), (that I gave a sell rating to recently), which now trades on the OTC market. It is an actively managed fund diversified across several cryptocurrencies. Sacks and his firm invested in 2017 in this fund when it was a private vehicle. Craft Ventures and Sacks have both divested from the Bitwise fund since January 2025, presumably before President Trump was inaugurated, to avoid conflicts of interest. This fueled speculation that the government really would go through with a crypto reserve fund, and that Sacks was needing to divest from this exactly because he would be doing activities that would promote them in his new role as Crypto Czar. Craft Ventures Possible Inclusions Looking at Bitwise's fund, we can identify what assets Sacks may advise a crypto stockpile to invest in; we are effectively looking at what he was invested in with his own money. Here are all the holdings above 1% NAV in BITW. Bitwise Immediate suspects for a digital asset stockpile are Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Ripple XRP ( XRP-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), and Cardano ( ADA-USD ). These are not necessarily the top cryptocurrencies by market weight, for the record. I discuss that further in my article on BITW , but I won't go into any further for our purposes here. What's important to note from this is that speculators have been buying up these cryptocurrencies in advance of several key announcements post-inauguration that would boost these assets. The 1st Batch of Executive Orders Skip to January 2025, when President Trump is in office. He signs two executive orders, one creating a US Sovereign Wealth Fund ('SWF'), and another creating a committee to work on a 'digital asset stockpile.' In an article I published last month , I discussed the potential for a positive price impact on Bitcoin from this move, and other cryptocurrencies that are added to the stockpile. Specifically, I speculated: I wouldn't put it far off for a US-based SWF with this current administration to tangle itself up with [ this order ] and help with establishing said stockpile. The US already has significant Bitcoin reserves, which it has seized from criminals. While the US has already auctioned off and returned much of its reserves, the government still has over 100,000 BTC in its possession, which represents over $9B in assets. To make this more substantial as a strategic reserve, it would stand to reason that the government, either through the SWF or through the treasury directly, would buy Bitcoin. Since then, we've gotten more clarity on what digital assets would be included, dissipating much of the speculation surrounding Sacks and Bitwise. On March 2nd, President Trump posted about the exact currencies that would be in the reserve: Truth Social Since Sacks was confirmed in December, if you had picked up on the investment in BITW (I did not, for the record), the various cryptocurrencies have been mixed. This has been disappointing for investors. Data by YCharts It was interesting to see it play out, as President Trump's messages named the exact top five holdings of BITW. Yet, despite the spike from the initial rush after the post on March 2nd, the assets are still relatively depressed. The 2nd Batch of Executive Orders On March 6th, President Donald Trump signed a follow-up executive order to the order that established a Digital Asset Stockpile committee. It was now time for that committee to act. The order was titled: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE AND UNITED STATES DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE Here is what the order authorizes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to do: ...establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"" capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings... ...establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the ""United States Digital Asset Stockpile,"" capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings... ...develop strategies for acquiring additional Government BTC provided that such strategies are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers. However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. Immediately, I understand why all the hype is gone. The specific wording of the act essentially orders the Treasury Secretary to collect all the Bitcoin and other assets already owned by the US in its stockpiles of seized assets and rename it into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This explicitly does not authorize the purchase of any Bitcoin at all. It does do something, which is that it stops the sale of any more Bitcoin or other assets out of the US accounts, which were previously being auctioned. It should be of note that basically all financial assets seized by the government end up at auction, to allow the government to recoup some money from criminal activities that they seized the assets from. This order disallows future auctions of seized Bitcoin, leaving the government's approximately $9B stockpile stagnant. The order only authorizes the assets to come from particular channels; seizures and forfeiture. This is in no way is what the market expected. The initial narrative had been all about the US investing in cryptocurrencies, not necessarily just holding on to existing stores. This was a neutered version of what was expected, and has not corrected the downturn since the highs of late January. Digital Asset Summit Fast-forward to the most recent update, on March 7th, where President Trump was speaking at the White House Digital Asset Summit, put together by David Sacks, the Crypto & AI Czar. Not much of substance pertaining to the fund itself was mentioned, but here are some of the main points President Trump and his cabinet made at the address: The US government will stop all sales of crypto assets, in favor of holding them instead. This will be funded through the existing stockpile. The Treasury will work toward deregulating cryptocurrency more broadly. They are primarily concerned with stable coins. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will not be at the cost of taxpayers. None of this seemed particularly bullish for the price of the coins, and definitely not for the alt-coins mentioned earlier, like SOL and ADA. Ultimately, I see this as being bullish for cryptocurrency-based business more than anything. The biggest winner at the summit was not someone who spoke, but someone who was there: Brian Armstrong. He is the CEO of Coinbase ( COIN ), one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. He remarked : [Emerging regulatory clarity] is directly translating to economic growth in the U.S. For instance, Coinbase plans to hire about 1,000 employees in the U.S. this year as a result of this renewed growth. The more normalized crypto is within financial markets, and the easier it is to do business in crypto, the more money exchanges like COIN make. This may not impact the price of Bitcoin very much, which is largely dictated by speculation and less by fundamentals like how much traffic the network sees or how much money is tied up on exchanges. Conclusion Ultimately, it looks a little foolish in hindsight to have bet on the government, being as irresponsible as to speculate on cryptocurrencies through direct investments. Instead, the cryptocurrency market has fallen despite all the news and buzz around the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It seems that this wasn't the play, at least not in the short term, despite the positive backing from the new administration. For now, it seems like the best investment is to stay with Bitcoin alone or to invest in Bitcoin-adjacent companies like Coinbase, who will benefit from the new regulatory environment, and to ignore the noise from politics. While initially promising, the ideas that were presented on the campaign trail have not resulted in the paradigm shift that many investors were pricing in back in January. For this reason, I would not advise betting on the proposed alt-coins for the Digital Asset Stockpile. They are unlikely to see any market influence from this move by the government. It's now more clear from the latest developments that the administration is not coming to buy anything from the marketplace, and is not going to put any positive pressure on the cryptocurrency market. While the lack of US government auctions may be a positive for markets, since it reduces supply, it may not be enough to deeply influence the crypto market. These coins may continue to fall despite positive developments toward this project. Currently, I am getting my Bitcoin exposure through MAXI . I am still long Bitcoin, but I have limited my exposure and monitor it closely. I suggest investors do the same at the current moment.
