Whale Transactions Signal BlockDAG’s Unprecedented Growth & a Shift in Layer-1 Networks,https://thecoinrise.com/over-201m-raised-whale-transactions-signal-blockdags-unprecedented-growth-a-shift-in-layer-1-networks/,"The current landscape of digital currencies shows notable shifts. Bitcoin’s price experiences regular changes, causing liquidations and strategic moves by large financial entities. Regular individuals now seek clear direction. One project, BlockDAG (BDAG), draws attention as its presale surpasses $201 million, indicating strong interest. BlockDAG offers a different approach to network structures. It uses a parallel system for processing transactions, low fees, and a $30 million fund to encourage use. With upcoming listings on exchanges, people try to acquire BDAG at its presale price. BlockDAG’s technology is a key factor. The BlockDAG structure allows for simultaneous transaction handling. This removes slowdowns found in other networks. This feature is important for decentralized finance, non-fungible items, and high-speed trading. Why BlockDAG Attracts Attention Now Many seek stable assets in a changing market. Those who acquired BDAG early see a 2,380% increase in value. The opportunity remains available. Here is why the BlockDAG project is considered a strong digital asset option for 2025: $201 Million Presale and Ten Exchange Listings BlockDAG’s presale raised over $201 million. 18.7 billion BDAG units sold at $0.0248 each in batch 27. Demand remains high as ten major exchanges plan to list BDAG. These listings could increase BDAG’s value after its launch. The BlockDAG project has seen strong support. Parallel Processing For Better Scale Unlike other networks that slow down with high usage, BlockDAG uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for parallel processing. This improves speed. This makes it suitable for many uses, including decentralized finance and non-fungible items. The BlockDAG technology is designed for efficiency. March 2025 Test Network Launch BlockDAG’s test network will be available in March 2025. This is a step towards the main network. The test network includes: Rewards for those who help run the network early. Tools to watch the network’s performance. Testing for decentralized finance applications. Successful tests will increase confidence in BlockDAG. This could lead to higher presale prices. $30 Million Support Program A healthy community is important for any network. BlockDAG allocates $30 million for developers. Support ranges from $10,000 to $100,000. It supports: Web3 development. Decentralized finance applications. Non-fungible item markets. Business network solutions. BlockDAG also works with HackerEarth to bring developers through events. This helps the network grow. The BlockDAG team wants to encourage development. Large Entity Interest and Accumulation Large financial entities acquire BDAG. They see the potential of BlockDAG’s technology. This mirrors the early phases of other successful projects. These entities recognize the network’s design and upcoming listings. The BlockDAG presale sees large purchases. Could BDAG Reach $1 After Launch? With its current path, BlockDAG could see a price increase after exchange listings. Experts think BDAG could follow a pattern seen with other networks, possibly reaching $1. Factors that could drive this include: Exchange listings: This increases access and demand. Low initial value: This helps with price growth. Network growth: Support programs and events to help with use. Large entity purchases: They see the network’s advantages. The Presale Opportunity Nears Its End Those interested in BDAG should act quickly. Presale prices increase over time. Once exchange listings begin, prices will change. With over $201 million raised, a new network model, and a plan with key events, BlockDAG is more than a presale. It represents a change. The BlockDAG project shows a new direction. Will you acquire BDAG at presale prices or watch as it rises towards $1?

CZ says pitching tents with credible projects is a better investment strategy in the long term for investors in the space.# A Fortune Is Spent Investing In Shady Projects, Says Binance Founder CZ has taken swipes at “degen” activity in cryptocurrency circles following a string of high-profile rug pools. According to the Binance founder, investors are sinking in massive fortunes to clutch at quick rewards in the ecosystem. The Binance founder disclosed on X (formerly Twitter) that investors rarely recoup their funds in the pursuit of quick gains. Degens typically invest in low-cap tokens and memecoins, aping into leveraged positions without proper research. CZ advises investors to turn their gaze to “ethical teams” building projects for long-term growth, rather than short-term hype. Investors chasing trends and hype have lost a fortune in rug pulls, liquidity drains, and exit scams. The US SEC has disclosed that memecoins are not securities , urging investors to be wary of speculative investment in the asset class. “In crypto, too much money is spent chasing small, quick gains,” said CZ. “Focus on ethical teams that build for the long term. Big money is built slowly with stamina.” While the Binance founder did not expressly mention credible crypto projects, his comments allude to teams with established members and communities building projects with real utility. CZ Offers Suggestions on Tokenomics For Crypto Projects The Binance founder has offered suggestions for crypto project tokenomics designed to reduce rug pulls. According to CZ’s plan, only 10% of tokens will be unlocked while the remaining tokens will require the fulfillment of strict conditions before an unlock. Under the proposal, issuers will unlock new tokens after every six months with only 5% of tokens allowed to be unlocked. CZ’s tokenomics plan will rely on smart contracts to control the vesting schedule and third parties to hold the keys. CZ has since rolled out support for victims of BROCCOLI and TST memecoin crashes, raising over $1 million in cryptocurrencies. The Binance founder says that AI projects can leverage L1 and L2 blockchains to achieve efficiency and decentralization objectives.

However, only a handful of digital assets can deliver astronomical returns. For investors looking for the top crypto coins to invest in, three contenders stand out: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Celestia (TIA), and Terra Classic (LUNC). These projects cater to different market segments, offering varying levels of innovation, narrative, and investment potential. Whether it’s a meme coin revolutionizing storytelling, a blockchain redefining scalability, or a revived ecosystem driven by its community, each project presents an exciting prospect for investors in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Legendary Crypto Expedition Deep within the frozen tundras, where myths blur with reality, Arctic Pablo embarks on a journey that defies imagination. The fearless explorer ventures into uncharted territories, unearthing mystical $APC coins—tokens infused with the magic of forgotten lands. But this isn’t just a fantasy; it’s an investment opportunity. Unlike traditional meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin redefines the game by merging adventure, scarcity, and financial potential. Each presale phase corresponds to a new location, making investors feel on an exhilarating journey alongside Pablo. Arctic Pablo has arrived at ChillVille, the 13th stop in this epic expedition, where $APC is available at just $0.000070. With over $1.78 million already raised and a launch price of $0.008, early investors stand to gain an incredible 11,285.71% ROI. For instance, a $100 investment today would get 1,428,127 APCs, ballooning to $11,425.02 once Arctic Pablo reaches its final destination. But that’s not all—staking opportunities with a 66% APY ensure holders can multiply their tokens while awaiting the journey’s culmination. With a robust token burn mechanism, Arctic Pablo Coin continuously increases in scarcity, driving long-term value. Any unsold tokens are burned weekly during the presale, and all remaining supply will be incinerated post-launch. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), $APC accepts BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, SOL, and BNB, making it accessible to many investors. As Arctic Pablo continues his legendary voyage, investors can claim their own piece of the adventure. The question is: Are you ready to join the top crypto coins to invest before it’s too late? Celestia: The Future of Modular Blockchain Technology While Arctic Pablo Coin turns heads with its immersive storytelling, Celestia (TIA) is making waves in the blockchain world with its groundbreaking modular architecture. Unlike traditional monolithic blockchains, Celestia separates the consensus and data availability layers, allowing developers to build scalable and flexible blockchains without compromising security. Investors looking for the top crypto coins to invest in should keep an eye on Celestia, as it’s at the forefront of blockchain evolution. With partnerships growing and adoption increasing, TIA’s potential for explosive growth is undeniable. Celestia is positioned as a scalability, security, and efficiency leader as blockchain infrastructure expands. Terra Classic: The Community-Driven Comeback Story Terra Classic (LUNC) proves that a strong community can revive even the most battered projects. Once an empire in the stablecoin industry, Terra’s ecosystem suffered a catastrophic collapse. However, rather than fading into obscurity, LUNC has been reborn as a decentralized, community-driven network determined to restore its former glory. Recent improvements have strengthened Terra Classic’s transaction speeds, security, and utility, again making it a viable competitor in the DeFi space. With developers continuing to innovate and expand its ecosystem, LUNC is steadily climbing back up the ranks of crypto’s most resilient assets. For investors willing to bet on the power of community-driven projects, LUNC remains a solid contender. Its resurgence underscores the importance of decentralization, adaptability, and collective governance in shaping the future of blockchain. Conclusion: The Next Big Crypto Investments Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Celestia, and Terra Classic stand out as some of the top crypto coins to invest in 2025. Each offers distinct advantages, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) combines high ROI, narrative-driven investment, and a 66% APY staking program, making it the perfect choice for meme coin enthusiasts seeking substantial gains. Celestia (TIA) spearheads the modular blockchain revolution, providing the foundation for scalable, secure, high-performance blockchain applications.

The platform even confiscated proceeds from the market maker to compensate affected users of $GPS and $SHELL. Binance will reveal its compensation plan in the coming days According to Binance, it’s prepared to act against market makers that fail to comply with its policies, which became very clear with the latest incident. One of Binance’s market makers, a single market-making entity for the $GPS token, was found coincidingly participating in $SHELL’s market activities, violating the exchange’s policies. Thus, the crypto exchange quickly offboarded the market maker and even permanently banned any future market participation. Additionally, the exchange confiscated all the funds the market maker received from its non-compliant activities, saying that they would use the proceeds to pay back affected token $GPS and $SHELL token holders. However, the exchange has yet to disclose how all affected users will be properly compensated. Nevertheless, it said that it would release its compensation plan in the next few days, detailing eligibility criteria, distribution mechanisms and timelines. A Binance representative commented on the matter, saying, “Protecting our users and maintaining a fair trading environment remain our top priorities. This incident underscores our proactive approach to identifying and addressing misconduct, and we will continue to enhance our monitoring systems to prevent future breaches.” Binance even insisted that all its project market makers needed to comply with its rules, including providing bids and asks in tandem with the market size of each security, maintaining a stable spread for market activity as well as preventing market disruption from high-frequency order placement and cancellations. Binance revealed a new mechanism for listing and delisting despite GPS troubles at the time On Friday, the crypto exchange announced new listing and delisting rules, which included putting the entire process up for community vote. The exchange explained that users with more than 0.01 BNB will now be allowed to ‘Vote to List’ or ‘Vote to Delist’ the exchange’s tokens. However, the platform still reserves the right to choose the tokens being voted on. However, the GPS ecosystem was still under close observation at the time of the announcement. Just a few days after its listing, the GPS token was under the Monitoring tag, with the exchange concerned over its sudden price dips and what they thought to be intentional price manipulation. The exchange later discovered that a market maker caused the price drop when he quickly sold roughly 70 million tokens, siphoning about $5 million in liquidity from the market. The exchange even detailed that the market maker failed to place matching buy orders, thus contributing to losses for early traders. At the time, Binance only put the market maker’s account on hold.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has collected $2.5 million throughout its two-phased presale process which has managed to pull in more than 4,600 holders. The 75% adjustment level in Phase two indicates growing market demand because the token price will jump to $0.02 during its upcoming stage. Individuals who acquire Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens early during these presales will experience a 33% increase before the third phase begins while the tokens will list for $0.06 after the increase represents over 400% higher than the current value. Research analysts predict MUTM tokens will surpass $3.50 valuation by 2025 because of its distinct lending technology and built-in token distribution system. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum The second presale phase of MUTM by Mutuum Finance occurs at $0.015 price before the exchange listing phase starts with currently the lowest entry cost. Early contributors who participate in the presale will achieve a 400% profit once the project lists at $0.06 since this value has been incorporated into the tokenomics design. The urgency to invest in Mutuum Finance continues to grow since phase two shows almost full capacity and the project has already raised $2.5 million. The initial phase sold out at a rate which exceeded projections which demonstrated increasing market belief in the decentralized lending approach. Bringing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from conventional DeFi tokens becomes possible through its dual revenue structure. MUTM platform fees create an automatic system to repurchase MUTM tokens that distribute them to users with long-term stake positions. The flourishing demand cycle driven by this mechanism works to reduce temporary sales activities in addition to generating repetitive revenues that resemble established blue-chip protocols. The $100,000 presale giveaway for participants has elevated investor interest since ten investors will receive $10,000 each which simultaneously strengthens engagement with holders. Real-World Utility Driving Forecasts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its investment value based on concrete financial services operations rather than relying on meme coins or speculative assets. The platform allows users to put ETH or DAI cryptocurrencies as deposits which generates interest-bearing mtTokens. The tokens increase in value during periods of accumulation and users can utilize them both for swapping and DeFi transactions on different platforms. This fusion of liquidity and passive income enables users to benefit. Users applying for loans secure their transactions by providing assets comparable to the loan amount thus the system reduces default risk and maintains stability. Users will gain enhanced functionality through the forthcoming peer-to-peer lending tools that let them conduct swaps involving Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a flexible platform within an industry which many 때 criticizes for absent real-world use. The project implements an Overcollateralized stablecoin development alongside its ecosystem growth efforts which aim to establish itself against established platforms like Aave and Compound. Price Trajectory and Strategic Positioning Market analysts identify Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token distribution policies as the key factor behind its ongoing expansion. Liquidity incentives with staking rewards receive almost 40% of available tokens to maintain continuous user participation. Another 20% supports partnerships and exchange listings, critical for maintaining post-launch stability. Meme coins base their value solely on hype although MUTM provides investors with tangible plans instead of unproven expectations. The current market forecasts project MUTM tokens to hit $3.50 by 2025 thus creating a 23,233% boost in value from the initial presale cost. The platform’s revenue-sharing system generates these projections because token demand represents an initiating factor that correspond with user participation levels. People who purchase $2,500 worth of MUTM today would receive $60,000 when the price reaches $0.06 after the initial launch and could earn even greater returns because of growing adoption rates. The period to buy tokens at cheap rates is running out for investors. Phase 2 will soon reach its 75% completion mark as the platform shows similar frenetic behavior like phase 1 preceding the next price increase.

Web3Bay’s $1.6M Presale Takes Over the Crypto Spotlight!,https://thecoinrise.com/is-cardano-out-web3bays-1-6m-presale-takes-over-the-crypto-spotlight/,"Once a stalwart in the altcoin community, Cardano (ADA) has seen a marked decline in investor enthusiasm as its efforts to reach previous peaks falter. Amidst uncertain market conditions, ADA’s performance has been lackluster, prompting traders to seek out more promising opportunities elsewhere. In contrast, Web3Bay (3BAY) presale is attracting significant attention, drawing investors who are keen on securing growth opportunities slated for 2025. Having already amassed over $1.6 million, Web3Bay is establishing itself as a more stable and profitable investment compared to faltering options like Cardano. Challenges for Cardano as Investor Confidence Wanes Throughout 2025, ADA’s market behavior has not inspired investor confidence, with its current trading price pegged at $0.7405. The token has experienced a slight dip of 1.35% in the last day and a more notable 2.85% drop over the week. Looking at the past month, ADA’s minimal gain of 1.86% does little to alleviate concerns, especially given its 22.55% and 25.87% falls over the past three and six months, respectively. Despite a significant market cap of $27.82 billion, ADA is struggling to keep pace with newer, more agile blockchains, particularly in the rapidly expanding DeFi sector, where it has notably lagged in adoption and investor interest. Why Investors Are Drifting from Cardano to Web3Bay As Cardano flounders, many are redirecting their investments toward the burgeoning presale of Web3Bay, which has swiftly exceeded the $1.6 million mark. But why this shift? DeFi Hurdles for Cardano vs. Practical Applications of Web3Bay Cardano’s slow embrace of DeFi contrasts sharply with Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain, which have quickly capitalized on this sector. Cardano’s transaction volumes remain low, and adoption is sluggish. Conversely, Web3Bay is poised to disrupt the trillion-dollar e-commerce market by addressing issues like steep transaction fees, transparency, and data control. Web3Bay’s practical applications provide a solid basis for sustained growth, unlike ADA’s reliance on market speculations. Predictable Returns with Web3Bay Versus ADA’s Market Volatility Web3Bay’s structured presale model offers early investors low entry prices before its official launch, setting the stage for substantial future gains. This approach presents a more predictable growth path compared to the volatile swings of Cardano, which is heavily influenced by broader market sentiments. A More Secure Option in Unstable Times With ongoing instability in Bitcoin and broader markets, investors are increasingly allocating their capital to presale tokens like Web3Bay. These investments are less affected by immediate market volatility, providing a safer bet during downturns. This strategy is a key factor in the growing appeal of Web3Bay’s presale, even as ADA faces challenges in attracting new investment. Web3Bay’s Presale: A Prime Investment Prospect Despite general market volatility, Web3Bay’s successful presale, which has raised over $1.6 million and sold over 400 million tokens, highlights the shift towards assets with robust long-term prospects, as opposed to speculative bets like ADA. Web3Bay’s model, which leverages real-world applications for robust early-stage growth, distinguishes it from the challenges ADA faces with adoption and investor demand. Which Crypto Is Worth Your Investment? The struggles of Cardano in both price and innovation within the DeFi space have left many investors disillusioned, prompting them to explore superior alternatives. Web3Bay’s thriving presale represents a compelling investment choice, demonstrating the significant advantages of early-stage projects with tangible utility in the current market cycle. As Web3Bay continues its presale phase, investors are presented with a fleeting chance to participate at the most advantageous prices before the next uptick. The critical question now is whether you will capitalize on this opportunity or let it pass by.

This new development has ignited some reflection as both brothers ponder how they moved from intense regulatory scrutiny involving Gemini to where they are currently. Crypto Czar Engage Winklevoss Brothers Speaking on the matter, Crypto czar David Sacks acknowledged an earlier statement made by Cameron Winklevoss. “I think you said something earlier that I thought was really profound,” Sacks said. “You said that a year ago, you thought it would be more likely that you’d end up in jail than at the White House.” At first, Cameron clarified that Tyler made the statement. Then, he pointed out how they were surprised at how everything turned out with Gemini Earn. In his opinion, an attack was the last thing they expected from doing “the right thing for so many years and always trying to raise the bar with respect to regulations.” SEC Sues Gemini For Earn Program The Winklevoss brothers’ cryptocurrency exchange was under intense scrutiny a few years ago. It had to do with their Earn Program, which ordinarily allowed users to earn interest on their assets. All they had to do was lend the crypto assets to Genesis Global Capital, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG). However, the program turned negative when FTX imploded in 2022, and Gemini Earn users could not access their funds. It got worse when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued both Gemini and Genesis, citing that the Gemini Earn was an unregistered offering of securities. This allegedly violated securities laws. Amidst this, the Winklevoss twins had a fallout with Barry Silbert, the CEO of DCG. Where is Gemini Now? On the progress of the Gemini Earn Program, the crypto exchange has paid out $50 million settlement to compensate the investors. The resolution, announced by the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office, ensured the fund’s recovery. Moving beyond the lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny, the Winklevoss brothers took a significant step toward going public. The company confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) and enlisted financial giants Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to guide the process.

Institutional investors are offloading ETH, increasing downside risks. Ethereum Price Dives Below $2,000 as US NFP Tilts Markets Bearish Ethereum (ETH) experienced significant losses over the weekend as the highly anticipated White House Summit failed to lift market sentiment. Instead, the latest US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report dominated investor outlook, highlighting rising unemployment and increasing inflation pressures. As a result, ETH price tumbled below the psychological $2,000 level, trading as low as $1,998 on Binance on March 9, marking an 8% daily decline. The drop exceeded Bitcoin’s 4% losses within the same timeframe, signaling stronger bearish momentum within ETH spot markets. Ethereum Price Action The selling pressure has been exacerbated by mounting fears of further Federal Reserve tightening in response to rising inflation metrics. With investors now eyeing the next Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, ETH price could struggle to gain meaningful traction unless macroeconomic conditions shift favorably. BlackRock ETF Led Outflows with $11 Million Sell-off After US NFP Data Amid rising unemployment and inflation triggers, institutional investors are reallocating capital away from crypto markets toward fixed-income securities, driving bond yields higher across global markets. This shift in investor sentiment has translated into substantial outflows from Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock Spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF Flows, March 2025 | Source: SosoValue According to on-chain analytics provider SosoValue , Ethereum ETFs recorded $23 million in outflows on Friday, the same day the US NFP report was released. Among the largest liquidations, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF saw an $11 million capital flight, the highest single-day outflow among Ethereum-focused funds. The rapid outflows in Ethereum ETFs suggest that institutional investors are repositioning their portfolios in anticipation of further downside in crypto markets. If Ethereum ETF outflows continue into the coming week, ETH price could struggle to mount a sustained recovery. Ethereum Price Forecast: Death Cross Pattern Signals Deeper Decline Toward $1,850 Ethereum price forecast signals have taken a decisive bearish turn, with ETH plunging 8.3% on March 9 to test support near $2,000. The daily chart reveals a concerning technical setup, as ETH struggles below key moving averages, with a confirmed Death Cross between short-term EMAs signaling prolonged downside risks. If Ethereum closes below the critical $2,000 level, selling pressure could accelerate, targeting the next major support at $1,850, where historical demand has previously stabilized declines. Ethereum Price Forecast | ETHUSD The Bollinger Bands show ETH trading at the lower band, suggesting it is in oversold territory. However, the absence of a significant bullish reaction underscores weak buying momentum. The MACD histogram remains in deep negative territory, with its signal line widening against the MACD line—affirming that bearish momentum is strengthening rather than reversing. While a relief bounce cannot be ruled out, any recovery toward $2,250 or $2,433 would likely face intense resistance as sidelined sellers look to re-enter. The heightened leverage in derivatives markets could amplify price swings. If ETH loses $2,000 decisively, long liquidations may accelerate a cascade effect, making $1,850 the next crucial test for bulls. Conversely, a close above $2,200 could shift sentiment toward a bullish retracement. Ethereum Price Outlook: Key Levels to Watch This Week For Ethereum to break its bearish grip, ETF inflows must show signs of stabilization, particularly from major asset managers like BlackRock. If institutional demand returns, ETH could attempt to reclaim the $2,100 level and challenge the $2,250 resistance zone. On the flip side, if macroeconomic headwinds persist and ETF outflows accelerate, Ethereum risks dropping below $1,950, potentially testing lower support at $1,850. With US CPI data and Federal Reserve commentary on the horizon, traders should remain cautious, as Ethereum’s price action could see heightened volatility in response to broader market shifts. Overall, Ethereum remains vulnerable to further downside unless it reclaims key resistance levels and sees a resurgence in institutional demand.

The announcement was made following President Donald Trump’s White House Crypto Summit on March 7. “FIFA is very, very interested in developing a FIFA coin to do it from here, from America, and to conquer the 5 billion football fans in the world,” Infantino said. “If there is anyone here who wants to cooperate with FIFA, we are here with the United States and we will conquer the world of football with the FIFA coin.” While specific details or timelines regarding the potential FIFA token remain unclear, Infantino’s statements suggest the organization is exploring blockchain technology as a means of fan engagement and revenue generation. Related News: Analytics Company Shares Critical Level That Must Be Maintained To Avoid Aggressive Bitcoin Decline US President Donald Trump, who hosted the summit, responded enthusiastically to Infantino's statement. “This coin could end up being more valuable than FIFA. It could actually be a pretty big coin,” he said.

This article explores three coins with strong fundamentals that are poised for a significant rebound once this decline ends. Stay tuned to discover which digital assets are set to surge and make the most of this rare chance. Ethereum Faces Downturn Amid Bearish Pressures Ethereum saw a decline in its prices over the past month with a drop of nearly 19%. Over the last six months, the fall was around 8%, reflecting a steady bearish sentiment. The price volatility is evident as it has fluctuated within a range from approximately $1,766 to $3,021. The market has experienced a mix of pressures and minor recoveries, illustrating the coin’s sensitivity to broader trends and news. Indicators such as momentum and oscillator readings have been in negative territory, reinforcing the downward movement. Current levels present significant technical challenges with support around $1,294 and immediate resistance near $3,804. Bulls appear to be scarce with the RSI reading below 40 and negative momentum indicators, suggesting that bears control the market right now. Traders might consider strategies within these levels, watching closely for any sign of a reversal before testing the next resistance near $5,058. Jupiter’s Bearish Momentum and Key Levels in Play Jupiter has shown notable declines with a one-week drop of 26.40%, a one-month fall of 32.87%, and a six-month decrease of 24.54%. The performance over these periods highlights ongoing bearish pressure, indicating that the market has been challenged to regain strength recently. The coin currently trades between $0.57 and $1.01, with support at $0.38 and resistance at $1.26, nearing a second resistance at $1.71. Bearish indicators such as negative momentum and a low RSI of 33.44 suggest that sellers still dominate. A potential trading approach could involve seeking entries near the support level while monitoring the resistance for any breakout signals. Celestia Price Trends Ahead of Altcoin Season Last month showed a modest rally with a 13.63% increase, while the six-month outlook recorded a 22.09% drop. Price action over these periods reflects fluctuations that have tested investor sentiment and demonstrated recovery followed by noticeable corrections. Current trading sees Celestia oscillating between a price range of $2.83 and $4.89, with the nearest resistance at $5.71 and clear support identified at $1.57. The absence of a strong trend, along with bearish momentum indicated by the negative Awesome Oscillator and moving average recommendations, suggests cautious trading. Traders may consider buying on dips and targeting resistance while monitoring for potential directional shifts. Conclusion ETH , JUP , and TIA show great promise for growth. ETH, with its new updates, is attracting more developers. JUP’s unique features make it stand out. TIA’s innovation and tech advancements are impressive. As the market stabilizes, these coins are likely to gain significant value. Investors watching these assets may find rewarding opportunities ahead.

With thousands of digital assets out there, only a handful manage to capture attention and redefine what blockchain can do truly. While some projects fade into obscurity, others cement themselves as indispensable assets in the digital economy. So, which projects are making waves right now? One name that keeps showing up is Qubetics , the world’s first Web3 aggregator, currently leading one of the top crypto presales of the year. Alongside industry giants like Binance and Algorand, it’s proving that crypto isn’t just a passing trend—it’s a full-fledged alternative to traditional investments. Let’s break down how these projects have established themselves and why their momentum isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Qubetics: The Top Crypto Presale That’s Turning Heads Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, is transforming asset ownership by enabling interoperability in blockchain refers to the seamless exchange and utilization of assets, data, and functionalities across different networks without restrictions. With the top crypto presale already raising over $14.8 million, Qubetics has been gaining traction fast. Currently, in Stage 24, the presale price of $TICS tokens is currently $0.0976, with over 497 million tokens sold and 22,600+ holders already in. It’s solving a problem that most crypto buyers face—fragmentation. Right now, managing assets across multiple blockchains is a nightmare. Imagine having Bitcoin on one chain, Ethereum-based NFTs on another, and stablecoins locked in DeFi protocols. Switching between them is time-consuming, costly, and inefficient. Qubetics changes that with interoperability, meaning assets from different blockchains can be managed seamlessly in one place. Businesses can finally run cross-chain transactions without friction, professionals can manage crypto assets without hopping between wallets, and everyday users can trade effortlessly. Whether sending money across networks, bridging NFTs, or using DeFi tools across chains, Qubetics makes life easier. With price projections soaring—analysts eyeing $TICS at $0.25 by presale’s end (156% ROI), $1 post-presale (924% ROI), and $15 after mainnet launch (15,256% ROI)—the top crypto presale of the year isn’t just talk. It’s setting up to be a major player in the blockchain industry. Binance: The Undisputed Crypto Powerhouse Binance stands as one of the most influential entities in the cryptocurrency industry, recognized for both its market dominance and its adaptability in an evolving regulatory landscape. As one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, it has consistently catered to the growing demand for digital asset investments, offering a comprehensive suite of services, including spot trading, futures, staking, and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Beyond its trading functionalities, Binance has positioned itself as a cornerstone of blockchain innovation by supporting a vast array of crypto projects, providing staking incentives, and bridging the gap between decentralized and traditional finance. Its ability to navigate regulatory challenges while maintaining a strong presence in the market underscores its resilience and strategic foresight. Algorand: The Blockchain for Real-World Solutions Unlike many other crypto projects, Algorand has always been focused on bridging the gap between blockchain technology and real-world utility. Its pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) model offers high-speed transactions with minimal energy consumption, making it a favorite for projects that prioritize sustainability. Algorand has been gaining traction in sectors like digital identity, asset tokenization, and cross-border payments. Governments and institutions have taken note, with Algorand being chosen for major projects, including central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives. For those looking for a blockchain that can handle real-world applications with efficiency, Algorand continues to prove its worth. Final Thoughts: Why These Cryptos Are Worth Watching From Qubetics’ top crypto presale solving cross-chain issues to Binance’s market dominance and Algorand’s real-world adoption, these projects are solidifying their positions in the crypto world. While traditional investments still hold value, the rapid growth and innovation in blockchain technology make these digital assets impossible to ignore. For those keeping an eye on emerging projects, Qubetics’ presale isn’t just another crypto launch—it’s an evolution in blockchain interoperability. With a growing number of backers and analysts forecasting huge potential upside, missing out might not be an option. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics’ presale gaining so much attention? Qubetics’ top crypto presale is attracting buyers due to its unique interoperability features, making it easier to manage assets across multiple blockchains. How does Qubetics’ interoperability benefit users? Instead of juggling multiple wallets and networks, Qubetics allows users to seamlessly interact across different blockchains. Whether transferring tokens, staking, or trading, the process is faster, cheaper, and hassle-free. What makes Binance and Algorand stand out in the crypto world? Binance dominates as the largest crypto exchange, offering a vast ecosystem of trading, DeFi, and blockchain services.

At just past 7:00 pm ET, bitcoin had slumped to exactly $80,000, down 7% over the past 24 hours. The world's largest crypto did manage the most modest of bounces from there, trading at $80,700 at press time. Ether (ETH), solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) were lower by similar amounts, while cardano (ADA) and dogecoin (DOGE) had plunged closer to 12%. ""There could be a little disruption,"" said U.S. President Donald Trump in a Fox News appearance on Sunday when asked about the impact of his tariff and budget-cutting policies. ""If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective … we go by quarters,"" he continued. ""What we’re doing is building a foundation for the future."" Trump's comments were dubbed ""Volckering"" by some on social media — a reference to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Shortly after being appointed to the position by Jimmy Carter in 1979, Volcker moved to break the back of a decade-long inflation by jacking up short term rates to unheard of levels, knowing that by doing so, the U.S. would surely have to experience a brutal recession. By the time Volcker had finished tightening policy roughly 18 months later, the Fed funds rate had hit 20% and the economy indeed had gone through a difficult contraction. Inflation, however, was broken and the stage was set for growth throughout most of the following decade. In early Sunday evening action, U.S. stock index futures were lower by about 0.85% across the board.",Markets|Bitcoin|Breaking News,EN,0,0,BTC|ADA|DOGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-09 23:20:56
41403861,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689949,1741562652,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41403861.jpeg,"CZ criticizes short-term greed in crypto, urges focus on ethical, long-term growth",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cz-criticizes-short-term-greed-in-crypto/,"Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has criticized the short-term crypto investment culture, in which investors are driven by greed to accumulate wealth in short-term projects at the expense of ethical long-term projects. On his X page , CZ wrote, “Unpopular opinion: In crypto, too much money is spent chasing small, quick gains. Focus on ethical teams that build for the long term. Big money is built slowly with stamina.” CZ remarks point to the speculative nature of altcoins, which are not sustainable due to their instability and risk of market manipulation Chasing short-term gains harms crypto’s stability Cryptocurrency has historically been synonymous with making a fortune in a single night, and investors are attracted to it because it promises to make them wealthy quickly. CZ’s worries reflect a larger problem for the sector—the unpredictability of speculative assets. Excessive hype of projects by short-term traders also enables low-quality projects and mispricing of assets. However, when speculative bubbles burst, that can lead to market crashes, and investors are left holding the bag. In addition, the search for quick returns stifles actual blockchain innovation since purely concentrating on project hype provides zero solutions. This short-termism results in many promising projects never being able to realize their actual potential, hurting the credibility of the industry. The crypto landscape continues to evolve at a fast pace, and we have much to learn about the virtues of patience and the need for slow-burn development. To some, this industry’s tried-and-tested projects include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. These projects have withstood the test of time by sticking true to their fundamental missions and ensuring that they only focus on developments that make steady and meaningful progress. No wonder Bitcoin, the so-called digital gold, remains the first and the leading crypto game in town based on the nature of decentralization and the secured path network. This seems against the rampant market speculation, with institutional investors viewing Bitcoin as an increasingly certain store of value. Ethereum is also accepting long-term development. It moved on to Ethereum 2.0, which has a proof-of-stake model which increases the blockchain’s scalability and sustainability. Unlike others, however, Cardano was built on peer-reviewed research, meaning the team is focused on making gradual changes and improvements to the protocol instead of rushing headlong into radical improvements, some of which have the potential to compromise security and transparency. The future of success in crypto will have much less to do with price pumps and much more to do with building a unique society. Having a dependable society is more secure for investors as it results in a more sustainable long-term market. Investors supporting such initiatives can help construct the industry of the future, one sourced from technology rather than speculation. CZ’s message is a good reminder that crypto investing isn’t just about getting rich in the short term but creating sustainable returns — by keeping the key pillars of this industry, discipline, patience, and ethics, at the forefront of its daily operations. Short-term thinking risks undermining crypto’s future Long-term investment strategies have their virtues, but most investors cannot resist the volatility of crypto. The wild swings of digital currencies reveal the craving for quick profits, so speculative trading is one option for cashing in on price or market action. Almost every action with such advantages as high risk is characterized by tremendous market spin, scams, scrutiny from authorities, and emotional burnout. Most traders lose tremendously, even in a short-term trick. There are many scams and rug pulls, too, with some new projects providing “give-it-to-you” numbers to new investors and crashing when early investors do lockups. This destroys market confidence and affects mainstream adoption the most. In addition, states and regulatory authorities are currently facing this contemporary issue of speculative trading and have thus already legislated against such practices to combat market manipulation and protect the interests of retail traders. These incidents are symptomatic of the dangers of pursuing short-term growth at the cost of long-term sustainability. Today, the arguments over short- and long-term investment strategies lie at the heart of all crypto activity as the market matures. CZ’s perspective is “off the deep end,” and it advocates a beaten-down order of crypto investment. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Per a release from Japan’s top regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) , and a news report from the Japanese media outlet CoinPost , the government has approved a Cabinet decision to amend the Payment Services Act. Relaxed Rules for Crypto Brokerages, Stablecoin Issuers Tokyo has sent a bill to finalize the amendments to the National Diet. The Diet is all but certain to vote in favor of the amendments in the coming days. Japan proposes crypto tax cuts (55% 20%) and ETF approval under new reforms, aiming to become a global crypto hub. #Crypto #Japan https://t.co/9a6cw4LgFG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 6, 2025 In its history, the Japanese parliament has never voted against any crypto-related legal change approved by the Cabinet. And the Cabinet, in turn, has never rejected a legal change proposed by the FSA, which has something of a carte blanche when it comes to Japanese crypto regulatory matters. The bill will allow crypto companies to operate as “intermediary businesses.” That means that brokers will no longer need to apply for the same kind of permits that crypto exchanges and crypto wallet operators use. The bill also allows stablecoin issuers to enjoy more flexibility when it comes to the type of assets they can use to back their coins. Currently, Japanese firms need to match the amount of tokens they have in circulation 1:1 with cash deposits in regulated bank accounts. @FirstDigitalHQ announces a partnership with @Ledger Enterprise Tradelink to enable institutions to leverage $FDUSD for off-exchange settlements. #Stablecoin #Ledger https://t.co/XJe0IeER8W — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 7, 2025 The amendments will instead allow firms to use assets like certain Japanese and US government bonds instead. However, not all bonds will be eligible: The bill stipulates that only certain types of bonds can be used, including bonds with a remaining maturity of three months or less. Stablecoin issuers can also hold funds in fixed-term, high-interest bond accounts “that allow early cancellation.” Issuers will only be allowed to use bonds to back their coins by a maximum of 50%. The remainder will need to be held in current accounts.

This, CoinPost wrote, will “lower the barrier to entry.” To qualify for these new licensees, brokerages will have to prove that they do not directly handle any of their clients’ funds. Media reports claim that some of Japan’s biggest (and most crypto-keen) businesses are already eyeing brokerage operations. These include Mercari, SBI Securities, and Monex Securities.

Meme coins are among such assets. On-chain data from the blockchain analytics platform Dune reveals that meme tokens created using the Solana-based meme coins generator Pump.fun have declined to lows from September 2024. As of this writing, the total tokens launched on the meme token generator have dropped below 12,000. Pump.fun Tokens Down Since its debut in January 2024, Pump.fun has become a go-to platform to create meme coins on the Solana blockchain. This is mainly because the platform allows users to deploy meme tokens with minimal or zero programming language knowledge and technical expertise in creating and managing a cryptocurrency. According to Dune, the meme coin generator has birthed hundreds of thousands of meme tokens in just over a year. Pump.fun saw its peak number of created tokens in a single day on January 23rd when over 71,700 meme coins were launched. Notably, Pump.fun aided the creation of viral meme coins like TRUMP. Although TRUMP made waves shortly after its debut, it failed to garner attention weeks later. An earlier report shed light on how low the Trump-themed meme token has gone, dropping from being the second-largest meme coin by market cap ranking to a cataclysmic 82% decline from its all-time high. This unsustained long-term growth and other legal issues facing Pump.fun and its tokens have likely triggered users to refrain from using the platform. After the sudden mid-February crash of the Solana-based meme coin LIBRA tied to the Argentine president Javier Milei, Pump.fun saw reduced engagement in fees, users, and tokens generated. Way Back Up? It remains uncertain how Pump.fun will garner the attention and user engagement it once had. Still, crypto experts believe meme coin projects with sustainable utilities will weather the ongoing bearish trend. These utilities/use cases can include incorporating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized applications (dApps), artificial intelligence (AI) tools, etc., into their ecosystem.

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s value struggled throughout February, enduring significant downturns. On February 27, the cryptocurrency dropped steeply, falling below $78,000 for the first time in more than three months. Analysis of on-chain data suggests that the decrease was largely driven by sell-offs from “Bitcoin tourists”—newcomers to the trading scene. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $85,999 Market cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating supply 19,719,062 All-time high $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $86,224 24-hour low $85,783 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $85,999 Price Prediction $ 123,720 (46.23%) Fear & Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 4.86% Green Days 12/30 (40%) 50-Day SMA $ 98,051 200-Day SMA $ 82,082 14-Day RSI 25.03 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows a consolidation around $86K.

BTC Price Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $85,091, beginning a bearish trend to $81,008. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin uptoday? Following the overall buying sentiment, BTC price faced a buying demand and surged toward the high of $88K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs faced $275.83 million in net outflows on Feb. 27, 2025, pushing the week’s total net outflows to $2.71 billion. Bitcoin price prediction March 2025 February was the reddest month for Bitcoin since June 2022, when the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s performance was -37.28%. According to crypto data provider Santiment, Bitcoin whales and sharks have dumped ~6,813 coins since last week, which is the largest drop since last July. Will the BTC price recover in March 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $89,000 and be pushed further, at least $95,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $72,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction March 2025 $72,000 $89,000 $95,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October.

May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K.

BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum capture much of the attention, several lower-priced digital assets are making considerable progress and could experience substantial growth in 2025. Some of the best crypto projects to observe are still priced under $1 and are gaining traction due to key developments such as upgrades, partnerships, and increasing community support. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are among the top digital assets demonstrating strong potential to rise next year. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) The successful presale of BlockDAG (BDAG) has positioned this new project as one of the best crypto projects to monitor, appealing to those seeking an affordable digital asset. With a current price of $0.0248 in its current Batch 27, BDAG is gaining significant traction, raising over $201 million while distributing 18.7 billion coins. The BDAG price has jumped 2380% across its presale, and analysts predict a $1 valuation for this year. Those who participated in Batch 1 have seen a 2,380% return, highlighting the coin’s steady climb in value. Currently, in Batch 27, BDAG offers a 400% bonus on all BDAG purchases using the code BDAG800 . Its structured pricing model has consistently drawn attention, as each batch has marked an increase, rewarding early participants. With affordability and consistent growth, BDAG continues to be a digital asset under $1 worth considering, particularly for those tracking potential breakout assets. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) In early 2025, Grayscale introduced the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, providing institutional participants with an easier method to engage with DOGE. Frankenmuth Credit Union has expanded its services by adding Dogecoin, allowing customers to buy, sell, and manage it through online banking. Bitwise Asset Management has applied for a Dogecoin ETF with the U.S. SEC, aiming to simplify DOGE accessibility. At present, Dogecoin trades around $0.2057. Analyst Alon Mask sees $0.20 as a key support level and $0.315 as resistance, with potential for a breakout toward $1. 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at around $0.6507 and continues to be a strong player in the blockchain sector. Known for its research-driven development and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, Cardano is built for scalability and energy efficiency. Ongoing advancements in smart contracts and increasing adoption suggest steady long-term growth. With a dedicated development team and a large, engaged community, ADA remains one of the top digital assets to watch in 2025. Rising interest from major entities and its expanding real-world applications indicate a potential value increase soon. Cardano is often included in lists of the best crypto projects due to its strong tech. 4. Stellar (XLM) Stellar is gaining attention for its role in simplifying cross-border transactions and making money transfers faster and more affordable. Its network is widely used for remittances and financial services. XLM, priced at $0.343 with a 0.0295% increase, has shown resilience despite market fluctuations. Recognized as one of the best crypto projects to watch, Stellar continues to grow with support from banks and fintech firms. As demand for blockchain payments increases, its adoption could expand. With clearer regulations and institutional interest, XLM may see further gains, strengthening its position in global finance. Wrapping Up These four digital assets show strong growth potential, standing as key digital assets to watch in 2025 for those seeking accessible entry into the digital currency market without high costs. Dogecoin (DOGE) is aiming for a push toward $1 with growing institutional support. Cardano (ADA) remains strong with its advanced blockchain technology and rising adoption. Stellar (XLM) is expanding its role in cross-border payments, gaining traction in the financial sector. BlockDAG (BDAG), with its structured growth and accessible pricing, is gaining attention as a high-potential digital asset predicted to reach $1 this year. Unlike other coins facing market volatility, BDAG is set to see consistent growth in its presale and beyond—especially with analysts predicting a jump to $1 this year. Those who understand the market closely recognize these as the best crypto projects available today.

41405091,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689957,1741564920,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41405091.jpeg,Bitcoin crashes to $80k as Ether tumbles below $2k. How low can prices get?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-crashes-80k-ether-tumbles-below-2k/,"Bitcoin just collapsed to $80,000, wiping out over $200 billion from the crypto market in one of the worst single-day crashes over the past year, according to data from CoinGecko. Ether also crashed , tumbling below $2,000 to trade at $1,992, a level we haven’t seen in over six months. The sudden sell-off came after Donald Trump signed an Executive Order on Thursday, officially launching the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve—a decision you’d expect would boost prices, not tank them. Source: Jai Hamid/TradingView Friday’s White House Crypto Summit was set to be the big event, but Trump threw a curveball by announcing the reserve ahead of schedule. Traders were betting on a bullish rally, but instead, Bitcoin dropped from $90,000 to $85,000 within minutes of the announcement. The market reaction was brutal, with options traders unwinding long positions, volatility spiking, and put contracts gaining demand as traders scrambled to hedge against deeper downsides, per data from Coinglass. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve triggers sell-off instead of rally The Executive Order confirms the US government’s plan to stockpile Bitcoin, but there’s a catch—there’s no new funding for purchases yet. The initial reserves will be built using Bitcoin seized from criminal or civil asset forfeitures, which means no immediate demand pressure. Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, and Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, have been given the job of figuring out “budget-neutral” ways to add more Bitcoin to the reserve without costing taxpayers a dime. That wasn’t what traders wanted to hear. The market was looking for aggressive government buying, not just a relabeling of old holdings. With no sign of new demand, the sell-off gained momentum. As trading company QCP explained in its Friday Telegram note, risk reversals in the crypto market flipped, meaning traders started pricing in more downside risk than upside potential, which only made the crash worse. Recession fears and US debt crisis fuel the fire Meanwhile, the broader economic picture is looking worse by the day, and traders are bracing for a recession. The US is staring at a $9.2 trillion debt refinancing problem in 2025, with most of that debt maturing between January and June. The government needs lower interest rates—badly. The easiest way to get them? A recession. Over the last two months, the 10-year Treasury yield has dropped by 60 basis points, a sign that markets are pricing in economic trouble. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been working hard at spending cuts with a target of $2 trillion, but those guys aren’t working fast enough to fix the debt problem. President Donald Trump has been pushing for lower oil prices to fight inflation, even calling on OPEC to drop prices. But the fastest way to kill inflation? A recession that crushes demand. That’s why traders are keeping a close eye on the Atlanta Fed, which recently slashed its Q1 2025 GDP growth estimate to -2.8%, according to an analysis from The Kobeissi Letter. Markets have been expecting the Federal Reserve to cut rates at some point during the first half of 2025, but inflation keeps getting in the way. Source: Adam Kobeissi X/Twitter US consumer expectations for inflation just jumped to 6.0% over the next 12 months, the highest since May 2023. That’s the third straight month of rising inflation expectations—a problem for rate-cut hopes. Trump doesn’t even care about the stock market anymore. As Cryptopolitan reported on March 6, he said, “I’m not watching the market,” though during his first term, he was obsessed with it. That’s not just an offhand comment—it’s a message. Wall Street is on its own. Bitcoin braces for $75K as liquidation risks increase With Bitcoin now at $80,000, traders are already looking at the next danger zone—and it’s ugly. According to Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, things could get a lot worse before they get better. “An ugly start to the week. Looks like BTC will retest $78K. If it fails, $75K is next in the crosshairs. There are a lot of options open interest at $70K-$75K, and if we get into that range, it will be violent,” Arthur warned in a post on X. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data shows that Bitcoin exchange reserves are dropping rapidly, which means there is a potential supply shock—but right now, that doesn’t matter. When the market is in freefall, supply-side fundamentals take a backseat to sheer panic selling. But while most traders are running for the exits, President Nayib Bukele is buying the dip. El Salvador, which has been steadily accumulating Bitcoin, bought 5 more BTC today—up from its usual 1 BTC daily purchase. Only thing that’s gonna save these markets now is a rate cut, and the only way we’re gonna get that is through a recession. Buckle up, folks.

Based on thousands of simulated price paths, the forecast offers a range of possible outcomes that illuminate both potential gains and risks. According to the Results, Bitcoin Could Drop Below $51,000 with a 5% Chance According to MarktQuant, the simulation used a starting Bitcoin price of $82,655.52. The results show an average final price of $258,445.24 According to MarktQuant, the simulation used a starting Bitcoin price of $82,655.52. The results show an average final price of $258,445.24 ve bu da önemli bir potansiyel artışa işaret ediyor. Bununla birlikte, sonuç aralığı geniş olup, 5’lik yüzdelik dilim sonuç 51.430,23 dolara kadar olası bir düşüş öngörürken, 95’lik yüzdelik dilim sonuç Bitcoin’in 712.118,81 dolara kadar ulaştığını gösteriyor.

Amidst the complex signals from Ethereum (ETH) whale activity and the impressive 208% weekly surge of the Story (IP) Token, the market is a hotbed of activity. While Ethereum’s upcoming “Pectra” upgrade promises enhanced smart contract capabilities and Story Protocol’s strategic partnerships fuel the rise of its IP token, a newcomer is positioning itself as a top crypto to buy. Web3Bay (3BAY) is carving a niche with its innovative zero-fee e-commerce model, catching the eye of early investors with its presale, setting them on a path towards potentially game-changing gains in 2025. The allure of the 3BAY token’s affordable presale price offers significant financial advantages that are increasingly hard to overlook. Web3Bay: A Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 In the midst of Ethereum (ETH) whale activity’s cautionary tale and the robust ascent of the Story (IP) Token, Web3Bay is forging a promising path forward. The ongoing momentum of its presale is notable, with the 3BAY token already attracting $1.6 million through the sale of over 400 million tokens. The anticipated launch price of $0.1959 hints at a potential 3890% gain, presenting a substantial opportunity for swift movers. The zero-fee e-commerce marketplace that Web3Bay offers extends beyond just an enticing presale. By cutting out middlemen, it ensures a direct buyer-to-seller connection, enhancing transparency and reducing costs. Early backers of the 3BAY token can also enjoy a 5% discount on purchases, adding an extra layer of incentive. As Ethereum refines its upgrades and Story Protocol leverages its new partnerships, Web3Bay’s practical perks and clear financial benefits position it as a top crypto to buy in 2025. With plans for staking rewards, a shift towards DAO governance, and an upcoming NFT marketplace, Web3Bay is laying the groundwork for a comprehensive ecosystem. The limited-time presale price and the growing excitement surrounding the project suggest significant advantages for early participants. It’s this blend of immediate practical benefits, growth potential, and early entry perks that distinguishes Web3Bay in the bustling market. Ethereum (ETH) Whale Activity Suggests Market Watchfulness Ethereum is trading at $2,348.60, with current dynamics reflecting a cautious market stance. Significant Ethereum (ETH) whale transactions have led to $94.27 million existing spot ETFs, underscoring a wary attitude among major investors. This, combined with a 20% reduction in futures open interest, suggests a broader market retreat, impacting Ethereum’s price negatively. Despite this cautious market sentiment, Ethereum’s “Pectra” upgrade illustrates its enduring robustness. Operational on the Holesky testnet since February 24, 2025, it features 11 major improvements, such as EIP-7702, which enhances smart contract capabilities for wallets. Although initial tests have seen some hurdles, the forthcoming March 5, 2025, test on the Sepolia testnet is set to continue Ethereum’s steady developmental journey. Story (IP) Token Thrives Despite Market Downturn While Ethereum (ETH) whale activity indicates caution, Story (IP) Token emerges as a beacon of market defiance, surging 208% in the past week to $6.64. The growth of Story Protocol is driven by smart strategic moves, including collaborations with StabilityAI and acquiring rights through its Aria Protocol to BTS’s track “The Truth Untold.” Launched on February 13, 2025, its mainnet introduced innovative mechanisms for creators to tokenize and monetize their intellectual property effectively. While Ethereum grapples with its Pectra upgrade challenges, Story (IP) Token’s robust performance offers an attractive alternative, showing that strategic timing and smart partnerships can lead to substantial market gains. This dynamic underlines the importance of selecting the right crypto assets in a fluctuating market. In Summary Ethereum (ETH) whale activity may be signaling caution, while Story (IP) Token demonstrates growth through effective partnerships, but Web3Bay offers something uniquely compelling—a solid chance for substantial financial returns. With the 3BAY token priced at just $0.00524 and a potential launch price of $0.1959, early investors are well-positioned for a 3890% return. Web3Bay’s zero-fee marketplace, coupled with its strategic roadmap including staking rewards, DAO transition, and NFT integration, establishes it as a top crypto to buy in 2025 . Those who seize this opportunity now could be paving their way towards a significant financial transformation. In a market presenting mixed signals, Web3Bay’s distinct potential provides a clear and strategic choice for those aiming to maximize this year’s crypto opportunities.

The meme coin market has produced some of the most insane returns in crypto history, and right now, the three best new meme coins to invest in today are catching fire: BTFD Coin (BTFD) , Brett (BRETT), and SPX6900 (SPX). With new investors pouring into the market and meme coins outperforming traditional assets, the opportunity to jump in before prices explode is here. But while Brett and SPX6900 are solidifying their places as top-tier meme tokens, BTFD Coin is in its final presale stretch, offering investors a chance at a staggering 3650% ROI. The Bulls Squad is rallying, and those who move now will be locking in what could be the most lucrative play of 2025. Let’s explore the best new meme coins to invest in today. BTFD Coin – Bulls Squad Leads the Charge to a 3650% ROI Moonshot The final countdown has begun on one of the best new meme coins to invest in today, and those who get in on BTFD Coin’s presale at just $0.00016 are staring at the kind of return most traders only dream of. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement built around seizing market dips and turning them into generational wealth. More than 71 billion BTFD tokens have already been sold to over 11,300 investors, with a total of $6.27 million raised so far. BTFD’s Bulls Squad is leading the charge, proving that smart money doesn’t chase hype—it buys early, before the surge. The time to act is now because once this presale ends, the price will skyrocket to $0.0006, locking in an easy 275% gain for presale buyers before the $0.006 moon target potentially delivers that massive 3650% return. The Bulls Squad and Staking Rewards Joining the Bulls Squad isn’t just about buying tokens; it’s about maximizing returns. BTFD’s staking just went live at a 90% APY on December 2, meaning holders can compound their gains while waiting for the bull run. Unlike passive holding, staking ensures a continuous flow of rewards. Play-to-Earn Game – More Than Just a Token The BTFD P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, giving investors another way to earn while having fun. Play, win, and stack up BTFD tokens as you battle through levels, complete challenges, and boost your portfolio just by gaming. With in-game earnings seamlessly converted into real BTFD tokens, this project goes beyond the hype—it’s utility-driven, rewarding, and primed for mass adoption. Investment Breakdown – Why This Price Won’t Last At Stage 14, an investment of $1250 buys 7.81 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, that same investment is worth $4,687—an easy 275% gain. But when BTFD reaches its projected moon price of $0.006, that same $1250 investment turns into a massive $46,875. The opportunity is here with this best new meme coin to invest in today, but the presale is ending fast. Visit the BTFD presale site now, connect your wallet, and secure your tokens before prices surge! Brett (BRETT) – The People’s Meme Coin While BTFD is leading the presale race, Brett (BRETT) has carved its own path as a community-powered token. Launched as a spin-off from the Pepe ecosystem, Brett has cultivated a loyal following, making it one of the most discussed meme coins in 2025. Brett has seen whales accumulate massive holdings, pushing speculation that another leg up is on the horizon. It recently hit an all-time high of $2 billion in market cap, proving that meme coins are more than just a passing trend—they’re shaping up as serious investment plays. Whether it’s for speculation or community-driven growth, Brett continues to dominate the scene. SPX6900 (SPX) – The Unstoppable Meme Market Sensation SPX6900 is one of the most volatile yet exciting meme tokens in the game. Recently, its market cap soared past $570 million, fueled by its Coinbase listing and record-breaking trading volume. The appeal of SPX lies in its ability to tap into meme culture while offering serious liquidity and trading volume, something most meme coins struggle to maintain. As more investors shift toward meme coins with high speculation potential and exchange listings, SPX6900 remains a dominant force. Those who bet on it early have already seen incredible returns, making it one of the most talked-about meme tokens this year. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Before It’s Too Late If history has taught us anything, it’s that getting in early on high-potential meme coins is how life-changing returns are made. BTFD Coin is standing at the final presale stretch, and investors are rushing in before the price jumps.

Ordinals co-founder Casey Rodarmor noted that Bitcoin’s prestige and Solana’s speed could be the final nail in Ethereum’s coffin. Bitcoin and Solana Threaten Ethereum’s Rise While Ethereum’s recent decline has left investors in shock, the Ordinals co-founder Casey Rodarmor has proffered a theory for the asset. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Rodarmor disclosed that the duo of Bitcoin and Solana negatively affects Ethereum. Rodarmor says Bitcoin’s age and first-mover advantage gives it a keen advantage over Ethereum’s claim as “better money.” Conversely, Rodarmor says Solana is living up to its reputation as an ETH killer, improving on a range of metrics. “Ethereum is getting squeezed by Bitcoin and Solana,” said Rodarmor. “Ethereum has nowhere to go.” Rodarmor hinged Solana’s speed and scalability to its “centralization,” sparking a reaction from Solana cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko. Yakovenko downplayed Solana’s decentralization claims while pointing accusing fingers of centralization at Rodarmor. Bitcoin has enjoyed a streak of positives including the executive signing of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve while Solana is gearing up for a potential ETF approval. ETH Continues To Falter In Troubling Fashion Ethereum’s on-chain indicators are painting a sorry picture for the largest altcoin. After falling below $2,000, analysts say the possibility of ETH falling to $1,000 is highly likely. After losing over 6% over the day, the asset is trading at $2,045, triggering a resistance by investors to buy ETH. However, whales continue to scoop ETH at a discount while institutional interests inch forward. Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje attempted to rationalize Ethereum’s underperformance , citing a boatload of Layer 2 projects dumping the assets. For Cronje, a below-par user experience contributes to waning interest in Ethereum with rising competition from newer blockchains. Cronje shut down speculation that he could buy ETH, noting that the project’s roadmap and lack of clear representation are major stumbling blocks. “Hell, I don’t invest, but if I did, I would choose Solana, Tron, and XRP over ETH,” remarked Cronje.

The decentralized lending project has captured more than $2.5 million investment which attracted 4,600 token holders into its system that unites decentralized finance with tokenomic structures. Phase 2 has reached 75% completion and provides a shrinking opportunity for investors to buy tokens at the current market-low price which will quickly become important for immediate substantial ROI gains. Experts agree that the upcoming exchange listing will occur at $0.06 and this will generate instant 400% returns for investors. External forecasts indicate an astonishing rise of MUTM tokens to $3.50 during 2025 which spurs strategic investors to buy immediately. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has exceeded all initial market prediction levels because its presale program gives first adopters increased benefits. The opening phase reached its maximum capacity quickly and now during the present phase tokens cost $0.015. The approaching Phase 3 increase will double the existing pricing and makes unwillingness to participate increasingly perilous. New investors who join now will profit from the current $0.015 market value plus attain the future $0.06 per token price which represents a total four times better value than present pricing. The market experiences heightened pressure because of this multiple-level pricing system which adds a $100,000 worth of incentives for early investors. The current Phase 2 fundraise has brought in over $1.5 million while displaying a quickly rising level of investor agreement that failing to engage now will result in lost exceptional market possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers an appeal based on its buy-and-distribute model that allocates platform earnings for continuous perpetual token acquisitions. The mechanism of platform revenue purchase drives an ongoing support of mtToken stakers through continuous buying and caps potential selling activities. The protocol features integration between its lending features which let users stake ETH and DAI to obtain interest-bearing mtTokens. The collected value of these tokens grows steadily until they reach full value through passive operations that maintain decentralized assets while other tokens have no functional use. System stability emerges from borrowers who obtain loans through positions requiring more collateral than the requested amount which strengthens lender confidence. MUTM stands unique among DeFi assets because its combined earning potential and borrowing attributes create a valuable and scarce instrument. Post-Launch Trajectory Sparks Optimism The $0.06 initial listing price at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates immediate profitability opportunities but users already perceive MUTM as resembling established leaders in DeFi. The predictions for MUTM’s price growth to $3.50 in 2025 would generate a staggering 23,233% profit from its current presale value. Platform analysts base their overcollateralized stablecoin and peer-to-peer lending estimates on future MUTM platform development plans for niche assets and stablecoin releases. The value of MUTM depends on user growth and earned revenue since experts describe this presale foundation as “unusually robust” for projects at this development stage. The token builds credibility through stake rewards and adjustable interest rates and security audits and retains its path as a successor of established crypto projects by adopting transparent systems. Investors now have limited opportunity to take advantage of the Phase 2 pricing at $0.015. The time has arrived for investors to confirm their position ahead of the price increase since MUTM continues its upward trajectory. The official portal of Mutuum Finance currently awaits visitors who want to take part in the financing opportunity before upcoming market changes occur.

Currently, that standout is BlockDAG (BDAG) , which has accumulated $201 million across 27 presale batches, marking a 2,380% price increase from its initial batch. With rising scrutiny in the crypto space, security concerns often accompany new projects. BlockDAG is proactively addressing this by undergoing rigorous audits by two well-known firms—Halborn and Certik. But what sets BlockDAG apart, making analysts project a potential 30,000x ROI? Let’s dive in. Advancing Crypto with DAG and Hybrid PoW Technology BlockDAG brings a fresh approach to blockchain technology with its DAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchain structures, which process blocks in a linear sequence, DAG’s framework allows each block to link to multiple previous ones. This structure improves scalability by permitting multiple validators to add blocks simultaneously, enhancing the system’s efficiency. Another significant feature is BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. This method further boosts scalability by optimizing transaction validation. The system currently supports a speed of 10 blocks per second, with the capability to scale beyond 100 blocks per second in future updates. Halborn Audit Confirms BlockDAG’s Strong Security Framework BlockDAG is not just about speed and scalability—it places significant importance on security. To ensure the network’s resilience against threats, BlockDAG has implemented a layered security strategy. This began with an internal assessment, followed by a comprehensive review by two of the most recognized auditing firms, Halborn and Certik. Halborn was the first to conduct an extensive evaluation, focusing on BlockDAG’s smart contracts and infrastructure. Once the findings were reviewed, BlockDAG swiftly addressed any identified areas of improvement, strengthening its security. Halborn’s audit report is accessible to the public, reinforcing the project’s commitment to transparency. Following this, Certik was engaged to conduct a secondary audit, ensuring an even more rigorous assessment. While this process is ongoing, the additional evaluation further solidifies BlockDAG’s security measures. As the final step in its security initiative, BlockDAG plans to launch a bug bounty program in collaboration with HackerOne. Security is a continuous process, and BlockDAG remains committed to maintaining and improving its protective measures as it moves toward its mainnet launch this year. BlockDAG’s Presale Gains Momentum— Is 30,000x ROI Achievable? With its advanced technology and structured security measures, BlockDAG’s presale success is not by chance—it is a result of calculated planning and execution. Crypto buyers are capitalizing on the potential, rapidly acquiring BDAG coins. Over 18.6 billion coins have been sold, raising $201 million in presale. Currently, in its 27th batch, BlockDAG is priced at $0.0248. Those who purchased BDAG early in batch one have already witnessed a 2,380% return. Experts anticipate that once the mainnet launches this year, BDAG’s price could reach $1, reflecting strong confidence in the project. Given its current price momentum, extensive security framework, and exceptional scalability, the possibility of achieving a 30,000x ROI appears within reach. For those looking to accumulate a promising digital asset in 2025, BlockDAG presents a compelling opportunity. Long Story Short! BlockDAG is making strides in security and scalability, pushing the boundaries of what blockchain can achieve. With its ability to process 10 blocks per second and plans to scale beyond 100 blocks, it offers a powerful framework for long-term growth. Alongside its scalability, BlockDAG has placed security at the forefront, undergoing thorough evaluations from respected audit firms. Taking a proactive approach to vulnerability assessments ensures ongoing protection and reliability. Beyond technical achievements, BlockDAG’s crypto presale has drawn immense interest, reaching $201 million in sales. Analysts predict that once the mainnet goes live, BDAG could reach $1, setting the stage for long-term success. The potential for a 30,000x ROI remains an enticing possibility, making BlockDAG a project worth following closely before it gains mainstream traction.

Despite strong bullish factors over the past week, its recent price movement is far from the high expectations set by analysts following the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Bitcoin Drops Over 6% Bitcoin is currently trading at $80,909, down over 6% in the past day. Bitcoin has dropped 3.37% over the past week, with trading volumes down 53%. Despite the declining figures, Bitcoin whales are actively buying, accumulating more than 22,000 BTC in just three days. Whales have bought over 22,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/gVuFsijOqt — Ali (@ali_charts) March 9, 2025 Despite a week full of positive news, including the signing of an executive order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a Crypto Summit at the White House, and encouraging statements from the OCC, Bitcoin’s price is unexpectedly falling and could drop below $80K. The Out-of-sync Price Action! On March 7, President Trump signed an executive order to use seized Bitcoin rather than purchasing it from the market. This move caused Bitcoin’s price to drop over 6%, from $90,400 to $84,979. “The knee-jerk reaction lower likely stems from the realization that no actual budget has been allocated for BTC purchases in the near term,” QCP Capital shared in a recent note . However, it also noted that while this wasn’t the bullish catalyst as many expected, it’s still positive for crypto. The risk of random Silkroad BTC sales disrupting the market is gone, and the U.S. government has reaffirmed its commitment to a long-term crypto strategy, it noted. An analyst expressed surprise, saying that in his 8 years with Bitcoin, he never saw the price action so out of sync with the news. This week was one of the most bullish in Bitcoin’s history, yet the market is facing decline. What is Causing The Drop? Several factors are behind Bitcoin’s recent price drop. Macroeconomic issues, like new tariffs from the US, have sparked sell-offs in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Besides, the release of the non-farm payrolls (NFP) report on Friday suggests that the Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy, which could hurt Bitcoin’s price. Experts noted that while the executive order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the Crypto Summit were positive, the lack of concrete policies might have cooled investor enthusiasm. Besides, Bitcoin’s decline is also dragging altcoins down, with ETH, XRP, and BNB losing over 6%, 6% and 4% respectively in the last 24 hours.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-10 02:30:44

In the past 24 hours, the market downturn caused $616 million in liquidations, with long positions taking the biggest hit at $540 million. Bitcoin alone saw $231 million in losses. Trump Says There Might Be Some Disruption In his Fox News appearance on Sunday, President Donald Trump addressed the potential effects of his policies, including tariffs and budget cuts. When asked about the impact, he acknowledged that there could be some short-term disruptions but emphasized the long-term vision behind his approach. “There might be some disruption. China has a 100-year plan, while we focus on quarterly results. What we’re doing is laying the groundwork for the future,” he said. Trump’s Approach Compared To Former Fed Chair’s Trump’s comments were dubbed “Volckering” on social media, likening his approach to that of former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in the 1980s. Volcker raised interest rates to extreme levels to combat persistent inflation, fully aware that it would trigger harsh recession. His tough measures eventually broke inflation and set the stage for long-term economic growth. The comparison suggests that Trump’s policies, while disruptive now, could have long-term benefits. The recent decline in Bitcoin comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China are set to worsen on Monday, with Beijing imposing tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods in response to President Trump’s latest import hike.

David Sacks, appointed as 'Crypto & AI Czar,' divested from Bitwise's Crypto Index Fund to avoid conflicts of interest, fueling speculation about the government's crypto reserve plans. Despite initial speculation, the exact cryptocurrencies included in the reserve were Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple XRP, Solana, and Cardano, leading to mixed investment outcomes. The executive order restricts the government from significantly impacting the Bitcoin market and mandates budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional BTC. This has led to a let-down of expectations, which may fuel further short-term losses in the crypto market, but may be a positive in the long run. Introduction Over the last few months, politics have caused volatility to rise . This is especially true over the last two weeks. Much of this volatility has to do with the uncertainty around certain assets that were caught up in the 'Trump Trade,' or assets that were popular with now-President Trump on his campaign trail. Bitcoin was a large part of the Trump Trade. On the campaign trail, in late September 2024, Trump posted: X (Twitter) The world began to speculate on what cryptocurrencies would make the list for this kind of project, and who would decide its form. The Crypto Czar Skip to December 2024 with the appointment of David Sacks as 'Crypto & AI Czar,' or the lead advisor to the President on matters of cryptocurrencies and AI. Sacks is notable for a few things, like being one of the founders of PayPal ( PYPL ). Also notable is that since 2017, he has been running a venture capital firm called Craft Ventures. It, alongside Sacks himself, were first-round investors in Bitwise's Crypto Index Fund (BITW), (that I gave a sell rating to recently), which now trades on the OTC market. It is an actively managed fund diversified across several cryptocurrencies. Sacks and his firm invested in 2017 in this fund when it was a private vehicle. Craft Ventures and Sacks have both divested from the Bitwise fund since January 2025, presumably before President Trump was inaugurated, to avoid conflicts of interest. This fueled speculation that the government really would go through with a crypto reserve fund, and that Sacks was needing to divest from this exactly because he would be doing activities that would promote them in his new role as Crypto Czar. Craft Ventures Possible Inclusions Looking at Bitwise's fund, we can identify what assets Sacks may advise a crypto stockpile to invest in; we are effectively looking at what he was invested in with his own money. Here are all the holdings above 1% NAV in BITW. Bitwise Immediate suspects for a digital asset stockpile are Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Ripple XRP ( XRP-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), and Cardano ( ADA-USD ). These are not necessarily the top cryptocurrencies by market weight, for the record. I discuss that further in my article on BITW , but I won't go into any further for our purposes here. What's important to note from this is that speculators have been buying up these cryptocurrencies in advance of several key announcements post-inauguration that would boost these assets. The 1st Batch of Executive Orders Skip to January 2025, when President Trump is in office. He signs two executive orders, one creating a US Sovereign Wealth Fund ('SWF'), and another creating a committee to work on a 'digital asset stockpile.' In an article I published last month , I discussed the potential for a positive price impact on Bitcoin from this move, and other cryptocurrencies that are added to the stockpile. Specifically, I speculated: I wouldn't put it far off for a US-based SWF with this current administration to tangle itself up with [ this order ] and help with establishing said stockpile. The US already has significant Bitcoin reserves, which it has seized from criminals. While the US has already auctioned off and returned much of its reserves, the government still has over 100,000 BTC in its possession, which represents over $9B in assets. To make this more substantial as a strategic reserve, it would stand to reason that the government, either through the SWF or through the treasury directly, would buy Bitcoin. Since then, we've gotten more clarity on what digital assets would be included, dissipating much of the speculation surrounding Sacks and Bitwise. On March 2nd, President Trump posted about the exact currencies that would be in the reserve: Truth Social Since Sacks was confirmed in December, if you had picked up on the investment in BITW (I did not, for the record), the various cryptocurrencies have been mixed. This has been disappointing for investors. Data by YCharts It was interesting to see it play out, as President Trump's messages named the exact top five holdings of BITW. Yet, despite the spike from the initial rush after the post on March 2nd, the assets are still relatively depressed. The 2nd Batch of Executive Orders On March 6th, President Donald Trump signed a follow-up executive order to the order that established a Digital Asset Stockpile committee. It was now time for that committee to act. The order was titled: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE AND UNITED STATES DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE Here is what the order authorizes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to do: ...establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"" capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings... ...establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the ""United States Digital Asset Stockpile,"" capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings... ...develop strategies for acquiring additional Government BTC provided that such strategies are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers. However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. Immediately, I understand why all the hype is gone. The specific wording of the act essentially orders the Treasury Secretary to collect all the Bitcoin and other assets already owned by the US in its stockpiles of seized assets and rename it into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This explicitly does not authorize the purchase of any Bitcoin at all. It does do something, which is that it stops the sale of any more Bitcoin or other assets out of the US accounts, which were previously being auctioned. It should be of note that basically all financial assets seized by the government end up at auction, to allow the government to recoup some money from criminal activities that they seized the assets from. This order disallows future auctions of seized Bitcoin, leaving the government's approximately $9B stockpile stagnant. The order only authorizes the assets to come from particular channels; seizures and forfeiture. This is in no way is what the market expected. The initial narrative had been all about the US investing in cryptocurrencies, not necessarily just holding on to existing stores. This was a neutered version of what was expected, and has not corrected the downturn since the highs of late January. Digital Asset Summit Fast-forward to the most recent update, on March 7th, where President Trump was speaking at the White House Digital Asset Summit, put together by David Sacks, the Crypto & AI Czar. Not much of substance pertaining to the fund itself was mentioned, but here are some of the main points President Trump and his cabinet made at the address: The US government will stop all sales of crypto assets, in favor of holding them instead. This will be funded through the existing stockpile. The Treasury will work toward deregulating cryptocurrency more broadly. They are primarily concerned with stable coins. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will not be at the cost of taxpayers. None of this seemed particularly bullish for the price of the coins, and definitely not for the alt-coins mentioned earlier, like SOL and ADA. Ultimately, I see this as being bullish for cryptocurrency-based business more than anything. The biggest winner at the summit was not someone who spoke, but someone who was there: Brian Armstrong. He is the CEO of Coinbase ( COIN ), one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. He remarked : [Emerging regulatory clarity] is directly translating to economic growth in the U.S. For instance, Coinbase plans to hire about 1,000 employees in the U.S. this year as a result of this renewed growth. The more normalized crypto is within financial markets, and the easier it is to do business in crypto, the more money exchanges like COIN make. This may not impact the price of Bitcoin very much, which is largely dictated by speculation and less by fundamentals like how much traffic the network sees or how much money is tied up on exchanges. Conclusion Ultimately, it looks a little foolish in hindsight to have bet on the government, being as irresponsible as to speculate on cryptocurrencies through direct investments. Instead, the cryptocurrency market has fallen despite all the news and buzz around the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It seems that this wasn't the play, at least not in the short term, despite the positive backing from the new administration. For now, it seems like the best investment is to stay with Bitcoin alone or to invest in Bitcoin-adjacent companies like Coinbase, who will benefit from the new regulatory environment, and to ignore the noise from politics. While initially promising, the ideas that were presented on the campaign trail have not resulted in the paradigm shift that many investors were pricing in back in January. For this reason, I would not advise betting on the proposed alt-coins for the Digital Asset Stockpile. They are unlikely to see any market influence from this move by the government. It's now more clear from the latest developments that the administration is not coming to buy anything from the marketplace, and is not going to put any positive pressure on the cryptocurrency market. While the lack of US government auctions may be a positive for markets, since it reduces supply, it may not be enough to deeply influence the crypto market. These coins may continue to fall despite positive developments toward this project. Currently, I am getting my Bitcoin exposure through MAXI . I am still long Bitcoin, but I have limited my exposure and monitor it closely. I suggest investors do the same at the current moment.

Traders and investors are left jittering as even major-league altcoins Solana and XRP lost alarming values despite a ‘crypto stockpile’ and a strategic Bitcoin reserve announcement by Donald Trump last week. Crypto Market Today: Here’s Why Bitcoin & Major Altcoins Are Falling The global crypto market lost 4.83% over the past day, as indicated by a diminished market cap of $2.69 trillion. Further, liquidations in the past 24 hours totaled over $600 million, per Coinglass data , underscoring heat on prices. Analyst Ali Martinez revealed that over $1 billion in Bitcoin long positions have been liquidated recently, aligning with the market volatility. Source: Ali Charts, X On the other hand, the release of the non-farm payrolls (NFP) report on Friday hinted that a hawkish stance by the Feds could be on the horizon again. Coupled with the macro heat due to Trump’s tariff saga this month, these factors present risk assets with severe market pressure. BTC Price Brushes $80K Low BTC price dropped nearly 5% as of press time and exchanged hands at $82,033. The flagship coin hit an intraday bottom of $80,052.49 after falling from $86,146.15. The latest Coinglass data indicated that $237.60 million was liquidated in the Bitcoin market intraday. Nevertheless, the coin’s market dominance remained up by 0.03%, pointing towards a more volatile alts sector. ETH Price Reverses 6% ETH price lost nearly 6% in the past 24 hours and exchanged hands at $2,062. The coin bottomed and peaked at $1,991.19 and $2,194.89 intraday. Ethereum slips alongside $107.56 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. ETH’s market dominance rested at 9.2% today . XRP Price Falls 6% XRP price fell nearly 6% in the past 24 hours and exchanged hands at $2.18. The coin hit a low and a peak of $2.09 and $2.34 in the past 24 hours. Ripple’s coin recorded only $30.34 million worth of liquidations, despite which the price slumps. SOL Price Loses 8% SOL price lost nearly 8% value as of press time and closed in at $127.5. Its intraday bottom and peak were $124.38 and $139.73, respectively. Solana recorded $26.6 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours, with its price dipping in tandem with the broader trend. Meme Crypto Market Also Wanes Dogecoin (DOGE) price fell 10% in the past 24 hours and traded at $0.1718. Shiba Inu (SHIB) price cracked 4% and exchanged hands at $0.00001208. Pepe Coin (PEPE) and TRUMP crashed over 9% and are sitting at $0.000005960 and $10.97, respectively. Leading meme coins also sink in sync with the broader market trend. Top Gainers In Crypto Market Today Some tokens have defied the broader market trend to trade in the green zone today. These are: Story (IP) Price: $5.23 24-Hour Gains: +9% UNUS SED LEO (LEO) Price: $9.83 24-Hour Gains: +0.5% Top Losers In Crypto Market Today JasmyCoin (JASMY) Price: $0.01363 24-Hour Loss: -15% Injective (INJ) Price: $9.66 24-Hour Loss: -13% Render (RENDER) Price: $3.05 24-Hour Loss: -12% Overall, the current market action has pushed investors to stay cautious despite pro-crypto advancements in the U.S. However, some market experts sighed in relief as the U.S. government announced it wouldn’t sell the nearly 200,000 Bitcoins acquired by Silk Road and would include it in its reserve, negating mass sell-off concerns. On the other hand, whales continue to buy the dip, sparking contrary market speculations as a sustained volatile trend prevails despite broader crypto advancements.

Arctic Pablo Coin Offers a New Shot at 11,285% ROI",https://thecoinrise.com/did-you-miss-dogecoins-early-days-arctic-pablo-coin-offers-a-new-shot-at-11285-roi/,"The cryptocurrency world has seen its fair share of legendary success stories. One of the most famous is Dogecoin, which started as a joke but turned into a multi-billion-dollar digital asset. In its early days, Dogecoin was trading for mere fractions of a cent, and few believed it would ever gain real value. However, those who recognized its potential and invested early are now sitting on life-changing profits. But what about those who missed out? Fortunately, history has a way of repeating itself, and Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as a new opportunity among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now. Dogecoin’s Humble Beginnings and Astronomical Growth Back in 2013, Dogecoin entered the crypto market as a fun and lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. Its price was almost nonexistent at launch, trading for around $0.00026 per coin. Few investors took it seriously, but over time, Dogecoin built a massive community, securing a position among the top cryptocurrencies. Fast forward to 2021, and Dogecoin reached an all-time high of $0.73, creating millionaires out of early investors. A $100 investment in Dogecoin’s first days turned into more than $280,000 at its peak. Missed out on that explosive growth? That same level of opportunity is rare but not impossible to find. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin is proving to be an emerging powerhouse among Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, with an even more structured and calculated approach to building wealth for early investors. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Meme Coin With Unparalleled ROI Potential Unlike traditional meme coin presales, Arctic Pablo Coin is introducing a fresh and unique approach. Instead of staged price increases, its presale moves by locations, marking its journey across different destinations. Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin is at ChillVille, with a presale price of just $0.000070. With over $1.78 million raised, it’s clear that investors are flocking to what could be the next crypto sensation. Here’s where things get exciting: At launch, Arctic Pablo Coin will hit the market at $0.008. That’s an insane 11,285.71% ROI potential for those getting in at this stage. Imagine turning a small investment into something massive—just like Dogecoin’s earliest believers did. As one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about the hype. It integrates powerful tokenomics, a smart burning mechanism to sustain long-term value, and community-driven growth that builds a solid foundation for sustained expansion. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out Among the Best Meme Coins of 2025 Presale Without Stages: Unlike traditional presales that rely on static rounds, Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey-based model keeps engagement high and prices fair. Massive Growth Potential: Early investors are positioned to see jaw-dropping gains, similar to Dogecoin’s early adopters. Community-Driven Approach: The Arctic Pablo Coin movement is rapidly gaining traction as investors recognize its long-term potential. Burning Mechanism: A structured token burn ensures deflationary pressure, keeping supply in check and boosting long-term value. This is the kind of project that could define the future of meme coin investments, making it one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now before it reaches mass adoption. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let This Be Another Missed Opportunity Dogecoin’s early days were an incredible wealth-building opportunity, but not everyone recognized its potential in time. The same scenario is playing out now with Arctic Pablo Coin, and those who get in at ChillVille could be the next big winners. With a launch price of $0.008 and the potential for over 11,285% returns, the chance to invest early is slipping away fast. Crypto history rewards those who act, not those who hesitate. Arctic Pablo Coin is paving the way for a new wave of meme coin success, and its ongoing presale is the gateway to massive future gains. Investors looking for the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now should not overlook this.

Bitcoin has dropped by 4.8% to $81,729 , while Ethereum has taken an even bigger hit, falling 8% to hover around $2,000. Dogecoin is the biggest loser among the top 10 cryptos , sliding 13% to $0.16. Despite the hype around Trump’s Executive Order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , the market hasn’t responded positively. QCP Analysts believe this is because no actual budget has been allocated yet for Bitcoin purchases, causing uncertainty among investors. $334 Million Liquidation Shakes the Market With the changing current scenario, the market downturn has triggered massive liquidations, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP leading the sell-off. In the last 24 hours, liquidations have surpassed $334 million, affecting over 109,704 traders. Those who bet on price increases have taken the biggest hit. Crypto Market Sees $614.63M in Liquidations Amid Volatility In the past 24 hours, the crypto market experienced significant turbulence, with a total of $614.63M in liquidations, according to the latest Liquidation Heatmap data. pic.twitter.com/1ujSpwVgPb — AZCoin News (@azcoinnews) March 10, 2025 Bitcoin saw $186.35 million in liquidations, with long traders losing $123.21 million. Ethereum followed with $40.84 million in total liquidations, while XRP recorded a smaller $7.3 million in losses. Altcoins like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Sui (SUI), and Litecoin (LTC) also faced significant sell-offs, adding to the market’s instability. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Struggle Bitcoin has dropped by 3% in the past 24 hours, now trading at $86,409. Despite a 1.9% increase in the last week, the overall sentiment remains weak, with trading volume down by 24.63%. Ethereum has struggled to hold key support levels, currently battling to stay above $2,000. Analyst Ali Martinez has warned that if ETH drops below $2,114, it could test $1,250 in the coming weeks. XRP is also under pressure, down 7.31% in the last 24 hours to $2.36. The uncertainty surrounding the crypto reserve plan has only fueled further volatility. Crypto Reserve Plan Faces Pushback Trump’s proposal to include ADA, XRP, and SOL in the U.S. Strategic Reserve has faced resistance. Industry leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Real Vision’s Raoul Pal, believe Bitcoin should remain the primary reserve asset. Armstrong argued that Bitcoin is the clearest successor to gold, while Pal suggested a market-cap-weighted index instead of altcoin inclusion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : VanEck Proposes 6 Ways for U.S. to Buy Bitcoin Without Taxpayer Money , What’s brewing? Meanwhile, the U.S. government’s latest crypto disclosures reveal that it holds no SOL, ADA, or XRP, contradicting previous speculation. Following Trump’s Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Crypto Czar David Sacks clarified that while a digital asset stockpile will be created, it will only include assets obtained through forfeiture, with no new acquisitions. Onchain data confirms the government’s possession of 198,000 BTC but provides no evidence of ADA, XRP, or SOL holdings. Meanwhile, the government’s existing crypto reserves include 60,850 ETH ($122.96M), 122M USDT, and 40,293 BNB ($22.34M), among others. If liquidated, these assets could net around 5,004 BTC. Sacks hinted at reallocating some digital assets into Bitcoin for portfolio optimization, reinforcing the administration’s Bitcoin-focused strategy. With skepticism growing, the crypto reserve plan may struggle to gain traction, adding to market turbulence. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Celestia (TIA) and Injective (INJ) are encountering formidable resistance levels, creating a sense of uncertainty among investors. While traders pore over price charts, another pivotal issue emerges: the erosion of trust in online reviews. Web3Bay is addressing this critical problem head-on by utilizing blockchain technology to authenticate reviews, ensuring that only actual purchasers can post feedback. As Celestia and Injective strive to overcome technical obstacles, Web3Bay is focused on a mission just as vital—rebuilding trust in online shopping with a system that’s both transparent and verifiable. Celestia (TIA) Confronts a Crucial Resistance at $3.80 Celestia (TIA) is facing a recurring challenge to breach the resistance level at $3.80, with several attempts falling short of sustaining gains above this critical point. This resistance struggle indicates mounting selling pressure, potentially heralding a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency. If Celestia fails to secure a position above $3.80 convincingly, pessimistic sentiment could intensify, possibly leading to further price drops. Conversely, overcoming this threshold with substantial market support and volume might ignite a bullish trend, propelling prices upwards. Investors and traders are vigilantly monitoring Celestia’s price movements, watching key technical indicators like moving averages and the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and considering broader market influences such as Bitcoin’s performance and the general sentiment in the altcoin space. Given the unpredictable nature of its price trajectory, participants are encouraged to maintain caution and adhere to sound risk management practices in their investment decisions. Injective (INJ) Encounters a Stubborn Barrier at $16.30 Injective (INJ) has found it challenging to exceed the resistance zone between $15.909 and $16.30, repeatedly failing to push past $16.40 since early February. Despite these challenges, market analyst AMCrypto Alex points out that current technical indicators hint at a forthcoming breakout above this resistance. Currently trading at about $15.41, INJ’s repeated rejections at this level have shaped a pattern that, if surmounted, might signify a reversal of the recent downtrend. The overall positive market sentiment, supported by Injective’s robust fundamentals, suggests that bullish momentum could be rekindled. Moreover, the emergence of a falling wedge pattern, typically a bullish signal, enhances the likelihood of upward movement. Investors are advised to stay attentive to these developments, as a successful breach of the $16.30 resistance could lead to substantial gains. Web3Bay Reinvents Online Shopping with Blockchain-Verified Reviews The online shopping world has long grappled with the issue of fake reviews, often posted by bots or incentivized users rather than genuine customers. Web3Bay is tackling this challenge by implementing a blockchain-based review system that allows only verified purchasers to contribute feedback. This innovation not only combats review manipulation but also offers consumers reliable insights to inform their purchasing decisions. For businesses, this model offers a chance to establish credibility through genuine customer experiences, steering clear of artificial ratings or deceptive reviews. This paradigm shift also protects consumers from being misled by inflated product hype, fostering transparency across e-commerce platforms. As Web3Bay’s presale progresses, with over 400 million coins sold and $1.60 million raised, the interest in transparent online shopping continues to escalate. Web3Bay’s decentralized approach is poised to redefine the standards of trust in product ratings. Summing Up! As Celestia (TIA) and Injective (INJ) navigate through their respective resistance levels, investors are left evaluating potential market directions—breakouts or corrections. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is pioneering a crucial solution to a non-speculative problem—authenticating online reviews. Just as crypto traders seek confirmations for their strategies, online shoppers now benefit from a mechanism ensuring trust in product evaluations. Whether in the volatile spheres of financial markets or e-commerce, the importance of transparency remains paramount. While Celestia and Injective aim to surpass market barriers, Web3Bay is simplifying online shopping decisions by making reviews trustworthy and dependable.

However, as its price prediction for 2025 hovers around $5, analysts are questioning whether Pi Network (PI) can maintain its momentum, or if new competitors, like Coldware (COLD), will steal the show. Coldware (COLD): The Emerging Competitor Despite the success of Pi Network (PI), new competitors are entering the market, and Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a formidable rival. With its Layer 1 DePIN blockchain, Coldware (COLD) is offering solutions that are not only scalable but also provide real-world use cases. While Pi Network (PI) remains speculative and community-driven, Coldware (COLD) is carving a niche in the DeFi space, attracting whales and institutional investors. The real utility of Coldware (COLD) makes it a more appealing option for those seeking long-term investments. Coldware (COLD) is gaining traction as a secure and scalable alternative to speculative meme coins, positioning itself as a serious contender in the cryptocurrency market. Pi Network (PI): From Mobile Mining to Market Domination? When Pi Network (PI) first launched, it was met with skepticism. A mobile mining app that allowed users to mine coins using their smartphones seemed too good to be true. However, over the past few years, Pi Network (PI) has proven its resilience, expanding its user base and increasing its market capitalization significantly. Currently, Pi Network (PI) is trading at around $2 per coin, having surged recently after its listing on exchanges. The hype surrounding Pi Network (PI) is largely driven by its massive community and the anticipation of its mainnet launch. Analysts predict that the price of Pi Coin could hit $5 by 2025, driven by growing market interest and the eventual introduction of real-world utility. Pi Network (PI) and Coldware (COLD): A Battle for Dominance As Pi Network (PI) continues to rise in popularity, it faces increasing competition from Coldware (COLD). While Pi Network (PI) has the advantage of a massive user base, it must prove its real-world utility and scalability if it is to maintain its momentum. In contrast, Coldware (COLD) is focusing on providing tangible value with its DeFi ecosystem and Layer 1 blockchain, which could make it a strong contender for market leadership. Conclusion: Will Pi Network (PI) Maintain the Hype? As Pi Network (PI) continues to rise in value and reputation, analysts are divided on whether it will be able to sustain its success. While Coldware (COLD) presents a serious challenge, Pi Network (PI) has the potential to reach new heights, especially if it can successfully implement real-world applications and further expand its community. However, the competition is fierce, and Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a favorite among whales and institutional investors looking for long-term growth.

If history has taught us anything, it’s that early investors in meme coins often see ridiculous gains. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is proving that point being the top meme coin presale to buy right now, throwing out a massive 100% bonus on its presale. But here’s the kicker—it’s only available for a limited time. Meanwhile, AI16Z and SNEK have already cemented themselves as powerhouses in the meme coin ecosystem. They’ve held strong during market cycles, proving their staying power. But let’s be real—nothing gets the crypto crowd hyped quite like a high-reward presale, and BTFD Coin is delivering just that being the top meme coin presale to buy now. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin Movement That’s Rewarding Early Believers Forget waiting for dips—BTFD Coin is handing you the best entry point on a silver platter. The project is currently in its 14th presale stage, with over 71 billion BTFD coins sold to more than 11,300 holders. That’s $6.27 million raised and counting! If you act fast on this top meme coin presale to buy now, you can grab BTFD at just $0.00016 per coin before it jumps to $0.0006 at the end of the presale, promising a 275% ROI without the bonus—or an insane 550% ROI if you use the LAUNCH100 bonus code. And speaking of that 100% Bonus, here’s how it works: Buy BTFD tokens now, enter “LAUNCH100” at checkout, and DOUBLE the tokens. That means a $2,500 investment turns into $5,000 worth of BTFD instantly. At $0.0006 per coin post-presale, that $2,500 investment would be worth $9,375, and that’s before any market surge. BTFD’s Referral Program: Get Paid Just for Spreading the Word If you thought BTFD’s 100% bonus was the only reason to jump in on this top meme coin presale to buy, think again. The BTFD rewards program is making waves. The top 20 referrers earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens at the end of each month. That’s free tokens just for bringing others into the presale. And since this competition resets every month, there are continuous chances to stack up more rewards. Play2Earn Game: Earn While You Play The BTFD Play2Earn (P2E) Game’s full version has officially launched, and players are already cashing in. Gamers can earn BTFD Coins just by playing, making it a win-win for both crypto and gaming enthusiasts. This game isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a fully interactive way to earn rewards while being part of the BTFD movement. 90% APY Staking: A Meme Coin That Pays to Hold Holding BTFD isn’t just about riding the hype—it’s about making serious passive income. With a massive 90% APY staking reward, early holders get paid for simply holding onto their coins. That’s crypto working for you, ensuring that your BTFD stack keeps growing over time. Stage 13 Burn: A Supply Shock Incoming If you thought things couldn’t get crazier, here’s the latest bombshell—all unsold tokens from Stage 13 have been burned. That’s millions of BTFD Coins permanently removed from circulation, tightening the supply and increasing demand. This isn’t just a smart move; it’s a textbook setup for explosive price action when BTFD finally hits exchanges. AI16Z (ElizaOS): AI Meets Meme Coin Hype AI16Z, now known as ElizaOS, isn’t your standard meme coin. This project has positioned itself as the go-to AI-powered token, integrating artificial intelligence into the blockchain world. Unlike traditional meme coins, AI16Z leverages AI-driven trading bots, smart contract optimizations, and automated market strategies. The crypto crowd has been all-in on AI projects, and AI16Z has made sure it stays in the mix. Investors see it as a long-term hold, capitalizing on both the meme coin hype and AI advancements. SNEK: The Cardano-Based Meme Titan SNEK has become a dominant meme coin on the Cardano network and for good reason. With a community-driven approach and strategic supply burns, it has managed to stay relevant while others have faded. Cardano enthusiasts love SNEK for its decentralized roots, and it continues to be one of the most talked-about meme coins in ADA-based circles. But here’s the reality—SNEK is already established. While it has room to grow, it’s not in the presale phase like BTFD, meaning the biggest multipliers have already been realized. Early-stage investors are now looking at BTFD to repeat the success stories of SNEK and AI16Z. Final Call: This is Your Moment to Move! Based on market trends and historical data, early meme coin presale investors have consistently outperformed those who wait for exchange listings. The opportunity in front of you in the form of the top meme coin presale to buy now with BTFD’s 100% bonus, referral rewards, staking, and P2E game is one of the biggest we’ve seen in 2025. With the presale already in Stage 14, and prices set to jump from $0.00016 to $0.0006, there’s only a small window left to lock in this 550% ROI opportunity. The Stage 13 token burn means supply is tightening, and the next wave of buyers will be paying significantly more. No more waiting. No more second-guessing. This is how meme coin wealth is built. Join the BTFD presale now, enter LAUNCH100, and claim your 100% bonus before it’s gone.

The overall crypto market crash over the last 24 hours has eroded more than $170 billion of investors’ wealth with market analysts predicting more pain ahead. Will Bitcoin Price Crash to $75,000? Bitcoin price has once again come under heavy selling pressure, facing strong rejection at $92,500 and extending weekly losses to more than 11.15%. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that over $1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) long positions were liquidated today. The massive liquidation highlights the intense market volatility currently impacting the cryptocurrency sector. Source: Ali Martinez Bitcoin Forms a Bearish Pennant Says Peter Brandt Veteran trader Peter Brandt has shared a technical analysis suggesting the recent Bitcoin price action confirms a bearish outlook. In the latest chart structure, Brandt has identified three critical technical developments hinting at further downside pressure. Market completes double top. Top retested by pennant. Pennant completed, confirms bearish chart Bitcoin (BTC). Source: Peter Brandt The analysis highlights a double top formation with peaks reaching approximately $108,100, followed by a bearish pennant pattern. According to Brandt, Bitcoin made a “deep retest” of its previous high near $95,321 before breaking down through the pennant formation. The chart also indicates that Bitcoin price found temporary support at $81,513 following the breakdown, but the completion of the bearish pattern suggests further downside potential. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes also believes that there could be more pain left ahead for BTC. He wrote: “An ugly start to the week. Looks like $BTC will retest $78k. If it fails, $75k is next in the crosshairs. There are a lot of options OI struck $70-$75k, if we get into that range it will be violent”. Will BTC Enter Bear Market After US CPI? Several market analysts believe that Bitcoin is finally entering a bear market as market sentiment deteriorates despite the launch of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve . Furthermore, the initiative has revealed an apparent lack of intent to purchase anything beyond seized BTC. On the other hand, institutional demand for Bitcoin has dried up significantly, as evident by the massive outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. Between March 3 and March 7 (ET), Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced significant outflows, signaling waning investor sentiment in the market. Data shows a net outflow of $799 million during the period, with Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) accounting for $201 million of the total. All eyes will be on the US CPI data for February coming this week, ahead of March 12. February’s U.S. consumer price data is expected to reflect gradual progress in controlling inflation, a key concern for Federal Reserve policymakers. The central bank may opt to maintain a cautious stance, monitoring the broader economic landscape amid evolving fiscal policies. According to projections, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) excluding food and energy likely increased by 0.3% , as per a Bloomberg survey of economists.

Among the top projects generating buzz are Pi Network (PI) and Coldware (COLD), two Web3 altcoins vying for attention from investors and traders alike. As Donald Trump prepares for his next crypto announcement, both Pi Network and Coldware (COLD) are positioning themselves to benefit from the anticipated changes. In this article, we explore why Coldware (COLD) could potentially be the best altcoin to buy before Trump’s next big announcement, while also examining Pi Network’s (PI) market entry and growth potential. Coldware (COLD): A Strong Competitor in the DeFi Space While Pi Network (PI) has made impressive strides, a new Web3 altcoin, Coldware (COLD), has emerged as a serious contender in the DeFi space. Coldware (COLD) is a Layer 1 DePIN blockchain, offering unique solutions for decentralized finance, scalability, and security. Coldware (COLD) distinguishes itself from Pi Network (PI) by not only leveraging mobile mining but also providing a robust and functional ecosystem that supports real financial services such as staking, yield farming, and decentralized lending. The key unique selling proposition (USP) of Coldware (COLD) lies in its security and scalability. It provides institutions and whales with a platform that is both secure and efficient for handling high transaction volumes. Coldware (COLD) also stands out because of its tokenomics, which incentivize users to stake and earn rewards while contributing to the ecosystem’s growth. With Coldware (COLD), investors can expect to benefit not only from speculative gains but also from long-term value, backed by real-world applications and a sustainable economic model. Pi Network (PI): A Revolutionary Shift in Mining Launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, Pi Network promised to revolutionize cryptocurrency mining by enabling users to mine crypto via smartphones with minimal energy consumption. While initially met with skepticism, Pi Network made waves in the crypto community by offering mining capabilities to anyone with a smartphone, challenging the traditional mining ecosystem that requires expensive and specialized hardware. Since transitioning to an Open Network in February 2025, Pi Network has experienced notable growth. The Pi Coinquickly surged to over $2 on various exchanges, sparking excitement among its vast user base. The network now boasts over 70 million users, with millions of them having completed the required KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process. Market Momentum for Pi Network (PI) As Pi Coin becomes more accessible through exchanges like OKX and MEXC, investors are eagerly watching its price movements. Currently trading at around $1.87, Pi Coin has the potential to reach $5 by April 2025, given its strong community backing, the increasing number of dApps, and the possibility of further exchange listings. One of the significant factors that could influence Pi Network’s (PI) price is real-world adoption. While Pi Coin has grown in popularity, its ability to achieve meaningful use cases in commerce and services will be a critical determinant of its price trajectory. Additionally, new exchange listings such as Binance could provide substantial liquidity and market visibility, potentially pushing Pi Coin’s value to higher levels. Trump’s Crypto Announcement and What It Means for Pi Network and Coldware Donald Trump’s upcoming crypto announcement could have significant implications for the market. As the former president has expressed interest in establishing the United States as a global crypto leader, his upcoming statements are likely to focus on regulatory clarity for digital assets and the potential for creating a crypto reserve. This announcement may spur market movements and attract new capital to certain crypto projects. Pi Network (PI), with its rapidly expanding user base and promising real-world applications, could see a surge in demand if Trump’s announcement includes favorable policies for retail-friendly coins. On the other hand, Coldware (COLD) could benefit from institutional support, especially if the US government pushes for innovative DeFi solutions to be integrated into the broader financial ecosystem. Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) as the Best Web3 Altcoin With both Pi Network (PI) and Coldware (COLD) making waves in the crypto space, Coldware (COLD) stands out as a solid investment opportunity ahead of Trump’s announcement. As a Layer 1 DePIN platform offering robust DeFi solutions and a secure, scalable blockchain, Coldware (COLD) is positioned to benefit not only from speculation but also from real-world adoption in the growing Web3 ecosystem. Investors looking to capitalize on the next big Web3 altcoin before Trump’s crypto announcement should strongly consider Coldware (COLD), which offers both stability and growth potential as a Layer 1 blockchain built for the future of decentralized finance.

Binance, the world’s largest centralized exchange, is adjusting its token listing process by introducing a community co-governance structure, allowing users to vote on which tokens should be listed or delisted. Meanwhile, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) is urging Elon Musk to take stronger action against bots on X, which continue to spread scams and misinformation, particularly in the crypto space. Binance Introduces Community Co-Governance Model for Token Listings Amid Surging Crypto Growth Binance, the world's largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a community co-governance structure that will allow its users to vote on the listing and delisting of tokens. This move comes as the industry grapples with an explosion in new cryptocurrency projects, making it increasingly difficult for exchanges to maintain quality control and regulatory compliance. According to Binance's announcement, the exchange will pre-select projects that will be put up for a community vote. The tokens that receive the most votes from Binance users will then undergo a due diligence process before being listed on the platform. Additionally, Binance has introduced a ”monitoring zone” for projects that fail to meet community and exchange standards. Projects can be placed in this category if they: Fail to provide regular progress updates or disclose necessary token information. Engage in malfeasance or unethical behavior. Have inactive developer teams and communities. Once a project is added to the monitoring zone, Binance users will have the ability to vote on whether to delist it from the exchange. This system introduces a crowdsourced accountability mechanism, where projects must maintain engagement and transparency to retain their listings. Binance's decision to introduce community voting comes as the number of cryptocurrency tokens has skyrocketed. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the number of unique digital assets increased from 11 million on Feb. 8 to 12.4 million today—a massive surge in just a few months. The rapid expansion of token offerings has created challenges for major exchanges, as they struggle to vet and evaluate new projects effectively. The influx of low-quality or scam tokens has led to concerns about market dilution, potentially affecting investor confidence and price stability across the broader crypto market. Binance is not alone in reconsidering its approach to token listings. In a Jan. 24 post on X, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong highlighted the difficulties of manually evaluating the overwhelming number of new tokens. ”We need to rethink our listing process at Coinbase given there are [roughly] 1 million tokens a week being created now, and growing — high-quality problem to have — but evaluating each one by one is no longer feasible,” Armstrong said. Armstrong further suggested that regulatory frameworks need to evolve to accommodate the growing scale of the crypto industry, stating that applying for approval for each token is impractical under current models. Coinbase is now exploring a hybrid model that incorporates allow-lists, block-lists, community reviews, and on-chain data to determine which projects are suitable for listing. What This Means for Crypto Traders and Projects The introduction of a community co-governance model at Binance marks a major shift in how centralized exchanges interact with users and projects. While Binance has always maintained a dominant position in the crypto exchange space, this new approach could signal a broader trend toward more decentralized and community-driven decision-making. For crypto traders, this model presents both opportunities and risks: More control over listings: Traders will have a direct say in which projects are added or removed, potentially leading to more democratic and transparent listings. Increased accountability: Projects will be under greater pressure to maintain transparency and engagement to avoid getting delisted. Potential manipulation risks: If not implemented carefully, community votes could be manipulated by large token holders or coordinated groups, leading to unfair delistings or spammed listings. The crypto industry's growth is outpacing traditional regulatory and operational models, forcing major players like Binance and Coinbase to experiment with new approaches. Binance's community co-governance initiative represents an attempt to balance decentralization with due diligence, giving users a more active role while maintaining standards for token quality. Whether this model proves to be effective, scalable, and resistant to manipulation remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: as the crypto landscape continues to evolve, exchanges must adapt or risk becoming obsolete. CZ Urges Elon Musk to Ban Bots from X as Crypto Scams Surge In related news, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has once again called on Elon Musk to take decisive action against bots on X, which have long plagued the platform, especially within the crypto community. In a March 9 post, CZ suggested that while users should be allowed to copy and paste AI-generated content, automated API posting should be disabled to curb bot activity. This renewed call for action comes amid growing concerns about crypto scams, phishing attacks, and pump-and-dump schemes, all of which have been amplified by armies of automated bots posing as real users. CZ’s March 9 X post directly addressed Musk, urging him to clamp down on bot activity, ”If someone uses Grok, ChatGPT, or DeepSeek to generate a tweet and copy and paste it here, fine, but API posting should be disabled.” CZ later clarified that while AI agents—which can assist with tasks like hotel bookings and code writing—are useful, social media bots serve no constructive purpose. Instead, they contribute to widespread spam, deception, and manipulation in online discourse. The bot epidemic on X is particularly severe in the cryptocurrency space, where malicious actors use fake accounts to spread phishing links, impersonate influencers, and manipulate token prices. These scams often involve: Fake token promotions promising high returns to lure unsuspecting investors. Phishing links directing users to fraudulent websites designed to steal funds. Pump-and-dump schemes, where bots artificially inflate a token’s price by spamming misleading information. According to a 2023 study by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), bots have played a key role in manipulating altcoin prices, coordinating posts across thousands of fake accounts to generate artificial hype. Ever since Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in 2022, the crypto community has been pressing him to eliminate bots from the platform. While Musk has acknowledged the problem, efforts to curb bot activity have had mixed results. Musk’s proposals to combat bots have included: Requiring users to register a credit card to create new accounts, thereby adding a small financial barrier to mass bot creation. Introducing paid verification (Twitter Blue) to make it harder for bots to pass as real users. Enhancing AI-based bot detection systems to automatically flag and remove suspicious accounts. Despite these measures, bots continue to thrive on X, often adapting to changes faster than detection systems can respond. Romance Scams and AI-Powered Fraud on the Rise Beyond simple spam and phishing, AI-powered chatbots have also contributed to more sophisticated fraud schemes. One such example is the ”pig butchering” scam, a long-term con in which scammers pretend to form romantic relationships with victims, gradually convincing them to invest in fake cryptocurrency projects. According to Cyvers, crypto romance scams stole an estimated $5.5 billion from investors in 2024 alone. These scams take advantage of AI chatbots that can engage in human-like conversations, building trust with victims before orchestrating financial fraud. While CZ’s proposal to ban API-based bot posting could help mitigate some of the problem, it is unclear whether Musk and X will take action. Completely banning API posting could hinder legitimate automation on the platform, including useful bots that provide news updates, crypto price alerts, and trading signals. Moreover, scammers and bot farms have repeatedly demonstrated an ability to adapt to countermeasures, often creating more sophisticated versions of automated accounts that mimic human behavior. For now, the bot problem remains a significant issue, particularly in the crypto space, where investors are at constant risk of falling victim to scams. As industry leaders like CZ continue to push for change, the question remains: Will Musk finally take decisive action, or will bots continue to run rampant on X?",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-10 05:30:00

Most of the tokens rise and fall, but two projects remain in the spotlight for the potential they show. Cardano has weathered the fluctuations of the markets, entrancing traders with its technical merits. Remittix, a new payments-focused platform is also gaining steam, gaining plaudits for its practical applications. As next year’s trends start to take shape, these two projects head the pack. One of them has a track record of building solid foundations, and the other introduces a fresh twist to cross-border finance. With a focus on real utility, they have the potential to outlast the short-term hype. Here are five of the most important reasons why investors believe that Cardano and this new PayFi solution have the potential to be among the best of 2025. Cardano’s Market Potential and Path to $1.2 Cardano (ADA) has seen price swings that tested investors’ resolve, but some analysts perceive the drops as temporary. Following a massive rally in the first half of the year, ADA retraced to a familiar price level. Still, chart watchers say it could trend to the $1.2 level if bulls succeed in sustaining key support around $0.78 to make it a good investment. Also, the narrow trading range is indicated by the market structure. Regardless of Cardano’s failure to break out, a strong uptrend on the Directional Movement Index (DMI) signals sustained positive momentum. Still, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) signals subdued buying interest, meaning that ADA may remain in its current range unless enthusiasm improves. If sentiment becomes more positive in general—especially with the help of Bitcoin—Cardano’s resistance level of $1.2 could be an achievable target. Source: Tradingview Remittix (RTX) and Its PayFi Breakthrough While ADA takes care of the technology aspect of the blockchain, Remittix (RTX) is crafted to enable easy crypto payments to the benefit of all stakeholders from small businesses to large enterprises. Valued at an estimated $0.0734, Remittix has raised over $13.6 million in the presale and sold over 516 million tokens to date. Instead of riding the social media wave, it is solving an immediate issue: converting digital funds into local money without delay or cost. Envision a clothing store that serves international clients but is frustrated with exchange rates and wire transfers. Using the Remittix PayFi solution, the store can accept payments in crypto and settle nearly instantaneously in its domestic currency—avoiding traditional banking headaches. That certainty appeals to businesses that would prefer to have a steady cash influx even if the markets decline or increase. Because Remittix aims to solve real-world hurdles, it could stand firm as crypto markets shift direction. While other tokens mostly rely on hype cycles, Remittix brings the digital world and the world of fiat together by being usable in real life. As the platform becomes more streamlined for daily life, investors increasingly see RTX as a secure choice in an area too frequently plagued by short-term hype. Why ADA and RTX May Outperform in 2025 Both Cardano and Remittix target gaps in the market. Cardano’s ongoing network upgrades and potential rally to $1.2 show how a solid community plus strong fundamentals can yield steady gains. As for Remittix, its emphasis on PayFi technology taps into a critical need for simpler cross-border payments, suggesting more room for long-term expansion. In a space where short-lived mania can overshadow practical solutions, these two projects offer a contrast. Cardano’s seasoned community and robust network updates may set it apart, but Remittix holds even greater promise with its PayFi system. By making cross-border payments near-instant, Remittix addresses everyday issues that businesses and freelancers wrestle with. For investors who value tangible solutions over fleeting hype, Remittix could well be the bigger story in 2025’s crypto landscape. Curious about PayFi’s role in reshaping cross-border finance? Take a look at Remittix and learn why a token rooted in real-world solutions might share the stage with Cardano in the year ahead.

China’s retaliatory tariffs on US farm goods took effect, following the US hiking tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%. Traders reacted to fresh data from China over the weekend, which showed that consumer prices fell the most in 13 months in February, while producer deflation persisted for the 29th month despite a slower fall. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.42% to around 3,990, while the broader Topix Index edged up 0.1% to 2,712 on Monday, recovering some losses from the previous session. The Japanese yen strengthened past 148 per dollar on Monday, hovering at a five-month high. Domestically, data showed that Japan posted a current account deficit in January for the first time in two years, as imports outpaced exports. Additionally, inflation-adjusted real wages—a key measure of consumer purchasing power—fell 1.8% year-on-year, marking the first decline in three months. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.62% to below 3,360, while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.3% to 10,810 on Monday, extending losses from the previous session as persistent deflationary pressures underscored China's economic challenges, and the offshore yuan depreciated around 7.25 per dollar as investors reacted to China’s weaker-than-expected inflation data . China announced on Saturday that it will impose a 100% tariff on imports of certain Canadian agricultural products, including rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas, along with a 25% levy on aquatic products and pork. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 2.29% to 23,888 on Monday morning, extending losses from the prior period amid widespread sector falls. Locally, Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves fell to an 8-month low in February, following a period of stability over the previous three months. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.40% to 74,601 in early deals on Monday, hitting a near two-week peak, with the Nifty 50 climbing 0.4% to above 22,600, after being flat in the previous session, supported by strength in consumer goods, metals, and realty. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.18% to around 7,970 on Monday, recovering some losses from the previous session, as mining and energy stocks led gains amid firmer commodity prices. The Australian dollar steadied around $0.63 on Monday, pausing a two-day decline. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher recovered from earlier losses after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated confidence in inflation progress while emphasizing no urgency to cut rates. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump described the economy as undergoing “a period of transition” during a Fox News interview, when asked about the risk of a recession. U.S. stock futures declined on Monday ahead of the inflation and JOLTS data: Dow -0.43% ; S&P 500 -0.46% ; Nasdaq -0.51% . Markets are closely watching consumer inflation expectations set for release on Monday, followed by consumer inflation data on Wednesday, producer inflation figures on Thursday, and a consumer sentiment report on Friday.

S&P 500 futures dropped 0.8%, Nasdaq 100 futures slid nearly 1%, and Dow Jones futures sank 268 points (0.6%), per data from CNBC. This comes after last week’s brutal selloff, where the S&P 500 plunged 3.10%, the Dow lost 2.37%, and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.45%—its worst performance since September. The selloff was also fueled by Washington’s economic policies and tariff negotiations with Mexico and Canada, creating uncertainty that sent investors running for cover. Throughout the week, a flood of economic reports will be released and they likely would add to the chaos. The New York Fed’s consumer expectations survey is set for release Monday, but the real concern is inflation—something the Federal Reserve and investors are watching closely. So we got the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February will be released Wednesday, followed by the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday, and then the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index comes on Friday. Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said, “The total and core CPI likely rose at a more moderate pace in February after sharp increases in the prior month.” Bill also explained that tariffs and trade uncertainties continue to push producer prices higher. On Friday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the uncertainty, saying the central bank is “focused on separating the signal from the noise.” He pointed out that his team isn’t in a hurry to adjust interest rates, adding that the Fed will wait for “greater clarity” before making changes. The Biden administration’s economic policies also remain a factor. President Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admitted on Friday, “The economy is starting to roll a bit.” Investors are watching to see whether Washington will step in with any measures to stabilize the markets, but let’s face it, with Trump saying “I’m not even looking at the stock market,” last week, they probably won’t. Bitcoin sinks as US creates strategic reserve The market bloodbath wasn’t limited to stocks, the crypto market took a hit too. Early Monday, Bitcoin fell more than 5%, trading at $80,622, according to data from CoinGecko. Ethereum and XRP weren’t spared either, both dropping by 6% and 7.5% respectively. The plunge came after Trump signed an executive order to establish a US strategic bitcoin reserve. The reserve will be funded with bitcoins seized from criminal and civil forfeiture cases, and there are no plans for the government to buy more. That announcement disappointed investors, many of whom expected massive and aggressive federal purchases of Bitcoin. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, wasn’t convinced the market’s reaction made sense. Bitcoin price chart. Source: Jai Hamid/TradingView “I absolutely think the market has this wrong,” Matt said on CNBC’s Squawk Box Asia. “The market is short-term disappointed” that the US didn’t announce a 100,000 or 200,000 bitcoin purchase. David Sacks, White House Crypto and AI Czar, promised that the US could acquire more bitcoin in the future using “budget-neutral strategies” that wouldn’t cost taxpayers anything. The idea of a strategic bitcoin reserve has long-term implications, and Matt believes it’s the key to Bitcoin becoming a key geopolitical asset, so now we’re all watching to see if other governments follow suit and start stockpiling crypto. Bitcoin Magazine’s David Bailey told Bloomberg TV last week that Middle Eastern countries and even China are secretly making plans to jump into crypto too. Wall Street faces uncertainty as investor panic grows Jim Cramer, speaking on CNBC, didn’t hold back in his assessment of the situation. “Our president, Donald Trump, tells us that ‘what we are doing is big,’ so there might be economic consequences to come that we don’t like,” said Jimmy. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hasn’t helped the situation, giving conflicting signals about tariffs. “Howard tells us to worry about tariffs, then not to worry, and then to worry again,” Jim said. “What was the last worry or not worry turn? I forget. Is he freelancing?” With $36 trillion in national debt, tariffs alone won’t fix the economy. Jimmy pointed out that tariffs worked when Alexander Hamilton was building a manufacturing base, but today’s situation is completely different. With 4% unemployment and a worker shortage in manufacturing, he questioned how effective they can be. “Just target those countries dumping on us or hitting us with high tariffs,” Jimmy suggested. “Take the history books we studied that proved over and over again that tariffs helped cause the Great Depression. They weren’t lies. They weren’t propaganda. They were just empirical observations.” The instability has investors running. “It’s like the whole point of the exercise post-inauguration is to get you to sell all of the stocks you own and certainly not to put any money to work,” said Jimmy. “The major stock benchmarks are barely down. But look at this endless rotation out of anything with earnings risk, anything with exposure to data centers, personal computers, semiconductors, and enterprise software—about 50% of the market is now radioactive.” What’s next for the markets? Wall Street is watching for signs of stabilization, but it’s hard to see through the uncertainty. “Pass me the binoculars; I don’t see one yet because the dust storm the White House keeps kicking up is obscuring everything,” Jimmy bantered. For investors, the biggest question is whether the market collapse is sustainable. Trump’s presidency was expected to be bullish for stocks, but the opposite has happened. “Everything you thought would be good for the stock market under Trump hasn’t happened, and everything you knew would be horrendous for the stock market has happened times ten,” Jim pointed out. Still, he doesn’t think the downturn is permanent. “I think Trump is going to try to figure out something good for the markets,” he said . “But not when the Dow Jones falls 10% from here. He cares that our markets will soon be the worst in the world, and no one with pride can ignore that.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The sell-off has penetrated a bullish trendline that starts with the low registered after the June 2022 crash of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, which destroyed billions in investor wealth. The decisive breakdown means ether's near three-year-long bullish trend has likely ended, shifting focus to more profound losses, potentially to support identified by September-October 2023 lows near $1,500. Trendlines help visualize the direction in which traders are allocating funds and where price movements are likely to occur. An ascending or bullish trendline represents levels where demand is expected to be sufficient to avoid further price declines. When a prolonged bullish trendline is breached, as seen in the case of ETH, it signals a weakening of demand or that sellers are overpowering buyers, indicating a potential bearish shift in market trend. The breakdown often prompts other traders to sell, leading to even deeper losses. Ether's near 20% drop took out dual support – the trendline and the area around $2,100, characterizing repeated seller exhaustion since August. The next support is seen at $1,500, with the past week's high of $2,523 a level to beat for the bulls.",Markets|Ether|Technical Analysis|Markets,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-10 05:55:01

Key Levels to Watch Amid Market Volatility,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-low-can-bitcoin-price-drop/,"The post How Low Can Bitcoin Price Drop? Key Levels to Watch Amid Market Volatility appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has had a rough start to the week, hanging to just above $80,000 on March 10. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warns that BTC could soon retest $78,000, and if that level fails, $75,000 will be the next target. He pointed out that a massive amount of Bitcoin options open interest is concentrated between $70,000 and $75,000 , meaning that if BTC enters this range, volatility could rise, triggering fear of more liquidations. Billions Lost as Bitcoin Falls The market crash has already wiped out over $5 billion in bullish bets, mostly long positions in just four days. Bitcoin is now down nearly 30% from its January highs, and traders are worried because the price has fallen below the 200-day moving average, a key signal that often predicts more losses. Many had hoped that the BTC Strategic Reserve , a new initiative, would boost confidence, but it hasn’t helped. At the same time, big investors are pulling money out of Bitcoin ETFs at record levels, showing that institutional demand is drying up. A ‘Textbook Correction’ in Progress According to 10x Research, this drop is a “textbook correction”, meaning it’s a natural pullback after a big rally. Analysts noted that 70% of sellers are recent investors who bought Bitcoin within the last three months and are now panic-selling. Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has been bouncing between $80,000 and $95,000, reacting to economic and regulatory news. Moreover, investor sentiments are fading, with the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index dropping to extreme fear at a reading of 20. Meanwhile, trading volume has fallen, meaning fewer people are buying in at current prices. Adding to the woes, El Salvador, one of Bitcoin’s biggest supporters , has reportedly halted its Bitcoin-related projects, further weakening the market’s outlook. Brace For Upcoming Events The volatility may continue this week as two key U.S. inflation reports are due, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. If inflation remains high, the Fed may maintain its restrictive stance, adding pressure to risk assets like Bitcoin. On the geopolitical front, Canada has responded to recent U.S. trade tariffs with retaliatory measures, further unsettling global markets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Prediction for Next Week , What’s Next for Bitcoin? Crypto analyst Jacob King also highlights Bitcoin’s sharp drop below $80,000, wiping out over $5 billion in long positions within four days. BTC is now down nearly 30% from its January highs, with its price slipping below the 200-day moving average—a bearish signal. The much-anticipated BTC Strategic Reserve failed to ignite bullish momentum, while institutional interest is fading, as seen in record ETF outflows. Bitcoin’s ability to hold the $80,000 support level will be crucial in determining its next move. If prices stabilize, a recovery could follow, but if BTC breaks below key support levels, a further drop toward $70,000 is possible. With weakening institutional demand, rising liquidations, and tariff war, traders are bracing for more volatility in the days ahead. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

BITO tracks Bitcoin futures, not spot prices, causing inefficiencies and higher costs compared to spot ETFs like IBIT, which holds actual Bitcoin. Despite political and economic factors favoring Bitcoin, technical indicators suggest potential volatility, making it uncertain if BITO will hold above $17 or fall to $10. Given the tracking errors and mixed signals from technical analysis, I recommend holding BITO rather than buying or selling in this uncertain environment. ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) is falling since the beginning of 2025 and lost 18.32% of its value so far. That’s why it doesn’t offer an investment opportunity as advantageous as Bitcoin itself, although it varies depending on the type of investor. In this article, I will explain the reasons for this in detail. I’d like to start the article by comparing returns of Bitcoin with the returns of BITO because many investors are wondering why BITO is not performing as well as IBIT or Bitcoin itself. TradingView Since BITO’s launch in October 2021 it lost 53.77% of its value, while Bitcoin has gained 35.08%. Both instruments reflect Bitcoin’s price movements, but structural differences in design are leading to a significant and permanent performance difference. Similarly, when I calculate the annual expected return rates, BITO has an expected return of 3.17% since 2022 while Bitcoin has an expected return of 51.17%. There is a truly huge difference between the two. So what causes this difference? Understanding BITO BITO tracks futures contracts traded on the CME instead of holding Bitcoin directly. While this allows the fund to operate within regulatory circles it introduces negative complications such as contango and rollover costs too. The fund periodically rolls over expiring contracts into longer-term contracts which is insuring costs. Unlike BITO, for example IBIT completely eliminates the problems and costs associated with futures trading because it holds actual Bitcoin for the fund. BITO’s reliance on futures creates contango. Contango means longer-term contracts trade at a premium to shorter-term ones. Contango intensifies during bull markets, especially after March 2023 which forced BITO to sell low and buy high on a monthly basis. iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) 0.25% Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ( BTC ) 0.15% Franklin Bitcoin ( EZBC ) 0.19% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) 0.20% VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) 0.20% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) 0.21% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) 0.25% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) 0.25% Median 0.21% In addition to that BITO’s expense ratio is really high. While the median expense ratio of spot Bitcoin holding ETFs is generally around 0.21%, BITO’s expense ratio is significantly higher than this ratio with 0.95%. Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITS ) 0.65% CoinShares Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) 0.75% Bitwise Trendwise Bitcoin and Treasury Rotation Strategy ETF ( BITC ) 0.85% CoinShares Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF ( BTF ) 1.24% Median 0.80% Maybe it’s not right to compare the futures ETF with the spot. That's why I took the median of the futures ETFs expense ratios, which resulted 0.80%. BITO has a lower expense ratio than BTF, but it still has an expense ratio above the median. This expense ratio also seriously affects the performance of the fund. In addition to these expenses, there is also the issue of dividend distribution. BITO distributes monthly dividends from futures earnings and taxes them as ordinary income (up to 37% federal rate). On the other hand, spot ETF’s can delay these taxes until the sale. Since this tax burden is compounded, it is also written off as a burden on performance. BITO seems to be a less efficient investment, both compared to Bitcoin itself and spot ETFs. So if this inefficiency is weighing on performance, why do I have a “hold” position instead of a “sell” position? This is a decision that depends entirely on Bitcoin's own performance. After all BITO is a Bitcoin fund and even though its performance is not exactly the same, it aims to reflect Bitcoin's movements. So I will analyze Bitcoin technically and determine whether BITO can compensate for its expenses. Charting TradingView Historically, I see that Bitcoin has been in a constant logarithmic upward trend. In addition, when the average return of each year is calculated since 2018, when Bitcoin began to mature, the expected return is at 76.75%. Therefore, I think that this performance will compensate for BITO's expenses in the long run. TradingView When I focus on shorter term I see that Bitcoin moves in accordance with the 80 and 500-week weighted moving averages. Bitcoin supported from the 80-week moving average about 3 times in the bull run after 2023. I think this moving average is critical for Bitcoin even right now. The 80-week moving average is at $74,200. If Bitcoin holds at this level, it means that BITO will find support at $17 proportionally. As long as it holds at this level and continues its run, I think BITO will be able to cover its costs, but it will still significantly underperform compared to Bitcoin or spot ETFs due to contango. I think after finding, the support target level is going to be maximum $28 for BITO. TradingView But if Bitcoin cannot hold at this level, I have to start talking about the price action support level of $53,000 and the 500-week moving average level of $34,433 which means a bearish call. In this scenario, I think BITO will fall by the amount of Bitcoin's loss of value + other costs. We saw this in practice in 2024. While Bitcoin was suppressed and lost about 27% of its value from March to September, BITO lost up to 52% in this period. This indicates an additional 25% loss in value. Therefore, my analysis shows that a drop to the $53,000 support will take BITO down to $10. I have to say that both possibilities are really close to each other, which is the biggest reason why I keep a ""hold"" position. The changes in the global political and economic ground generally seem to be in favor of Bitcoin. President Trump recently signed a decree by keeping his promise to hold Bitcoin in the Federal Reserve and organized the first crypto summit at the White House. Plus US holds 212,000 Bitcoins , China 194,000, the UK 61,000 and this number continues to increase every day. So in the global political and economic arena, states have started to turn to Bitcoin for certain reasons and this naturally increases the demand for Bitcoin. So the increase in these developments will contribute to Bitcoin remaining above the 80-week moving average. But at the same time, the RSI indicator’s bearish divergence formation reminds me of 2021 in technical terms. This negative formation is a sign that the price is not met with enough momentum and is inclined to slow decline. In addition, the MACD indicator’s death cross is another negative signal. So if this selling pressure continues we can witness a break of $74,200. Risks BITO exhibits a serious tracking error due to its structure based on futures. While spot ETFs such as IBIT have tracking error rates of 0.5% this rate is between 5-10% annually for BITO. This means that the fall or surge of Bitcoin will be reflected in BITO in a very different way. Therefore, the risk may increase unexpectedly. Conclusion Political and global economic developments have begun to take shape in favor of Bitcoin. This could cause BITO to hold above $17 and run to $28. However, technical analysis also indicates that BITO will be undecided about whether to hold at this level and could fall to $10. In this uncertain environment, I am staying on the side of holding rather than buying or selling.",BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-10 05:59:32

The approval come as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation takes full effect across the European Union. This approval for BBVA marks the conclusion of a multi-year process for the Spanish lender to allow for its clients to get exposure to digital assets. In 2020, CoinDesk reported that BBVA planned to dip its toes in the sector, pending regulatory approval because MiCA wasn't yet in place. BBVA initially planned to launch its crypto services from Switzerland rather than Spain or other EU countries because Switzerland already had a clear regulatory framework for digital assets under the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). In January, BBVA launched crypto trading in Turkey through a local subsidiary.

The former central bank chief oversees the nation while President Donald Trump’s administration applies economic pressure on Canada. Carney received almost 86% of the vote to lead the Liberal Party of Canada, and at one point, he held top positions at the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. Trudeau would hand the baton over to Carney, who would then have the option (though not the obligation) to call a national election shortly after taking power. Carney caps an escalating dispute between Canada and the US. The echo of Trump’s trade policy is giving Canada headaches overnight. Trump proposed a 25% tax on many products from Canada and Mexico. He also said he would postpone the taxes on countries in the North American trade agreement for one month. He subsequently threatened new tariffs on Canadian lumber and milk. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that he expected to place 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on March 12. With Canada’s economy heavily reliant on trade with the US, Trump has openly vowed to use economic pressure to keep the country aligned with American interests. His aggressive stance has sparked outrage across Canada, fueling calls to boycott US goods and prompting Ottawa lawmakers to reassess the nation’s trade partnerships. Carney cautioned that Trump’s threats cannot buy off Canada. Canada will never be part of America On Sunday, Carney tried to do just that in his victory speech. Saying America is not Canada, he also warned that Canada “will never be part of America.” He also likened the trade dispute with the US to a hockey game, saying Canadians always come prepared when challenged. He said Americans should not underestimate Canada; in trade, as in hockey, Canada would win. Carney promised that Canadian retaliatory tariffs on US goods would remain as long as the American government failed to show respect and fairness in trade. He also said the proceeds from these tariffs would go toward assistance for Canadian workers. He also addressed his plans to strengthen Canada’s economy, forge new trade relations with trusted partners, and make Canada an “energy superpower.” During the Liberal Party leadership race, Carney positioned himself as an experienced leader who knew how to deal with crises. He steered Canada’s central bank through the global financial crisis and helped the U.K. during its troubled exit from the European Union. But Carney has never been an elected politician and does not currently sit in Parliament. Carney, a former chair of Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. and Bloomberg Inc., stepped down from both roles to launch a leadership bid. As prime minister, he would seek new international markets for Canadian products and work to eliminate trade barriers inside Canada. Carney also intends to scrap the Liberals’ planned increase in capital gains tax and abolish the consumer carbon tax. He aims to use taxpayer money to fund large-scale infrastructure projects that will invigorate Canada’s economy. Carney’s fiscal plan involves splitting the federal budget into two halves: an operating budget that he vows to keep balanced and a capital spending budget that will allow the government to pour billions into infrastructure. Carney said Canada had so much more to offer itself than Donald Trump could take away from it. He stressed that it would not be business as usual and that the country would have to take steps it had never previously conceived, doing them at speeds it had never considered possible. Canada must hold an election by October, but the Liberal Party’s perilous status in Parliament, where it has fewer than 50% of the House of Commons seats, means it’s expected sooner. Carney has to decide whether to plunge the country into a springtime election — leaving it with a caretaker government for several weeks, during which a trade war may be raging — or attempt to gain support from at least one opposition party to govern for a period of time. Carney clashes with Poilievre over transparency, leadership, and Canada’s future Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre criticized Carney’s statement, questioning his transparency and business dealings and calling on him to reveal his financial holdings to avoid conflicts of interest. Poilievre further accused Carney of attempting to mitigate where he steered Brookfield’s trajectory when he relocated the company’s headquarters from Toronto to New York in 2022. Carney was still the company chair at that time. Carney responded to Poilievre’s jab in his speech. He pointed to Poilievre’s threat to oust Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem in 2022. He stated the leaders of the opposition and their critics who signed the letter are casting scorn on the work of the bank, Carney said, mentioning Poilievre and saying he would leave the bank “crippled” during an economic uncertainty. He also pressed Poilievre on climate policy. In the Liberal attempt to replace Trudeau, Carney beat out well-known figures, including former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, former government House Leader Karina Gould, and businessman Frank Baylis. Freeland helped kill Trudeau’s political career—her resignation letter in December dealt a significant blow. Three weeks later, Trudeau said that he would resign. Trudeau delivered what may be his last political address as prime minister to the Liberal Party gathering in Ottawa. He called on Liberals to hold firm against the threats presented by Trump’s government. “Let there be no mistake, this is a nation-defining moment,” Trudeau said. “Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given.” So Canadians must wait and see whether those bonds deepen — or wither — as Carney takes the reins. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Unfortunately, so do scams. One common type of fraud involves unsuspecting investors being added to WhatsApp or Telegram groups . These groups are run by people pretending to be experts, using titles such as professor, advisor, or assistant. If you’ve been scammed on WhatsApp involving USDT or Bitcoin, you’re not alone. Here’s an example of how these scams work and what steps you can take to recover your funds. The Real Case: A Fake Job Offer A company referred to here as Company A , approached an individual through WhatsApp with a job offer. The role involved “reviewing products” and earning commissions based on sales. Initially, the job appeared legitimate, with daily funding of $50–$100 and commissions sent in cryptocurrency. The Scam Unfolds Increased Requirements : After about two weeks, the company claimed the victim’s sales were increasing and asked for payments for extra product purchases. They promised reimbursement and additional commissions. Fake Bonus : The victim was informed they had earned a “lucky bonus” of $250,000. However, to claim it, they had to pay: $30,000 as an invoice. $10,000 in late fees. Total: $40,000 New Demands : When trying to withdraw the $250,000, the scammers claimed there was an error and demanded a “repair fee” of $80,000, later reduced to $25,000. The victim refused to pay further. Warning Signs Fake Identities : All individuals involved had fabricated names and non-verifiable histories. Forged Documents : They sent a fake document with the “CEO’s” forged signature, which was later verified as fraudulent. Untraceable Communication : The WhatsApp numbers used by the scammers could not accept calls. The victim was eventually removed from the WhatsApp group of about 50 members, who also claimed to be “sellers.” Later, another person attempted to scam the victim using the same tactics, indicating it was part of a larger operation. Steps to Check If You’re Being Scammed If you’re in a similar situation, here’s how to determine if you’re being scammed: Verify Communication : Check the identities of the people who offer the job. Check if the WhatsApp number can accept calls. Be cautious of individuals who avoid video calls or use fake photos. Examine Documents : Verify any documents or signatures they send. Cross-check with official company details. Look for Red Flags : Unreasonably high promises of earnings. Requests for large upfront payments or “fees.” Being removed from groups or blocked when you question them. Steps to Recover Your Money If you’ve already fallen victim, here’s what you can do to try to recover your funds: Report to Authorities : File a report with the FBI or your country’s cybercrime unit.

Trace Your Funds : Visit Bitquery’s Crypto Investigation Services . Fill out their form to initiate a detailed investigation. Their team can trace your funds and guide you through legal and recovery processes. Conduct Your Investigation : Verify the identities of individuals involved. Check if others have reported similar scams. Protect Yourself from Future Scams Be Skeptical of Offers on WhatsApp : Especially unsolicited offers that seem too good to be true. Do Not Send Upfront Payments : Legitimate companies will not ask you to pay fees to receive earnings. Verify Legitimacy : Research the company thoroughly before engaging. By following these steps, you can minimize your losses and avoid falling for similar scams in the future.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 542,00 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart has plunged into oversold territory. Traders keep a close eye on the RSI as it can often signal trend reversal points. The crypto strategist says that since November of 2022, Bitcoin has mounted strong rallies each time the RSI dropped to oversold levels on the daily time frame. “Bitcoin’s Daily RSI equaled 2022 Bear Market RSI levels (RSI=23.93) when the price crashed into the high $70,000s. The only lower Daily RSI in this cycle was back in August 2023 (RSI=18.28). Throughout this cycle, each visit into sub-25 RSI resulted in a trend reversal to the upside over time.” Source: Rekt Capital/X According to Rekt Capital, historical data shows that Bitcoin may find a solid bottom between $78,000 and $71,700. “Bitcoin has made yet another Lower High on the Daily. There’s no denying that. But throughout this entire cycle, whenever Bitcoin would reach 28 or lower on the RSI… Bitcoin’s price would either bottom or be between -2% to -8% away from the bottom.” Source: Rekt Capital/X To support his stance that Bitcoin is now in the process of bottoming out, the trader says BTC may be following in the footsteps of the layer-1 protocol Cronos ( CRO ). According to Rekt Capital, CRO may be in the midst of ending its downtrend with a double-bottom pattern. “What’s interesting to see is that BTC is trying to build out a potential Double Bottom-like formation here. Whereas CRO has potentially broken out from its own Double Bottom, in fact leading Bitcoin. Other Altcoins are in varying phases of their own respective Double Bottoms.” Source: Rekt Capital/X A double-bottom structure is traditionally viewed as a bullish reversal pattern as it indicates that the asset has found a price floor and is gearing up for an upside burst. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that CRO has taken out the resistance of the pattern at around $0.08. At time of writing, CRO is trading at $0.80. Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $82,207, down over 4% in the past day.

Some legal experts suggest that Ripple could potentially settle using XRP tokens rather than cash – we’ll cover this in detail below. On a different front, StratoVM ($SVM) could draw attention as a Layer 2 solution that could finally integrate Bitcoin effectively into decentralized finance. By using the Bitcoin blockchain as an anchor for its data, StratoVM potentially offers improved transaction speeds and reduced fee structures—addressing longstanding limitations that have disrupted Bitcoin’s practical utility in DeFi applications. Let’s check out the deets. XRP News: Could Ripple’s $125 Million Fine Be Paid in XRP? Back in August 2024, Ripple Labs got hit with a $125 million fine from the SEC for breaking securities laws when selling XRP to institutional investors. While Ripple is still fighting its legal battles, people are now wondering how the company might pay this fine. Yassin Mobarak , a member of the XRP community, has suggested that Ripple could actually pay using XRP tokens instead of cash. He points out that the government recently created a digital asset reserve meant to hold highly liquid cryptocurrencies like XRP. If Ripple pays with XRP, this would be the first time the US government officially holds XRP tokens. Mobarak thinks this could be good news, as it would align the government’s interests with XRP holders, possibly leading to clearer regulations and wider adoption. Attorney Jeremy Hogan supports this idea , too. He references a Supreme Court case from 1869 (Willard v. Tayloe), which ruled that payments could legally be made in commodities if both sides agreed. This could set the stage for Ripple and the SEC to settle using XRP. Could StratoVM ($SVM) be the Project That Finally Helps Bitcoin Expand into the DeFi Sector? Here’s How This Layer-2 Platform Works Despite Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market, it has lagged behind Ethereum when it comes to DeFi applications, AI integrations, and meme token ecosystems. StratoVM ($SVM) might change that as an EVM-compatible Layer-2 solution that lets developers build smart contracts and decentralized apps on Bitcoin. Interest in StratoVM has been growing fast, with its price jumping an impressive 6,911% in just one month to reach about $0.1906, according to CoinGecko . SVM 30-day chart, Source: CoinGecko While the price movement is grabbing headlines, the real value of StratoVM might be its potential to expand Bitcoin’s functionality in DeFi while maintaining the security Bitcoin is known for. The project is showing promising early results. Its testnet has already attracted more than 113,000 wallets and handles around 56,000 transactions daily. As StratoVM prepares for its mainnet launch, it could change what’s possible within the Bitcoin ecosystem. It’s also worth noting that StratoVM’s current market cap sits at $17M, while its comparable project CoreDAO is valued at $990M. Meanwhile, the broader Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) space has expanded dramatically from $307M to $6.6B over the past year, according to DeFiLlama. If this trend continues, StratoVM could become a major player in this growing sector. The project’s community is also expanding rapidly, with over 100,000 followers across social platforms, including X, Telegram, and Discord. With more than 50 strategic partnerships and rumors of a centralized exchange listing on the horizon, StratoVM might be ready to finally bridge the gap between Bitcoin and the world of decentralized finance. The Bottom Line Ripple’s $125 million penalty has brought interesting discussions about payment methods. Some analysts suggest the company might settle using XRP tokens instead of traditional currency – a move that could establish a precedent for how digital asset cases are resolved in the future. At the same time, StratoVM could generate serious buzz as a Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. As its mainnet launch approaches, the platform could potentially transform how Bitcoin interacts with decentralized finance, opening new opportunities for BTC holders who have traditionally been limited in their DeFi participation options.

The cybercriminals, working for the North Korean regime, swiped the funds two weeks ago in what has become the single largest crypto hack in history. Despite global efforts to track and freeze the stolen assets, at least 20% of the stolen money has vanished. The stolen funds are being funneled through an elaborate laundering process, with experts warning that the money is likely funding North Korea’s nuclear and military programs. Source: Elliptic Crypto analysts tracking the movements say the hackers are working nonstop, using sophisticated tools to evade detection. “Every minute matters for the hackers who are trying to confuse the money trail, and they are extremely sophisticated in what they’re doing,” said Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic. ByBit’s security breach allowed Lazarus to hijack funds The ByBit attack happened on February 21, when Lazarus infiltrated one of ByBit’s suppliers. The hackers secretly changed the destination of a massive 401,000 ETH transfer, making ByBit send the funds straight into their hands instead of its own wallet. The criminals took advantage of the loophole before the exchange even realized what had happened. ByBit CEO Ben Zhou confirmed that no customer funds were affected, but the company had to replenish the stolen money through investor loans. $150K worth of stolen assets, now frozen and seized. Source: Elliptic “We are waging war on Lazarus,” Ben said, announcing a bounty program where people can earn rewards for helping track and freeze the stolen funds. So far, 20 people have received a total of $4 million in rewards for helping recover $40 million of the stolen crypto. The strategy relies on the fact that all transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, making it possible to trace the movement of the stolen money. But the problem is that Lazarus is too good at laundering crypto. Lazarus is using crypto exchanges to cash out stolen funds While ByBit and other exchanges are actively freezing stolen funds, not all crypto companies are cooperating. One exchange, eXch, has been accused of allowing Lazarus to cash out more than $90 million. ByBit and other firms have called out Johann Roberts, the owner of eXch, for not acting fast enough to block the criminals. Roberts, however, denies the accusations. Over email, he admitted that eXch did not initially freeze the stolen funds, claiming that his company was in a long-standing dispute with ByBit and wasn’t sure the funds were from the hack. He now says eXch is cooperating, but at the same time, he criticized the push for more regulation, arguing that it compromises the privacy and anonymity of crypto. The U.S. and its allies blame North Korea for dozens of crypto hacks over the years, using stolen funds to support the country’s sanctions-hit economy. Lazarus was previously focused on hacking banks, but in the last five years, crypto exchanges have become their primary target. Dr. Dorit Dor, a cybersecurity expert at Check Point, says North Korea has perfected the art of cybercrime. “North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy, so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering, and they don’t care about the negative impression of cybercrime,” she said. The ByBit hack is just the latest in a long list of Lazarus attacks, including the 2019 UpBit hack ($41 million stolen), the 2020 KuCoin hack ($275 million stolen, most recovered), the 2022 Ronin Bridge attack ($600 million stolen), and the 2023 Atomic Wallet breach ($100 million stolen) The U.S. has added Lazarus members to its Cyber Most Wanted list, but the chances of anyone getting arrested are slim unless they leave North Korea. Despite international sanctions and law enforcement tracking their every move, Lazarus is still pulling off some of the biggest heists in the world—and cashing out.

Here is the Latest Bitcoin Purchase Amount!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/el-salvador-continues-to-buy-bitcoin-despite-imf-here-is-the-latest-bitcoin-purchase-amount/,"El Salvador has continued its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy despite pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to halt purchases, increasing its holdings to 6,111 BTC. El Salvador Defies IMF, Continues Bitcoin Accumulation The Central American country added 6 BTC to its reserves on Sunday, bringing its total holdings to 6,111.18 BTC, worth about $504 million at current market prices. That’s up from 6,072 BTC on Feb. 9, according to the country’s Bitcoin Office. IMF Agreement and Rising Tensions El Salvador reached a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF in December, with the total financial package expected to exceed $3.5 billion. As part of the deal, the country agreed to reduce its Bitcoin engagement in exchange for financing. In January, the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly passed a bill to comply with IMF requirements tied to the loan. On March 3, the IMF released a new report reinforcing the expectation that El Salvador will limit government involvement in Bitcoin-related activities. Bukele Remains Firm on Bitcoin Strategy Despite these agreements, President Nayib Bukele has made it clear that El Salvador will not stop accumulating Bitcoin. In a March 5 post on X (formerly Twitter), Bukele countered speculation that the country would abandon its Bitcoin-first approach. “No, it won’t stop,” Bukele wrote. “If it didn’t stop when the world shut us out and most ‘bitcoinists’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now and it won’t stop in the future.” El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, a move that initially drew criticism from global financial institutions including the IMF and the World Bank. The government has since launched initiatives such as Bitcoin-backed bonds and a volcanic-powered Bitcoin mining operation. Despite concerns from the IMF and credit rating agencies, the Bukele administration continues to frame Bitcoin adoption as a long-term strategy for financial independence and economic growth. *This is not investment advice.

But that’s not all—BTFD has rolled out a 100% bonus for a limited time with the exclusive LAUNCH100 code. Investors can double their holdings instantly. Meanwhile, Bonk (BONK) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) remain top players in the meme coin market, holding strong established names. But let’s be real—newcomers with explosive growth potential are where the real money is made. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in this weekend, here’s why BTFD Coin is the golden ticket you don’t want to miss.

In this game, players join the Bulls Squad, take on multiple challenges, and win BTFD tokens. What’s the best part?

Despite facing recent market corrections, BONK remains one of the most talked-about meme coins, securing a spot in major decentralized exchanges and driving high trading volumes. What sets BONK apart is its continued integration into the Solana network, offering low fees and high-speed transactions. Investors who have held BONK since early 2024 have seen significant gains, proving its place as a strong alternative investment. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Coin Giant Still Holding Strong Shiba Inu (SHIB) has become a household name in the crypto space. With its Shibarium Layer 2 solution, SHIB staking, and metaverse expansion, it continues to attract long-term holders. While SHIB remains a dominant force, its massive market cap makes triple-digit gains harder to achieve compared to high-growth presales like BTFD Coin.

Over the last week, ETH has lost more than 16%, thereby extending its year-to-date losses to more than 37%, suggesting a strong bearish sentiment for the altcoin. On the other hand, the Ethereum ETF outflows have also surged last week, suggesting dropping institutional interest. Will Ethereum Price Crash Further From Here? The world’s largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has come under strong bearish grip eroding all of its gains following the US Presidential election in November 2024. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Ethereum is breaking down of a parallel channel, a technical pattern that suggests bearish price action ahead. If Ethereum price fails to hold this support, it can crash by another 75% all the way to $1,250 levels. Source: Ali Martinez Today’s ETH price drop comes amid the broader crypto market correction as market liquidations soar to more than $600 million as per the Coinglass data . Additionally, the ETH open interest has dropped by 2.67% to $19 billion, hinting bearish sentiment among futures traders. Ethereum Liquidations Skyrocket The Ethereum market faced significant turbulence yesterday, with over $230 million in long positions liquidated, according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez. The wave of liquidations has shaken out overleveraged traders, highlighting the current market volatility surrounding the altcoin. Source: Ali Charts Furthermore, the institutional interest in Ethereum has been falling fast. During the last week, the total outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs surged over $120 million. Despite this fall, crypto market analysts continue to stay bullish for ETH expecting it to kickstart its recovery journey again. Will ETH Recover Anytime Soon? Despite the bearish onslaught over the past few weeks, market analysts continue to be bullish about an Ethereum price recovery in the coming days. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reports that Ethereum’s largest whales have purchased 330,000 ETH in the past 48 hours, signaling strong accumulation by major holders. Source: Ali Martinez Additionally, over 600,000 ETH have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges in the last week, pointing to a potential shift toward long-term holding. These trends highlight growing confidence among large investors and reduced selling pressure on exchanges. For Ethereum momentum to shift on the upside, the bulls must reclaim $2,460 resistance. A massive 10.95 million investors hold ETH at these levels, and thus, investors need to break past this to trigger a rally to the upside. Crypto trader and analyst Crypto Patel has expressed bullish sentiment on Ethereum (ETH), emphasizing his strategy of buying during market dips. “Buying $ETH on every dip for $10k/ETH,” Patel shared. He believes that this is the last opportunity for accumulation before Ethereum’s next major price surge.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another week of outflows from March 3-5, with nearly $800 million exiting the funds. This follows a record outflow week that saw over $2.61 billion in redemptions, extending the negative flow streak to four consecutive weeks with total net outflows exceeding $4.5 billion. Notably, Bitcoin ETFs recorded net negative flows throughout last week, starting with $74.19 million on Monday, followed by $143.43 million, $38.3 million, $134.26 million, and culminating in the largest outflow of $409 million on Friday. On the final day of the week, ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB led the outflows with $160.03 million, followed closely by Fidelity’s FBTC, which saw $154.89 million withdrawn by investors. Other major ETF issuers, including BlackRock’s IBIT, Grayscale’s GBTC, and Bitwise’s BITB, also experienced outflows of $39.85 million, $36.46 million, and $18.6 million, respectively. VanEck’s HODL was the only fund to buck the trend, recording a modest inflow of $619.55K. Meanwhile, the nine spot Ethereum funds also reported two consecutive weeks of negative flows, with $455 million exiting the funds, reflecting broader bearish sentiment in the crypto market. You might also like: Bitcoin tumbles to $80K as Trump’s economic policies stir debate Despite widespread anticipation that the White House Crypto Summit could provide a boost to the market, Bitcoin ETFs continued their downward trend. Analysts attribute this decline to ongoing macroeconomic concerns, particularly President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and overall economic uncertainty, which appear to be shaking investor confidence in digital assets. Some experts suggest that strategic market shifts are also contributing to the sell-off. One prevailing theory is that hedge funds have been capitalizing on low-risk arbitrage trades between Bitcoin spot ETFs and CME futures. As these trades unwind, liquidity is drying up, leading to increased selling pressure and exacerbating ETF outflows. Another factor influencing Bitcoin’s recent price swings is Trump’s announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. While many traders expected the Crypto Summit to be a bullish event, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price instead dropped from $90,000 to $85,000 following the signing of the executive order. According to Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of Komodo, Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing major outflows despite the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve due to a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” In such scenarios, assets typically rise in anticipation of an event but decline once it materializes. Stadelmann noted that speculation about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve began in July 2024 when Trump first mentioned the initiative. By the time the official announcement was made during Thursday’s Crypto Summit, the market had already priced it in, leading to a sell-off. He added that in these situations, “people who are less informed, connected, and monied often buy the news and lose money.” Additionally, the summit took place during a challenging time for the market, with concerns over trade tariffs compounding existing worries about inflation, a slowing real estate market, weak consumer spending, and declining savings.

Yesterday, the Bitcoin price dropped by around 6.37% – the most severe drop since the March 3 decline of 8.53%. Currently, at $82,362.27, the BTC market is struggling to recover from yesterday’s correction. Interestingly, Bloomberg Economics’ analysis of the gold-to-BTC ratio reveals what could be expected in the gold-BTC market in the coming days. The price of gold now stands at $2,909.42. The gold-to-Bitcoin ratio now stands at 0.034. The analysis suggests that there is a high chance for a sharp shift in the gold-to-BTC ratio in the near future. Dive in for more details! Gold-to-Bitcoin Ratio Could Drop A drop in the gold-to-BTC ratio means the price of gold has decreased in comparison to the price of BTC. In early March 2024, the gold-to-BTC ratio was very close to its current level. In early September 2024, it touched the yearly peak of 0.047. In late November 2024, when the US political landscape shifted in favour of the crypto industry, the ratio was at 0.029. On the first day of this year, the ratio was around 0.028. Though in late January 2025, it slipped to as low as 0.026, in February, it showcased constant growth. On February 26, it touched a peak of 0.035. Currently, the ratio remains at 0.034. Notably, in February, when the ratio experienced steep growth, the BTC market recorded a severe drop of 17.5%. A post on X by Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, suggests that there is a chance of the gold-to-Bitcoin ratio declining in the coming days. Gold $3,000, Bitcoin $70,000? The ounces of #gold equal to a #Bitcoin at about 28x on March 9 is at risk of dropping toward 21x, based on Bloomberg Economics' model. My bias is leaning that way, especially if the US #stockmarket reverses some of last year's almost $12 trillion… pic.twitter.com/tWrftnGyhi — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) March 9, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is Crypto Market Down Today ? When Will it Recover? , Bitcoin May Gain Strength Over Gold What McGlaone’s post indicates is that Bitcoin could become more valuable than gold in the coming days. The analyst states that if the US stock market falls, it may affect gold and Bitcoin. In the last month, the S&P 500 has recorded a fall of 4.87%. In the last week alone, the market has plummeted by over 3.50%. The YTD performance of the S&P 500 market remains at 1.68%. In conclusion, Bloomberg’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin may gain more value compared to gold in the coming days, especially if the US stock continues to decline. The recent shifts in the gold-to-BTC ratio highlight Bitcoin’s potential strength. If the trend follows past patterns, Bitcoin’s price could rise while gold’s comparative value declines. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On-chain data from Onchain Lens reveals that between April and November 2022, this investor acquired 25.12 million XRP from Binance at an average price of $0.429, spending approximately $10.77 million. During this period, the whale contributed their holdings to a liquidity pool with Binance Coin (BNB), accumulating an additional 1.38 million XRP. With the asset experiencing renewed market activity, the investor has chosen to exit, securing an estimated $56.87 million in profits. The timing of this large deposit suggests a potential shift in sentiment among major XRP holders, particularly as significant policy changes take effect in the U.S. crypto landscape. XRP Sell-Off Aligns with U.S. Digital Asset Strategy The whale’s Binance transfer happened just one day after the U.S. government released finalized documents detailing its approach to managing its Digital Asset Stockpile and establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve . This development has fueled concerns about the potential treatment of the token and other cryptocurrencies under the new framework. The policy grants Bitcoin special protection from liquidation, ensuring that any BTC added to the reserve cannot be sold. In contrast, XRP and other digital assets do not have the same safeguards, leaving them vulnerable to potential sell-offs at the discretion of the U.S. Treasury. The lack of restrictions on liquidating these assets introduces uncertainty that could influence market behavior. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Implications and Investor Sentiment The decision by this long-term XRP holder to cash out at this moment has led to speculation regarding its motives. While profit-taking is likely a key factor, the withdrawal coincides with growing concerns about XRP’s regulatory standing and role in the broader crypto market. Historically, policy changes have influenced market dynamics, and the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s future treatment could be a contributing factor in large holders reconsidering their positions. If major investors anticipate potential government intervention or forced liquidations, they may opt to secure profits now rather than face the risk of increased volatility later. Although this single transaction does not necessarily indicate a larger trend, it highlights the ongoing regulatory uncertainties surrounding XRP. Whether other long-term holders will follow suit remains to be seen, but market participants will likely continue monitoring whale activity and policy developments for further signals. This recent whale transaction underscores XRP’s market resilience and the evolving regulatory landscape that could impact its future. With Bitcoin receiving special protections under the new U.S. policy while XRP remains exposed to potential sell-offs, investors are now assessing the long-term implications. As institutional and retail sentiment fluctuates, The token’s price movement will likely be influenced by regulatory clarity, whale activity, and broader market trends in the coming months.

Referred to as House Bill 230 , Utah’s State Senate passed the bill with a 19-7-3 vote on March 7. However, this version no longer includes the Bitcoin reserve clause. The bill is now headed to Governor Spencer Cox for approval. Initially, the bill proposed allowing Utah’s state treasurer to invest up to 5% of certain public funds into Bitcoin and other qualifying digital assets. Utah was leading the Bitcoin reserve race and was widely expected to be the first U.S. state to pass such a law due to its short 45-day legislative window and strong political momentum. However, the clause was scrapped during the final Senate reading on March 7, and the House later concurred with the amendment in a 52-19-4 vote, sealing its removal from the bill. With the reserve clause gone, HB230 only includes provisions that protect the right to mine Bitcoin, run a node, and participate in staking, ensuring residents can engage in blockchain activities without regulatory overreach. It also establishes basic custody protections, giving Utahns clearer rights when holding digital assets.

According to Bitcoin Laws, two Arizona Senate bills and the Texas Senate bill (TX S) are now next in line to establish a state-backed Bitcoin reserve. Arizona’s bills have already cleared committee stages and are awaiting final floor votes, while Texas’ proposal has moved to the House . Meanwhile, other states, including Kentucky, New Hampshire , Illinois, and Iowa, still have live Bitcoin reserve bills in progress, but they remain further behind in the legislative process. In related news, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 7 that establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. However, the reserve would be funded via assets seized by the federal government instead of direct investments.

Priced at just $0.006, the token has already raised over $17 million, attracting a surge of investor interest. Despite the challenges faced by the broader crypto market, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach and strong community support are driving its growth and appeal. With a focus on bridging AI and blockchain, this rapidly growing project is seen as a promising opportunity by both new and seasoned investors. As uncertainty continues to loom over the market, Lightchain AI’s early momentum positions it as one of the most intriguing altcoins to watch in 2025, offering potential for significant returns amidst market turbulence. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what sets Lightchain AI apart and why it has garnered such overwhelming support. Market Sentiment and the Crypto Fear Index The crypto market has been under intense pressure, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reflecting a state of heightened anxiety among investors. Market sentiment has been shaky, with prices fluctuating wildly due to economic uncertainty, regulatory concerns, and major institutional developments. As fear dominates the market, many investors are retreating into safer assets, unsure of the market’s next move. However, this climate of fear also creates opportunities for those willing to look beyond the chaos. Some altcoins, such as Lightchain AI, have managed to stay resilient, showing a strong presale performance and attracting substantial investor interest. As the fear index rises, investors are looking for promising alternatives that can weather the storm, and Lightchain AI’s innovative approach to AI and blockchain technology may be exactly what the market needs. Can Lightchain AI Maintain its Momentum? As the crypto market experiences heightened fear and uncertainty, Lightchain AI is standing out with impressive momentum. Despite the overall downturn in market sentiment, Lightchain AI’s presale has seen significant success, attracting millions in investor demand. This momentum is fueled by the project’s innovative integration of AI and blockchain, offering a unique value proposition that sets it apart from traditional cryptocurrencies. While market conditions remain volatile, Lightchain AI’s solid fundamentals and growing investor interest position it as a potential leader in the emerging AI-driven crypto space. The challenge will be whether the project can maintain this momentum as it moves from presale to wider adoption. However, with a dedicated team, clear use cases, and strong backing, Lightchain AI has the potential to continue attracting attention and growth in the face of market adversity. Why Lightchain AI is Worth Watching In a market overwhelmed by fear and uncertainty, Lightchain AI has emerged as a project worth watching. Its presale has already raised significant funds, reflecting investor confidence despite the broader market downturn. The project stands out due to its unique combination of AI and blockchain technology, offering innovative solutions for both industries. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI is driven by tangible use cases and promises to integrate artificial intelligence in ways that can disrupt existing ecosystems. With an expanding network of supporters and a focus on long-term utility, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a potential leader in the evolving crypto space. Investors are keeping a close eye on its progress, as it combines cutting-edge technology with a solid roadmap, making it one to watch in 2025 and beyond. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://twitter.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-10 07:29:59

Since its mainstream launch Dogecoin has surprised the public multiple times with unexpected achievements. The current value of DOGE stands at $0.2039 while the market shows stability in this volatile period. Expert analysts suggest DOGE could reach $6.24 as long as traders keep their positions higher than $0.16 support level. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the presale success attracts 4,900 holders while raising $2.7 million. MUTM demonstrates high investment potential based on its present $0.015 value while Phase 2 of its presale shows 85% completion success. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin with Serious Potential The cryptocurrency Dogecoin achieved impressive growth while changing its position from a joke currency to a prominent cryptocurrency in the market. DOGE has attracted strong community support even while its origins were seen as a joke and now attracts increasing investment from institutional entities. Technical analyst Ali Martinez observed that Dogecoin (DOGE) remains under an ascending parallel channel as it trades on the market. The price of Dogecoin could rise to $2.74 then potentially up to $6.24 if its support level remains above $0.16. If Dogecoin manages to secure an ETF approval it would likely enhance its future position. Firms including Grayscale and WisdomTree have shown their institutional backing for DOGE by submitting their applications to regulatory bodies. The index’s target at $6.24 would become more reachable after this development brings significant liquidity and stability. Mutuum Finance: A DeFi Powerhouse in the Making The core community support behind Dogecoin remains its foundation but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains market value through its practical applications in the real world. The project’s decentralized lending model and innovative tokenomics have positioned it as a standout in the crowded DeFi space. Early investors can acquire MUTM tokens during its present Phase 2 presale period at $0.015 until the price increases to $0.02 during the subsequent phase. The demand for Mutuum Finance grows from its distinct characteristics which combine mtTokens with its buy-and-distribute model. MUTM demand remains stable because the distribution system utilizes platform revenue to acquire MUTM before giving them to staking participants. Uplifted market price values accompany the incentive system which encourages users to maintain token ownership. Initial investors who purchased at $0.06 during presale would earn 400% profit when the token launched. After launch analysts predict MUTM will achieve $1.50 which would bring investors a remarkable 9,900% ROI from the present presale value. The projected financial gains demonstrate how this project provides huge lifetime benefits to purchasers who make their investments early. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out Mutuum Finance has bridged innovation with pragmatic design elements in order to achieve its current level of success. Financial utility stands as the main strength of MUTM because it operates through a platform that enables lending and borrowing services for users. The platform achieves operational stability through its collateral structure which also draws both parties because of its adaptive interest rate system. The current project success demonstrates increasing demand because the presale phase raised $2.7 million and Phase 2 is approaching completion. Since security and transparency are core priorities of this platform it further strengthens its market appeal. Mutuum Finance works with established security firms to examine its smart contracts which helps establish its secure and robust environment. MUTM presents investors with a strong option thanks to its focus on safety and its creative features that drive long-term market expansion. The Two Cryptos You Need Dogecoin and Mutuum Finance stand out among other tokens because they show strong potential to expand tremendously through 2025. Dogecoin attracts high-risk investors through its popular culture aspect and trading patterns although Mutuum Finance introduces a measured DeFi entrance through its useful crypto model. Investors who seek to take advantage of future market opportunities should consider the MUTM presale as their best opportunity to obtains tokens at their base value. With Phase 2 of the presale nearly filled, time is running out to join the Mutuum Finance revolution. Don’t miss your chance to be part of a project poised for significant growth.

William Banks posts with friends from prison. Source: William Banks X/Twitter His name has flooded X (formerly Twitter), with some calling him a scammer and others hailing him as Robin Hood. Either way, the story is real, and it all played out in real-time on social media, proving once again that there is no place more entertaining than the crypto community. So, who is William Banks exactly? William, known for his unhinged performances in short films and underground comedy, made headlines in February after launching a Solana-based meme coin called White Moses (MOSES) on Pump.fun. Investors poured money into the project, causing its market cap to skyrocket to $257,000 in under an hour. Then, just as fast, William dumped his holdings, tanking the price and leaving investors with nothing. He later deleted all posts promoting the coin and posted on X, saying, “William Banks is Robin Hood. Thank you to the crypto community for buying my pretend memecoin and helping me to raise $50,000 for the crisis in Gaza. Free Palestine.” The Palestinian charities William Banks donated to. Source: X/Twitter William also shared five separate receipts showing $10,000 donations to various Palestinian charities. Some organizations confirmed receiving the money, while others were still yet to comment as of press time. The internet went into full meltdown mode. Some accused him of fraud. Others called him a hero. Political commentator Eden Riley posted on X, “He escaped from jail only to immediately rug-pull a bunch of crypto bros to donate the money to Palestine… he might be the greatest to ever do it.” Escaping from jail and going viral William’s crypto stunt came just weeks after his prison escape, which was also documented on X. He had been arrested in Connecticut for allegedly stealing and throwing away five Israeli signs from people’s yards. He was sentenced to eight months in jail in October 2024, posting before his trial, “Hey I just want to be honest with everyone. I’m facing some pretty serious charges in the state of Connecticut that could result in my imprisonment. My trial is tomorrow and I might be going away for a little bit.” Two days later, he hilariously updated his followers: “I have terrible news. The state of Connecticut has sentenced me to 8 months in jail beginning on Nov 15. I have always tried to make the most out of my life, but today I am presented with an overwhelming challenge to overcome.” While behind bars, William continued posting on X, gaining a cult following for his bizarre content. But what happened next defied reality. A riot broke out inside the jail, and in the chaos, William escaped. William later posted a video reenactment, showing himself crawling under a fence, racking up over 20 million views. By the time authorities realized he was gone, he had already moved on to his next scheme—crypto. How amazing is that? Life on the run with a girlfriend and a fanbase Despite being a fugitive, William is still active online, and he’s not hiding. He’s been posting videos with his new girlfriend, a mystery “baddie” who appears in clips laughing, dancing, and even smoking with him. William Banks and his girlfriend. Source : William Banks X/twitter. Cryptopolitan would describe their content as “bizarre”, but neither us nor William’s followers can look away. And X users have mixed reactions to his chaotic rise to fame. One person wrote , “William Banks got an 8-month jail bid for stealing Israel signs out of people’s yards, does 4 months, says fuck it, becomes White Moses and orchestrates a breakout. My new greatest of all time.” Another guy posted, “William you have to stop. You smoke too tough. Your swag is too different. Your girl is too bad. They’ll kill you.” This one guy humorously said , “Nothing against William Banks but any time I see a guy with a beautiful girlfriend I hope he gets hit by a car.” William Banks and friend in prison. But others believe it’s nothing but a bit, with one guy saying , “Can’t wait to watch William Banks get shot in the neck before bleeding out in an efficiency apartment on some random account’s live stream two days from now. (I’ll be smiling quietly because I’m a special smart boy and I know it’s a bit).” Cryptopolitan has reached out to William for a comment, and will promptly publish an update if he responds. For now, the hero remains free, still posting, still dodging the law, and with a fanbase that’s watching his every move, including the author of this article.

The number of weekly active addresses has surged to a fresh record high, indicating heightened interest among traders. Despite this spike, XRP price is still struggling to gain momentum. As market interest rises, can XRP price stage a recovery? XRP price today trades at $2.19 after a nearly 6% drop in 24 hours. XRP Price Hints at a Rebound as Weekly Active Addresses Hit ATH Data from Santiment shows that the number of weekly active XRP addresses has increased significantly over the past week. These addresses have surged to 1.15M, indicating high network usage and market interest. XRP Weekly Active Addresses This rise has also coincided with a surge in transaction activity. According to market analyst ScottMelker, XRP transactions have skyrocketed to $5 billion within 24 hours. At the same time, wallet activity has increased by more than 600%. The surge in active addresses and transaction count may precede a rebound for XRP price due to rising interest. However, such a rebound is dependent on whether this rise in network activity is sustained. Short Sellers Increase Positions on XRP Data from Coinglass shows a massive increase in short positions on XRP. This is after a sudden spike in negative funding rates, which points towards increased pressure from short sellers betting that XRP price will drop further. XRP Funding Rates If the funding rates remain negative for an extended period, it increases the risk of a short squeeze. If Ripple price makes a sudden recovery, and these short sellers are forced to close their positions, it could accelerate the upward momentum. XRP Price Retests Multi-Month Support as Sell Signal Emerges XRP price has dropped to retest a multi-month support level at $2.14. Ripple has bounced from this support price before, but if sell-side pressure continues, it may lead to a breach of this critical level. The MACD line has crossed below the signal line and formed a sell signal, which may push Ripple price lower. However, the Stoch RSI suggests that Ripple may be oversold, which could hint at possible seller exhaustion and trigger a reversal. For Ripple price to avert a drop below the $2 psychological level, it needs to flip critical resistance at $2.60. If it makes a decisive breakout above this level, it could pave the way for XRP price to rally past $3 . XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart The rising network activity suggests that market interest in Ripple is rising. If this surge leads to traders accumulating XRP during the dip , it could trigger an XRP price recovery.

In a Mar. 10 post on X, Bailey suggested that Silk Road liquidations could be happening despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, potentially contributing to the recent downturn in BTC’s price. Bailey’s claim sparked discussion within the cryptocurrency community. If the DOJ has been liquidating America’s bitcoin with haste (in defiance of the President) ever since getting court approval to do so 3 months ago… then Bitcoin’s price action makes perfect sense. — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) March 10, 2025 Some users have rejected the notion asserting that the DOJ’s holdings, just like Germany’s 2024 Bitcoin sales , lack enough volume to have a substantial effect on the market. Others pointed to broader macroeconomic factors as having a greater impact on Bitcoin’s price. Bailey has also previously suggested that Trump should enable Bitcoin payments for his proposed “Gold Card,” aimed at attracting foreign investors. Though entirely theoretical, the concept shows the rising convergence of global capital flows, politics, and Bitcoin. At the same time, some experts have proposed selling off other assets seized by the U.S. government to prop up Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . As of Mar. 10, the federal government held 60,850 Ethereum ( ETH ), around $125 million, 122 million Tether ( USDT ), and other assets such as Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ), according to data from Arkham Intelligence. Proponents of the idea have pointed out that these holdings have the potential to provide an extra 5,000 BTC if they are liquidated.

Risky assets like Bitcoin may be under more pressure if bond spreads continue to expand, he cautioned. Bitcoin is like playing a game of Chicken with central banks.

In this thread, I'll explain how these factors interact… pic.twitter.com/gWaGlVyo2A — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) March 10, 2025 But he remained optimistic, pointing to factors like growing nation-state Bitcoin holdings, possible ETF inflows, and the possibility that Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy will buy up to 200,000 BTC this year. As the market continues to respond to the uncertainties surrounding Trump’s economic policies, the price of Bitcoin fell to $80,052 on Mar. 10, a 7% decrease over the previous day. Traders are now watching key economic reports, including the Consumer Price Index on Mar.12 and the Producer Price Index on Mar.13, which could influence Bitcoin’s next move.

A correction of this magnitude is nothing new in a bull market, and previous cycles have seen larger pullbacks, so prices could drop even further. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted further losses on X on March 9, saying that BTC would retest $78,000, where it last hit on Feb. 28. “If it fails, $75,000 is next in the crosshairs,” he added. Meanwhile, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, Anthony Pompliano, observed that the Fear and Greed Index for crypto one year ago was at “extreme greed” of 92, and today it is at “extreme fear” of 17. “Bitcoin is 20% higher over the same time frame,” he said before adding, “Don’t get tricked by online sentiment. It is all noise.” Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back was also bullish, saying that people are undervaluing the US strategic Bitcoin reserve announcement : “It is huge for moving the overton window, the actual US government promoting Bitcoin. provides the new ultimate reference for sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds to add bitcoin allocations.” people are undervaluing the US strategic bitcoin reserve announcement: it is huge for moving the overton window, the actual US government promoting bitcoin. provides the new ultimate reference for sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds to add bitcoin allocations. — Adam Back (@adam3us) March 9, 2025 Price Leads Narrative Analyst Miles Deutscher was a little more pragmatic, saying that “price often leads narrative.” “Even though it seems like there is no north star right now, at any point, we could see a huge rally – and everyone will create reasons to be bullish again,” he said before adding that it has happened time and time again. BTC was trading down 4.3% on the day at $82,394 at the time of writing and had lost 11% over the past seven days.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 5.61% in 24-hours to $2.19. Ripple’s XRP finally neared the long-awaited $3 mark after President Donald Trump announced a new U.S. strategic crypto reserve that will include XRP and other digital assets. The number of active XRP addresses has shot up by an astonishing 620% in a week, rising from 74,589 to 462,650. XRP price is currently down 5.61% to $2.19. If the bullish momentum kicks in, XRP could aim at its next resistance levels at $2.35. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, XRP price will remain range bound between its key support levels at $2.08 and $2.09. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $2.46 Market Cap $141.02 billion Trading Volume $14.24 billion Circulating Supply 57.94 billion XRP All-time High $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time Low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 24-hour high $2.95 24-hour low $2.43 XRP Price Prediction 2025 A few factors will likely shape XRP’s market performance in 2025. The main factor that will decide XRP’s trend in 2025 is the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . Successively, analysts are expecting a resolution in March, considering that the SEC has dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. However, there’s more in store, as the U.S. President Donald Trump had mentioned XRP being included in the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve. Moreover, Ripple and Ondo Finance will be bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to XRPL, to improve speed, efficiency, and adoption by institutions. Talking about on-chain, the active receiving addresses have shot up to 356,581, compared to 43,882 on February 17. XRP Ledger Active Receiving Addresses If things go in favor of Ripple, XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness a strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be at $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040 and 2050.

Not even Trump’s advice to “never sell your Bitcoin” at Friday’s crypto summit was enough to boost the asset back over $90,000, and it has weakened over the weekend. Markets will have key inflation reports to digest this week, and hotter-than-expected figures could rattle risk on assets such as stocks and crypto. Economic Events March 10 to 14 Wednesday will see the release of February’s Core CPI data. The Consumer Price Index is one of the two key inflation indicators as it reflects price trends in the economy, shapes consumer spending, and directly affects the Fed’s policy rate decisions. Bitcoin prices fell following higher-than-expected CPI figures in February, so history could repeat itself if the figures are not favorable. “A hot CPI print will likely scare the market,” Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, told Reuters. “The market still wants the Fed to come to the rescue… Until inflation and inflation expectations come down, the Fed is handcuffed,” he added. The reports are followed by February’s PPI (Producer Price Index) report on Thursday, which reflects input prices for producers and manufacturers. This data measures the costs of producing consumer goods, which directly affects retail pricing and is also viewed as a signal of inflationary pressures. US inflation has increased every month since September and hit 3% last month, and the trend is likely to continue with CPI for February expected to have climbed 0.3%, according to a Reuters poll. The inflation reports will be among the last key pieces of data before the Federal Reserve next meets on March 18 and 19, when it is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at 4.25% to 4.5% Key Events This Week: 1.

February PPI Inflation data – Thursday 6. MI Consumer Sentiment data -… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 9, 2025 A preliminary consumer sentiment analysis is due on Friday, offering further insight into consumer inflation expectations. This week, job openings and jobless claims reports will also be released, offering insight into changing labor market trends. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets continue to weaken with total capitalization tanking 6.5% on the day in a fall to $2.8 trillion. Bitcoin has slumped 4.5% in a fall to just over $80,000 in early trading in Asia on Monday morning. The asset made a slight recovery to reclaim $82,000 at the time of writing, however, it remains down more than 11% since this time last week. Ethereum has fared worse as usual, tanking 6% to a 16-month low of $2,000 on March 10 and it hasn’t shown signs of recovery. The altcoins were bleeding with larger losses for Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, Pi Network, Chainlink, and Hedera.

This latest decline places the cryptocurrency roughly 25% below its all-time high of $109,900. Analysts attribute the downturn to ongoing trade tensions—linked to President Donald Trump’s latest tariff measures—and the fears of a looming recession. Meanwhile, a weakening US Dollar Index (DXY), which has fallen from 110 to 103 since mid-January, coinciding with Trump’s second term in office and could be a potential bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price. In a series of posts on X, Jamie Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, offers a look at the current market environment, highlighting two key metrics that could shape central bank policy—and, by extension, Bitcoin’s trajectory. “Bitcoin is like playing a game of Chicken with central banks,” Coutts writes. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Signal Aligns With Price Tops, CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals He explained that while the dollar’s recent decline supports a bullish framework for Bitcoin, rising Treasury bond volatility (tracked by the MOVE Index) and widening corporate bond spreads are causing concern: Coutts emphasized the role of US Treasuries as the global collateral asset. Any spike in their volatility, he argued, forces lenders to impose larger haircuts on collateral, tightening liquidity. “Rising volatility forces lenders to apply haircuts on collateral, thereby tightening liquidity. Above 110 [on the MOVE Index] and I suspect there will be a few concerns at the central planner levels.” Over the past three weeks, US investment-grade corporate bond spreads have been widening, a shift Coutts views as a signal that risk assets—including Bitcoin—could face pressure: “This suggests that the demand keeping yields compressed relative to Treasuries is fading—and further widening could be negative for risk assets.” Despite these cautionary flags, Coutts remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s medium-term prospects, primarily due to the dollar’s “rapid decline.” He noted that the dollar’s drop in March—one of the most significant monthly dips in 12 years—historically has coincided with bullish inflection points in Bitcoin’s price. According to his research, “They have all occurred at Bitcoin bear market troughs (inflection points) or mid-cycle bull markets (trend continuations).” Related Reading: If This Happens, Bitcoin Price Will Shoot To $140,000, Says Analyst While acknowledging the limited historical dataset for Bitcoin, Coutts also cited key catalysts he believes could propel the digital asset higher: Nation-State Adoption: “A global nation-state race is underway,” Coutts wrote, describing a scenario in which countries either include Bitcoin in their strategic reserves or ramp up mining efforts. Corporate Accumulation: He points to the possibility of companies—particularly Strategy (MSTR)—adding 100,000 to 200,000 BTC this year. ETF Positions: Exchange-traded funds may “double their positions,” further driving institutional inflows. Liquidity Dynamics: In Coutts’s words, “The Spice Must Flow.” Coutts also mentioned that Bitcoin appears to be “filling a big gap” and reiterated his view that a slide below the high-$70,000 range would signal a fundamental market shift. Meanwhile, he sees central bankers edging closer to possible intervention as Treasury volatility and credit spreads climb: “If Treasury volatility and bond spreads keep rising, asset prices will continue their decline. Meanwhile, this will likely push the central planners to act.” In closing, Coutts offered a concise summary of why he believes Bitcoin is effectively locked in a showdown with central banks: “Think of Bitcoin as a high-stakes game of chicken with the central planners. With their options dwindling—and assuming HODLers remain unleveraged—the odds are increasingly in the Bitcoin owner’s favor.” For now, the world’s largest cryptocurrency appears to be treading a line between macroeconomic headwinds—highlighted by a volatile bond market—and the tailwinds of a weakening dollar. Whether Bitcoin continues to retreat or resumes its long-term ascent will likely depend on how global policymakers respond to mounting bond market pressures—and whether holders are prepared to keep playing “chicken” with the central planners. At press time, BTC traded at $82,091.

This has caused the creation of certain tokens like Monero for privacy and anonymity. Combining Monero with new DeFi project Remittix will ensure the highest form of security as far as crypto liquidation and transfers are concerned. Already, XMR and Ripple users are flocking to the new project, even if it’s for different reasons. The XRP price is already suffering from the negative crypto policy backlash in the past few days. Here’s more on the crypto gist. Ripple Users are Withdrawing Holdings from XRP The Donald Trump-led administration promised to have an easier, softer grip on crypto regulations, allowing the sector to grow adequately. However, for the most part, all the policies in these first few months have not yielded the results most crypto folk would expect. An example is the hard fall that hit the XRP price after Trump’s executive order for a Strategy crypto reserve. The reserve seeks to use the top stable cryptos as a hedge against inflation, but the current focus is on Bitcoin. Subsequently, metrics like the XRP price and other chart parameters started to fall. As there was little hope for a change in the order at the White House Crypto Summit, most XRP traders have started to transfer out their holdings. Some traders withdrew about $130 million worth of Ripple tokens from Binance, contributing to the 1.31% weekly loss. Monero with Remittix: Anonymity and Privacy at its Best! The XMR blockchain has a reputation for being the strictest platform when it comes to privacy. While the regular crypto network promotes decentralisation and anonymous trading, Monero takes its own policies even a notch higher. As a result, the blockchain is a hub of sorts for criminal asset transfers, especially the active black market in the US and the Middle East. Already, the US Treasury has had to seize $1.6 million worth of crypto assets associated with the Nemesis darknet, assets that were traded across blacklisted Monero and Bitcoin addresses. Still, all the anonymity only makes Monero a top choice for transactions. XMR coins trade at $219.56, with a 2.21% fall in the past week. Using the Monero chain together with Remittix (RTX) will only boost the level of privacy and anonymity on crypto transactions. That’s probably where that flux to the RTX presale is coming from. Transfer Crypto Tokens in Private with Remittix Privacy, especially with the level of globalization we’re experiencing, is going to be really difficult to navigate on the regular crypto network. There are chain monitors that flag huge token movements and asset movements associated with certain wallets. That’s where Remittix gains the upper hand over the average crypto blockchain. Sure, traders can withdraw their crypto assets directly into fiat bank accounts, but the transaction can never be traced back to the crypto platform. The Remittix API incorporates one-time-generated smart contracts that operate independent of the blockchain, converting crypto assets into appropriate fiat currencies before resolving the transactions in the provided fiat accounts. By eliminating the introduction of intermediate service providers for converting and resolving transactions, Remittix removes the possibility of being traced, making it a secure, anonymous route to get crypto tokens from wallets into fiat bank accounts. Plus, unlike Ripple, the Remittix project caters directly to traders’ needs, allowing them to liquidate their assets directly into their fiat accounts without paying more charges than the standard gas fees. While Ripple might be best for corporations like banks, Remittix is the crypto equivalent of SWIFT–fast, secure, private, and user-friendly. Get Into the Remittix Presale Early! Joining a new project early is the fastest way to benefitting maximally from it. Remittix is more of an investment for the long run–the anonymity and privacy are big selling points for crypto traders, along with its drastically low fees. Even then, you could get some ROI from the presale, but only if you buy early enough. Each RTX coin goes for $0.0734 now–build your stash and hold for even greater returns!

Since then, though, the valuation has crashed by over 50%. Pi Network’s native token started trading on February 20 when the team launched its Open Network. The massive milestone was highly expected and came nearly six years after the project’s birth. During its first trading days, PI’s price experienced huge volatility, ranging from $0.64 to a peak of almost $3 (registered on February 27). Since then, though, the valuation has been gradually declining. Several hours ago, PI tanked to as low as $1.26 before rebounding to the current $1.41 (per CoinGecko’s data). This represents a 12% decrease on a daily scale and 16% on a weekly basis . PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most evident factor negatively affecting PI’s performance is the overall correction of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly plunged to $80,000, while many leading altcoins are also deep in the red for the day. Another element could be Binance’s intervention, or more precisely, its lack of action. Last month, the biggest crypto exchange held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see PI available for trading. The results became official on February 27, with over 86% of the voters clicking the “yes” option. However, the company has remained silent on the matter. A potential listing would boost the coin’s liquidity and accessibility and could create upward pressure on the price. Some well-known crypto exchanges that have already allowed trading services with PI include Bitget, OKX, and MEXC.

With only a few days left until the final migration deadline, many users report unresolved technical issues, raising concerns about the project's management and transparency. The Pi Network has set March 14, 2025 , as the critical deadline for users to complete their Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and migrate their tokens. According to the network’s announcement, those who fail to finalize the process by 8:00 AM UTC will lose most of their Pi holdings, except for coins mined in the last six months. The team argues that multiple extensions have already been given to ensure maximum participation, but the current deadline is final. Despite these assurances, many Pioneers report being stuck in the migration process, unable to transfer their Pi despite completing all required steps. Some users claim that they have followed every instruction but remain locked out of Mainnet migration. One user, Jaro Giesbrecht , expressed his frustration on social media, stating that despite completing the checklist, his balance remains unverified, with no response from the support team. Other users echo similar concerns, describing the process as confusing and unhelpful. Several have taken to social media to demand an extension of the migration deadline until all technical problems are resolved. A major complaint revolves around Step 9 on the Mainnet checklist— “Migrate to Mainnet” —which some users say remains unresolved, preventing their tokens from being transferred. The controversy comes as Pi Coin experiences a significant price decline in the market. Over the past week, Pi Coin has dropped sharply, with its price down by double digits. Some analysts remain hopeful that Pi Day, March 14 , will bring a price rebound, as excitement builds over potential market movements. However, the token’s price struggles raise questions about its long-term sustainability. Adding to the uncertainty, Pi Network supporters are pushing for a Binance listing . The exchange recently launched a ""Vote to List"" feature, allowing users to vote on new coin listings. The Pi Coin community overwhelmingly voted in favor, with 86% of participants supporting a listing. However, Binance retains the final decision-making power, and so far, the exchange has not made any official announcements regarding Pi Coin’s fate. The lack of response has fueled anger among Pioneers, with many accusing Binance of ignoring community demands. In protest, frustrated users have flooded Binance and Bybit with one-star reviews on the Google Play Store, attempting to pressure the exchanges into taking action. This reaction follows previous skepticism from industry leaders, including the Bybit CEO , who has openly called Pi Network a scam. As the March 14 deadline approaches , tensions continue to rise. If Pi Network does not address users' concerns, it risks further backlash from the community. Many Pioneers now face the possibility of losing their tokens due to unresolved technical issues, leaving the project’s credibility in question. Whether Binance will move forward with a listing remains uncertain, but for now, Pi Network users remain in limbo.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-10 07:56:51

Interestingly, the most significant drop came from the Ethereum price struggles, catering to the 65% of the loss. In addition, the rest of the altcoins took a considerable toll, revealing the poor state of the market. The reports suggest that $619M has been liquidated in the last 24 hours, resulting in the global crypto market cap declining to $2.7T, which was last seen before Trump’s election win. Crypto Market Crash: The Trump Effect on Crypto The crypto stance of Donald Trump has led to the crypto space’s betterment. The crypto market witnessed significant gains but lows as well. This started with investors’ rising confidence in the industry, Bitcoin’s price hitting new highs, Trump announcing a U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, hosting the Crypto Summit, and much more. These events reveal the ongoing developments and the effect Trump has on the crypto space. Before this, the crypto industry was battling stricter regulations instead of developments. With the Crypto Summit, more things will align positively for the industry. However, critics have presented a different take, especially on Trump’s crypto portfolio as a conflict of interest. With higher expectations and rising uncertainty, the crypto market crashed. Analysts believe this happened as uncertainty surrounded these key events. However, things may turn in favor in the long term with these events catering to benefit the industry with grown adoption. Donald Trump Crypto Move: A Risky Precedent? Amid the high optimism around the U.S. Strategic Reserve, analysts have pointed out several risks with forming a government-backed reserve. The Solana co-founder’s controversial post claims it is against the nature of decentralization, while the others add that it could result in market manipulation by the government. In addition, it could bring corruption risk, favoritism of assets, regulatory capture, as they could shape policies in their favor, and much more. Crypto critic Peter Schiff even mocked Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve, claiming he is launching one himself. These incidents reveal the investors’ diverted sentiments on these Trump events, resulting in the crypto market crash. Conclusion: Was Crypto Better Before Donald Trump? Along with highs, crypto has seen devastating lows since Trump’s political resurgence. While his crypto policies aim to make the United States the crypto capital, they have also increased volatility. Along with that, ethical concerns are also rising, with many questioning Trump’s effect. With numerous crypto market crash incidents since Donald Trump came into power, few critics believe the market was better before. However, this is a conditional claim, and the outlook seems optimistic for the long term, as the U.S. The President’s crypto stance could push for global adoption and regulation.

While some states have introduced regulatory sandboxes for financial and blockchain innovation, the absence of a nationwide approach makes compliance across different jurisdictions complex. Experts argue that establishing a unified sandbox would provide a controlled testing environment for emerging financial technologies, allowing regulators to develop well-informed policies while fostering responsible growth in the industry. Industry figures, including representatives from OilXCoin and Asset Token Ventures LLC, emphasize that while state-level sandboxes offer some flexibility, they lack the scale and coordination necessary for businesses to expand across borders. A federal sandbox would create a standardized framework that enhances clarity, encourages innovation, and maintains consumer protection. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major hurdle for blockchain and AI-driven fintech projects , as companies struggle to navigate varying interpretations of digital asset regulations. Several countries, including the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates, have already implemented national regulatory sandboxes , giving them a competitive edge in attracting fintech investments. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK pioneered this approach in 2014, enabling fintech startups to test products in a supervised environment while regulators refined their policies. Similarly, the UAE has four distinct sandboxes that focus on digital banking, blockchain, payment systems, and AI. Despite support from various industry leaders and some US regulators, challenges remain. The fragmented US regulatory system , with oversight from multiple agencies like the SEC and CFTC , complicates the process of establishing a single sandbox framework. Congressional approval would be required to implement such a system, potentially facing legal and political obstacles. However, bipartisan collaboration and regulatory flexibility could help bridge the gap between innovation and oversight, ensuring the US remains competitive in the global fintech space.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-10 08:00:27

However, after swift negotiations with the hacker, the platform managed to recover most of the stolen funds. The attacker agreed to return a large portion, keeping the rest as a bug bounty in exchange for their cooperation. This incident sheds light on both the vulnerabilities within decentralized finance and the increasing trend of ethical hacking in the industry. The breach, which occurred on March 5, stemmed from an exploit in an outdated version of the platform’s Fusion v1 resolver smart contract . Attackers leveraged this flaw to conduct unauthorized transactions . Notably, the exploit did not directly affect 1inch users but instead targeted a third-party market maker, TrustedVolumes. Upon detecting the intrusion, 1inch promptly redeployed its resolver contracts to prevent further exploits and minimize additional risks. Security firm Decurity, which analyzed the attack, confirmed that the hacker initiated an on-chain message shortly after carrying out the exploit. They proposed a deal to return the funds in exchange for a reward. Negotiations between TrustedVolumes and the attacker led to a rare resolution where a hacker voluntarily returned a significant portion of stolen assets. This highlights a shift in DeFi security responses, where white-hat negotiations sometimes prove more effective than traditional recovery methods. While this case ended with a mostly positive outcome, it marks the second major security incident for 1inch in the past six months. In late 2024, the platform suffered a front-end compromise due to a supply chain attack, exposing users to phishing threats. These repeated security challenges emphasize the importance of continuous smart contract audits , proactive monitoring, and swift mitigation strategies. In response to the latest attack, 1inch has urged all resolvers to transition to Fusion v2 , its updated version, which features enhanced security measures to prevent similar exploits. The company is also strengthening internal auditing procedures to ensure a higher level of protection against future vulnerabilities. Despite successfully recovering the stolen assets, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the persistent risks in decentralized finance. As DeFi protocols continue to evolve, maintaining rigorous security standards remains crucial for protecting users and reinforcing trust in the industry.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-10 08:03:34

While these established assets have strong fundamentals, their growth potential appears limited in the short term. As a result, investors are increasingly turning their attention to high-reward opportunities in the presale sector, where early-stage projects like The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) are generating significant interest. Could $TLD be the best altcoin to buy right now? Let’s analyze the market conditions, the struggles of Solana and Dogecoin, and why $TLD is rapidly gaining momentum. Solana (SOL) Faces Resistance as It Tries to Rebound Solana, often praised for its high-speed transactions and low fees, has been struggling to regain bullish momentum. Currently trading around $142, SOL has faced resistance at $147.88, preventing further breakout attempts. Analysts suggest that while Solana’s long-term outlook remains strong, its short-term performance may be sluggish due to profit-taking and macroeconomic factors affecting the crypto market. Many investors are hesitant to enter SOL at current levels, as the market cap is already substantial, limiting the potential for exponential gains. With Ethereum dominating the Layer 1 sector, Solana must prove itself through continued network growth and adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) Struggles with Speculation and High Volatility Dogecoin has long been a favorite among retail traders, thanks to its strong community and backing from public figures like Elon Musk. However, DOGE has struggled to hold key support levels, currently trading around $0.20, after a 1.93% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite efforts to increase its utility through Dogecoin’s integration with X (formerly Twitter) and potential payment use cases, the meme coin remains highly speculative. Without strong fundamentals or a clear roadmap for long-term growth, DOGE investors are looking for alternative assets with better upside potential. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) – A High-Growth Alternative with Real Utility While Solana and Dogecoin battle market uncertainties, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) is rapidly becoming one of the most sought-after early-stage crypto investments. The project introduces an innovative Play-to-Invest model that seamlessly integrates blockchain gaming and DeFi, creating a unique ecosystem where players can mine resources, battle for rewards, and gain early access to high-potential Web3 projects. Despite being in the presale stage, The Last Dwarfs already has a fully functional platform with over 300,000 users. The platform is integrated with Telegram and the TON blockchain, allowing it to tap into a massive audience of over 900 million potential users. The $TLD ecosystem is built around a gamified launchpad, where players can engage in the game while simultaneously investing in high potential tokens. $TLD Presale – The Final Opportunity Before Major Growth The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) has just entered Stage 2 of its presale, meaning that early investors have already missed the lowest price. However, there is still time to buy before the next price increase. Key benefits of the presale include: 300% APY staking rewards for early adopters. A referral program that allows investors to earn extra tokens for every referred purchase. With the presale rapidly selling out and the official launch approaching, $TLD is positioning itself as one of the most exciting investment opportunities of 2025. Final Thoughts – The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) Stands Out as the Best Crypto to Buy Now As Solana and Dogecoin navigate uncertain market conditions, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) emerges as a high-growth alternative with real-world utility and strong adoption potential. Unlike traditional altcoins, which rely on market speculation, $TLD offers a tangible use case through its gamified investment model, making it an attractive option for investors looking for long-term growth. With Stage 2 of the presale selling out fast, now may be the last chance to get in before $TLD hits major exchanges and gains even more traction. Investors looking for possibly the next 100x opportunity should keep a close eye on The Last Dwarfs ($TLD). Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano’s ADA led losses with a nearly 10% slump over the past 24 hours, data shows, with XRP falling more than 7%. BNB Chain’s BNB, ether (ETH) and tron's TRX) fell 5%, while BTC lost 4%. This has sent the well-followed crypto fear and green index to a multi-year low reading of 17 — which indicates ‘extreme fear’ — in its lowest level since mid-2023. The index measures investor emotions and ranges from 0 (lowest sentiment) to 100 (highest sentiment), helping identify whether investors are too scared (potential buying opportunity) or too greedy (possible market correction). It is based on price volatility, momentum, social media sentiment, Google trends data, and bitcoin’s overall market share. It tends to act as a contrarian indicator in the short term. Major tokens have fully pared all gains made after President Donald Trump announced a strategic crypto reserve in the U.S. earlier this month, sending tokens XRP, Solana’s SOL, and ADA higher by as much as 60% in days following. Traders expected windfall plans of buying pressure from the U.S. for majors, but hopes were doused as Trump repurposed previously seized BTC holdings as a reserve and said non-BTC seized assets would be considered a ‘stockpile’ of tokens. Then, an anticipated White House Crypto Summit on Mar.7 ended in a “nothingburger” without the expected bold announcements. The summit resulted in a framework for stablecoin legislation by August and a promise of lighter regulation, but these outcomes did not stimulate the market as anticipated. Losses were magnified as global markets took a hit amid an ongoing tariff war sparked by Trump and other world leaders. A widely tracked dollar index (DYX) , a measure of the U.S. dollar's strength, is at its lowest since November, to under 105 (a DXY index above 100 is considered strong, which tends to put pressure on risk assets). Traders are now in a wait-and-watch mode as they approach the coming months, mainly eying macroeconomic data and decisions for cues on further positioning. “The summit signaled for more optimism,” Kevin Guo, Director of HashKey Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Despite expectations for more substantial announcements as crypto assets continue to follow US equities in a negative trend in the wake of February's job report that saw generally stable results despite government job cuts. “Investors don't expect a reverse of the trend as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell assured that the Fed will continue to show patience on a bumpy road to a 2% inflation rate, which further lowered expectations of a rate cut this year,” Guo added. Traders have been buying short-dated treasuries, per Bloomberg , expecting the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates as soon as May to keep the economy from deteriorating — a sign of hope for crypto bulls and lower rates tend to create inflow into riskier assets.",Markets|Fear & Greed Index|Bitcoin|Dogecoin|XRP|ADA,EN,0,0,MARKET|ADA|DOGE|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-10 08:04:17

However, on-chain activity suggests that the positive momentum for DOGE could resume soon amid a 270% surge in active addresses over the last 24 hours. Also, the DOGE whale activity has surged, indicating big players are buying the dips, thereby hinting a potential rebound moving ahead. Dogecoin Price Rebound Ahead? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical support level for DOGE as it approaches the lower boundary of its current price channel. According to Martinez, maintaining a position above $0.16 is essential for the cryptocurrency to sustain momentum and potentially fuel a strong rebound. Source: Ali Martinez As of press time, the Dogecoin price is trading 9.29% down at $0.1726 with its daily trading volume surging 115% to more than $2.01 billion. Also, the open interest has tanked 12.91% to $1.45 billion while the 24-hour liquidations have shot to $21 million, per the Coinglass data . Previously, analyst Ali Martinez stated that if bulls manage to hold above the DOGE support levels of $0.16, it can trigger a rally toward $2.74 or even as high as $6.24. DOGE Active Addresses and Whale Activity Despite the Dogecoin price heading lower amid broader crypto market correction , market analysts are bullish amid strong on-chain developments. In a significant development for DOGE, the number of active addresses on the network has skyrocketed by 270% in just 24 hours, increasing from 71,750 to 264,000. Source: Ali Charts On the other hand, the largest whales on the Dogecoin network have reportedly accumulated 1.7 billion DOGE over the past 72 hours. This massive accumulation suggests that major players could be positioned for the next big move, underscoring growing activity and interest in the meme coin. Additionally, the Dogecoin wallet addresses have reached an all-time high, hinting further momentum ahead. Key Demand Zones for DOGE Pseudonymous analyst “TheGift94” has outlined potential demand zones where DOGE might stabilize amidst intense selling pressure. In a recent TradingView analysis, the analyst identified three “buying demand zones” critical to the meme coin’s price movement. The first support zone, at $0.20, was breached as Dogecoin’s price fell by 13% yesterday, closing at $0.1678. The analyst further highlighted two additional zones that could act as support levels: $0.16 and $0.13. These levels are now being closely monitored as potential turning points for the meme coin.

Like most top altcoins, the Cardano coin exploded, maintaining a 40% gain on the weekly chart. The Ethereum price also retested $2,500, although it now trades downward. However, IntelMarkets (INTL) stole the spotlight after hitting the $11 million fundraising milestone in record time, joining its 900% upswing in the past few months. Scheduled to go live this quarter, experts believe it might be a more compelling alternative than top crypto coins like ETH and ADA. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Big Thing in the DeFAI Sector IntelMarkets (INTL) stands out for its significant upside potential as a low-cap AI gem. Its bullish narrative—a blend of artificial intelligence and DeFi—further drives demand, contributing to the growing interest. Boasting higher growth prospects than the Cardano coin and more budget-friendly than the Ethereum price, INTL basks in the spotlight. By combining AI technology, blockchain and DeFi, IntelMarkets will stand out as an AI-powered trading platform. Unlike conventional exchanges, it will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels, offering unmatched computing power. Its dual-chain compatibility and quantum-proof custody solution are other distinguishing features. In the tenth stage of the ICO, it is heavily discounted at $0.091, presenting an opportunity to invest early in what has been dubbed the future of trading. In addition to its 900% rally from the initial price of $0.009, a 75x rally is projected after Tier-1 exchange listings. Hailed as 2025’s best ICO, it is among the best altcoins to invest in this year. Cardano (ADA): 40% Weekly Gain The Cardano coin is up over 40% on the weekly chart, retailing around $0.94. Primed for another breakout above $1 after hitting $1.1 earlier this week, it is one of the altcoins to watch. Moreover, key technical indicators like the 10-EMA and 20-VWMA hint at further upswings in the Cardano coin price. At the same time, its inclusion in the US crypto reserve sparks bold price predictions. Cryptotarget11, a crypto analyst on X, identifies $1.10 and $1.20 as the next resistance zones for the Cardano coin and a potential breakout above $1.50. CW8900, a leading expert on X (formerly Twitter), predicts sustained bullish momentum, stating there is no “significant sell wall until $1.95.” Despite the upside potential of the Cardano coin, it pales compared to IntelMarkets, a new AI coin. This new AI coin is dubbed the best new crypto to invest in due to its bullish narrative and small market size. Ethereum (ETH): Technical Indicators Hint at a Bounce The Ethereum price fell from $2,500 and currently consolidates between $2,100 and $2,200. It is down over 20% in the past month, which, on the bright side, puts it in an attractive buy zone. Moreover, as a part of the US crypto reserve, it is primed to skyrocket. Also, its long-term outlook is promising, as evident in the bold Ethereum price predictions being thrown out. Web3Samantha, a crypto analyst, targets a bounce between $2,100 and $2,600 before breaking out above $4,000. A more bullish Ethereum price prediction was made by CryptoBoj—a rally past $10,000 this bull run. Further, technical indicators like the 9-HMA and the neutral 14-day RSI suggest a bounce in the Ethereum price. Despite this, savvy investors are betting more on the INTL token. Tipped to soar as high as 75x this year, it is among the best altcoins to invest in. IntelMarkets (INTL): In the Spotlight Alongside Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) Early funding in the ongoing IntelMarkets presale crossed $11.3 million in record time, putting it in the spotlight. Given its bullish AI narrative and upside potential, it is a better bet than the Cardano coin. Moreover, at $0.091, it is significantly undervalued compared to the current Ethereum price, adding to its retail appeal.

The Key Opinion Leader (KOL) Label monitors the holdings of influencers with over 100,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), revealing whether they truly believe in the projects they promote or are simply taking part in paid endorsements. This update comes at a time when meme coins are rapidly gaining traction, often with little utility or long-term stability. The introduction of this tracking feature has sparked heated discussions among crypto investors and traders. Supporters see it as a move toward greater transparency , making it easier to distinguish between genuine investment recommendations and potential pump-and-dump schemes. Critics, however, argue that the tool could be misleading, as many influencers use multiple wallets to avoid detection. Reports suggest that nearly three out of four influencer-backed tokens fail , with their value dropping drastically within a few months. Research also indicates that influencers with larger followings tend to promote tokens with the worst performance. This raises concerns about the ethical responsibility of high-profile figures in the crypto space, as many influencers allegedly receive large payments for promotional posts while secretly selling off their holdings. Recent investigations have exposed several influencers involved in coordinated price manipulation schemes, further eroding trust in the market. By using Arkham’s tracking tool, investors can verify whether influencers actually hold onto the tokens they promote. If an influencer quickly dumps a token after pushing it, that could be a red flag signaling potential deception. Crypto leaders, including Tron founder Justin Sun, emphasize the importance of conducting thorough research instead of blindly following influencer endorsements. Many experts suggest evaluating real social engagement , checking project fundamentals, and reviewing a token’s underlying structure before making investment decisions.

The Broccoli-themed tokens gained popularity after CZ shared a story about his dog, but the rapid launch of multiple versions has left investors confused and caused prices to plummet. Many believe that consolidating these fragmented projects would increase the chances of securing a Binance listing and reviving investor interest. The proposal to unite Broccoli meme coins has sparked intense debate. A popular trader argued that the odds of any single Broccoli token achieving major gains are slim, but if combined, they could see significant growth. The problem, as pointed out by community members, is that investors don’t know which version of Broccoli will receive enough liquidity to sustain momentum. This uncertainty has led to price crashes and skepticism about the future of the tokens. Earlier this year, Binance Alpha introduced three Broccoli-themed projects, raising speculation about an eventual exchange listing. However, all three have struggled, with prices dropping sharply after their initial hype. Investors now question whether a merger could be a lifeline for the meme coins, providing a stronger foundation for future growth. CZ’s stance on the matter has further fueled speculation. While he has not officially endorsed any particular project, his acknowledgment of the idea suggests that a single, unified Broccoli token might stand a better chance of long-term success. This aligns with Binance’s approach to community-driven projects, where listing decisions are often influenced by user demand and engagement. Despite CZ’s comments, the execution of such a merger remains uncertain. The biggest challenge lies in uniting different Broccoli communities under one token. Each version of Broccoli has its own backers, making it difficult to determine a fair way to consolidate them without alienating some investors. Additionally, the current meme coin market is volatile , and even a well-planned merger does not guarantee price stability. Some traders see this as an opportunity to clean up the Broccoli ecosystem and increase its legitimacy. If the merger gains traction, it could lead to a larger, more organized community with greater influence over exchange listings. However, without a clear strategy, the plan could backfire, leading to further price instability. Another factor that could influence the future of Broccoli tokens is Binance’s evolving stance on meme coins. Recently, Binance introduced a new voting feature that allows communities to decide which tokens get listed. This mechanism could play a key role in determining whether a unified Broccoli coin has a real chance of securing a spot on the exchange. While the concept of merging meme coins is not new, its success largely depends on community participation and investor confidence. If the plan moves forward, it could reshape the way meme coins evolve, offering a model for other fragmented projects. However, the risk of failure remains high , and investors should remain cautious about the potential impact of consolidation on token value. For now, the future of Broccoli meme coins remains uncertain. With CZ’s support, the discussion around a merger is gaining momentum, but it is unclear whether developers and investors will agree on a unified approach. The coming weeks could determine whether Broccoli becomes a stronger force in the meme coin space or fades into obscurity.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|MARKET|BNB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-10 08:10:39

Looking for a retest, the price is up today following a steady increase in the past days. After witnessing a notable breakdown in February, CRO managed to stay above $0.068 and established support in the late month. This led to an early month bounce, and the price increased briefly to $0.1035. A sharp rejection from that level rolled the price back to the bottom, but luckily, the previous support level held well on Tuesday, and the price increased steadily to where it’s changing hands at $0.092. These price actions have created a double-bottom pattern on the 4-hour chart. But the bullish pattern looks more like a trap as the overall crypto market still follows strong negative sentiments weekly. The price will likely face some threat anytime soon. It currently trades near the recent monthly high. Reclaiming this high could bring a sigh of relief, bringing a suspension in the bearish trend. Failure to scale through it could lead to another impulsive bearish move. That said, CRO is still considered bearish on the daily chart. Having seen a temporal halt in selling, it has lost over 20% in the past month. More losses can be expected as soon as it resumes drops. CRO’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Right now, CRO’s bulls are charging back at $0.1035. If they reclaim it, the next target resistance level to keep in mind is $0.123. Above it lies the $0.1495 level. While there’s still room for a drop, the price must dip below $0.078 and the $0.682 support before considering an extension. The key level for support on the way down is $0.06. Key Resistance Levels: $0.1035, $0.123, $0.1495 Key Support Levels: $0.078, $0.0682, $0.06 Spot Price: $0.092 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Global banks and fintechs are launching their own stablecoins, capitalizing on the increasing adoption and favorable regulatory environment. Joining an established list of payment providers like Standard Chartered, PayPal, and Revolut, Bank of America (BoE) is considering launching its stablecoin. This growing trend among financial institutions aims to disrupt the dominance of major players like Tether and Circle. Banks and Fintechs Capitalize on Stablecoin Growth According to Financial Times , top banks and fintechs are racing to introduce their own stablecoins to secure a foothold in the rapidly evolving cross-border payments space. The favorable regulatory environment and growing adoption of stablecoins add momentum to the development. Notably, the regulatory recognition that stablecoins can play a legitimate role in the financial system has boosted enthusiasm. This, in turn, has influenced financial institutions to leverage the capabilities of these assets. This regulatory shift, following President Donald Trump’s election victory in 2024, has been driven by his pro-crypto stance. Likening this increasing demand for stablecoins to the gold rush, where people made more money selling shovels to miners than actually mining for gold, Simon Taylor, co-founder of fintech consultancy 11: FS, stated, It’s about people selling shovels in the stablecoin gold rush. The other thing that’s driven it is there’s real volume. Founders want to get a piece of it because they know they’re going to get stablecoin regulation and so it’s all of those things coming together. Stablecoin Frenzy: Big Players Enter the Fray Large players like Bank of America, PayPal, Standard Chartered, Stripe, and Revolut have expressed their interests in adopting stablecoins. Stripe co-founder John Collison stated, “Stablecoins and the more modern chains are really interesting for the payments use case, and that makes up our business.” Recently, Bank of America announced its potential plans to launch its own stable asset upon receiving regulatory approval. CEO Brian Moynihan stated, ““If they make that legal, we will go into that business.” Last month, Standard Chartered revealed its plans to develop a Hong Kong dollar-backed token, adhering to the new stablecoin regulatory policies in the territory. Similarly, PayPal intends to expand its stablecoin payment option, PYUSD, in 2025, anticipating significant adoption among US businesses making international supplier payments. According to Visa data, stablecoin transactions on PayPal totaled $163 million this month, a fraction of Tether’s $131 billion. US Department of Housing and Urban Development Experiments with Stablecoins In a recent development, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development is planning to integrate blockchain technology and adopt stablecoins. According to a ProPublica report, the department is considering blockchain-based solutions for grant tracking and stablecoin payments, with pilot testing proposed for one of its offices. Notably, the team believes that the current experiment signals the adoption of crypto and blockchain across the federal government. US Regulatory Landscape Boosts Crypto Adoption President Donald Trump’s crypto-focused policies have generated significant optimism. This marks a substantial shift in the US government’s stance on digital assets. Trump’s administration is introducing new policies aimed at establishing stablecoins. Recently, Trump announced plans to adopt Bitcoin, XRP, SOL, and ADA as US crypto reserve assets, signaling a commitment to integrating digital assets into the country’s financial ecosystem. This move was followed by an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . These developments underscore the government’s progressive stance on cryptocurrencies. It focuses on fostering innovation, investment, and integration into the traditional financial system. The Trump administration’s policies aim to position the United States as a leader in the global digital asset economy.

Canadian crypto mining company HIVE Digital has released its February production results, revealing that its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings increased by more than 20% year-over-year. In a March 9 press release , the Vancouver-headquartered company said it had mined 89 BTC, increasing its HODL portfolio to 2,620 BTC, valued at around $220 million. While the company’s Bitcoin holdings increased by 23% YoY, its month-over-month crypto holdings saw a decline, though HIVE Digital didn’t disclose the amount of Bitcoin sold during the month. “ on a month-over-month basis, BTC holdings saw a decline as HIVE strategically sold a portion of its BTC to invest in capital assets, including Bitfarms’ 200 megawatt hydro-powered Bitcoin mining assets in Paraguay.” HIVE Digital You might also like: Crypto miner HIVE Digital’s shares soar amid 263% surge in Bitcoin reserves Following the news, HIVE Digital shares jumped 4.76% to $2 after hours, per data from Nasdaq.

The average price target represents an increase of nearly 200%, per the firm. HIVE Digital chief executive Aydin Kilic says the company is focused on executing a “transformative year” that would position the company as “one of the largest and most efficient Bitcoin miners in the world,” adding that HIVE’s 300 MW expansion in Paraguay to 4x its hashrate from 6 EH/s to 25 EH/s by September 2025 “remains on track.” HIVE says it expects to finalize the strategic acquisition of the Bitfarms’ 200 MW Yguazú site in Q1 2025.

Meanwhile, crypto scammers are exploiting trade war fears in Canada by using fake news articles featuring government figures to promote fraudulent investment schemes. Additionally, a long-dormant Bitcoin wallet that is linked to the Nucleus darknet marketplace recently moved $77.5 million in BTC, fueling speculation about the motives behind the sudden reactivation of old wallets. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Faces Setback Ethereum's latest Pectra upgrade encountered some unexpected issues during its rollout on the Sepolia testnet, one of which led to errors and an exploit that resulted in the mining of empty blocks. The upgrade was deployed on March 5, but Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden reported on March 8 that the team quickly started seeing error messages on their geth node. The problem stemmed from the deposit contract, which triggered a transfer event instead of a deposit event, leading to incorrect processing. A fix was quickly issued, but a missed edge case allowed an unknown attacker to exploit the system. By sending a zero-token transfer to the deposit address, the attacker managed to trigger the same error again. As a result, empty blocks continued to be mined, which prompted the developers to investigate further. Initially, they suspected a mistake from one of the trusted validators but soon realized the transaction originated from a new account funded through a faucet. Van der Wijden explained that the ERC-20 standard does not prohibit zero-token transfers. This means that anyone—even without holding any tokens—could interact with the deposit contract. This loophole was identified and used by the attacker to disrupt block production. To mitigate the issue, the team privately deployed a fix to select DevOps nodes, filtering out all transactions interacting with the deposit contract. The developers suspected that the attacker was monitoring their communications, so they did not publicise the fix and instead silently updated a few controlled nodes to restore normal block production. By 2 pm, all nodes received the fix, and the problematic transaction was successfully mined. Van der Wijden shared that despite the disruption, the incident never resulted in the loss of finalization, and the issue was limited to Sepolia because it used a token-gated deposit contract rather than the standard mainnet deposit contract. This was not the first time the Pectra upgrade encountered difficulties. Its previous testnet deployment on Holesky on Feb. 26 also faced issues. Due to these latest challenges, Ethereum developers decided to postpone the Pectra upgrade to allow for more testing. The Pectra fork follows Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, which was successfully deployed on March 13 of 2024. Dencun introduced improvements that reduced transaction fees for layer-2 networks and enhanced Ethereum rollup efficiency. Scammers Exploit Trade War Fears Attackers are not only targeting Ethereum and its Pectra upgrade. Crypto scammers are also exploiting trade war fears by using fake news articles and the likeness of government figures to deceive investors, according to securities regulators in Alberta and New Brunswick. The Alberta Securities Commission issued an alert on March 7, warning that a fraudulent crypto investment scheme called CanCap falsely claimed an endorsement from former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The scam used a fake news article that was designed to appear as if it came from Canada’s national broadcaster, CBC, which stated that Trudeau supported the scheme as a response to US tariffs. The Financial and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick issued a similar warning on March 5, and stated that CanCap also used a fraudulent news article claiming that New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt endorsed the platform. The fabricated article mimicked the design of a Telegraph-Journal web article, and alleged that Holt backed the investment program due to US tariff hikes. It even included a fake interview transcript and manipulated photos to make the endorsement look more authentic. The warnings were made during a time of economic uncertainty in Canada after US President Donald Trump’s recent trade policies. His 25% tariffs on Canadian goods took effect earlier this month, only to be partially rolled back before he quickly threatened new 250% tariffs on lumber and dairy. Mark Carney, who replaced Trudeau as prime minister on March 9, strongly criticized Trump’s actions by calling them an attack on Canadian families . Carney also warned that Canada will win any trade war. New Brunswick’s financial regulators said that the uncertainty caused by the tariffs is increasing anxiety among residents, making them a lot more vulnerable to financial scams. The commission’s communications director, Marissa Sollows, pointed out that scammers are preying on people who are in a heightened state of financial concern. Scammers have been very quick to adapt, changing the name and appearance of their platforms to evade detection. CanCap already appeared under different names, including CanCentra and Immediate Flectinium, and has been linked to at least six other websites. ( Source: CertiK ) The scale of crypto-related fraud is huge, with global losses from scams, exploits, and hacks totaling close to $1.53 billion in February alone. This large number was mostly driven by the $1.4 billion hack on crypto exchange Bybit, according to CertiK . Even excluding the Bybit incident, losses exceeded $126 million in February, which was a 28.5% increase from the $98 million reported in January. Wallet Linked to Darknet Marketplace Moves Millions To make things even more risky for crypto investors, a Bitcoin wallet linked to the now-defunct darknet marketplace Nucleus reawakened after nine years by moving $77.5 million in BTC to three new addresses while leaving $365 million in the primary wallet, according to Arkham Intelligence . The wallet has been dormant since April of 2016, when Nucleus shut down and left behind 5,000 BTC in vendor and customer deposits. At the time, the stash was worth just $2.1 million. Nucleus was one of many darknet marketplaces that facilitated the sale of illicit goods, including drugs and weapons. While the official reason for its shutdown was a hack, there was speculation that the administrators either ran an exit scam or were arrested. Like other marketplaces of its time, transactions on Nucleus were primarily conducted in Bitcoin because of its relative anonymity. The sudden movement of funds from the dormant wallet came just a day after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the country. The reserve will initially be funded through seized crypto assets. Bitcoin’s surge in price led to a wave of dormant wallets becoming active again. Since early 2023, Bitcoin has climbed from below $17,000 to an all-time high of approximately $109,000. This prompted long-inactive wallets from the 2010s to move funds. In July of 2023, an 11-year-old wallet containing 1,037 BTC became active, while in May of 2024, three Satoshi-era wallets transferred large sums, including one that moved 687 BTC and two others moving a combined 1,000 BTC. June 2024 saw a whale transfer 8,000 BTC from a five-year-old dormant wallet, and in September 2024, five miner wallets from the Satoshi era reawakened after 15 years. Speculation continues to grow over why these wallets are becoming active. Some experts attribute it to rising Bitcoin prices. Meanwhile, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino suggested that advancements in quantum computing could soon pose a threat to early Bitcoin wallets.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-10 09:13:58

In a new press release, the regulatory agency says that banks now have the green light to manage crypto assets, partake in certain stablecoin activities and participate in node verification networks. Furthermore, the OCC is shedding a requirement that forced institutions under its jurisdiction to meet certain requirements before being able to engage in crypto-related activities. Says Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood, “The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones. Today’s action will reduce the burden on banks to engage in crypto-related activities and ensure that these bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology. I will continue to work diligently to ensure regulations are effective and not excessive, while maintaining a strong federal banking system.” Under the Biden Administration, the OCC sent a letter that has since been rescinded, telling US banks they must first clear crypto-related activities with the regulator before being able to legally partake in them. “This letter clarifies that the activities addressed in [previous] interpretive letters are legally permissible for a bank to engage in, provided the bank can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of its supervisory office, that it has controls in place to conduct the activity in a safe and sound manner… The bank should not engage in the activities until it receives written notification of the supervisory office’s non-objection.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to the analyst, both XRP and Cardano (ADA) have the potential to surge to $10, driven by anticipated tax policy changes under Donald Trump’s administration. The Impact of Tax Policies on Cryptocurrency Growth The possibility of removing capital gains taxes on digital assets has been widely debated. Many investors believe such a change could significantly increase participation in the crypto market. Eliminating tax burdens on crypto profits may encourage institutional and retail investors to hold onto their assets, driving demand and boosting prices. According to recent discussions, Eric Trump—Donald Trump’s son—has reportedly suggested that U.S.-based cryptocurrencies like XRP might qualify for capital gains tax exemptions. In contrast, foreign crypto projects could be subject to a tax rate of approximately 30%. This policy shift, if implemented, would align with the Trump administration’s broader efforts to prioritize American cryptocurrency projects. XRP and ADA as Beneficiaries of a Favorable Tax Environment The Modern Investor predicts that XRP and ADA will be the biggest beneficiaries of potential regulatory changes, specifically, repealing capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies. According to the analyst, repealing this tax burden could lead to a substantial surge in value for these digital assets, potentially reaching $10 in a short period. Although this forecast is speculative, it reflects the growing enthusiasm among investors about the positive impact of more favorable tax policies on the cryptocurrency market. Beyond individual price predictions, the prospect of tax-free cryptocurrency transactions could lead to increased market activity, as traders and long-term holders alike may feel less pressure to sell prematurely due to tax concerns. This could contribute to a more stable and liquid market. Trump Administration’s Interest in U.S.-Based Cryptocurrencies Reports indicate that Donald Trump has openly supported strengthening the U.S. cryptocurrency sector. As part of this initiative, U.S.-based digital assets such as XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano are expected to play a key role in a proposed national cryptocurrency reserve , often called the “ crypto stockpile .” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If these policies are enacted, the competitive landscape for digital assets could shift significantly, potentially favoring projects headquartered or heavily involved in the U.S. financial ecosystem. While details remain uncertain, the possibility of tax exemptions for certain crypto assets continues to generate discussions within the industry. Speculation vs. Reality: What Investors Should Consider While the notion of a tax-free environment for U.S. crypto investors is appealing, it is important to approach these claims prudently. The Modern Investor’s predictions are based on speculation, and no official policy has been confirmed. Additionally, any changes to tax regulations would likely require legislative approval, making the implementation’s timeline unclear. Nonetheless, discussions surrounding cryptocurrency tax policies will remain a key factor influencing market sentiment. If the U.S. government moves toward tax exemptions for domestic crypto assets, it could create a more favorable investment climate and potentially drive substantial price movements in the market.

The order, which introduced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, initially sent Bitcoin tumbling by 5% before partially recovering. With a high trading volume of $39.1 billion, market participants remain uncertain about whether the U.S. government will actively acquire Bitcoin. Trade War Tensions & Bitcoin Update Canada, China & Mexico strike back with tariffs, fueling market uncertainty! Meanwhile, #Bitcoin faces major swings—$70K support & $75K resistance are key levels to watch — Bitunix Analyst Stay sharp, trade smart & manage your risk! pic.twitter.com/F80ltdXdQx — Bitunix (@BitunixOfficial) March 5, 2025 The uncertainty surrounding this policy shift has fueled volatility, leaving investors questioning the long-term impact on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Was this dip a buying opportunity, or does further downside loom? BTC struggled above $82,000 amid selling pressure and trade tensions. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve order caused a 5% drop before recovery. Bitcoin is down 4.13%, trading at $82,331.29 with high volume. Trade Tensions Keep Pressure on Bitcoin Beyond the immediate impact of Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Order, global trade tensions have continued to weigh on market sentiment. Recent shifts in U.S. tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports have fueled uncertainty, prompting risk-averse behavior among investors. The temporary waiver of 25% tariffs on select goods under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has contributed to volatile price swings across financial markets, including crypto. Trade policy shifts are adding market volatility and uncertainty. Risk-sensitive assets, including Bitcoin, face increased selling pressure. Investors are moving cautiously amid unclear U.S. economic policies. Given Bitcoin’s status as a hedge against traditional financial instability, some traders see these economic uncertainties as a potential long-term bullish catalyst. However, short-term price action suggests that bearish sentiment is still in control. Inflation Data and Fed Policy: The Next Market Movers The next big test for Bitcoin comes in the form of upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy. On March 12, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be released, followed by the Producer Price Index (PPI) on March 13. The digital currency market is on the verge of an important change. Publishing Consumer Price Index (CPI) and US Producer Price Index (PPI) in the coming days can determine the path of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the next few months. pic.twitter.com/wK1Euq0dXx — Reza Trader (@RezaTraderFarsi) March 9, 2025 Market forecasts indicate: CPI to rise 0.3% in February, with an annual inflation rate of 2.9%. PPI data could further influence market expectations for Fed rate cuts. Traders anticipate up to 70 basis points of rate cuts by December. The March 18-19 Federal Reserve meeting will be crucial in shaping Bitcoin’s direction. If inflation data exceeds expectations, the Fed may delay rate cuts or even consider further tightening, adding pressure on BTC and risk assets. Conversely, if inflation slows, Bitcoin could regain momentum on renewed liquidity optimism. Bitcoin’s Technical Outlook: Will Bears Push BTC to $80K? From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin remains under selling pressure as it struggles to reclaim the $82,725 resistance level. The 50-period EMA suggests bearish momentum, with further declines possible if BTC fails to break back above $83,990. Key resistance: $82,725 and $83,990. Major support: $80,070, with downside potential to $78,196 and $76,198. A break below $80,070 could trigger further selling pressure. Traders should watch for volume confirmation and market sentiment shifts before positioning for either a continuation of the downtrend or a potential reversal. With economic uncertainty and Fed policy weighing on risk assets, BTC’s next move could be pivotal for the broader crypto market.

According to data from Arkham Intelligence, WLFI’s investment of $336 million across nine cryptocurrencies is now worth approximately $226 million. Of the portfolio’s losses, Ethereum ( ETH ) is responsible for 65%. Ethereum is trading at around $2,000 as at Mar. 10, meaning that WLFI, which bought it at an average price of $3,240, is down an estimated $80.85 million, or almost 37% of its total investment. Tron ( TRX ) has proven to be the most resilient of WLFI’s holdings, down just 5%. The portfolio’s other holdings, which have all contributed to the WLFI’s losses, include tokens such as stETH ($10.27M), WHITE ($5.87M), Movement ( MOVE ) ($3.5M), and Ondo ( ONDO ) ($296,000). Despite these losses, WLFI continues to boost its portfolio and expand its network. On Mar. 6, WLFI acquired $21.5 million worth of Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) and Movement Network tokens. In addition, the company recently partnered with Sui ( SUI ), a blockchain founded by former Meta programmers, to explore decentralized finance opportunities.

Founded in 2024, WLFI has managed to position itself as a major player in DeFi. Trump, along with his close family and allies, controls more than 60% of the project. Despite recent losses, WLFI attracted strong investor interest, raising $300 million during its January 2025 token sale. Meanwhile, as Trump’s government works to establish a strategic crypto reserve for the United States, critics argue that his growing influence in the cryptocurrency markets may lead to conflicts of interest. The Trump Organization has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that his children, an outside ethics lawyer, and an independent investment firm run WLFI and that Trump has no direct control over its activities.

Key US economic data , including job openings, inflation reports, and consumer confidence, will shape BTC’s next move. If inflation stays hot and jobless claims rise, risk assets like Bitcoin could take another hit. Moreover, the current sentiment leans negative, with recession fears creeping in as Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts bite deeper into government spending. With the Fed meeting just around the corner, all eyes are on whether inflation surprises again—will Bitcoin take another hit? Here’s what could move the needle: This Week's Market Movers: Mar 10th-Feb 14th, 2025 A huge week for economic data, with JOLTS, CPI & PPI.

A strong report, showing job openings above 7.6 million, could fuel dollar strength and lower Bitcoin’s appeal. However, a weaker reading might raise concerns over economic slowdown, increasing expectations for Fed rate cuts and boosting BTC’s safe-haven narrative. CPI report on Wednesday – Core Inflation number going to come in cool – potentially lower than most expect. BTC will pump Week after that – FOMC – Fed flips dovish and announces interest rates cuts. BTC will pump. Position accordingly while in peak fear. — sickone (@sickonesol) March 10, 2025 Inflation Data Holds the Key The Consumer Price Index (CPI), dropping on March 12, is a major trigger for risk assets. If inflation stays hot at 2.9% or above, rate cuts could be delayed, strengthening the dollar and pressuring Bitcoin. A softer CPI, on the other hand, might revive bullish sentiment by signaling potential monetary easing. Traders are already speculating that a lower-than-expected core inflation number could spark a BTC rally. Jobless Claims and Producer Prices Add More Volatility On March 13, Initial Jobless Claims and the Producer Price Index (PPI) will provide further economic insights. Fewer-than-expected jobless claims could reinforce dollar dominance, drawing investors toward traditional markets and away from Bitcoin. A lower PPI reading, however, may ease inflation concerns and improve BTC’s outlook as an inflation hedge. Consumer Sentiment Could Sway Market Mood The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index survey , due on March 15, will gauge economic confidence. A strong number might shift focus to equities, reducing Bitcoin’s attractiveness. But if sentiment drops below expectations, BTC could gain as investors seek a hedge against economic uncertainty. With a heavy lineup of macroeconomic events, Bitcoin traders are bracing for potential swings.

President Nayib Bukele recently clarified that their BTC accumulation strategy is not stopping. In a statement last week, he clarified his 7.3 million followers on X that El Salvador won’t stop its BTC accumulating strategy. “If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future,” he wrote. “This all stops in April.” “This all stops in June.” “This all stops in December.” No, it’s not stopping.

The IMF has cited volatility risks, fiscal vulnerabilities, and potential implications for financial stability as primary concerns in its ongoing discussions with the Central American nation. Following the loan, the nation’s Legislative Assembly approved a bill to revise Bitcoin adoption strategy, complying to the IMF’s requirements. Per Reuters, the bill was approved by Congress with 55 votes in favor and two votes against. Despite the pressure, El Salvador has maintained its course, continuing to accumulate Bitcoins. Further, the government maintains that its dollar-based economy remains stable alongside the Bitcoin implementation.

Mutuum Finance stands as the main focus following this development since it currently operates within its second presale phase after collecting $2.7 million while showing positive signs with 4,900 holders. Investors show increased interest in the project because the current price sits at $0.015 during a time when the current project stage is already 85% complete. Cardano (ADA): A Path to $2 The crypto market has placed special attention on Cardano (ADA) since the U.S. chose it for the crypto stockpile. The cryptocurrency demonstrates positive market potential for a rally to $2 based on both recent technical analysis patterns and broader market conditions. Since December ADA has followed a descending broadening wedge pattern which currently uses $1.14 as its main resistance point. Daily trading above $1.14 could ignite a major upward movement of ADA that would take it to $2. ADA continues to be popular with traders and investors even after its price dropped by 7%. Analysts expect ADA to become part of the U.S. crypto stockpile together with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) which supports market optimism. The U.S. SEC created more optimism in the market after it recognized Grayscale’s Spot Cardano ETF filing. Most analysts expect ADA to increase towards $1.30 and $1.40 before the end of the current quarter based on their forecast values. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) breakthrough project within decentralized finance (DeFi) features a distinctive lending operation and integrated buying force mechanism. MUTM brings practical financial capabilities to the network since users can both provide loans to others and borrow funds while earning passive income. The project achieved impressive results from its pre-sale phase by attracting $2.7 million in funding from 4,900 different holders. Between the second phase and next phase stages of presale MUTM will increase in price from $0.015 to $0.02 which provides a 33% profit opportunity for early buyers. Early investors will achieve a 400% return when MUTM launches at a value of $0.06. The market analysts project a price of $1.50 for MUTM tokens by 2025 creating an astounding 9,900% ROI potential. The innovative features of Mutuum Finance include mtTokens as well as its buy-and-distribute mechanism which makes the platform more attractive to users. Through mtTokens users can earn passive income from their deposited funds that grow in value over time. The platform automatically purchases MUTM tokens using its earnings before it disperses them to stakers to maintain constant market demands and long-term price stability. Why Investors Are Flocking to Mutuum Finance Eighty-five percent of the Mutuum Finance presale tokens have reached their selling target during the second phase while attracting investors. Market demand has grown sharply due to the combination of practical application of the project and robust economic dynamics along with promising investment potential. The chance to purchase tokens at their minimum price draws first investors prior to the following round commencement. Mutuum Finance provides lenders and borrowers an attractive partnership by implementing stable overcollateralized lending schemes that minimize risk exposure. Users can choose peer-to-peer (P2P) lending since the platform enables loan term negotiations between its members. The project provides $100,000 as a giveaway to early contributors while simultaneously building a devoted community through these incentives. Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) received significant attention due to the support from a successful Arab billionaire. The technical indicators for Cardano along with market trends indicate ADA holders might experience a price boost to $2 but Mutuum Finance stands out as an attractive investment because of its innovative structure and exciting presale performance. The ongoing presale phase of MUTM tokens has reached its second segment so investors need to acquire their tokens before prices advance ahead of the third phase.

What’s Happening?,https://timestabloid.com/5-billion-xrp-in-24-hours-whats-happening/,"Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency community, recently drew attention to a sharp rise in XRP transactions. She referenced a post from Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast, who highlighted that XRP transactions had skyrocketed, reaching $5 billion in just 24 hours. According to Melker, XRP wallet activity surged by over 600%, signaling significant movement in the market. “Big money is moving—something is brewing with XRP,” he stated. XRP TRANSACTIONS SKYROCKET AS ACTIVITY HITS $5 BILLION IN 24 HOURS $XRP transfers topped $5B in a single day, with wallet activity surging over 600%. Big money is moving—something is brewing with XRP. — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) March 9, 2025 This massive surge in transaction volume has raised speculation about potential market shifts, with analysts and traders closely monitoring the situation. While the reason for this spike remains unclear, recent blockchain activity suggests that whales are moving significantly and may be preparing for something big. Whale Activity and Market Implications Recent data shows that large-scale XRP transfers have increased, fueling speculation about potential institutional involvement or strategic accumulation. A report from Times Tabloid confirmed that 5.37 billion XRP moved within 24 hours, a figure that stands out even in a highly liquid market like XRP’s. The impact of this movement remains uncertain, but such large transfers often indicate either internal restructuring among institutions or preparation for major market events. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More Whale Activity in the Ecosystem Adding to the intrigue, another report recently revealed that XRP whale activity has been consistently rising . While some analysts believe this could precede a major price movement, others caution that it might be a sign of redistribution rather than new accumulation. Further developments include the transfer of 240 million XRP , raising additional questions about market intent. This massive token movement aligns with the broader trend of increased whale activity. With no clear explanation, many in the community are convinced that the whales are secretly accumulating and preparing for a big price jump. What’s Next for XRP’s Price? While many community members are excited about XRP’s short-term trajectory, some expressed skepticism because the asset’s price is currently down over 7%. Currently trading at $2.13, XRP has had a rough few weeks, with all attempts to break out being suppressed by bearish pressure from the broader market. However, this decline provides an appropriate buying opportunity, as the large investors can see the digital asset’s potential, and expect a big move in the short-term.

Market conditions remain volatile, and traders are closely watching price movements. With the BTC price struggling at $82k, investors are now eyeing altcoins to buy that could turn $50 into $5,000. The recent dip erased over $170 billion from the global crypto market . This sell-off comes ahead of key US economic data, influencing crypto sentiment. Despite the downturn, some altcoins present opportunities if the market rebounds. Let’s uncover these altcoins to watch, including XRP, Solana, and DOGE Altcoins to Buy: (Ripple) XRP XRP price has dropped 7% in the last 24 hours, currently hovering around $2.16. The decline follows the overall decrease in cryptocurrencies price. Amid this dip, XRP is among the altcoins to buy for potential future gains. Crypto Expert Ali noted that if the XRP price holds above the head-and-shoulders neckline and surpasses the right shoulder, a bullish breakout could occur. This move might push the Ripple price prediction toward $5, possibly reversing the recent downtrend. Source: Tweet Solana (SOL) Solana price has followed a downward trend, mirroring the broader crypto market decline. The latest SOL price is trading at $128, making an 8% decrease in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, the top altcoin has decreased by more than 20%, slipping below the crucial $150-$130 support levels. Crypto analyst Ali suggests that the Solana price could experience further movement depending on its ability to hold above the $125-$110 support zone. A break below this level may lead to additional losses, while stability could support potential recovery. Speculation surrounding a possible Solana ETF and rising interest in Solana-based meme tokens may also influence market sentiment. Despite the ongoing decline, Solana remains a key best altcoin to buy . If market conditions improve, SOL could regain momentum. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin price has been moving in a bearish trend recently. However, analysts are monitoring its price movements closely. Since October 2022, the asset has seen three major declines. The first two dips resulted in 64% retracements before surging by 300% and 500%. Currently, DOGE has retraced by 66%, raising speculation about a potential rebound. Analysts suggest this could push the Dogecoin price prediction toward $1. Some traders consider it among altcoins to buy that could turn $50 into $5,000 after the recent dip. As of writing, the DOGE price at $0.1715, with a 10% decrease over the past day. Final Thoughts Market volatility continues, but altcoins to buy after this dip could offer significant upside. Investors are closely monitoring price trends for potential gains.

41425231,https://invezz.com/?p=2607174,1741599449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Bitcoin vs. gold: the digital age’s store of value showdown,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/10/bitcoin-vs-gold-the-digital-ages-store-of-value-showdown/,"Most people have heard about Bitcoin these days, and even those who still don’t understand how it works might be aware that it’s widely considered to be a kind of “digital gold”. That’s because Bitcoin shares several characteristics with real gold, such as its scarcity, its perceived value and its usefulness as a hedge against economic turbulence. But how does Bitcoin really stack up to gold, and which one is the best investment over the long term? These are pressing questions for many investors and they’re still up for debate, so let’s take a look at some of the established facts and see if we can guess what the future holds for these two iconic stores of value. Scarcity One of the main reasons why Bitcoin has so many fans is its scarcity. It has a hard-coded limited supply that no one can change. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in total, and a lot of them have already been “lost”, which makes them inherently scarce. That’s similar to real gold, of course, which is a finite resource, albeit with an unknown amount still trapped under ground. But whereas gold mining continues to deliver a steady stream of new ingots onto the global market, Bitcoin’s halving mechanism means that fewer and fewer new coins will be minted, until such a time as the last one is mined. That said, the amount of new gold mined every year isn’t substantial enough to decrease its value, and historically the price of gold has increased slowly but surely for hundreds of years. Economic hedge For centuries, gold has been widely used across the world as a store of value, preserving wealth that can be handed down from generation to generation. Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a digital equivalent, with its deflationary nature making it an appealing investment for those who want to protect their wealth. Bitcoin’s advantages include that the price cannot be inflated easily, and nor can it be controlled or confiscated by banks or governments. Bitcoin’s price is much more volatile than that of gold, but in the 16 years it has been around, the value of this asset has risen sharply overall, consistently hitting new all-time highs at its peaks, even though its price can dip quite alarmingly during bearish conditions. Still, the fixed supply of Bitcoin provides protection compared to traditional fiat currencies, which lose purchasing power over time. In times of economic turmoil such as high inflation, many governments will print more money to counteract it, diluting the value of their currency. Bitcoin, and gold, are immune to this inflationary pressure. Decentralization Bitcoin fans often cite its decentralized nature as a major benefit, and in a way gold is similar. That’s because the gold trapped underground, waiting to be dug up, isn’t owned by anyone. Whoever finds it can claim it, and governments have very little control over gold prices either. Bitcoin lives on a decentralized blockchain that’s controlled by its users. It’s not possible for anyone, not even the US government, to censor or manipulate that blockchain in any way. This decentralization enhances Bitcoin’s security and transparency. It means anyone can acquire Bitcoin, and every transaction is made public, so anyone can verify it. These characteristics also help to make Bitcoin resilient to corruption. Physical vs digital Because Bitcoin is digital, it has a significant advantage over gold in being more portable and easier to store and secure. It lives inside user’s digital wallets installed on smartphones or PCs, and it can easily be transferred and accessed anywhere in the world with a few clicks. Someone could bring millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin with them when they fly to another country, without any difficulty or without anyone knowing, and they don’t even need to bring a smartphone if they can commit their private key to memory. Gold, on the other hand, is incredibly heavy, and when you have several million dollars worth of it, it’s not so easy to transport. You’ll need a fleet of trucks to bring it anywhere, and you’ll also want to consider security – that much gold will likely require armed guards, not to mention a secure hi-tech vault once you reach your destination. Gold’s advantage That’s not to say Bitcoin is superior, for physical gold does have some major advantages itself. For one thing, gold has stood the test of time, serving as a store of value for thousands of years. While Bitcoin is similar, it has only existed for 16 years, so we have no way of knowing if it will be able to retain its value over a similar timeframe. Moreover, gold has some unique properties that make it useful in the real world. It’s widely used in the electronics industry as a corrosion-resistant electrical connector in smartphones, computers, and other devices, and it also has uses in dentistry, aerospace, and some kinds of medical treatments, thanks to its non-reactive properties. It’s even used in glassmaking, helping to reflect solar radiation outwards in climate-controlled buildings. Bitcoin, without such physical properties, will never be useful in industry. Some investors might also consider Bitcoin’s usefulness in the event of societal collapse. If we’re ever unlucky enough to see the onset of nuclear winter and/or a total shutdown of the internet, you’ll surely wish you had bought real gold rather than crypto. Tokenized gold Notably, gold’s distinct advantages are not lost on the crypto industry, and many tokenized forms of gold live today on the blockchain. Some of the best-known gold-backed stablecoins include Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT), and there are many smaller ones such as GoldCoin (GLC), DigixGlobal (DGX), AABB Gold Token (AABBG) and Kinesis Gold (KAU). The price of each of these digital assets is pegged to a specific amount of physical gold, measured in grams or Troy ounces, and the creators maintain a physical supply of gold as collateral to ensure they don’t lose that peg. Such tokens have proven popular with the crypto crowd, and they’re among the most widely-traded stablecoin assets. As with Bitcoin, real gold and USD-backed stablecoins, they’re a stable store of value, used by traders to cash out of the risky positions they might hold in more volatile cryptocurrencies. The popularity of tokenized gold is evident on crypto exchanges such as VALR , which is offering users some big incentives to buy and sell XAUT in its “Great Re-Balancing Trading Competition”, with up to $5,000 in cash prizes weekly for those with the highest trade count. Digital gold is here to stay The transition towards digital economies makes it likely that Bitcoin will cement its status as a reliable store of value. Businesses and governments alike are now looking at Bitcoin as a strategic asset, with El Salvador having created the world’s first “strategic reserve” based on the cryptocurrency, and the U.S. government promising to do the same under President Trump. Bitcoin’s growing adoption leaves no doubt that it fully merits its status as “digital gold”, and while physical gold itself will always be a significant asset, it may one day find that it’s no longer considered to be the world’s de facto store of value.

Previously known as “All Roads Lead to Polygon”, the podcast has evolved substantially under the dynamic hosting style of Polygon’s leading DEX, QuickSwap . With its unfiltered approach and engaging format, QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” has cemented itself as an engaging platform that elevates and unifies discussions on decentralized tech. The show has delivered cutting-edge insights, engaging debates and the latest alpha in the crypto space. Hosted by QuickSwap, the show is a go-to AMA space for top CEOs, media moguls and key opinion leaders in the Web3 and blockchain world. QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” has earned the top-spot on X’s podcast ecosystem due to its in-depth analysis of global innovations with a refreshingly candid tone that has resonated with audiences worldwide. https://t.co/Olx8iQoRuE — QuickSwap 🐲 DragonFi 2.0 (@QuickswapDEX) February 14, 2025 Nurturing Candid Conversations, One Episode at a Time QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” thrives on its open, honest discussions that other creators often avoid due to the looming threat of possible audience backlash on X. Instead of shying away from controversial topics, the hosts— Roc Zacharias with co-host Aztec —help nurture opposing voices together through lively debates, providing a space for all opinions. The QuickSwap team has actively challenged established narratives and aimed to inspire listeners to look at crypto issues from nuanced perspectives. This open-minded, easy-going, fun, but vigilant approach to business tends to be the standard for most of the projects and podcasts associated with their marketing firm Lunar Digital Assets as noted in previous articles . Industry insiders have noted that the show’s raw, unpolished style sets it apart. QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” has an organic blend of chaotic energy and professional insight which is often reminiscent of an early rock ‘n’ roll merged with classic town hall-style sophistication in discussions. The 100th episode was hosted live on X Spaces on the QuickSwap page, and featured influential figures from across the crypto spectrum who shared insights on emerging trends and future challenges. The celebration not only honored the show’s journey but also showcased its significant impact on the crypto media landscape. Listeners reported that they enjoyed the mix of expert analysis and spirited banter, while guest speakers elevated the conversation by exploring potential pitfalls of the rapidly evolving blockchain industry. Moreover, the episode teased future topics that aim to challenge conventional wisdom and spark innovative discussions in Web3 circles and beyond.“We look to challenge industry norms. We also like to treat each speaker as a friend or potential friend regardless of their opinions. We do our best to make sure the show is like The Roman Bathhouse of Web3 where discussions flow freely.”- Roc Zacharias Bridging the Crypto Knowledge Gap Each episode from QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” breaks down intricate concepts, industry jargon and aims to provide practical advice that can empower both crypto novices and seasoned DeFi veterans. Critics, however, argue that while the podcast succeeds in delivering quality content, its informal style occasionally blurs the line between raw insight and polished expertise. Likewise, some listeners have reported that they would rather prefer a traditional interview style show format as opposed to unscripted segments. Nonetheless, the show’s authentic approach is also its key differentiator—a space where lively, deep discussions and raw opinions are respected.QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” plans to lead with authenticity and enthusiasm in an industry where change is inevitable and perspectives are often PR driven. As the podcast prepares for future episodes, the question remains: can the show's promises continue to keep its finger on the pulse of Web3 developments or would it ultimately lose its charm in the evolving digital ecosystem? Only time will tell. For the time being, interested listeners can tune-in every Friday at 3 p.m. UTC on X to uncover unfiltered crypto insights.

41425039,https://coingape.com/?p=243199,1741599485,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Binance Issues Key Update On These 6 Crypto, What’s Happening?",https://coingape.com/binance-issues-key-update-on-these-6-crypto-whats-happening/,"Cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance again captured noteworthy investor attention as it unveiled a key announcement on six cryptos this Monday. The crypto exchange revealed that the collateral ratio for CELO, IOTX, LRC, ALICE, AUDIO, & ICX tokens under the portfolio margin will be updated shortly ahead. As a response, market watchers speculate over the update’s impact on prices as the new offerings provide less market value. Binance Reduces Collateral Ratio For 6 Crypto Tokens In an official Binance announcement dated March 10, the crypto exchange revealed that it will reduce the collateral ratio for six tokens under the margin portfolio starting March 14 at 06:00 UTC. As per the announcement, this update will be completed in just an hour. Here Are The Updated Collateral Ratio For 6 Crypto: CELO The collateral ratio is to be reduced from 80% to 70%. IoTeX (IOTX) Binance revealed that IOTX collateral ratio is to be reduced from 80% to 70%. Loopring (LRC) Loopring collateral ratio is to be reduced from 80% to 65%, per the update. MyNeighborAlice (ALICE) ALICE’s collateral ratio is to be reduced from 80% to 65%. Audius (AUDIO) The collateral ratio is to be reduced from 70% to 55%. ICON (ICX) ICX collateral ratio is to be reduced from 70% to 55%. For context, a decline in this ratio signals reduced collateral value, thereby limiting the borrowing capacity of these tokens. As a result, these assets could see a decline in investor interaction and trading volumes due to reduced offerings on one of the top crypto exchanges . What’s More? Binance added that the collateral ratio will affect ‘Unified Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR)’ as well. Platform users should monitor the update closely to mitigate any losses potentially resulting from the abovementioned change. How Are These 6 Tokens Performing? CELO price plunged over 6% intraday and closed in at $0.3440. The coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $0.3295 and $0.3682, respectively. IOTX price dropped over 2% intraday and exchanged hands at $0.01540. The coin hit a low and a high of $0.01491 and $0.0159 over the past day. LRC price slipped nearly 1% as of press time and traded at $0.01053. The coin bottomed and peaked at $0.09879 and $0.1073 in the past 24 hours. ALICE price also followed the waning action in tandem with Binance’s announcement, falling 7% to $0.5194. MyNeighborAlice hit a low and high of $0.4999 and $0.5601 intraday. Nevertheless, AUDIO price was up by a remarkable 35% and rested at $0.1071. The coin bottomed at $0.07742 in the past 24 hours. Lastly, ICX price lost 6% value and closed in at $0.09933. Its intraday low and high were $0.0961 and $0.1066, respectively. It’s noteworthy that the broader slumping action also falls in line with the broader crypto market trend today . Besides, the leading exchange’s reduced offerings added to market concerns surrounding the aforementioned tokens’ future performances.

As we move into celebrating Women’s Day and Women’s Month, it is paramount to cherish dynamic women from the Web3 world, who are rewriting the rules of innovation, creativity and leadership. These journeys remind us that every breakthrough in the crypto industry starts with a single idea—an idea nurtured by passion and executed with precision. Let us take a closer look at the women who recently made a transformative impact on the Web3 industry: Bridging Gaming and Blockchain: Mattie Fairchild Mattie Fairchild is a name that resonates in both the gaming and blockchain communities. As the Head of Developer Relations at OP Labs- Polygon and formerly the Senior Director of Crypto Marketing and Developer Relations at Manticore Games, she doesn’t just manage teams—she nurtures communities. At Manticore, she helped integrate blockchain tech into gaming, empowering developers to build, share and monetize games though decentralized ecosystems. She has also led impactful NFT projects including Boys Club, a DAO championing women builders in Web3, proving her fierce commitment to inclusivity and innovation in the blockchain spehere. Before Manticore, Mattie was the co-founder of Wavedash Games and served as its CEO, pushing community-driven Web3 game development to new heights. Her stints at TinyCo and Storm8 influenced her knack for creating engaged online communities. Through bold strategies and the relentless energy of a commander, Mattie has turned challenges into opportunities, driving technical growth and fostering creative spaces where diverse ideas from the Web3 community can thrive. Redefining Art and Ownership: Victoria Fuller Victoria Fuller’s journey is a testament of substantially fusing art and technology. As the founder, lead artist and project director of Rogue Bunnies NFT collection, she has helped shatter the traditional barriers between art and blockchain. Minted on the FLOW blockchain—the same platform powering NBA Top Shot and UFC Strike—Rogue Bunnies delivers stunning digital art, while providing real-world perks to its community. Leveraging her unique background as a former Playboy Playmate and the first licensed artist by Playboy, Victoria has created a bold vision for the decentralized future where Metaverse and in person events converge. She bypasses old-school gatekeepers, empowering artists to reach a global audience and secure ownership of their work through blockchain. As CEO of Gatefold Labs, Victoria is pushing the limits of Web3 through her vibrant Discord channels to orchestrating dynamic NFT activations and in-person events—experiences that have captivated both crypto veterans, newcomers, and the mainstream media alike. In an era where digital assets rival physical ones, Victoria’s work stands as a prime example of democratizing art ownership through creativity and a real life- community focused experience. Empowering Musicians: Violetta Zironi’s Blockchain Beat In an industry where record labels have long held the reins, singer-songwriter Violetta Zironi is rewriting the rulebook. Since diving into blockchain in 2022, Violetta has emerged as a trailblazer and top musician within Web3, using NFTs to empower independent artists and transform fan engagement. Today, she’s celebrated as the #1 independent NFT singer-songwriter globally—raking in $2.5 million in revenue and selling over 10,000 music NFTs. One of her most jaw-dropping feats came when she inscribed a song onto the Bitcoin blockchain as an Ordinal, pairing it with original artwork by her father, the renowned Disney illustrator Giuseppe Zironi. The one of a kind innovation sold for 1 BTC (around $30,000 at the time), proving that music and art can live and thrive on the blockchain. Her project ""Moonshot"" also turned heads, with over 325 ETH worth total sales on OpenSea. Her bold move to step away from traditional music distribution and fully embrace Web3 showcases her entrepreneurial spirit, for a future where artists call the shots. Violetta stands as a beacon for independent artists eager to break free from industry constraints and traditional streaming platforms which often and notoriously pay musicians only a fraction of a penny per stream. Digital and Immersive Storytelling in Web3 World: Nyx (@Nyx3Media) Nyx, known on social media as @Nyx3Media, is another bold example of impactfully amalgamating art, code and storytelling. Not only is Nyx the Director of Strategy at Creative Labs for IBC Group- a Mario Nawfal company, but her project ""Crypto Coven"" is a vibrant, community-driven journey into identity and mysticism, where each NFT tells a unique story that invites collectors to dive in and engage. Nyx has repeatedly enhanced traditional art through blockchain to create interactive, moving story pieces. By embedding smart contracts into her work, she has guaranteed transparent ownership and sustainable royalties, making every piece collectible and testament to decentralized creativity in the Web3 ecosystem. Her innovative approach invites viewers to join the creative process, echoing the collaborative energy seen in projects like MoMA’s blockchain postcard experiment and platforms like Dada.art. Nyx is constantly pushing the envelope, proving that when creativity, networking, and leadership meets blockchain, art transforms into not only a shared journey but a force which further unifies an often tribalistic Web3 space. Crafting Clear Narratives in a Complex World: Nicole GrinsteadIn the ever-growing crypto world, effective communication is the secret sauce that turns tech jargons into stories everyone can enjoy. Nicole Grinstead, at Lunar Digital Assets , has helped transform blockchain complexities into engaging narratives that resonate with the diverse gentry of the blockchain world.

The recent downturn has fueled panic selling and heightened fear, leading many investors to speculate about the potential start of a bear market. As uncertainty grips the market, traders remain cautious about Bitcoin’s next major move. Related Reading: Cardano Bulls Eye $10 Target – Analyst Reveals Key Levels To Break However, despite the ongoing sell-off, key on-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin could be setting up for a recovery rally. The Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) indicator, a metric that tracks long-term holder behavior and capital inflows, suggests that BTC could soon enter a new uptrend. If Bitcoin stabilizes and reclaims key support levels, it could pave the way for a rally toward a new all-time high of $128,000. With Bitcoin at a critical inflection point, the next few trading sessions will be crucial in determining whether BTC can regain momentum or if further downside is ahead. Investors are now closely watching whether selling pressure continues or if long-term holders step in to accumulate, signaling a potential market rebound. Bitcoin Insights Give Hope To Bulls Bitcoin is at a critical juncture, facing a serious risk of continued correction as bearish sentiment grips the market. Many analysts now believe that the Bitcoin bull cycle may be over, as BTC struggles below $85,000 while barely holding above $80,000. With selling pressure intensifying, investors are expecting another leg down, potentially pushing BTC into lower demand zones. Despite the negative outlook, some analysts argue that a recovery is still possible if Bitcoin can reclaim key levels. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, stating that if BTC reclaims $84,000 as support, it could open the path toward a rally to a new all-time high of $128,000. This suggests that while the market remains fragile, there is still potential for Bitcoin to regain strength if bulls step in at critical price points. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the strength or weakness of this cycle. If BTC continues to struggle below key resistance levels, a deeper correction could follow, reinforcing bearish sentiment. However, if bulls manage to push BTC back above $84K, it would indicate a shift in momentum, potentially reigniting the uptrend.

With uncertainty dominating the market, traders are closely watching BTC’s next move, as its ability to hold or reclaim support levels will determine whether this cycle is truly over or if another rally is still on the horizon. BTC Struggling Below $85K Bitcoin has faced massive selling pressure, with the most significant drop occurring on Sunday, when the price plunged from $86,000 to $80,000, marking a 7% decline in just hours. This sharp downturn has fueled panic selling as investors remain uncertain about Bitcoin’s short-term direction. For bulls to regain control, BTC must reclaim the $86,000 level and push above $90,000 to confirm a potential recovery rally. A strong move past these key resistance levels could restore confidence in the market, signaling that Bitcoin’s correction phase might be nearing its end. However, failure to break above $86K could keep Bitcoin under bearish control, increasing the risk of another leg down. If BTC drops below $80,000, it could test the $78,000 low, a level that, if breached, may lead to further downside pressure.

41425755,https://invezz.com/?p=2606985,1741600191,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Inside Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve: A new era for US digital asset policy or just a fluke?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/10/inside-trumps-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-a-new-era-for-us-digital-asset-policy-or-just-a-fluke/,"The US government just made history by officially recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset—a first for any global superpower. President Donald Trump’s new Executive Order (EO) establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, ensuring that seized Bitcoin will be permanently held by the federal government. Now the question is whether or not this is a game-changer or is it just political posturing wrapped in a shiny new label. Critics argue that this move lacks real substance, while supporters see it as the ultimate move to integrate Bitcoin into the global financial system. So, which one is it? What the Executive Order says On March 6, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and a US Digital Asset Stockpile. This means that every Bitcoin seized through civil and criminal forfeiture proceedings will be permanently held by the government. No sales. No liquidations. Just cold storage, indefinitely. The order also tasks the Treasury and Commerce Departments with developing budget-neutral strategies to acquire more Bitcoin in the future. Budget-neutral means that the government can only buy more if it doesn’t increase the deficit, raise taxes, or add financial burden to taxpayers. So while the door for accumulation is technically open, no direct purchases have been announced as of now. Beyond Bitcoin, the US Digital Asset Stockpile will hold other forfeited cryptocurrencies. Unlike the SBR, this stockpile is not considered strategic, and there’s no policy preventing the government from selling these assets. In other words, Bitcoin is now officially separated from the broader “crypto” category in US policy, which is a significant development in itself. Why this matters Bitcoin has spent the last decade clawing its way from a niche internet experiment to a legitimate macroeconomic asset. Institutional adoption has surged, especially following the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. Hedge funds, public companies, and sovereign wealth funds have taken positions. But until now, nation-states had largely remained on the sidelines. That era may be ending. The US government now officially holds 207,189 coins (worth approximately $17.5 billion at today’s prices), making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. So if this is significant, does this move set off a global Bitcoin arms race? If Bitcoin is indeed a strategic asset, other countries may feel pressure to accumulate before it’s too late. With only 21 million BTC ever to exist, late adopters could find themselves priced out permanently. The implications are massive. A world where central banks and sovereign wealth funds scramble to secure Bitcoin would change the global financial system forever. For the US, this decision could also be seen as a hedge against monetary debasement. While the dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, holding Bitcoin could serve as insurance against potential changes to the global financial order. The bearish case: symbolic, unclear, and overhyped Skeptics argue that Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is more about branding than substance. While the government is now officially holding Bitcoin, the lack of an acquisition plan weakens its long-term significance. If the US isn’t actively buying, does this reserve mean anything? The harshest critics say that this is simply a new name for Bitcoin, the government already had. The executive order makes no guarantees that more Bitcoin will be acquired. Without a defined accumulation strategy, the reserve is just a rebranded holding rather than a deliberate sovereign investment. Others point to the market reaction as evidence that this move fell flat. Bitcoin dropped 5% immediately after the announcement, as traders likely searched for the word “buy” in the EO and didn’t find it. If this were a true game-changer, markets should have responded positively. Critics also warn about government interference in markets. The inclusion of other cryptocurrencies in a separate digital asset stockpile raises concerns about the government picking winners. If Bitcoin is in the reserve but other assets aren’t, does this imply implicit approval of one over the other? And if the government were to suddenly decide that Bitcoin should be regulated differently, could this reserve be used as a tool for control rather than a strategic advantage? The bullish case: Bitcoin’s legitimacy moment Supporters of the move see this as one of the most significant moments in Bitcoin’s history. For years, Bitcoin has been lumped in with speculative altcoins. This executive order changes that. Bitcoin is now officially recognized as a distinct, strategic asset by the most powerful government in the world. Unlike previous administrations, which treated Bitcoin with skepticism or outright hostility, this move legitimizes Bitcoin at the highest level. The US is now a sovereign Bitcoin holder, and that alone sets an important precedent. Beyond symbolism, the budget-neutral accumulation strategy could be a brilliant long-term approach. Instead of printing money or issuing debt to buy Bitcoin, the US could acquire BTC through alternative funding methods. Some have suggested that the government could: Sell Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from the IMF Revalue gold reserves to unlock new capital Sell non-Bitcoin digital assets from the stockpile If executed properly, this approach would allow the U.S. to gradually accumulate Bitcoin without destabilizing financial markets or harming taxpayers. Perhaps the biggest implication is what happens next. Now that the U.S. has moved first, other governments will be forced to make a decision. Do they start stacking Bitcoin to maintain a competitive position? Or do they sit back and watch the US secure an early lead? Some countries have already shown their interest in using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve or as part of their sovereign wealth funds. If other nations adopt the same approach as the US, Bitcoin could truly have its defining moment of legitimacy.

Those with liquid cash to stockpile are the Kings and Queens of the investor world in this bearish season. For those who have the extra cash to invest or refraining from ‘wasteful spending’ to buy into the market, here’s a summarized look at the best 3 token presales for crypto Investors in March of 2025. Notice on each of the listed initial coin offerings there are two sections of information. One part is a more detailed format, while the other is a bullet briefing of token data and where to purchase. #1 - Nollars Network (NOLA) The native cryptocurrency of the Nollars Network, called $NOLA, is currently in presale at Nollars.com as part of its initial coin offering (ICO). The brand value of the Nollars Network cryptocurrency has grown significantly, attracting more Google searches than established tokens like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. The project is led by German mathematician Richart Dedekind, indicating high long-term potential. The $NOLA token will serve as the main currency in a new ecosystem that includes a high-speed blockchain, a decentralized exchange, and a dApp for cryptocurrency transactions via WhatsApp. With WhatsApp's user base projected to exceed 3.1 billion by 2025, the adoption of the dApp could lead to a skyrocketing token value, potentially reaching over $100. A total of 15 million $NOLA tokens will be minted, and the current presale price is 50 cents per token. The Nollars Network will enable seamless asset transfers across different blockchains and has passed KYC verification, enhancing its legitimacy. AscendEX crypto exchange plans to list the $NOLA token in January, reducing the risk of scams and suggesting strong future growth potential. Presale Data Overview: Token Name: Nollars Network Symbol: $NOLA Creator: Richart Dedekind Total Token Supply: 15,000,000 Presale Price: $0.50 Listing Day Price: $0.83 Return on Investment Potential: +66% CEX Listing Month: May 2025, contingent upon reaching the soft cap Utility: Facilitates expedited trading and improved spot pricing, resulting in cost savings. Furthermore, it serves as the foundation for a new cryptocurrency ecosystem, which will include a decentralized exchange (DEX) and an e-commerce solution integrated with WhatsApp. Official Website: www.Nollars.com #2 Yeezy (YZY) A new token presale, Yeezy coin, linked to rapper Kanye West (formerly Ye), is rumored to launch in March 2025. The token is expected to be used for purchasing Yeezy shoes, clothing, and merchandise, as Kanye regains control after parting ways with Adidas. The Yeezy brand is valued at over $3 billion, with potential high sales for new collections. If the Yeezy coin launches alongside the relaunch of Yeezy.com, its market capitalization could soar, potentially placing it in the Top 10 cryptocurrencies. A significant return on investment (ROI) is anticipated if the presale price is below the listing price. Background details on another token, Nollars Network ($NOLA), include a presale price of $0.50, a listing price of $0.83, and a potential ROI of +66%. The token will support a decentralized exchange and an e-commerce solution. Presale Data Overview: Token Name: Yeezy Symbol: $YZY Creator: Ye, also known as Kanye West Total Token Supply: Information not available Presale Price: Information not available Listing Day Price: Information not available ROI Gap: Information not available CEX Listing Month: Information not available Utility: The official digital currency for Yeezy footwear, apparel, and merchandise, associated with a brand valued at approximately $3 billion Official Website: www.Yeezy.com #3 - Bitnance (BTN) Each blockchain has its own version of Bitcoin, and the Binance ecosystem is set to see the launch of Bitnance (BTN) on the BEP-20 network. BTN is currently in its presale phase with a soft cap of $1 million and a total supply of 10,500,000 tokens, half of which is for presale. Bitnance aims to provide lower transaction fees than Bitcoin and offers advantages over the Bitcoin blockchain; a digital store of value asset. BTC is projected to reach $250,000 this year, which, while a solid return, requires significant new investment; BTN represents a pioneer investment opportunity. Investors are encouraged to adopt a long-term HODL strategy with BTN, recalling Bitcoin’s growth from less than 1 penny in 2011 to over $100,000 today. BTN is currently priced at $0.38, with nearly 118,000 tokens sold and a gradual price increase in the presale. The cryptocurrency will operate autonomously, controlled by investors' spending power, serving as a store of value against fiat currency inflation. This is commonly referred to as a SOV token or ‘digital store of value asset.’ Presale Data Overview: Token Name: Bitnance Symbol: $BTN Creator: N/A Total Token Supply: 10,500,000 Presale Price: $0.3804 Listing Day Price: $0.47 Return on Investment Gap: +23.66% Centralized Exchange Listing Month: October 2025 (soft cap of $1 million; hard cap of $2.5 million) Utility: Store of Value Official site / white paper: www.Bitnance.net Best 3 Token Presales for Crypto Investors in March 2025 A savvy investor has a varied investment portfolio. As we near April 2025, analysts have firm belief that these cryptocurrencies are the best 3 initial coin offerings for a chance at getting a better return on investment than the precious metal Gold [AU] and most cryptos. Watch Nollars Network (NOLA), Yeezy (YZY), and Bitnance (BTN) closely. While Yeezy (YZY) may not have its presale this month, it’s anticipated that it could launch in March. When making investments, prioritize your financial objectives over the actions of rapper Kanye West. Keep an eye out for announcements regarding the Nollars Network’s decentralized WhatsApp application, as this could mark a crucial development in the cryptocurrency space.

Remittix Continues Marching Into Crypto Greatness With 4x Gains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/has-solana-price-reached-support-or-is-the-worst-yet-to-come-remittix-continues-marching-into-crypto-greatness-with-4x-gains/,"Solana (SOL), now trading at approximately $125.12 having dipped more than 2% in the past 24 hours, sits on the precipice of a vote that would fundamentally change its token inflation mechanism. Tweaking inflation rates in line with staking could support the price of SOL, say experts, but others warn that short-term numbers are dictating a long-term change Meanwhile, fast rising altcoin Remittix (RTX), currently trading in the area of $0.0734 having raised more than $13.7m and selling 516+ million tokens, has caught traders’ attention with its real-world application and future development potential. Solana Dynamic Inflation Proposal Improvement Proposal-0228 (SIMD-0228) would substitute the current fixed model of inflation (4.6% to 1.5%) with a dynamic model that rewards or trims token creation as a function of the ratio of SOL that is being staked. Inflation rises to incentivize more stakers to participate and secure the network if it is low (less than 33% of the network). Inflation is cut to avoid unnecessary dilution if it is high. Tushar Jain and Vishal Kankani of Multicoin Capital and Anza economist Max Resnick head the proposal. Some, such as VanEck’s Matthew Sigel , support the transition, as they argue that it is achievable to have low inflation without sacrificing security. Others, such as MetaDAO co-founders Nallok, have worries about too much dependence on short-term validator data and that a dynamic fee model could prove to be a more appropriate model. SOL prices at around $135. Source: CoinGecko At SOL prices of approximately around $125.12 , opinion remains split as to if the slide by the coin is new support or if more declines await. Solana’s current fervor is centered on tokenomics, but others question if that will hold investors’ fascination. Some see a potential way to an ETF if Solana brings down the level of inflation, with an institutional demand spark as a possible catalyst. Fear exists that adjusting parameters of inflation mid-course will alienate existing validators. Remittix (RTX): The 4x Gainer Bec In Solana’s rollercoaster, the lead is taken by Remittix (RTX), which rose 4x in value in the presale and now is trading around $0.0734. Having raised more than $13.7 million and selling 516+ million tokens, RTX brings something simpler: instant-ish cross-border payments. No end-to-end smart-contract platform to construct or change inflation every quarter; Remittix is all about simple exchange. Someone in Europe sends money in BTC or ETH and someone in Asia gets local cash in the bank in about 24 hours. Such a simple, real-world solution is attracting families, freelancers and small stores who need cheaper, faster transfers. If Remittix (RTX) is paired with e-commerce or payroll services, the number of users could balloon, taking the token price even higher. Why Traders Prefer Remittix to Solana Solana’s dynamic inflation scheme generates new buzz but also brings complexity with it. SOL stakers have to track shifting rates, and validators have to stay on high alert. Remittix (RTX), on the other hand, solves a daily need of low-cost, fast remittances without the need for users to deal with complicated blockchain protocols. Then, the token-locked funds and audit-secured smart contract on Remittix eliminate scam risks, a big plus in an industry with an abundance of perilous presales. Market commentators compare RTX to such tokens as XRP that surged on hopes of simplifying cross-border finance. The difference is that Remittix could roll out answers ahead of the pack, attracting mass users more concerned with savings than with exotic DeFi concepts. That real-world pull could drive saner expansion than a token burdened with inner gov debates. Conclusion: Can Solana’s Innovation Keep Up with the Real-World Attraction of Remittix Solana’s dynamic inflation model needs to calm the future of the chain but could unsettle some players. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX), currently trading at $0.0734 and having raised over $13.7m, sits higher by solving a common problem: sending money affordably across the world. If demand by users drives the next wave of crypto, Remittix could overtake Solana’s conservative tokenomics. Ready to Check Out Remittix?

The market cap of the coins, whose value is pegged to a real-world equivalent such as the U.S. dollar, climbed as high as $205 billion, Glassnode data shows. Demand was buoyed by investors seeking relief from sliding cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin ( BTC ) and ether ( ETH ). Since President Donald Trump won the U.S. election, the stablecoin market cap has grown by $40 billion. With both cryptocurrencies and U.S. equities struggling in recent weeks, stablecoins have emerged as the clear winners. Market leader Tether's USDT has maintained a market cap of around $140 billion since December, while second-placed USDC, issued by Circle, is nearing $60 billion — an increase of $25 billion since the election. At the Digital Asset Summit on Friday , Bessent said, ""We are going to keep the U.S. the dominant reserve currency, and we will use stablecoins to do it."" Bessent's remarks highlight concerns over macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, which could lead to a decline in foreign demand for U.S. debt, pushing treasury yields higher. Over the past year, Japan and China , the two largest holders of U.S. Treasuries, have reduced their holdings. For the dollar to maintain its status as the world’s reserve currency, there must be consistent demand for U.S. debt. The administration identified stablecoins as an ideal partner in this strategy. By holding U.S. debt as reserves, stablecoins can help lower Treasury yields while simultaneously expanding the global reach and dominance of the dollar. Stablecoins need to have dollars available to repay investors looking to cash out. Tether is already one of the largest holders of three-month U.S. Treasuries.",Markets|Stablecoins|Bitcoin|Tether|USDC|Circle,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|USDT|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-10 09:53:09

This has sparked fresh investment among traders. Today, HBAR’s price hovers at $0.22 this week, fueled by a mainnet upgrade and a $2 billion ETF filing by Canary Capital. Also, a trending Asian meme coin, Panshibi (SHIBI) , is capturing attention with its charming panda theme. After achieving over $1.23 million raised in its presale, SHIBI promises wild 100x gains as more Asian traders take a piece. Let’s find out more about HBAR and Panshibi in this article. 10B Market Cap Incoming as Hedera Sparks New Interest Hedera (HBAR) is on fire as it races toward a $10 billion market cap as of March 9, 2025. This surge has got everyone talking as it hopes to go back above 10 Billion. Right now, HBAR’s price is around $0.203 after a recent but short lived uptrend which pushed its market cap to about $9.5 billion. This jump comes after a mainnet upgrade that slashed transaction fees and boosted transaction speed. Also, Canary Capital filed for a Hedera ETF this month. This signals that traders have a big trust in its future. In addition, since Trump’s U.S. crypto reserve announcement, Hedera has enjoyed the general market pump. Posts on X also show traders falling about HBAR’s potential to hit $0.75 by year-end. Since it features an eco-friendly tech that is highly attractive to corporate eyes, this is truly possible. Unlike some coins, Hedera is not just hype. It is built for real-world use, like tracking supply chains or powering apps. This is a reason why it is sparking new interest and pulling in investors who want more than just memes. Speaking of memes, a trending Asian meme coin, Panshibi (SHIBI) , is tempting some Hedera fans to peek over. This is no surprise as Hedera’s steady climb feels like speculation and a less solid bet that depends on many things. With Bitcoin and Ethereum fluctuating constantly, Hedera might feel the influence and also remain unstable. Thanks to the trending Asian meme coin, SHIBI, investors can invest in a coin more definitively as they wait for HBAR to make its leap to a $10B market cap. Investors Explore New Asian Meme Coin That Promises Huge Profits As the market remains unstable, investors are diving into Panshibi (SHIBI), a trending Asian meme coin with a roadmap to the top. This panda-inspired token has pulled in over $1.23 million in its presale and this is just the beginning. With a $10 million cap limit and only 15 days left, more investors are trying to get in before the presale ends. Now, SHIBI presale is at stage 4 and the token is priced at $0.005 after an increase from its starting price. Also, experts say the price is set to jump 1,200% during presale. This offers profits to early adopters who get into Panshibi before it launches. Also, Panshibi will soar 145,000% after hitting exchanges like Uniswap and other DEXs. Apart from the numerous profits, Panshibi also offers real perks. Investors can simply let their tokens work for them by staking $SHIBI and qualifying for a huge 1,200% APY. Also, early buyers will get into the Bamboo Private VIP Club where various exclusive rewards are shared. To prevent rug pulls, the team will lock liquidity for 10 years and team tokens will not be traded for 2 years. After the presale, leftover tokens will also be burned to increase scarcity and price. Thanks to Consuit, this trending Asian meme coin has solid contract security as this independent contractor has verified that there are no loopholes. Conclusion With major cryptocurrency prices fluctuating every other day, some experts say this is not the best time to invest in these coins. However, the trending Asian meme coin, Panshibi, is an outlier with a roadmap to the top of the charts. Just like HBAR investors who have begun to invest in Panshibi, other investors are taking the cue to hop in before it launches. This is an opportunity of a lifetime and experts say many millionaires will be made after the launch surge. Will you be one of them?

41425924,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/viral-020-coin-joins-polkadot-dot-and-shiba-inu-shib-as-februarys-top-picks-for-big-money-investors,1741600753,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41425924.jpeg,Viral $0.20 Coin Joins Polkadot (DOT) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) as February’s Top Picks for Big Money Investors,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/viral-020-coin-joins-polkadot-dot-and-shiba-inu-shib-as-februarys-top-picks-for-big-money-investors,"Investors are making hefty investments in crypto in February 2025, eyeing projects with substantial upside growth. Polkadot (DOT), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Rexas Finance (RXS) are the hottest investments being discussed. As SHIB keeps attracting more enthusiasts toward meme coins, DOT is enjoying a skyrocketing social volume. RXS, on the other hand, has gone viral and is gaining significant capital investment as it approaches its exchange listing. Polkadot (DOT) Gains Momentum as Social Volume Spikes DOT is back in the spotlight, with its social volume reaching 92 recently, indicating an increase in shilling. The spike in engagement is a very good sign for those wanting to trade and buy Polkadot because prices will likely increase. As Polkadot continues with its social dominance this month at 0.4417%, it has also become one of the most talked-about assets in the crypto world. Currently, DOT is hovering around its important support level of $3.74. This price zone has historically been a strong buy region that has helped recover and increase the value significantly. Analysts have divided opinions about DOT. If it exceeds this predicted price, it can reach $5.25 and eventually $6.50. Due to the recent drop, investors speculate that the impending breakout will increase the value significantly. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Keeps Investors Engaged SHIB is still very popular with retail traders as some price predictions have provided a very gradual growth in February. Analysts also expect that SHIB will incorporate new buying activities and an improving crypto market towards an increase from $0.0000152 to $0.0000153. All those who sold SHIB for profits made good returns, making SHIB popular. If market scenarios align for SHIB, further increases seem possible. However, the increased popularity of SHIB has attracted many investors toward newer opportunities, including Rexas Finance (RXS). Reasons Why Rexas Finance (RXS) Is in the Limelight While both DOT and SHIB have become well-known cryptocurrencies, RXS is still in its presale phase, where early investors have the unique opportunity to purchase the token before it hits major exchanges. RXS has completed 90.43% of Stage 12 of the presale and has successfully raised over $46.4 million while selling 452.1 million tokens. Early investors prefer to consider RXS at its current price of $0.20, much cheaper than its expected listing price of $0.25 on June 19, 2025. RXS is unique in its multi-utility ecosystem, which is designed to solve some of the most pressing problems in blockchains. The platform comprises: Rexas AI: An intelligent trading software that improves investment decisions. Rexas Treasury is a liquidity and funding mechanism that helps sustain the project over time. Rexas Token Builder: A platform where users can create their own digital assets on a blockchain with utmost simplicity. These features give RXS utility beyond being just a meme coin. With a CertiK security audit, an active dev team, and a supportive community, RXS is on its way to becoming a powerful token in 2025. Comparison of RXS with DOT and SHIB RXS has a distinct advantage of early entry, as it is still in the presale stage, compared to other established players like DOT and SHIB, which have strong investor bases. The fundamentals for DOT are strong; however, it is extremely volatile and trading in the low accumulation zone, with an uneventful and uninspiring potential upside of 50% to 100% in the foreseeable future. SHIB is also a fan favorite, and many people are attached to it. Still, its volatility makes it an unreliable bet, with price action often subject to social media speculation and hype. RXS is still new and relatively untamed, making it more likely to experience a 10x or even 20x increase quicker than expected. RXS has not yet hit major exchanges. RXS is almost entirely sold out and looks ready to get listed on a major exchange. With whale investors and smart traders betting on its price tag, it makes for a cost-efficient investment. Considering the ecosystem and utility of RXS, it is set to become one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in 2025. Conclusion: RXS Leads the Charge for February's Big Money Picks The February investment spotlight is equally shared among Polkadot, Shiba Inu, and Rexas Finance. However, RXS makes the strongest case for investment, considering the potential multi-fold returns it can offer. DOT's breakout and the overly hyped SHIB meme coin are the only things pumping. RXS offers early-stage investors an opportunity for massive returns before the exchange listings. With whales accumulating as the presale ends, RXS is topping the leaderboard for picks of the 2025 bull run—for now, at least. Investors looking for the next big story this year or searching for a crypto success internationally can look to RXS.

41425908,https://crypto.news/?p=14344045,1741600808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/41425908.jpeg,Japan’s crypto reform bill headed to National Diet after cabinet approval,https://crypto.news/japans-crypto-reform-bill-headed-to-national-diet-after-cabinet-approval/,"The Cabinet of Japan has green lit a proposal to amend the Payment Services Act, which would ease regulations for stablecoins and crypto brokerages. According to a press release issued by the country’s Financial Services Agency , the bill has already been approved by the Cabinet and was submitted to the National Diet on the same day. The bill was previously approved by the FSA and could potentially make it easier for crypto firms to enter the Japanese market. For a bill to pass through the National Cabinet, it must receive a majority vote from the Cabinet members present at the meeting. The Cabinet is led by the Japanese Prime Minister, who plays a key role in determining consensus, as the Cabinet operates under the principle of collective responsibility. Once approved, the bill is formally submitted to the National Diet for legislative debate and voting. Once it passes through to the Diet, the bill is assigned to a relevant committee where it is examined, debated, and potentially amended before it is introduced to the full chamber. If both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors approve the bill, it is then sent to the Emperor for ceremonial promulgation, which will formalize the law and eventually enact it. Read more: Japan’s FSA approves reforms to ease stablecoin and brokerage regulations What are the potential changes to Japan’s crypto regulations? The bill would allow for stablecoins to be backed by short-term government bonds and fixed-term deposits, aside from only the demand deposits. This clause also comes equipped with an upper limit of 50% for government bonds and deposits that can be used as collateral for stablecoins. At press time, stablecoin issuers in Japan are required to match the amount of circulated tokens on a 1:1 ratio with cash deposits in regulated bank accounts. The new rule grants them more flexibility to be able to use other assets like Japanese and U.S. government bonds instead. However, only certain types of bonds can be used, including those with a remaining maturity of three months or less. In addition, the bill will also create a new category just for “intermediary” crypto businesses or brokerages. In Japan, crypto brokerage firms can only operate within the country if they manage to fulfill the same registration requirements as crypto exchange platforms. This means that crypto brokerages need to apply for a virtual asset service provider license, just like domestic crypto exchanges. Under the new bill, intermediaries will abide to their own set of requirements and anti-money laundering obligations, instead of being clumped together with exchanges that operate differently.

33767162,[object Object],1741600849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Internal Ripple Emails Expose Anti-Bitcoin Smear Campaign,https://bitcoinist.com/internal-ripple-emails-expose-anti-bitcoin-campaign/,"Internal Ripple emails from 2018—submitted in the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit over alleged unregistered securities sales—have resurfaced. These documents show that Ripple executives and staff actively discussed promoting the narrative that Bitcoin is “controlled by China,” a claim often referred to as “China FUD” (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). How Ripple Directed The Bitcoin “China FUD” One of the cited emails , labeled “4) China + Bitcoin,” contains the following directive: “This feels similar to what Brad and [Redacted] already say publicly about Bitcoin being run by China.” Another segment outlines a plan to produce an “insights post” contrasting XRP with other cryptocurrencies:“ We could pitch this out as it would get a ton of play as ‘Ripple’s Response to [Redacted].’ Note: This feels like it would run opposite to our current promotion efforts around exchanges. As of right now, we have told all current or future exchanges that we are not able to provide promotion help.” In addition to these strategic notes, email exchanges among Ripple staff dated July 16, 2018, suggest a detailed, ongoing conversation about how best to frame Bitcoin’s perceived centralization issues. One staff member wrote: “How is the bitcoin/china story different than the one we are already working on with [Redacted]? Are we willing to put someone on the record now to specifically call out bitcoin and ethereum?” A [Redacted] staffer then proposed a meeting: “Can we all circle up sometime today to discuss next steps?” The emails underscore that “China + Bitcoin” was an internal talking point at Ripple, seemingly aimed at highlighting Bitcoin’s alleged vulnerabilities tied to Chinese mining pools in order to promote XRP as “decentralized”. These newly surfaced emails come shortly after US President Donald Trump announced the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Notably, leaks have revealed that Ripple opposed a “Bitcoin-only” strategy, lobbying for a more diversified approach that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly met with the Trump administration to advocate for broader inclusion of digital assets. Publicly, Ripple’s lobbying efforts have been positioned as part of a campaign to shape crypto-friendly regulations. However, critics assert that Ripple’s behind-the-scenes work—evidenced by the leaked emails—took on a distinctly anti-Bitcoin tone. Critics quickly seized upon an October 9, 2018 tweet from Ripple CTO David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz), which stated: “A new study shows China controls 74% of bitcoin. Does that sound decentralized to you?”According to critics, this tweet closely aligns with the July 2018 email discussions, suggesting a concerted PR strategy to depict Bitcoin as centralized. Longtime XRP skeptic Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot Platforms, Inc., responded on X: “I don’t respect David Schwartz, Ripple, or XRP. For the past decade their marketing strategy to hype their pre-mined altcoin has been to buy and promote anti-bitcoin disinformation while pretending that banks want to use XRP (they don’t). They’ll say and do anything to advance their centralized garbage ‘technology’ that has zero utility.” Rochard also added: “Brad Garlinghouse did his best to smear Bitcoin as bad for the environment and controlled by China. Disinformation. The truth won, he lost.” Ripple’s Long History Of Anti-Bitcoin Marketing Remarkably, Ripple has a long history of attacking Bitcoin. Ripple’s co-founder and executive chairman, Chris Larsen, has been a vocal advocate for shifting Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). In March 2022, Larsen personally funded a $5 million Greenpeace USA campaign called “Change the Code,” aimed at pressuring Bitcoin developers and prominent industry figures to alter Bitcoin’s mining protocol. Despite high-profile advertising and an attention-grabbing art installation by Benjamin Von Wong—the “Skull of Satoshi”—the campaign backfired spectacularly. Bitcoiners embraced it as “badass,” co-opting it as a mascot. On March 25, 2023, Von Wong posted a Twitter thread admitting he’d been “wrong” to view Bitcoin’s environmental impact as a “black-and-white issue.” After engaging with Bitcoin advocates online, he acknowledged that mining’s energy dynamics were complex—PoW could drive renewable adoption rather than just harm the planet. He shifted from advocating a code change to suggesting Bitcoiners “work within the system” to green the network, a notable pivot from the campaign’s original intent. Greenpeace, however, doubled down, continuing to tour the skull to push its message, despite Von Wong’s softened rhetoric. At press time, BTC traded at $81,593.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|crypto news|ripple|Ripple Anti-Bitcoin Campaign|ripple news|XRP|XRP news,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-10 10:00:49

However, instead of the bull market, it crashed, liquidating millions of digital assets. Interestingly, a Bitcoin whale has earned $7.5M with these events, leaving the crypto community wondering if it is a Trump insider. What’s the story? Let’s discuss this. Bitcoin Whale Predicted the Trump Executive Order Crash According to the Lookonchain post , an alleged Trump insider executed a short position at $96,500 on February 22. Interestingly, its predictions came true: the Bitcoin price plummeted below $80,000, closing the bottom near $78,900. But that’s just the start, as Trump’s Executive Order brought a price surge in Bitcoin, which favored the whale. As the BTC soared past $94,000, the whale re-entered a short position at the peak of ~$94,424. Overall, this person made another heavy profit even in the crypto market crash , earning $7.5M collectively. The community has tagged it as a Trump-insider, as its two predictions have come true. Interestingly, the trader is again eyeing profits as BTC hovers around $82,054. The Bitcoin whale has set additional short positions between $92,449 – $92,636 and placed limit orders to take profit between $70,475 – $74,192. If the price surged, the trader could earn another $70K–$74K in profits. Bitcoin Price Predictions: What’s Coming Next For BTC? With another crypto market crash, Bitcoin’s price dropped 4.5% in the last 24 hours. It currently trades at $80,350 and is facing bearish sentiments as US CPI data is to be released soon. Amid the mass liquidation and bearish sentiments, investors are concerned about a further downtrend. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has highlighted a declining downtrend with the bearish pennant pattern formation. Adding to his prediction, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicts that BTC will retest $78k, and a failure at that could push it down further. An ugly start to the week. It looks like $BTC will retest to $78K. If it fails, $75K is next in the crosshairs. A lot of options OI is struck at $70-$75K—if we get into that range, it will be violent. Conclusion: Trump Insiders in Action? In addition to the aforementioned Bitcoin whale, another trader made heavy returns with the Donald Trump Executive Order and the crypto market crash. With the Ethereum shorting, an alleged Trump insider profited $81M in just two days. Crypto investors are left in awe of such incidents, where some praised these traders’ skills while others called them insiders. Now, the eyes are all on the Bitcoin price performance and whether this will make the trader another $70,000-$75,000 in profits.

The platform’s revenues are down to $667K in a day, after a long-running downward trend. Pump.fun is no longer a reliable producer of fees. Daily revenues fell to $667K daily as of March 8, the lowest in seven months. While Pump.fun still produces more revenues compared to other protocols, there are no signs of ending the downward trend. Just a day later, Pump.fun posted a little over $110K in daily revenues. The meme token platform also reflected the general loss of optimism for crypto, as even major coins sank deeper in the red. The total fees for the platform fell off a cliff, despite hovering above $1M in the past week. Within days, the fees were down another 90%. Pump.fun continued to bleed revenues, as retail is losing interest in risky meme tokens. | Source: DeFi Llama. The platform achieved its peak daily revenues in January, surpassing $15M in a single day. The downward trend continues, diminishing the platform’s returns every day. The platform has almost returned to its slump from September 2024, but this time, there are doubts about starting a new casino cycle. Token creation, listings also slow down One of the reasons for the lower fees is the low number of graduating tokens, which brings a 1.5SOL ‘graduation fee’. The other source of income is the 1% trading fee for all token swaps. In the past day, only 194 tokens graduated to Raydium with sufficient liquidity. Only 7,233 wallets were engaged with creating new tokens in the past day. Pump.fun still saw over 11K new launches, though most remained in their bonding curves. The platform’s activity slowed down to 159K new addresses, down from a recent maximum of 292K active addresses. The loss of users arrived after Pump.fun ended its random casino stage, where any meme had a chance of making it big. Instead, the platform started carrying more curated tokens, with the risk of insider influence. Pump.fun trading volumes also continued to decline, as traders became discouraged by aggressive rug pulls and sniping. At the peak of the cycle, Pump.fun carried up to $3B in value. Currently, the daily trading turnover is a little over $77M . The lack of ‘trenches’ traders also means launches may become unfavorable, as they would not be able to raise sufficient liquidity. The recent series of launches relies on teams to provide liquidity to move the token to Raydium. Pump.fun mostly tapped Solana insiders More than 72% of Pump.fun traffic comes from direct visits, with 7.73% from Google traffic. Pump.fun is tied to crypto-friendly countries, with the biggest share of traffic coming from the USA. The Pump.fun phenomenon brought new cohorts of users, but did not lead to crypto mass adoption. Only a few of the meme tokens built communities, and none had any utility, unlike meme tokens from the previous cycle. The positions of meme tokens correlate with the performance of Bitcoin (BTC) and the general sentiment of the crypto market. As such, meme tokens are not counter-cyclical, and have fallen deeper compared to other assets. The recent meme token cycle raised doubts about bringing more value to crypto. In total, Pump.fun extracted $500M in the market, liquidating the income through SOL sales. The new value from retail buyers was quickly taken out of the market, and did not move to BTC or other crypto assets. The last $400M in value were extracted between August 2024 and January, tapping the peak meme cycle coinciding with the US elections narrative. This led crypto analysts to view the 2024 cycle as aggressively PvP, where the few winners also caused deep losses for users. Pump.fun was seen as one of the most active PvP markets, which only achieved its fees and turnover based on a wide user base willing to lose SOL for the chance of winning with one hot meme token.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to as low as $80,000 before the bulls recovered some of the losses. The alternative coins have followed the negative performance of the leading digital asset, with many of them charting substantial losses. Another Downtrend for BTC Despite its brief spikes, Bitcoin has been on an evident downfall in the past several days. As CryptoPotato reported , the price consolidated at around $86,000 over the weekend, but the bulls had to take another blow with the start of the business week. A few hours ago, BTC tanked to as low as $80,000, resulting in multi-million liquidations on a 24-hour scale. Since then, though, the asset stepped on the gas pedal again, recovering to almost $84,000 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The enhanced volatility is expected to continue in the short term due to some upcoming events. One of those is the latest US CPI report scheduled for March 12. It will reveal the inflation rate in the world’s biggest economy, which could trigger an interest rate adjustment by the Federal Reserve. Historically, such efforts have affected BTC’s price performance. Meanwhile, the asset’s market capitalization stands at approximately $1.66 trillion, while its dominance against the altcoins is almost the same as on March 9 – around 58.1%. Alts Turn Red, too The altcoins have also gone into red territory. At one point, Ethereum (ETH) collapsed to a multi-year low of under $2,000. It later recovered some of the losses, and as of this writing, it is worth around $2,120. Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and many more have performed quite poorly, too . For its part, Pi Network (PI) continues to suffer and is now worth around $1.43, representing a 14% decline on a weekly scale . The very few top 100 cryptocurrencies that have charted some gains in the last 24 hours include Ethena (ENA), Aave (AAVE), and Story (IP). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization currently stands at roughly $2.82 trillion, representing a 5% decrease for the day .

Recently, Pi Coin’s price dropped by 10%, leaving many investors wondering whether it’s a buying opportunity or a warning sign to stay away. Massive Outflows Raise Concerns The recent drop in Pi Coin’s price happened due to a global crypto market correction, with Bitcoin plunging sharply to $80k. Perhaps many in the Pi community believe that this isn’t the sole reason behind the price plunge. Some traders suspect that a large outflow from the Pi Core Team (PCT) Wallet played a role in the decline. On March 7, nearly 90 million Pi tokens were moved out of the wallet, followed by another 36.4 million tokens the next day. Since this movement happened at the same time as the price drop, it led to speculation that the team might be selling off tokens. Upcoming Token Unlocks Looking ahead, the Pi Network is set to unlock a significant number of tokens over the next month. The largest unlocks are scheduled for March 17 and March 21, with over 23 million Pi tokens set to enter the market on each of these days. In total, around 282 million Pi tokens , valued at approximately $390.93 million, will be unlocked in the next 30 days. This increase in supply could add selling pressure, making it challenging for the price to recover in the short term. Key Resistance Level To Watch Despite the recent decline, technical indicators suggest a possible recovery. Market analyst Rose highlighted that Pi Coin is currently consolidating and testing a key Fibonacci retracement level. If it breaks above $2, a bullish reversal could be in play. The first resistance levels to watch are between $2 and $2.60. If Pi Coin manages to break above this range, it could move toward $3.00 and eventually $3.60. However, for this to happen, strong buying momentum will be needed. As of now Pi coin price is hovering around $1.4 refelcing a drop of 10% seen in the last 24 hours with its market cap hitting around $10 billion.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-10 10:08:12

Rolling out after receiving the mandatory MiCA license, BBVA’s new trading service, available by its mobile application, will allow users to buy, sell, and manage other Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) transactions by it. Notably, the trading service launch for these two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap comes as BBVA wraps up its year-long regulatory formalities with Spain’s financial regulator, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV). The move signals the growing demand for digital assets among traditional banking customers and underscores BBVA’s commitment to integrating innovative financial solutions. BBVA’s Entry into Crypto Trading BBVA has been exploring blockchain and digital asset solutions for several years, with its Swiss arm, BBVA Switzerland, launching Bitcoin trading and custody services in 2021. And now the bank’s latest initiative will extend these offerings to a broader client base in Spain, allowing customers to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin and Ethereum through BBVA’s digital banking platform. BBVA’s crypto trading services are expected to be integrated within its existing mobile banking app, enabling seamless access for retail and institutional investors. Users will be able to manage both traditional and digital assets within a single interface, streamlining the process of portfolio diversification. Regulatory Race for MiCA Permit BBVA’s move comes amid a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in Spain and across the European Union. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, set to take effect in 2024, aims to establish a comprehensive framework for digital assets, ensuring greater transparency, consumer protection, and institutional oversight. By offering crypto trading services, BBVA is positioning itself as a compliant and regulated bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. The bank will implement stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, ensuring adherence to European financial regulations. Additionally, BBVA’s crypto services will not initially include decentralized finance (DeFi) products or staking mechanisms, focusing instead on basic trading and custody solutions. However, the bank has indicated that it may explore additional crypto-related services depending on customer demand and regulatory developments. Impact on Spain’s Crypto Market BBVA’s entry into cryptocurrency trading is expected to have a significant impact on Spain’s digital asset landscape. While Spanish banks have traditionally maintained a cautious approach to crypto, BBVA’s decision could encourage other financial institutions to explore similar offerings. The move also reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, with major banks worldwide—including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank—actively developing digital asset services. BBVA’s involvement could bolster confidence in the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, potentially attracting a new wave of retail and institutional investors in Spain. Crypto industry experts believe that BBVA’s decision could accelerate Spain’s adoption of blockchain-based financial services. What’s Next for Spanish Customers? BBVA has hinted at potential future expansions in its crypto services, including the addition of more digital assets, tokenized securities, and blockchain-based financial products. The bank is also reportedly exploring partnerships with fintech and crypto firms to enhance its digital asset infrastructure. In the long term, BBVA’s involvement in crypto could pave the way for broader blockchain adoption across Spain’s financial ecosystem. As regulatory clarity improves and customer interest grows, the integration of digital assets into traditional banking could become a defining trend in the industry. Thus, BBVA’s decision to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of traditional finance and the digital economy. By providing customers with regulated access to cryptocurrencies, BBVA is positioning itself as a forward-thinking financial institution that embraces innovation. As Spain’s crypto market evolves, BBVA’s leadership in the space could set a precedent for other banks looking to enter the digital asset sector.
