Whale Transactions Signal BlockDAG’s Unprecedented Growth & a Shift in Layer-1 Networks,https://thecoinrise.com/over-201m-raised-whale-transactions-signal-blockdags-unprecedented-growth-a-shift-in-layer-1-networks/,"The current landscape of digital currencies shows notable shifts. Bitcoin’s price experiences regular changes, causing liquidations and strategic moves by large financial entities. Regular individuals now seek clear direction. One project, BlockDAG (BDAG), draws attention as its presale surpasses $201 million, indicating strong interest. BlockDAG offers a different approach to network structures. It uses a parallel system for processing transactions, low fees, and a $30 million fund to encourage use. With upcoming listings on exchanges, people try to acquire BDAG at its presale price. BlockDAG’s technology is a key factor. The BlockDAG structure allows for simultaneous transaction handling. This removes slowdowns found in other networks. This feature is important for decentralized finance, non-fungible items, and high-speed trading. Why BlockDAG Attracts Attention Now Many seek stable assets in a changing market. Those who acquired BDAG early see a 2,380% increase in value. The opportunity remains available. Here is why the BlockDAG project is considered a strong digital asset option for 2025: $201 Million Presale and Ten Exchange Listings BlockDAG’s presale raised over $201 million. 18.7 billion BDAG units sold at $0.0248 each in batch 27. Demand remains high as ten major exchanges plan to list BDAG. These listings could increase BDAG’s value after its launch. The BlockDAG project has seen strong support. Parallel Processing For Better Scale Unlike other networks that slow down with high usage, BlockDAG uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for parallel processing. This improves speed. This makes it suitable for many uses, including decentralized finance and non-fungible items. The BlockDAG technology is designed for efficiency. March 2025 Test Network Launch BlockDAG’s test network will be available in March 2025. This is a step towards the main network. The test network includes: Rewards for those who help run the network early. Tools to watch the network’s performance. Testing for decentralized finance applications. Successful tests will increase confidence in BlockDAG. This could lead to higher presale prices. $30 Million Support Program A healthy community is important for any network. BlockDAG allocates $30 million for developers. Support ranges from $10,000 to $100,000. It supports: Web3 development. Decentralized finance applications. Non-fungible item markets. Business network solutions. BlockDAG also works with HackerEarth to bring developers through events. This helps the network grow. The BlockDAG team wants to encourage development. Large Entity Interest and Accumulation Large financial entities acquire BDAG. They see the potential of BlockDAG’s technology. This mirrors the early phases of other successful projects. These entities recognize the network’s design and upcoming listings. The BlockDAG presale sees large purchases. Could BDAG Reach $1 After Launch? With its current path, BlockDAG could see a price increase after exchange listings. Experts think BDAG could follow a pattern seen with other networks, possibly reaching $1. Factors that could drive this include: Exchange listings: This increases access and demand. Low initial value: This helps with price growth. Network growth: Support programs and events to help with use. Large entity purchases: They see the network’s advantages. The Presale Opportunity Nears Its End Those interested in BDAG should act quickly. Presale prices increase over time. Once exchange listings begin, prices will change. With over $201 million raised, a new network model, and a plan with key events, BlockDAG is more than a presale. It represents a change. The BlockDAG project shows a new direction. Will you acquire BDAG at presale prices or watch as it rises towards $1?

CZ says pitching tents with credible projects is a better investment strategy in the long term for investors in the space.# A Fortune Is Spent Investing In Shady Projects, Says Binance Founder CZ has taken swipes at “degen” activity in cryptocurrency circles following a string of high-profile rug pools. According to the Binance founder, investors are sinking in massive fortunes to clutch at quick rewards in the ecosystem. The Binance founder disclosed on X (formerly Twitter) that investors rarely recoup their funds in the pursuit of quick gains. Degens typically invest in low-cap tokens and memecoins, aping into leveraged positions without proper research. CZ advises investors to turn their gaze to “ethical teams” building projects for long-term growth, rather than short-term hype. Investors chasing trends and hype have lost a fortune in rug pulls, liquidity drains, and exit scams. The US SEC has disclosed that memecoins are not securities , urging investors to be wary of speculative investment in the asset class. “In crypto, too much money is spent chasing small, quick gains,” said CZ. “Focus on ethical teams that build for the long term. Big money is built slowly with stamina.” While the Binance founder did not expressly mention credible crypto projects, his comments allude to teams with established members and communities building projects with real utility. CZ Offers Suggestions on Tokenomics For Crypto Projects The Binance founder has offered suggestions for crypto project tokenomics designed to reduce rug pulls. According to CZ’s plan, only 10% of tokens will be unlocked while the remaining tokens will require the fulfillment of strict conditions before an unlock. Under the proposal, issuers will unlock new tokens after every six months with only 5% of tokens allowed to be unlocked. CZ’s tokenomics plan will rely on smart contracts to control the vesting schedule and third parties to hold the keys. CZ has since rolled out support for victims of BROCCOLI and TST memecoin crashes, raising over $1 million in cryptocurrencies. The Binance founder says that AI projects can leverage L1 and L2 blockchains to achieve efficiency and decentralization objectives.

However, only a handful of digital assets can deliver astronomical returns. For investors looking for the top crypto coins to invest in, three contenders stand out: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Celestia (TIA), and Terra Classic (LUNC). These projects cater to different market segments, offering varying levels of innovation, narrative, and investment potential. Whether it’s a meme coin revolutionizing storytelling, a blockchain redefining scalability, or a revived ecosystem driven by its community, each project presents an exciting prospect for investors in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Legendary Crypto Expedition Deep within the frozen tundras, where myths blur with reality, Arctic Pablo embarks on a journey that defies imagination. The fearless explorer ventures into uncharted territories, unearthing mystical $APC coins—tokens infused with the magic of forgotten lands. But this isn’t just a fantasy; it’s an investment opportunity. Unlike traditional meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin redefines the game by merging adventure, scarcity, and financial potential. Each presale phase corresponds to a new location, making investors feel on an exhilarating journey alongside Pablo. Arctic Pablo has arrived at ChillVille, the 13th stop in this epic expedition, where $APC is available at just $0.000070. With over $1.78 million already raised and a launch price of $0.008, early investors stand to gain an incredible 11,285.71% ROI. For instance, a $100 investment today would get 1,428,127 APCs, ballooning to $11,425.02 once Arctic Pablo reaches its final destination. But that’s not all—staking opportunities with a 66% APY ensure holders can multiply their tokens while awaiting the journey’s culmination. With a robust token burn mechanism, Arctic Pablo Coin continuously increases in scarcity, driving long-term value. Any unsold tokens are burned weekly during the presale, and all remaining supply will be incinerated post-launch. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), $APC accepts BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, SOL, and BNB, making it accessible to many investors. As Arctic Pablo continues his legendary voyage, investors can claim their own piece of the adventure. The question is: Are you ready to join the top crypto coins to invest before it’s too late? Celestia: The Future of Modular Blockchain Technology While Arctic Pablo Coin turns heads with its immersive storytelling, Celestia (TIA) is making waves in the blockchain world with its groundbreaking modular architecture. Unlike traditional monolithic blockchains, Celestia separates the consensus and data availability layers, allowing developers to build scalable and flexible blockchains without compromising security. Investors looking for the top crypto coins to invest in should keep an eye on Celestia, as it’s at the forefront of blockchain evolution. With partnerships growing and adoption increasing, TIA’s potential for explosive growth is undeniable. Celestia is positioned as a scalability, security, and efficiency leader as blockchain infrastructure expands. Terra Classic: The Community-Driven Comeback Story Terra Classic (LUNC) proves that a strong community can revive even the most battered projects. Once an empire in the stablecoin industry, Terra’s ecosystem suffered a catastrophic collapse. However, rather than fading into obscurity, LUNC has been reborn as a decentralized, community-driven network determined to restore its former glory. Recent improvements have strengthened Terra Classic’s transaction speeds, security, and utility, again making it a viable competitor in the DeFi space. With developers continuing to innovate and expand its ecosystem, LUNC is steadily climbing back up the ranks of crypto’s most resilient assets. For investors willing to bet on the power of community-driven projects, LUNC remains a solid contender. Its resurgence underscores the importance of decentralization, adaptability, and collective governance in shaping the future of blockchain. Conclusion: The Next Big Crypto Investments Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Celestia, and Terra Classic stand out as some of the top crypto coins to invest in 2025. Each offers distinct advantages, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) combines high ROI, narrative-driven investment, and a 66% APY staking program, making it the perfect choice for meme coin enthusiasts seeking substantial gains. Celestia (TIA) spearheads the modular blockchain revolution, providing the foundation for scalable, secure, high-performance blockchain applications.

The platform even confiscated proceeds from the market maker to compensate affected users of $GPS and $SHELL. Binance will reveal its compensation plan in the coming days According to Binance, it’s prepared to act against market makers that fail to comply with its policies, which became very clear with the latest incident. One of Binance’s market makers, a single market-making entity for the $GPS token, was found coincidingly participating in $SHELL’s market activities, violating the exchange’s policies. Thus, the crypto exchange quickly offboarded the market maker and even permanently banned any future market participation. Additionally, the exchange confiscated all the funds the market maker received from its non-compliant activities, saying that they would use the proceeds to pay back affected token $GPS and $SHELL token holders. However, the exchange has yet to disclose how all affected users will be properly compensated. Nevertheless, it said that it would release its compensation plan in the next few days, detailing eligibility criteria, distribution mechanisms and timelines. A Binance representative commented on the matter, saying, “Protecting our users and maintaining a fair trading environment remain our top priorities. This incident underscores our proactive approach to identifying and addressing misconduct, and we will continue to enhance our monitoring systems to prevent future breaches.” Binance even insisted that all its project market makers needed to comply with its rules, including providing bids and asks in tandem with the market size of each security, maintaining a stable spread for market activity as well as preventing market disruption from high-frequency order placement and cancellations. Binance revealed a new mechanism for listing and delisting despite GPS troubles at the time On Friday, the crypto exchange announced new listing and delisting rules, which included putting the entire process up for community vote. The exchange explained that users with more than 0.01 BNB will now be allowed to ‘Vote to List’ or ‘Vote to Delist’ the exchange’s tokens. However, the platform still reserves the right to choose the tokens being voted on. However, the GPS ecosystem was still under close observation at the time of the announcement. Just a few days after its listing, the GPS token was under the Monitoring tag, with the exchange concerned over its sudden price dips and what they thought to be intentional price manipulation. The exchange later discovered that a market maker caused the price drop when he quickly sold roughly 70 million tokens, siphoning about $5 million in liquidity from the market. The exchange even detailed that the market maker failed to place matching buy orders, thus contributing to losses for early traders. At the time, Binance only put the market maker’s account on hold.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has collected $2.5 million throughout its two-phased presale process which has managed to pull in more than 4,600 holders. The 75% adjustment level in Phase two indicates growing market demand because the token price will jump to $0.02 during its upcoming stage. Individuals who acquire Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens early during these presales will experience a 33% increase before the third phase begins while the tokens will list for $0.06 after the increase represents over 400% higher than the current value. Research analysts predict MUTM tokens will surpass $3.50 valuation by 2025 because of its distinct lending technology and built-in token distribution system. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum The second presale phase of MUTM by Mutuum Finance occurs at $0.015 price before the exchange listing phase starts with currently the lowest entry cost. Early contributors who participate in the presale will achieve a 400% profit once the project lists at $0.06 since this value has been incorporated into the tokenomics design. The urgency to invest in Mutuum Finance continues to grow since phase two shows almost full capacity and the project has already raised $2.5 million. The initial phase sold out at a rate which exceeded projections which demonstrated increasing market belief in the decentralized lending approach. Bringing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from conventional DeFi tokens becomes possible through its dual revenue structure. MUTM platform fees create an automatic system to repurchase MUTM tokens that distribute them to users with long-term stake positions. The flourishing demand cycle driven by this mechanism works to reduce temporary sales activities in addition to generating repetitive revenues that resemble established blue-chip protocols. The $100,000 presale giveaway for participants has elevated investor interest since ten investors will receive $10,000 each which simultaneously strengthens engagement with holders. Real-World Utility Driving Forecasts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its investment value based on concrete financial services operations rather than relying on meme coins or speculative assets. The platform allows users to put ETH or DAI cryptocurrencies as deposits which generates interest-bearing mtTokens. The tokens increase in value during periods of accumulation and users can utilize them both for swapping and DeFi transactions on different platforms. This fusion of liquidity and passive income enables users to benefit. Users applying for loans secure their transactions by providing assets comparable to the loan amount thus the system reduces default risk and maintains stability. Users will gain enhanced functionality through the forthcoming peer-to-peer lending tools that let them conduct swaps involving Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a flexible platform within an industry which many 때 criticizes for absent real-world use. The project implements an Overcollateralized stablecoin development alongside its ecosystem growth efforts which aim to establish itself against established platforms like Aave and Compound. Price Trajectory and Strategic Positioning Market analysts identify Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token distribution policies as the key factor behind its ongoing expansion. Liquidity incentives with staking rewards receive almost 40% of available tokens to maintain continuous user participation. Another 20% supports partnerships and exchange listings, critical for maintaining post-launch stability. Meme coins base their value solely on hype although MUTM provides investors with tangible plans instead of unproven expectations. The current market forecasts project MUTM tokens to hit $3.50 by 2025 thus creating a 23,233% boost in value from the initial presale cost. The platform’s revenue-sharing system generates these projections because token demand represents an initiating factor that correspond with user participation levels. People who purchase $2,500 worth of MUTM today would receive $60,000 when the price reaches $0.06 after the initial launch and could earn even greater returns because of growing adoption rates. The period to buy tokens at cheap rates is running out for investors. Phase 2 will soon reach its 75% completion mark as the platform shows similar frenetic behavior like phase 1 preceding the next price increase.

Web3Bay’s $1.6M Presale Takes Over the Crypto Spotlight!,https://thecoinrise.com/is-cardano-out-web3bays-1-6m-presale-takes-over-the-crypto-spotlight/,"Once a stalwart in the altcoin community, Cardano (ADA) has seen a marked decline in investor enthusiasm as its efforts to reach previous peaks falter. Amidst uncertain market conditions, ADA’s performance has been lackluster, prompting traders to seek out more promising opportunities elsewhere. In contrast, Web3Bay (3BAY) presale is attracting significant attention, drawing investors who are keen on securing growth opportunities slated for 2025. Having already amassed over $1.6 million, Web3Bay is establishing itself as a more stable and profitable investment compared to faltering options like Cardano. Challenges for Cardano as Investor Confidence Wanes Throughout 2025, ADA’s market behavior has not inspired investor confidence, with its current trading price pegged at $0.7405. The token has experienced a slight dip of 1.35% in the last day and a more notable 2.85% drop over the week. Looking at the past month, ADA’s minimal gain of 1.86% does little to alleviate concerns, especially given its 22.55% and 25.87% falls over the past three and six months, respectively. Despite a significant market cap of $27.82 billion, ADA is struggling to keep pace with newer, more agile blockchains, particularly in the rapidly expanding DeFi sector, where it has notably lagged in adoption and investor interest. Why Investors Are Drifting from Cardano to Web3Bay As Cardano flounders, many are redirecting their investments toward the burgeoning presale of Web3Bay, which has swiftly exceeded the $1.6 million mark. But why this shift? DeFi Hurdles for Cardano vs. Practical Applications of Web3Bay Cardano’s slow embrace of DeFi contrasts sharply with Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain, which have quickly capitalized on this sector. Cardano’s transaction volumes remain low, and adoption is sluggish. Conversely, Web3Bay is poised to disrupt the trillion-dollar e-commerce market by addressing issues like steep transaction fees, transparency, and data control. Web3Bay’s practical applications provide a solid basis for sustained growth, unlike ADA’s reliance on market speculations. Predictable Returns with Web3Bay Versus ADA’s Market Volatility Web3Bay’s structured presale model offers early investors low entry prices before its official launch, setting the stage for substantial future gains. This approach presents a more predictable growth path compared to the volatile swings of Cardano, which is heavily influenced by broader market sentiments. A More Secure Option in Unstable Times With ongoing instability in Bitcoin and broader markets, investors are increasingly allocating their capital to presale tokens like Web3Bay. These investments are less affected by immediate market volatility, providing a safer bet during downturns. This strategy is a key factor in the growing appeal of Web3Bay’s presale, even as ADA faces challenges in attracting new investment. Web3Bay’s Presale: A Prime Investment Prospect Despite general market volatility, Web3Bay’s successful presale, which has raised over $1.6 million and sold over 400 million tokens, highlights the shift towards assets with robust long-term prospects, as opposed to speculative bets like ADA. Web3Bay’s model, which leverages real-world applications for robust early-stage growth, distinguishes it from the challenges ADA faces with adoption and investor demand. Which Crypto Is Worth Your Investment? The struggles of Cardano in both price and innovation within the DeFi space have left many investors disillusioned, prompting them to explore superior alternatives. Web3Bay’s thriving presale represents a compelling investment choice, demonstrating the significant advantages of early-stage projects with tangible utility in the current market cycle. As Web3Bay continues its presale phase, investors are presented with a fleeting chance to participate at the most advantageous prices before the next uptick. The critical question now is whether you will capitalize on this opportunity or let it pass by.

This new development has ignited some reflection as both brothers ponder how they moved from intense regulatory scrutiny involving Gemini to where they are currently. Crypto Czar Engage Winklevoss Brothers Speaking on the matter, Crypto czar David Sacks acknowledged an earlier statement made by Cameron Winklevoss. “I think you said something earlier that I thought was really profound,” Sacks said. “You said that a year ago, you thought it would be more likely that you’d end up in jail than at the White House.” At first, Cameron clarified that Tyler made the statement. Then, he pointed out how they were surprised at how everything turned out with Gemini Earn. In his opinion, an attack was the last thing they expected from doing “the right thing for so many years and always trying to raise the bar with respect to regulations.” SEC Sues Gemini For Earn Program The Winklevoss brothers’ cryptocurrency exchange was under intense scrutiny a few years ago. It had to do with their Earn Program, which ordinarily allowed users to earn interest on their assets. All they had to do was lend the crypto assets to Genesis Global Capital, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG). However, the program turned negative when FTX imploded in 2022, and Gemini Earn users could not access their funds. It got worse when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued both Gemini and Genesis, citing that the Gemini Earn was an unregistered offering of securities. This allegedly violated securities laws. Amidst this, the Winklevoss twins had a fallout with Barry Silbert, the CEO of DCG. Where is Gemini Now? On the progress of the Gemini Earn Program, the crypto exchange has paid out $50 million settlement to compensate the investors. The resolution, announced by the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office, ensured the fund’s recovery. Moving beyond the lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny, the Winklevoss brothers took a significant step toward going public. The company confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) and enlisted financial giants Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to guide the process.

Institutional investors are offloading ETH, increasing downside risks. Ethereum Price Dives Below $2,000 as US NFP Tilts Markets Bearish Ethereum (ETH) experienced significant losses over the weekend as the highly anticipated White House Summit failed to lift market sentiment. Instead, the latest US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report dominated investor outlook, highlighting rising unemployment and increasing inflation pressures. As a result, ETH price tumbled below the psychological $2,000 level, trading as low as $1,998 on Binance on March 9, marking an 8% daily decline. The drop exceeded Bitcoin’s 4% losses within the same timeframe, signaling stronger bearish momentum within ETH spot markets. Ethereum Price Action The selling pressure has been exacerbated by mounting fears of further Federal Reserve tightening in response to rising inflation metrics. With investors now eyeing the next Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, ETH price could struggle to gain meaningful traction unless macroeconomic conditions shift favorably. BlackRock ETF Led Outflows with $11 Million Sell-off After US NFP Data Amid rising unemployment and inflation triggers, institutional investors are reallocating capital away from crypto markets toward fixed-income securities, driving bond yields higher across global markets. This shift in investor sentiment has translated into substantial outflows from Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock Spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF Flows, March 2025 | Source: SosoValue According to on-chain analytics provider SosoValue , Ethereum ETFs recorded $23 million in outflows on Friday, the same day the US NFP report was released. Among the largest liquidations, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF saw an $11 million capital flight, the highest single-day outflow among Ethereum-focused funds. The rapid outflows in Ethereum ETFs suggest that institutional investors are repositioning their portfolios in anticipation of further downside in crypto markets. If Ethereum ETF outflows continue into the coming week, ETH price could struggle to mount a sustained recovery. Ethereum Price Forecast: Death Cross Pattern Signals Deeper Decline Toward $1,850 Ethereum price forecast signals have taken a decisive bearish turn, with ETH plunging 8.3% on March 9 to test support near $2,000. The daily chart reveals a concerning technical setup, as ETH struggles below key moving averages, with a confirmed Death Cross between short-term EMAs signaling prolonged downside risks. If Ethereum closes below the critical $2,000 level, selling pressure could accelerate, targeting the next major support at $1,850, where historical demand has previously stabilized declines. Ethereum Price Forecast | ETHUSD The Bollinger Bands show ETH trading at the lower band, suggesting it is in oversold territory. However, the absence of a significant bullish reaction underscores weak buying momentum. The MACD histogram remains in deep negative territory, with its signal line widening against the MACD line—affirming that bearish momentum is strengthening rather than reversing. While a relief bounce cannot be ruled out, any recovery toward $2,250 or $2,433 would likely face intense resistance as sidelined sellers look to re-enter. The heightened leverage in derivatives markets could amplify price swings. If ETH loses $2,000 decisively, long liquidations may accelerate a cascade effect, making $1,850 the next crucial test for bulls. Conversely, a close above $2,200 could shift sentiment toward a bullish retracement. Ethereum Price Outlook: Key Levels to Watch This Week For Ethereum to break its bearish grip, ETF inflows must show signs of stabilization, particularly from major asset managers like BlackRock. If institutional demand returns, ETH could attempt to reclaim the $2,100 level and challenge the $2,250 resistance zone. On the flip side, if macroeconomic headwinds persist and ETF outflows accelerate, Ethereum risks dropping below $1,950, potentially testing lower support at $1,850. With US CPI data and Federal Reserve commentary on the horizon, traders should remain cautious, as Ethereum’s price action could see heightened volatility in response to broader market shifts. Overall, Ethereum remains vulnerable to further downside unless it reclaims key resistance levels and sees a resurgence in institutional demand.

The announcement was made following President Donald Trump’s White House Crypto Summit on March 7. “FIFA is very, very interested in developing a FIFA coin to do it from here, from America, and to conquer the 5 billion football fans in the world,” Infantino said. “If there is anyone here who wants to cooperate with FIFA, we are here with the United States and we will conquer the world of football with the FIFA coin.” While specific details or timelines regarding the potential FIFA token remain unclear, Infantino’s statements suggest the organization is exploring blockchain technology as a means of fan engagement and revenue generation. Related News: Analytics Company Shares Critical Level That Must Be Maintained To Avoid Aggressive Bitcoin Decline US President Donald Trump, who hosted the summit, responded enthusiastically to Infantino's statement. “This coin could end up being more valuable than FIFA. It could actually be a pretty big coin,” he said.

This article explores three coins with strong fundamentals that are poised for a significant rebound once this decline ends. Stay tuned to discover which digital assets are set to surge and make the most of this rare chance. Ethereum Faces Downturn Amid Bearish Pressures Ethereum saw a decline in its prices over the past month with a drop of nearly 19%. Over the last six months, the fall was around 8%, reflecting a steady bearish sentiment. The price volatility is evident as it has fluctuated within a range from approximately $1,766 to $3,021. The market has experienced a mix of pressures and minor recoveries, illustrating the coin’s sensitivity to broader trends and news. Indicators such as momentum and oscillator readings have been in negative territory, reinforcing the downward movement. Current levels present significant technical challenges with support around $1,294 and immediate resistance near $3,804. Bulls appear to be scarce with the RSI reading below 40 and negative momentum indicators, suggesting that bears control the market right now. Traders might consider strategies within these levels, watching closely for any sign of a reversal before testing the next resistance near $5,058. Jupiter’s Bearish Momentum and Key Levels in Play Jupiter has shown notable declines with a one-week drop of 26.40%, a one-month fall of 32.87%, and a six-month decrease of 24.54%. The performance over these periods highlights ongoing bearish pressure, indicating that the market has been challenged to regain strength recently. The coin currently trades between $0.57 and $1.01, with support at $0.38 and resistance at $1.26, nearing a second resistance at $1.71. Bearish indicators such as negative momentum and a low RSI of 33.44 suggest that sellers still dominate. A potential trading approach could involve seeking entries near the support level while monitoring the resistance for any breakout signals. Celestia Price Trends Ahead of Altcoin Season Last month showed a modest rally with a 13.63% increase, while the six-month outlook recorded a 22.09% drop. Price action over these periods reflects fluctuations that have tested investor sentiment and demonstrated recovery followed by noticeable corrections. Current trading sees Celestia oscillating between a price range of $2.83 and $4.89, with the nearest resistance at $5.71 and clear support identified at $1.57. The absence of a strong trend, along with bearish momentum indicated by the negative Awesome Oscillator and moving average recommendations, suggests cautious trading. Traders may consider buying on dips and targeting resistance while monitoring for potential directional shifts. Conclusion ETH , JUP , and TIA show great promise for growth. ETH, with its new updates, is attracting more developers. JUP’s unique features make it stand out. TIA’s innovation and tech advancements are impressive. As the market stabilizes, these coins are likely to gain significant value. Investors watching these assets may find rewarding opportunities ahead.

With thousands of digital assets out there, only a handful manage to capture attention and redefine what blockchain can do truly. While some projects fade into obscurity, others cement themselves as indispensable assets in the digital economy. So, which projects are making waves right now? One name that keeps showing up is Qubetics , the world’s first Web3 aggregator, currently leading one of the top crypto presales of the year. Alongside industry giants like Binance and Algorand, it’s proving that crypto isn’t just a passing trend—it’s a full-fledged alternative to traditional investments. Let’s break down how these projects have established themselves and why their momentum isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Qubetics: The Top Crypto Presale That’s Turning Heads Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, is transforming asset ownership by enabling interoperability in blockchain refers to the seamless exchange and utilization of assets, data, and functionalities across different networks without restrictions. With the top crypto presale already raising over $14.8 million, Qubetics has been gaining traction fast. Currently, in Stage 24, the presale price of $TICS tokens is currently $0.0976, with over 497 million tokens sold and 22,600+ holders already in. It’s solving a problem that most crypto buyers face—fragmentation. Right now, managing assets across multiple blockchains is a nightmare. Imagine having Bitcoin on one chain, Ethereum-based NFTs on another, and stablecoins locked in DeFi protocols. Switching between them is time-consuming, costly, and inefficient. Qubetics changes that with interoperability, meaning assets from different blockchains can be managed seamlessly in one place. Businesses can finally run cross-chain transactions without friction, professionals can manage crypto assets without hopping between wallets, and everyday users can trade effortlessly. Whether sending money across networks, bridging NFTs, or using DeFi tools across chains, Qubetics makes life easier. With price projections soaring—analysts eyeing $TICS at $0.25 by presale’s end (156% ROI), $1 post-presale (924% ROI), and $15 after mainnet launch (15,256% ROI)—the top crypto presale of the year isn’t just talk. It’s setting up to be a major player in the blockchain industry. Binance: The Undisputed Crypto Powerhouse Binance stands as one of the most influential entities in the cryptocurrency industry, recognized for both its market dominance and its adaptability in an evolving regulatory landscape. As one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, it has consistently catered to the growing demand for digital asset investments, offering a comprehensive suite of services, including spot trading, futures, staking, and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Beyond its trading functionalities, Binance has positioned itself as a cornerstone of blockchain innovation by supporting a vast array of crypto projects, providing staking incentives, and bridging the gap between decentralized and traditional finance. Its ability to navigate regulatory challenges while maintaining a strong presence in the market underscores its resilience and strategic foresight. Algorand: The Blockchain for Real-World Solutions Unlike many other crypto projects, Algorand has always been focused on bridging the gap between blockchain technology and real-world utility. Its pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) model offers high-speed transactions with minimal energy consumption, making it a favorite for projects that prioritize sustainability. Algorand has been gaining traction in sectors like digital identity, asset tokenization, and cross-border payments. Governments and institutions have taken note, with Algorand being chosen for major projects, including central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives. For those looking for a blockchain that can handle real-world applications with efficiency, Algorand continues to prove its worth. Final Thoughts: Why These Cryptos Are Worth Watching From Qubetics’ top crypto presale solving cross-chain issues to Binance’s market dominance and Algorand’s real-world adoption, these projects are solidifying their positions in the crypto world. While traditional investments still hold value, the rapid growth and innovation in blockchain technology make these digital assets impossible to ignore. For those keeping an eye on emerging projects, Qubetics’ presale isn’t just another crypto launch—it’s an evolution in blockchain interoperability. With a growing number of backers and analysts forecasting huge potential upside, missing out might not be an option. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics’ presale gaining so much attention? Qubetics’ top crypto presale is attracting buyers due to its unique interoperability features, making it easier to manage assets across multiple blockchains. How does Qubetics’ interoperability benefit users? Instead of juggling multiple wallets and networks, Qubetics allows users to seamlessly interact across different blockchains. Whether transferring tokens, staking, or trading, the process is faster, cheaper, and hassle-free. What makes Binance and Algorand stand out in the crypto world? Binance dominates as the largest crypto exchange, offering a vast ecosystem of trading, DeFi, and blockchain services.

At just past 7:00 pm ET, bitcoin had slumped to exactly $80,000, down 7% over the past 24 hours. The world's largest crypto did manage the most modest of bounces from there, trading at $80,700 at press time. Ether (ETH), solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) were lower by similar amounts, while cardano (ADA) and dogecoin (DOGE) had plunged closer to 12%. ""There could be a little disruption,"" said U.S. President Donald Trump in a Fox News appearance on Sunday when asked about the impact of his tariff and budget-cutting policies. ""If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective … we go by quarters,"" he continued. ""What we’re doing is building a foundation for the future."" Trump's comments were dubbed ""Volckering"" by some on social media — a reference to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Shortly after being appointed to the position by Jimmy Carter in 1979, Volcker moved to break the back of a decade-long inflation by jacking up short term rates to unheard of levels, knowing that by doing so, the U.S. would surely have to experience a brutal recession. By the time Volcker had finished tightening policy roughly 18 months later, the Fed funds rate had hit 20% and the economy indeed had gone through a difficult contraction. Inflation, however, was broken and the stage was set for growth throughout most of the following decade. In early Sunday evening action, U.S. stock index futures were lower by about 0.85% across the board.",Markets|Bitcoin|Breaking News,EN,0,0,BTC|ADA|DOGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-09 23:20:56
41403861,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689949,1741562652,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41403861.jpeg,"CZ criticizes short-term greed in crypto, urges focus on ethical, long-term growth",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cz-criticizes-short-term-greed-in-crypto/,"Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has criticized the short-term crypto investment culture, in which investors are driven by greed to accumulate wealth in short-term projects at the expense of ethical long-term projects. On his X page , CZ wrote, “Unpopular opinion: In crypto, too much money is spent chasing small, quick gains. Focus on ethical teams that build for the long term. Big money is built slowly with stamina.” CZ remarks point to the speculative nature of altcoins, which are not sustainable due to their instability and risk of market manipulation Chasing short-term gains harms crypto’s stability Cryptocurrency has historically been synonymous with making a fortune in a single night, and investors are attracted to it because it promises to make them wealthy quickly. CZ’s worries reflect a larger problem for the sector—the unpredictability of speculative assets. Excessive hype of projects by short-term traders also enables low-quality projects and mispricing of assets. However, when speculative bubbles burst, that can lead to market crashes, and investors are left holding the bag. In addition, the search for quick returns stifles actual blockchain innovation since purely concentrating on project hype provides zero solutions. This short-termism results in many promising projects never being able to realize their actual potential, hurting the credibility of the industry. The crypto landscape continues to evolve at a fast pace, and we have much to learn about the virtues of patience and the need for slow-burn development. To some, this industry’s tried-and-tested projects include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. These projects have withstood the test of time by sticking true to their fundamental missions and ensuring that they only focus on developments that make steady and meaningful progress. No wonder Bitcoin, the so-called digital gold, remains the first and the leading crypto game in town based on the nature of decentralization and the secured path network. This seems against the rampant market speculation, with institutional investors viewing Bitcoin as an increasingly certain store of value. Ethereum is also accepting long-term development. It moved on to Ethereum 2.0, which has a proof-of-stake model which increases the blockchain’s scalability and sustainability. Unlike others, however, Cardano was built on peer-reviewed research, meaning the team is focused on making gradual changes and improvements to the protocol instead of rushing headlong into radical improvements, some of which have the potential to compromise security and transparency. The future of success in crypto will have much less to do with price pumps and much more to do with building a unique society. Having a dependable society is more secure for investors as it results in a more sustainable long-term market. Investors supporting such initiatives can help construct the industry of the future, one sourced from technology rather than speculation. CZ’s message is a good reminder that crypto investing isn’t just about getting rich in the short term but creating sustainable returns — by keeping the key pillars of this industry, discipline, patience, and ethics, at the forefront of its daily operations. Short-term thinking risks undermining crypto’s future Long-term investment strategies have their virtues, but most investors cannot resist the volatility of crypto. The wild swings of digital currencies reveal the craving for quick profits, so speculative trading is one option for cashing in on price or market action. Almost every action with such advantages as high risk is characterized by tremendous market spin, scams, scrutiny from authorities, and emotional burnout. Most traders lose tremendously, even in a short-term trick. There are many scams and rug pulls, too, with some new projects providing “give-it-to-you” numbers to new investors and crashing when early investors do lockups. This destroys market confidence and affects mainstream adoption the most. In addition, states and regulatory authorities are currently facing this contemporary issue of speculative trading and have thus already legislated against such practices to combat market manipulation and protect the interests of retail traders. These incidents are symptomatic of the dangers of pursuing short-term growth at the cost of long-term sustainability. Today, the arguments over short- and long-term investment strategies lie at the heart of all crypto activity as the market matures. CZ’s perspective is “off the deep end,” and it advocates a beaten-down order of crypto investment. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Per a release from Japan’s top regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) , and a news report from the Japanese media outlet CoinPost , the government has approved a Cabinet decision to amend the Payment Services Act. Relaxed Rules for Crypto Brokerages, Stablecoin Issuers Tokyo has sent a bill to finalize the amendments to the National Diet. The Diet is all but certain to vote in favor of the amendments in the coming days. Japan proposes crypto tax cuts (55% 20%) and ETF approval under new reforms, aiming to become a global crypto hub. #Crypto #Japan https://t.co/9a6cw4LgFG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 6, 2025 In its history, the Japanese parliament has never voted against any crypto-related legal change approved by the Cabinet. And the Cabinet, in turn, has never rejected a legal change proposed by the FSA, which has something of a carte blanche when it comes to Japanese crypto regulatory matters. The bill will allow crypto companies to operate as “intermediary businesses.” That means that brokers will no longer need to apply for the same kind of permits that crypto exchanges and crypto wallet operators use. The bill also allows stablecoin issuers to enjoy more flexibility when it comes to the type of assets they can use to back their coins. Currently, Japanese firms need to match the amount of tokens they have in circulation 1:1 with cash deposits in regulated bank accounts. @FirstDigitalHQ announces a partnership with @Ledger Enterprise Tradelink to enable institutions to leverage $FDUSD for off-exchange settlements. #Stablecoin #Ledger https://t.co/XJe0IeER8W — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 7, 2025 The amendments will instead allow firms to use assets like certain Japanese and US government bonds instead. However, not all bonds will be eligible: The bill stipulates that only certain types of bonds can be used, including bonds with a remaining maturity of three months or less. Stablecoin issuers can also hold funds in fixed-term, high-interest bond accounts “that allow early cancellation.” Issuers will only be allowed to use bonds to back their coins by a maximum of 50%. The remainder will need to be held in current accounts.

This, CoinPost wrote, will “lower the barrier to entry.” To qualify for these new licensees, brokerages will have to prove that they do not directly handle any of their clients’ funds. Media reports claim that some of Japan’s biggest (and most crypto-keen) businesses are already eyeing brokerage operations. These include Mercari, SBI Securities, and Monex Securities.

Meme coins are among such assets. On-chain data from the blockchain analytics platform Dune reveals that meme tokens created using the Solana-based meme coins generator Pump.fun have declined to lows from September 2024. As of this writing, the total tokens launched on the meme token generator have dropped below 12,000. Pump.fun Tokens Down Since its debut in January 2024, Pump.fun has become a go-to platform to create meme coins on the Solana blockchain. This is mainly because the platform allows users to deploy meme tokens with minimal or zero programming language knowledge and technical expertise in creating and managing a cryptocurrency. According to Dune, the meme coin generator has birthed hundreds of thousands of meme tokens in just over a year. Pump.fun saw its peak number of created tokens in a single day on January 23rd when over 71,700 meme coins were launched. Notably, Pump.fun aided the creation of viral meme coins like TRUMP. Although TRUMP made waves shortly after its debut, it failed to garner attention weeks later. An earlier report shed light on how low the Trump-themed meme token has gone, dropping from being the second-largest meme coin by market cap ranking to a cataclysmic 82% decline from its all-time high. This unsustained long-term growth and other legal issues facing Pump.fun and its tokens have likely triggered users to refrain from using the platform. After the sudden mid-February crash of the Solana-based meme coin LIBRA tied to the Argentine president Javier Milei, Pump.fun saw reduced engagement in fees, users, and tokens generated. Way Back Up? It remains uncertain how Pump.fun will garner the attention and user engagement it once had. Still, crypto experts believe meme coin projects with sustainable utilities will weather the ongoing bearish trend. These utilities/use cases can include incorporating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized applications (dApps), artificial intelligence (AI) tools, etc., into their ecosystem.

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s value struggled throughout February, enduring significant downturns. On February 27, the cryptocurrency dropped steeply, falling below $78,000 for the first time in more than three months. Analysis of on-chain data suggests that the decrease was largely driven by sell-offs from “Bitcoin tourists”—newcomers to the trading scene. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $85,999 Market cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating supply 19,719,062 All-time high $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $86,224 24-hour low $85,783 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $85,999 Price Prediction $ 123,720 (46.23%) Fear & Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 4.86% Green Days 12/30 (40%) 50-Day SMA $ 98,051 200-Day SMA $ 82,082 14-Day RSI 25.03 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows a consolidation around $86K.

BTC Price Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $85,091, beginning a bearish trend to $81,008. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin uptoday? Following the overall buying sentiment, BTC price faced a buying demand and surged toward the high of $88K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs faced $275.83 million in net outflows on Feb. 27, 2025, pushing the week’s total net outflows to $2.71 billion. Bitcoin price prediction March 2025 February was the reddest month for Bitcoin since June 2022, when the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s performance was -37.28%. According to crypto data provider Santiment, Bitcoin whales and sharks have dumped ~6,813 coins since last week, which is the largest drop since last July. Will the BTC price recover in March 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $89,000 and be pushed further, at least $95,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $72,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction March 2025 $72,000 $89,000 $95,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October.

May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K.

BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum capture much of the attention, several lower-priced digital assets are making considerable progress and could experience substantial growth in 2025. Some of the best crypto projects to observe are still priced under $1 and are gaining traction due to key developments such as upgrades, partnerships, and increasing community support. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are among the top digital assets demonstrating strong potential to rise next year. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) The successful presale of BlockDAG (BDAG) has positioned this new project as one of the best crypto projects to monitor, appealing to those seeking an affordable digital asset. With a current price of $0.0248 in its current Batch 27, BDAG is gaining significant traction, raising over $201 million while distributing 18.7 billion coins. The BDAG price has jumped 2380% across its presale, and analysts predict a $1 valuation for this year. Those who participated in Batch 1 have seen a 2,380% return, highlighting the coin’s steady climb in value. Currently, in Batch 27, BDAG offers a 400% bonus on all BDAG purchases using the code BDAG800 . Its structured pricing model has consistently drawn attention, as each batch has marked an increase, rewarding early participants. With affordability and consistent growth, BDAG continues to be a digital asset under $1 worth considering, particularly for those tracking potential breakout assets. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) In early 2025, Grayscale introduced the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, providing institutional participants with an easier method to engage with DOGE. Frankenmuth Credit Union has expanded its services by adding Dogecoin, allowing customers to buy, sell, and manage it through online banking. Bitwise Asset Management has applied for a Dogecoin ETF with the U.S. SEC, aiming to simplify DOGE accessibility. At present, Dogecoin trades around $0.2057. Analyst Alon Mask sees $0.20 as a key support level and $0.315 as resistance, with potential for a breakout toward $1. 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at around $0.6507 and continues to be a strong player in the blockchain sector. Known for its research-driven development and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, Cardano is built for scalability and energy efficiency. Ongoing advancements in smart contracts and increasing adoption suggest steady long-term growth. With a dedicated development team and a large, engaged community, ADA remains one of the top digital assets to watch in 2025. Rising interest from major entities and its expanding real-world applications indicate a potential value increase soon. Cardano is often included in lists of the best crypto projects due to its strong tech. 4. Stellar (XLM) Stellar is gaining attention for its role in simplifying cross-border transactions and making money transfers faster and more affordable. Its network is widely used for remittances and financial services. XLM, priced at $0.343 with a 0.0295% increase, has shown resilience despite market fluctuations. Recognized as one of the best crypto projects to watch, Stellar continues to grow with support from banks and fintech firms. As demand for blockchain payments increases, its adoption could expand. With clearer regulations and institutional interest, XLM may see further gains, strengthening its position in global finance. Wrapping Up These four digital assets show strong growth potential, standing as key digital assets to watch in 2025 for those seeking accessible entry into the digital currency market without high costs. Dogecoin (DOGE) is aiming for a push toward $1 with growing institutional support. Cardano (ADA) remains strong with its advanced blockchain technology and rising adoption. Stellar (XLM) is expanding its role in cross-border payments, gaining traction in the financial sector. BlockDAG (BDAG), with its structured growth and accessible pricing, is gaining attention as a high-potential digital asset predicted to reach $1 this year. Unlike other coins facing market volatility, BDAG is set to see consistent growth in its presale and beyond—especially with analysts predicting a jump to $1 this year. Those who understand the market closely recognize these as the best crypto projects available today.

41405091,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689957,1741564920,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41405091.jpeg,Bitcoin crashes to $80k as Ether tumbles below $2k. How low can prices get?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-crashes-80k-ether-tumbles-below-2k/,"Bitcoin just collapsed to $80,000, wiping out over $200 billion from the crypto market in one of the worst single-day crashes over the past year, according to data from CoinGecko. Ether also crashed , tumbling below $2,000 to trade at $1,992, a level we haven’t seen in over six months. The sudden sell-off came after Donald Trump signed an Executive Order on Thursday, officially launching the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve—a decision you’d expect would boost prices, not tank them. Source: Jai Hamid/TradingView Friday’s White House Crypto Summit was set to be the big event, but Trump threw a curveball by announcing the reserve ahead of schedule. Traders were betting on a bullish rally, but instead, Bitcoin dropped from $90,000 to $85,000 within minutes of the announcement. The market reaction was brutal, with options traders unwinding long positions, volatility spiking, and put contracts gaining demand as traders scrambled to hedge against deeper downsides, per data from Coinglass. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve triggers sell-off instead of rally The Executive Order confirms the US government’s plan to stockpile Bitcoin, but there’s a catch—there’s no new funding for purchases yet. The initial reserves will be built using Bitcoin seized from criminal or civil asset forfeitures, which means no immediate demand pressure. Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, and Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, have been given the job of figuring out “budget-neutral” ways to add more Bitcoin to the reserve without costing taxpayers a dime. That wasn’t what traders wanted to hear. The market was looking for aggressive government buying, not just a relabeling of old holdings. With no sign of new demand, the sell-off gained momentum. As trading company QCP explained in its Friday Telegram note, risk reversals in the crypto market flipped, meaning traders started pricing in more downside risk than upside potential, which only made the crash worse. Recession fears and US debt crisis fuel the fire Meanwhile, the broader economic picture is looking worse by the day, and traders are bracing for a recession. The US is staring at a $9.2 trillion debt refinancing problem in 2025, with most of that debt maturing between January and June. The government needs lower interest rates—badly. The easiest way to get them? A recession. Over the last two months, the 10-year Treasury yield has dropped by 60 basis points, a sign that markets are pricing in economic trouble. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been working hard at spending cuts with a target of $2 trillion, but those guys aren’t working fast enough to fix the debt problem. President Donald Trump has been pushing for lower oil prices to fight inflation, even calling on OPEC to drop prices. But the fastest way to kill inflation? A recession that crushes demand. That’s why traders are keeping a close eye on the Atlanta Fed, which recently slashed its Q1 2025 GDP growth estimate to -2.8%, according to an analysis from The Kobeissi Letter. Markets have been expecting the Federal Reserve to cut rates at some point during the first half of 2025, but inflation keeps getting in the way. Source: Adam Kobeissi X/Twitter US consumer expectations for inflation just jumped to 6.0% over the next 12 months, the highest since May 2023. That’s the third straight month of rising inflation expectations—a problem for rate-cut hopes. Trump doesn’t even care about the stock market anymore. As Cryptopolitan reported on March 6, he said, “I’m not watching the market,” though during his first term, he was obsessed with it. That’s not just an offhand comment—it’s a message. Wall Street is on its own. Bitcoin braces for $75K as liquidation risks increase With Bitcoin now at $80,000, traders are already looking at the next danger zone—and it’s ugly. According to Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, things could get a lot worse before they get better. “An ugly start to the week. Looks like BTC will retest $78K. If it fails, $75K is next in the crosshairs. There are a lot of options open interest at $70K-$75K, and if we get into that range, it will be violent,” Arthur warned in a post on X. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data shows that Bitcoin exchange reserves are dropping rapidly, which means there is a potential supply shock—but right now, that doesn’t matter. When the market is in freefall, supply-side fundamentals take a backseat to sheer panic selling. But while most traders are running for the exits, President Nayib Bukele is buying the dip. El Salvador, which has been steadily accumulating Bitcoin, bought 5 more BTC today—up from its usual 1 BTC daily purchase. Only thing that’s gonna save these markets now is a rate cut, and the only way we’re gonna get that is through a recession. Buckle up, folks.

Based on thousands of simulated price paths, the forecast offers a range of possible outcomes that illuminate both potential gains and risks. According to the Results, Bitcoin Could Drop Below $51,000 with a 5% Chance According to MarktQuant, the simulation used a starting Bitcoin price of $82,655.52. The results show an average final price of $258,445.24 According to MarktQuant, the simulation used a starting Bitcoin price of $82,655.52. The results show an average final price of $258,445.24 ve bu da önemli bir potansiyel artışa işaret ediyor. Bununla birlikte, sonuç aralığı geniş olup, 5’lik yüzdelik dilim sonuç 51.430,23 dolara kadar olası bir düşüş öngörürken, 95’lik yüzdelik dilim sonuç Bitcoin’in 712.118,81 dolara kadar ulaştığını gösteriyor.

Amidst the complex signals from Ethereum (ETH) whale activity and the impressive 208% weekly surge of the Story (IP) Token, the market is a hotbed of activity. While Ethereum’s upcoming “Pectra” upgrade promises enhanced smart contract capabilities and Story Protocol’s strategic partnerships fuel the rise of its IP token, a newcomer is positioning itself as a top crypto to buy. Web3Bay (3BAY) is carving a niche with its innovative zero-fee e-commerce model, catching the eye of early investors with its presale, setting them on a path towards potentially game-changing gains in 2025. The allure of the 3BAY token’s affordable presale price offers significant financial advantages that are increasingly hard to overlook. Web3Bay: A Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 In the midst of Ethereum (ETH) whale activity’s cautionary tale and the robust ascent of the Story (IP) Token, Web3Bay is forging a promising path forward. The ongoing momentum of its presale is notable, with the 3BAY token already attracting $1.6 million through the sale of over 400 million tokens. The anticipated launch price of $0.1959 hints at a potential 3890% gain, presenting a substantial opportunity for swift movers. The zero-fee e-commerce marketplace that Web3Bay offers extends beyond just an enticing presale. By cutting out middlemen, it ensures a direct buyer-to-seller connection, enhancing transparency and reducing costs. Early backers of the 3BAY token can also enjoy a 5% discount on purchases, adding an extra layer of incentive. As Ethereum refines its upgrades and Story Protocol leverages its new partnerships, Web3Bay’s practical perks and clear financial benefits position it as a top crypto to buy in 2025. With plans for staking rewards, a shift towards DAO governance, and an upcoming NFT marketplace, Web3Bay is laying the groundwork for a comprehensive ecosystem. The limited-time presale price and the growing excitement surrounding the project suggest significant advantages for early participants. It’s this blend of immediate practical benefits, growth potential, and early entry perks that distinguishes Web3Bay in the bustling market. Ethereum (ETH) Whale Activity Suggests Market Watchfulness Ethereum is trading at $2,348.60, with current dynamics reflecting a cautious market stance. Significant Ethereum (ETH) whale transactions have led to $94.27 million existing spot ETFs, underscoring a wary attitude among major investors. This, combined with a 20% reduction in futures open interest, suggests a broader market retreat, impacting Ethereum’s price negatively. Despite this cautious market sentiment, Ethereum’s “Pectra” upgrade illustrates its enduring robustness. Operational on the Holesky testnet since February 24, 2025, it features 11 major improvements, such as EIP-7702, which enhances smart contract capabilities for wallets. Although initial tests have seen some hurdles, the forthcoming March 5, 2025, test on the Sepolia testnet is set to continue Ethereum’s steady developmental journey. Story (IP) Token Thrives Despite Market Downturn While Ethereum (ETH) whale activity indicates caution, Story (IP) Token emerges as a beacon of market defiance, surging 208% in the past week to $6.64. The growth of Story Protocol is driven by smart strategic moves, including collaborations with StabilityAI and acquiring rights through its Aria Protocol to BTS’s track “The Truth Untold.” Launched on February 13, 2025, its mainnet introduced innovative mechanisms for creators to tokenize and monetize their intellectual property effectively. While Ethereum grapples with its Pectra upgrade challenges, Story (IP) Token’s robust performance offers an attractive alternative, showing that strategic timing and smart partnerships can lead to substantial market gains. This dynamic underlines the importance of selecting the right crypto assets in a fluctuating market. In Summary Ethereum (ETH) whale activity may be signaling caution, while Story (IP) Token demonstrates growth through effective partnerships, but Web3Bay offers something uniquely compelling—a solid chance for substantial financial returns. With the 3BAY token priced at just $0.00524 and a potential launch price of $0.1959, early investors are well-positioned for a 3890% return. Web3Bay’s zero-fee marketplace, coupled with its strategic roadmap including staking rewards, DAO transition, and NFT integration, establishes it as a top crypto to buy in 2025 . Those who seize this opportunity now could be paving their way towards a significant financial transformation. In a market presenting mixed signals, Web3Bay’s distinct potential provides a clear and strategic choice for those aiming to maximize this year’s crypto opportunities.

The meme coin market has produced some of the most insane returns in crypto history, and right now, the three best new meme coins to invest in today are catching fire: BTFD Coin (BTFD) , Brett (BRETT), and SPX6900 (SPX). With new investors pouring into the market and meme coins outperforming traditional assets, the opportunity to jump in before prices explode is here. But while Brett and SPX6900 are solidifying their places as top-tier meme tokens, BTFD Coin is in its final presale stretch, offering investors a chance at a staggering 3650% ROI. The Bulls Squad is rallying, and those who move now will be locking in what could be the most lucrative play of 2025. Let’s explore the best new meme coins to invest in today. BTFD Coin – Bulls Squad Leads the Charge to a 3650% ROI Moonshot The final countdown has begun on one of the best new meme coins to invest in today, and those who get in on BTFD Coin’s presale at just $0.00016 are staring at the kind of return most traders only dream of. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement built around seizing market dips and turning them into generational wealth. More than 71 billion BTFD tokens have already been sold to over 11,300 investors, with a total of $6.27 million raised so far. BTFD’s Bulls Squad is leading the charge, proving that smart money doesn’t chase hype—it buys early, before the surge. The time to act is now because once this presale ends, the price will skyrocket to $0.0006, locking in an easy 275% gain for presale buyers before the $0.006 moon target potentially delivers that massive 3650% return. The Bulls Squad and Staking Rewards Joining the Bulls Squad isn’t just about buying tokens; it’s about maximizing returns. BTFD’s staking just went live at a 90% APY on December 2, meaning holders can compound their gains while waiting for the bull run. Unlike passive holding, staking ensures a continuous flow of rewards. Play-to-Earn Game – More Than Just a Token The BTFD P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, giving investors another way to earn while having fun. Play, win, and stack up BTFD tokens as you battle through levels, complete challenges, and boost your portfolio just by gaming. With in-game earnings seamlessly converted into real BTFD tokens, this project goes beyond the hype—it’s utility-driven, rewarding, and primed for mass adoption. Investment Breakdown – Why This Price Won’t Last At Stage 14, an investment of $1250 buys 7.81 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, that same investment is worth $4,687—an easy 275% gain. But when BTFD reaches its projected moon price of $0.006, that same $1250 investment turns into a massive $46,875. The opportunity is here with this best new meme coin to invest in today, but the presale is ending fast. Visit the BTFD presale site now, connect your wallet, and secure your tokens before prices surge! Brett (BRETT) – The People’s Meme Coin While BTFD is leading the presale race, Brett (BRETT) has carved its own path as a community-powered token. Launched as a spin-off from the Pepe ecosystem, Brett has cultivated a loyal following, making it one of the most discussed meme coins in 2025. Brett has seen whales accumulate massive holdings, pushing speculation that another leg up is on the horizon. It recently hit an all-time high of $2 billion in market cap, proving that meme coins are more than just a passing trend—they’re shaping up as serious investment plays. Whether it’s for speculation or community-driven growth, Brett continues to dominate the scene. SPX6900 (SPX) – The Unstoppable Meme Market Sensation SPX6900 is one of the most volatile yet exciting meme tokens in the game. Recently, its market cap soared past $570 million, fueled by its Coinbase listing and record-breaking trading volume. The appeal of SPX lies in its ability to tap into meme culture while offering serious liquidity and trading volume, something most meme coins struggle to maintain. As more investors shift toward meme coins with high speculation potential and exchange listings, SPX6900 remains a dominant force. Those who bet on it early have already seen incredible returns, making it one of the most talked-about meme tokens this year. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Before It’s Too Late If history has taught us anything, it’s that getting in early on high-potential meme coins is how life-changing returns are made. BTFD Coin is standing at the final presale stretch, and investors are rushing in before the price jumps.

Ordinals co-founder Casey Rodarmor noted that Bitcoin’s prestige and Solana’s speed could be the final nail in Ethereum’s coffin. Bitcoin and Solana Threaten Ethereum’s Rise While Ethereum’s recent decline has left investors in shock, the Ordinals co-founder Casey Rodarmor has proffered a theory for the asset. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Rodarmor disclosed that the duo of Bitcoin and Solana negatively affects Ethereum. Rodarmor says Bitcoin’s age and first-mover advantage gives it a keen advantage over Ethereum’s claim as “better money.” Conversely, Rodarmor says Solana is living up to its reputation as an ETH killer, improving on a range of metrics. “Ethereum is getting squeezed by Bitcoin and Solana,” said Rodarmor. “Ethereum has nowhere to go.” Rodarmor hinged Solana’s speed and scalability to its “centralization,” sparking a reaction from Solana cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko. Yakovenko downplayed Solana’s decentralization claims while pointing accusing fingers of centralization at Rodarmor. Bitcoin has enjoyed a streak of positives including the executive signing of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve while Solana is gearing up for a potential ETF approval. ETH Continues To Falter In Troubling Fashion Ethereum’s on-chain indicators are painting a sorry picture for the largest altcoin. After falling below $2,000, analysts say the possibility of ETH falling to $1,000 is highly likely. After losing over 6% over the day, the asset is trading at $2,045, triggering a resistance by investors to buy ETH. However, whales continue to scoop ETH at a discount while institutional interests inch forward. Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje attempted to rationalize Ethereum’s underperformance , citing a boatload of Layer 2 projects dumping the assets. For Cronje, a below-par user experience contributes to waning interest in Ethereum with rising competition from newer blockchains. Cronje shut down speculation that he could buy ETH, noting that the project’s roadmap and lack of clear representation are major stumbling blocks. “Hell, I don’t invest, but if I did, I would choose Solana, Tron, and XRP over ETH,” remarked Cronje.

The decentralized lending project has captured more than $2.5 million investment which attracted 4,600 token holders into its system that unites decentralized finance with tokenomic structures. Phase 2 has reached 75% completion and provides a shrinking opportunity for investors to buy tokens at the current market-low price which will quickly become important for immediate substantial ROI gains. Experts agree that the upcoming exchange listing will occur at $0.06 and this will generate instant 400% returns for investors. External forecasts indicate an astonishing rise of MUTM tokens to $3.50 during 2025 which spurs strategic investors to buy immediately. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has exceeded all initial market prediction levels because its presale program gives first adopters increased benefits. The opening phase reached its maximum capacity quickly and now during the present phase tokens cost $0.015. The approaching Phase 3 increase will double the existing pricing and makes unwillingness to participate increasingly perilous. New investors who join now will profit from the current $0.015 market value plus attain the future $0.06 per token price which represents a total four times better value than present pricing. The market experiences heightened pressure because of this multiple-level pricing system which adds a $100,000 worth of incentives for early investors. The current Phase 2 fundraise has brought in over $1.5 million while displaying a quickly rising level of investor agreement that failing to engage now will result in lost exceptional market possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers an appeal based on its buy-and-distribute model that allocates platform earnings for continuous perpetual token acquisitions. The mechanism of platform revenue purchase drives an ongoing support of mtToken stakers through continuous buying and caps potential selling activities. The protocol features integration between its lending features which let users stake ETH and DAI to obtain interest-bearing mtTokens. The collected value of these tokens grows steadily until they reach full value through passive operations that maintain decentralized assets while other tokens have no functional use. System stability emerges from borrowers who obtain loans through positions requiring more collateral than the requested amount which strengthens lender confidence. MUTM stands unique among DeFi assets because its combined earning potential and borrowing attributes create a valuable and scarce instrument. Post-Launch Trajectory Sparks Optimism The $0.06 initial listing price at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates immediate profitability opportunities but users already perceive MUTM as resembling established leaders in DeFi. The predictions for MUTM’s price growth to $3.50 in 2025 would generate a staggering 23,233% profit from its current presale value. Platform analysts base their overcollateralized stablecoin and peer-to-peer lending estimates on future MUTM platform development plans for niche assets and stablecoin releases. The value of MUTM depends on user growth and earned revenue since experts describe this presale foundation as “unusually robust” for projects at this development stage. The token builds credibility through stake rewards and adjustable interest rates and security audits and retains its path as a successor of established crypto projects by adopting transparent systems. Investors now have limited opportunity to take advantage of the Phase 2 pricing at $0.015. The time has arrived for investors to confirm their position ahead of the price increase since MUTM continues its upward trajectory. The official portal of Mutuum Finance currently awaits visitors who want to take part in the financing opportunity before upcoming market changes occur.

Currently, that standout is BlockDAG (BDAG) , which has accumulated $201 million across 27 presale batches, marking a 2,380% price increase from its initial batch. With rising scrutiny in the crypto space, security concerns often accompany new projects. BlockDAG is proactively addressing this by undergoing rigorous audits by two well-known firms—Halborn and Certik. But what sets BlockDAG apart, making analysts project a potential 30,000x ROI? Let’s dive in. Advancing Crypto with DAG and Hybrid PoW Technology BlockDAG brings a fresh approach to blockchain technology with its DAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchain structures, which process blocks in a linear sequence, DAG’s framework allows each block to link to multiple previous ones. This structure improves scalability by permitting multiple validators to add blocks simultaneously, enhancing the system’s efficiency. Another significant feature is BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. This method further boosts scalability by optimizing transaction validation. The system currently supports a speed of 10 blocks per second, with the capability to scale beyond 100 blocks per second in future updates. Halborn Audit Confirms BlockDAG’s Strong Security Framework BlockDAG is not just about speed and scalability—it places significant importance on security. To ensure the network’s resilience against threats, BlockDAG has implemented a layered security strategy. This began with an internal assessment, followed by a comprehensive review by two of the most recognized auditing firms, Halborn and Certik. Halborn was the first to conduct an extensive evaluation, focusing on BlockDAG’s smart contracts and infrastructure. Once the findings were reviewed, BlockDAG swiftly addressed any identified areas of improvement, strengthening its security. Halborn’s audit report is accessible to the public, reinforcing the project’s commitment to transparency. Following this, Certik was engaged to conduct a secondary audit, ensuring an even more rigorous assessment. While this process is ongoing, the additional evaluation further solidifies BlockDAG’s security measures. As the final step in its security initiative, BlockDAG plans to launch a bug bounty program in collaboration with HackerOne. Security is a continuous process, and BlockDAG remains committed to maintaining and improving its protective measures as it moves toward its mainnet launch this year. BlockDAG’s Presale Gains Momentum— Is 30,000x ROI Achievable? With its advanced technology and structured security measures, BlockDAG’s presale success is not by chance—it is a result of calculated planning and execution. Crypto buyers are capitalizing on the potential, rapidly acquiring BDAG coins. Over 18.6 billion coins have been sold, raising $201 million in presale. Currently, in its 27th batch, BlockDAG is priced at $0.0248. Those who purchased BDAG early in batch one have already witnessed a 2,380% return. Experts anticipate that once the mainnet launches this year, BDAG’s price could reach $1, reflecting strong confidence in the project. Given its current price momentum, extensive security framework, and exceptional scalability, the possibility of achieving a 30,000x ROI appears within reach. For those looking to accumulate a promising digital asset in 2025, BlockDAG presents a compelling opportunity. Long Story Short! BlockDAG is making strides in security and scalability, pushing the boundaries of what blockchain can achieve. With its ability to process 10 blocks per second and plans to scale beyond 100 blocks, it offers a powerful framework for long-term growth. Alongside its scalability, BlockDAG has placed security at the forefront, undergoing thorough evaluations from respected audit firms. Taking a proactive approach to vulnerability assessments ensures ongoing protection and reliability. Beyond technical achievements, BlockDAG’s crypto presale has drawn immense interest, reaching $201 million in sales. Analysts predict that once the mainnet goes live, BDAG could reach $1, setting the stage for long-term success. The potential for a 30,000x ROI remains an enticing possibility, making BlockDAG a project worth following closely before it gains mainstream traction.

Despite strong bullish factors over the past week, its recent price movement is far from the high expectations set by analysts following the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Bitcoin Drops Over 6% Bitcoin is currently trading at $80,909, down over 6% in the past day. Bitcoin has dropped 3.37% over the past week, with trading volumes down 53%. Despite the declining figures, Bitcoin whales are actively buying, accumulating more than 22,000 BTC in just three days. Whales have bought over 22,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/gVuFsijOqt — Ali (@ali_charts) March 9, 2025 Despite a week full of positive news, including the signing of an executive order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a Crypto Summit at the White House, and encouraging statements from the OCC, Bitcoin’s price is unexpectedly falling and could drop below $80K. The Out-of-sync Price Action! On March 7, President Trump signed an executive order to use seized Bitcoin rather than purchasing it from the market. This move caused Bitcoin’s price to drop over 6%, from $90,400 to $84,979. “The knee-jerk reaction lower likely stems from the realization that no actual budget has been allocated for BTC purchases in the near term,” QCP Capital shared in a recent note . However, it also noted that while this wasn’t the bullish catalyst as many expected, it’s still positive for crypto. The risk of random Silkroad BTC sales disrupting the market is gone, and the U.S. government has reaffirmed its commitment to a long-term crypto strategy, it noted. An analyst expressed surprise, saying that in his 8 years with Bitcoin, he never saw the price action so out of sync with the news. This week was one of the most bullish in Bitcoin’s history, yet the market is facing decline. What is Causing The Drop? Several factors are behind Bitcoin’s recent price drop. Macroeconomic issues, like new tariffs from the US, have sparked sell-offs in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Besides, the release of the non-farm payrolls (NFP) report on Friday suggests that the Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy, which could hurt Bitcoin’s price. Experts noted that while the executive order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the Crypto Summit were positive, the lack of concrete policies might have cooled investor enthusiasm. Besides, Bitcoin’s decline is also dragging altcoins down, with ETH, XRP, and BNB losing over 6%, 6% and 4% respectively in the last 24 hours.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-10 02:30:44

In the past 24 hours, the market downturn caused $616 million in liquidations, with long positions taking the biggest hit at $540 million. Bitcoin alone saw $231 million in losses. Trump Says There Might Be Some Disruption In his Fox News appearance on Sunday, President Donald Trump addressed the potential effects of his policies, including tariffs and budget cuts. When asked about the impact, he acknowledged that there could be some short-term disruptions but emphasized the long-term vision behind his approach. “There might be some disruption. China has a 100-year plan, while we focus on quarterly results. What we’re doing is laying the groundwork for the future,” he said. Trump’s Approach Compared To Former Fed Chair’s Trump’s comments were dubbed “Volckering” on social media, likening his approach to that of former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in the 1980s. Volcker raised interest rates to extreme levels to combat persistent inflation, fully aware that it would trigger harsh recession. His tough measures eventually broke inflation and set the stage for long-term economic growth. The comparison suggests that Trump’s policies, while disruptive now, could have long-term benefits. The recent decline in Bitcoin comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China are set to worsen on Monday, with Beijing imposing tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods in response to President Trump’s latest import hike.

David Sacks, appointed as 'Crypto & AI Czar,' divested from Bitwise's Crypto Index Fund to avoid conflicts of interest, fueling speculation about the government's crypto reserve plans. Despite initial speculation, the exact cryptocurrencies included in the reserve were Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple XRP, Solana, and Cardano, leading to mixed investment outcomes. The executive order restricts the government from significantly impacting the Bitcoin market and mandates budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional BTC. This has led to a let-down of expectations, which may fuel further short-term losses in the crypto market, but may be a positive in the long run. Introduction Over the last few months, politics have caused volatility to rise . This is especially true over the last two weeks. Much of this volatility has to do with the uncertainty around certain assets that were caught up in the 'Trump Trade,' or assets that were popular with now-President Trump on his campaign trail. Bitcoin was a large part of the Trump Trade. On the campaign trail, in late September 2024, Trump posted: X (Twitter) The world began to speculate on what cryptocurrencies would make the list for this kind of project, and who would decide its form. The Crypto Czar Skip to December 2024 with the appointment of David Sacks as 'Crypto & AI Czar,' or the lead advisor to the President on matters of cryptocurrencies and AI. Sacks is notable for a few things, like being one of the founders of PayPal ( PYPL ). Also notable is that since 2017, he has been running a venture capital firm called Craft Ventures. It, alongside Sacks himself, were first-round investors in Bitwise's Crypto Index Fund (BITW), (that I gave a sell rating to recently), which now trades on the OTC market. It is an actively managed fund diversified across several cryptocurrencies. Sacks and his firm invested in 2017 in this fund when it was a private vehicle. Craft Ventures and Sacks have both divested from the Bitwise fund since January 2025, presumably before President Trump was inaugurated, to avoid conflicts of interest. This fueled speculation that the government really would go through with a crypto reserve fund, and that Sacks was needing to divest from this exactly because he would be doing activities that would promote them in his new role as Crypto Czar. Craft Ventures Possible Inclusions Looking at Bitwise's fund, we can identify what assets Sacks may advise a crypto stockpile to invest in; we are effectively looking at what he was invested in with his own money. Here are all the holdings above 1% NAV in BITW. Bitwise Immediate suspects for a digital asset stockpile are Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Ripple XRP ( XRP-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), and Cardano ( ADA-USD ). These are not necessarily the top cryptocurrencies by market weight, for the record. I discuss that further in my article on BITW , but I won't go into any further for our purposes here. What's important to note from this is that speculators have been buying up these cryptocurrencies in advance of several key announcements post-inauguration that would boost these assets. The 1st Batch of Executive Orders Skip to January 2025, when President Trump is in office. He signs two executive orders, one creating a US Sovereign Wealth Fund ('SWF'), and another creating a committee to work on a 'digital asset stockpile.' In an article I published last month , I discussed the potential for a positive price impact on Bitcoin from this move, and other cryptocurrencies that are added to the stockpile. Specifically, I speculated: I wouldn't put it far off for a US-based SWF with this current administration to tangle itself up with [ this order ] and help with establishing said stockpile. The US already has significant Bitcoin reserves, which it has seized from criminals. While the US has already auctioned off and returned much of its reserves, the government still has over 100,000 BTC in its possession, which represents over $9B in assets. To make this more substantial as a strategic reserve, it would stand to reason that the government, either through the SWF or through the treasury directly, would buy Bitcoin. Since then, we've gotten more clarity on what digital assets would be included, dissipating much of the speculation surrounding Sacks and Bitwise. On March 2nd, President Trump posted about the exact currencies that would be in the reserve: Truth Social Since Sacks was confirmed in December, if you had picked up on the investment in BITW (I did not, for the record), the various cryptocurrencies have been mixed. This has been disappointing for investors. Data by YCharts It was interesting to see it play out, as President Trump's messages named the exact top five holdings of BITW. Yet, despite the spike from the initial rush after the post on March 2nd, the assets are still relatively depressed. The 2nd Batch of Executive Orders On March 6th, President Donald Trump signed a follow-up executive order to the order that established a Digital Asset Stockpile committee. It was now time for that committee to act. The order was titled: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE AND UNITED STATES DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE Here is what the order authorizes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to do: ...establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"" capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings... ...establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the ""United States Digital Asset Stockpile,"" capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings... ...develop strategies for acquiring additional Government BTC provided that such strategies are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers. However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. Immediately, I understand why all the hype is gone. The specific wording of the act essentially orders the Treasury Secretary to collect all the Bitcoin and other assets already owned by the US in its stockpiles of seized assets and rename it into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This explicitly does not authorize the purchase of any Bitcoin at all. It does do something, which is that it stops the sale of any more Bitcoin or other assets out of the US accounts, which were previously being auctioned. It should be of note that basically all financial assets seized by the government end up at auction, to allow the government to recoup some money from criminal activities that they seized the assets from. This order disallows future auctions of seized Bitcoin, leaving the government's approximately $9B stockpile stagnant. The order only authorizes the assets to come from particular channels; seizures and forfeiture. This is in no way is what the market expected. The initial narrative had been all about the US investing in cryptocurrencies, not necessarily just holding on to existing stores. This was a neutered version of what was expected, and has not corrected the downturn since the highs of late January. Digital Asset Summit Fast-forward to the most recent update, on March 7th, where President Trump was speaking at the White House Digital Asset Summit, put together by David Sacks, the Crypto & AI Czar. Not much of substance pertaining to the fund itself was mentioned, but here are some of the main points President Trump and his cabinet made at the address: The US government will stop all sales of crypto assets, in favor of holding them instead. This will be funded through the existing stockpile. The Treasury will work toward deregulating cryptocurrency more broadly. They are primarily concerned with stable coins. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will not be at the cost of taxpayers. None of this seemed particularly bullish for the price of the coins, and definitely not for the alt-coins mentioned earlier, like SOL and ADA. Ultimately, I see this as being bullish for cryptocurrency-based business more than anything. The biggest winner at the summit was not someone who spoke, but someone who was there: Brian Armstrong. He is the CEO of Coinbase ( COIN ), one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. He remarked : [Emerging regulatory clarity] is directly translating to economic growth in the U.S. For instance, Coinbase plans to hire about 1,000 employees in the U.S. this year as a result of this renewed growth. The more normalized crypto is within financial markets, and the easier it is to do business in crypto, the more money exchanges like COIN make. This may not impact the price of Bitcoin very much, which is largely dictated by speculation and less by fundamentals like how much traffic the network sees or how much money is tied up on exchanges. Conclusion Ultimately, it looks a little foolish in hindsight to have bet on the government, being as irresponsible as to speculate on cryptocurrencies through direct investments. Instead, the cryptocurrency market has fallen despite all the news and buzz around the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It seems that this wasn't the play, at least not in the short term, despite the positive backing from the new administration. For now, it seems like the best investment is to stay with Bitcoin alone or to invest in Bitcoin-adjacent companies like Coinbase, who will benefit from the new regulatory environment, and to ignore the noise from politics. While initially promising, the ideas that were presented on the campaign trail have not resulted in the paradigm shift that many investors were pricing in back in January. For this reason, I would not advise betting on the proposed alt-coins for the Digital Asset Stockpile. They are unlikely to see any market influence from this move by the government. It's now more clear from the latest developments that the administration is not coming to buy anything from the marketplace, and is not going to put any positive pressure on the cryptocurrency market. While the lack of US government auctions may be a positive for markets, since it reduces supply, it may not be enough to deeply influence the crypto market. These coins may continue to fall despite positive developments toward this project. Currently, I am getting my Bitcoin exposure through MAXI . I am still long Bitcoin, but I have limited my exposure and monitor it closely. I suggest investors do the same at the current moment.

Traders and investors are left jittering as even major-league altcoins Solana and XRP lost alarming values despite a ‘crypto stockpile’ and a strategic Bitcoin reserve announcement by Donald Trump last week. Crypto Market Today: Here’s Why Bitcoin & Major Altcoins Are Falling The global crypto market lost 4.83% over the past day, as indicated by a diminished market cap of $2.69 trillion. Further, liquidations in the past 24 hours totaled over $600 million, per Coinglass data , underscoring heat on prices. Analyst Ali Martinez revealed that over $1 billion in Bitcoin long positions have been liquidated recently, aligning with the market volatility. Source: Ali Charts, X On the other hand, the release of the non-farm payrolls (NFP) report on Friday hinted that a hawkish stance by the Feds could be on the horizon again. Coupled with the macro heat due to Trump’s tariff saga this month, these factors present risk assets with severe market pressure. BTC Price Brushes $80K Low BTC price dropped nearly 5% as of press time and exchanged hands at $82,033. The flagship coin hit an intraday bottom of $80,052.49 after falling from $86,146.15. The latest Coinglass data indicated that $237.60 million was liquidated in the Bitcoin market intraday. Nevertheless, the coin’s market dominance remained up by 0.03%, pointing towards a more volatile alts sector. ETH Price Reverses 6% ETH price lost nearly 6% in the past 24 hours and exchanged hands at $2,062. The coin bottomed and peaked at $1,991.19 and $2,194.89 intraday. Ethereum slips alongside $107.56 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. ETH’s market dominance rested at 9.2% today . XRP Price Falls 6% XRP price fell nearly 6% in the past 24 hours and exchanged hands at $2.18. The coin hit a low and a peak of $2.09 and $2.34 in the past 24 hours. Ripple’s coin recorded only $30.34 million worth of liquidations, despite which the price slumps. SOL Price Loses 8% SOL price lost nearly 8% value as of press time and closed in at $127.5. Its intraday bottom and peak were $124.38 and $139.73, respectively. Solana recorded $26.6 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours, with its price dipping in tandem with the broader trend. Meme Crypto Market Also Wanes Dogecoin (DOGE) price fell 10% in the past 24 hours and traded at $0.1718. Shiba Inu (SHIB) price cracked 4% and exchanged hands at $0.00001208. Pepe Coin (PEPE) and TRUMP crashed over 9% and are sitting at $0.000005960 and $10.97, respectively. Leading meme coins also sink in sync with the broader market trend. Top Gainers In Crypto Market Today Some tokens have defied the broader market trend to trade in the green zone today. These are: Story (IP) Price: $5.23 24-Hour Gains: +9% UNUS SED LEO (LEO) Price: $9.83 24-Hour Gains: +0.5% Top Losers In Crypto Market Today JasmyCoin (JASMY) Price: $0.01363 24-Hour Loss: -15% Injective (INJ) Price: $9.66 24-Hour Loss: -13% Render (RENDER) Price: $3.05 24-Hour Loss: -12% Overall, the current market action has pushed investors to stay cautious despite pro-crypto advancements in the U.S. However, some market experts sighed in relief as the U.S. government announced it wouldn’t sell the nearly 200,000 Bitcoins acquired by Silk Road and would include it in its reserve, negating mass sell-off concerns. On the other hand, whales continue to buy the dip, sparking contrary market speculations as a sustained volatile trend prevails despite broader crypto advancements.

Arctic Pablo Coin Offers a New Shot at 11,285% ROI",https://thecoinrise.com/did-you-miss-dogecoins-early-days-arctic-pablo-coin-offers-a-new-shot-at-11285-roi/,"The cryptocurrency world has seen its fair share of legendary success stories. One of the most famous is Dogecoin, which started as a joke but turned into a multi-billion-dollar digital asset. In its early days, Dogecoin was trading for mere fractions of a cent, and few believed it would ever gain real value. However, those who recognized its potential and invested early are now sitting on life-changing profits. But what about those who missed out? Fortunately, history has a way of repeating itself, and Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as a new opportunity among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now. Dogecoin’s Humble Beginnings and Astronomical Growth Back in 2013, Dogecoin entered the crypto market as a fun and lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. Its price was almost nonexistent at launch, trading for around $0.00026 per coin. Few investors took it seriously, but over time, Dogecoin built a massive community, securing a position among the top cryptocurrencies. Fast forward to 2021, and Dogecoin reached an all-time high of $0.73, creating millionaires out of early investors. A $100 investment in Dogecoin’s first days turned into more than $280,000 at its peak. Missed out on that explosive growth? That same level of opportunity is rare but not impossible to find. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin is proving to be an emerging powerhouse among Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, with an even more structured and calculated approach to building wealth for early investors. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Meme Coin With Unparalleled ROI Potential Unlike traditional meme coin presales, Arctic Pablo Coin is introducing a fresh and unique approach. Instead of staged price increases, its presale moves by locations, marking its journey across different destinations. Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin is at ChillVille, with a presale price of just $0.000070. With over $1.78 million raised, it’s clear that investors are flocking to what could be the next crypto sensation. Here’s where things get exciting: At launch, Arctic Pablo Coin will hit the market at $0.008. That’s an insane 11,285.71% ROI potential for those getting in at this stage. Imagine turning a small investment into something massive—just like Dogecoin’s earliest believers did. As one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about the hype. It integrates powerful tokenomics, a smart burning mechanism to sustain long-term value, and community-driven growth that builds a solid foundation for sustained expansion. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out Among the Best Meme Coins of 2025 Presale Without Stages: Unlike traditional presales that rely on static rounds, Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey-based model keeps engagement high and prices fair. Massive Growth Potential: Early investors are positioned to see jaw-dropping gains, similar to Dogecoin’s early adopters. Community-Driven Approach: The Arctic Pablo Coin movement is rapidly gaining traction as investors recognize its long-term potential. Burning Mechanism: A structured token burn ensures deflationary pressure, keeping supply in check and boosting long-term value. This is the kind of project that could define the future of meme coin investments, making it one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now before it reaches mass adoption. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let This Be Another Missed Opportunity Dogecoin’s early days were an incredible wealth-building opportunity, but not everyone recognized its potential in time. The same scenario is playing out now with Arctic Pablo Coin, and those who get in at ChillVille could be the next big winners. With a launch price of $0.008 and the potential for over 11,285% returns, the chance to invest early is slipping away fast. Crypto history rewards those who act, not those who hesitate. Arctic Pablo Coin is paving the way for a new wave of meme coin success, and its ongoing presale is the gateway to massive future gains. Investors looking for the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now should not overlook this.

Bitcoin has dropped by 4.8% to $81,729 , while Ethereum has taken an even bigger hit, falling 8% to hover around $2,000. Dogecoin is the biggest loser among the top 10 cryptos , sliding 13% to $0.16. Despite the hype around Trump’s Executive Order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , the market hasn’t responded positively. QCP Analysts believe this is because no actual budget has been allocated yet for Bitcoin purchases, causing uncertainty among investors. $334 Million Liquidation Shakes the Market With the changing current scenario, the market downturn has triggered massive liquidations, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP leading the sell-off. In the last 24 hours, liquidations have surpassed $334 million, affecting over 109,704 traders. Those who bet on price increases have taken the biggest hit. Crypto Market Sees $614.63M in Liquidations Amid Volatility In the past 24 hours, the crypto market experienced significant turbulence, with a total of $614.63M in liquidations, according to the latest Liquidation Heatmap data. pic.twitter.com/1ujSpwVgPb — AZCoin News (@azcoinnews) March 10, 2025 Bitcoin saw $186.35 million in liquidations, with long traders losing $123.21 million. Ethereum followed with $40.84 million in total liquidations, while XRP recorded a smaller $7.3 million in losses. Altcoins like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Sui (SUI), and Litecoin (LTC) also faced significant sell-offs, adding to the market’s instability. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Struggle Bitcoin has dropped by 3% in the past 24 hours, now trading at $86,409. Despite a 1.9% increase in the last week, the overall sentiment remains weak, with trading volume down by 24.63%. Ethereum has struggled to hold key support levels, currently battling to stay above $2,000. Analyst Ali Martinez has warned that if ETH drops below $2,114, it could test $1,250 in the coming weeks. XRP is also under pressure, down 7.31% in the last 24 hours to $2.36. The uncertainty surrounding the crypto reserve plan has only fueled further volatility. Crypto Reserve Plan Faces Pushback Trump’s proposal to include ADA, XRP, and SOL in the U.S. Strategic Reserve has faced resistance. Industry leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Real Vision’s Raoul Pal, believe Bitcoin should remain the primary reserve asset. Armstrong argued that Bitcoin is the clearest successor to gold, while Pal suggested a market-cap-weighted index instead of altcoin inclusion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : VanEck Proposes 6 Ways for U.S. to Buy Bitcoin Without Taxpayer Money , What’s brewing? Meanwhile, the U.S. government’s latest crypto disclosures reveal that it holds no SOL, ADA, or XRP, contradicting previous speculation. Following Trump’s Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Crypto Czar David Sacks clarified that while a digital asset stockpile will be created, it will only include assets obtained through forfeiture, with no new acquisitions. Onchain data confirms the government’s possession of 198,000 BTC but provides no evidence of ADA, XRP, or SOL holdings. Meanwhile, the government’s existing crypto reserves include 60,850 ETH ($122.96M), 122M USDT, and 40,293 BNB ($22.34M), among others. If liquidated, these assets could net around 5,004 BTC. Sacks hinted at reallocating some digital assets into Bitcoin for portfolio optimization, reinforcing the administration’s Bitcoin-focused strategy. With skepticism growing, the crypto reserve plan may struggle to gain traction, adding to market turbulence. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Celestia (TIA) and Injective (INJ) are encountering formidable resistance levels, creating a sense of uncertainty among investors. While traders pore over price charts, another pivotal issue emerges: the erosion of trust in online reviews. Web3Bay is addressing this critical problem head-on by utilizing blockchain technology to authenticate reviews, ensuring that only actual purchasers can post feedback. As Celestia and Injective strive to overcome technical obstacles, Web3Bay is focused on a mission just as vital—rebuilding trust in online shopping with a system that’s both transparent and verifiable. Celestia (TIA) Confronts a Crucial Resistance at $3.80 Celestia (TIA) is facing a recurring challenge to breach the resistance level at $3.80, with several attempts falling short of sustaining gains above this critical point. This resistance struggle indicates mounting selling pressure, potentially heralding a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency. If Celestia fails to secure a position above $3.80 convincingly, pessimistic sentiment could intensify, possibly leading to further price drops. Conversely, overcoming this threshold with substantial market support and volume might ignite a bullish trend, propelling prices upwards. Investors and traders are vigilantly monitoring Celestia’s price movements, watching key technical indicators like moving averages and the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and considering broader market influences such as Bitcoin’s performance and the general sentiment in the altcoin space. Given the unpredictable nature of its price trajectory, participants are encouraged to maintain caution and adhere to sound risk management practices in their investment decisions. Injective (INJ) Encounters a Stubborn Barrier at $16.30 Injective (INJ) has found it challenging to exceed the resistance zone between $15.909 and $16.30, repeatedly failing to push past $16.40 since early February. Despite these challenges, market analyst AMCrypto Alex points out that current technical indicators hint at a forthcoming breakout above this resistance. Currently trading at about $15.41, INJ’s repeated rejections at this level have shaped a pattern that, if surmounted, might signify a reversal of the recent downtrend. The overall positive market sentiment, supported by Injective’s robust fundamentals, suggests that bullish momentum could be rekindled. Moreover, the emergence of a falling wedge pattern, typically a bullish signal, enhances the likelihood of upward movement. Investors are advised to stay attentive to these developments, as a successful breach of the $16.30 resistance could lead to substantial gains. Web3Bay Reinvents Online Shopping with Blockchain-Verified Reviews The online shopping world has long grappled with the issue of fake reviews, often posted by bots or incentivized users rather than genuine customers. Web3Bay is tackling this challenge by implementing a blockchain-based review system that allows only verified purchasers to contribute feedback. This innovation not only combats review manipulation but also offers consumers reliable insights to inform their purchasing decisions. For businesses, this model offers a chance to establish credibility through genuine customer experiences, steering clear of artificial ratings or deceptive reviews. This paradigm shift also protects consumers from being misled by inflated product hype, fostering transparency across e-commerce platforms. As Web3Bay’s presale progresses, with over 400 million coins sold and $1.60 million raised, the interest in transparent online shopping continues to escalate. Web3Bay’s decentralized approach is poised to redefine the standards of trust in product ratings. Summing Up! As Celestia (TIA) and Injective (INJ) navigate through their respective resistance levels, investors are left evaluating potential market directions—breakouts or corrections. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is pioneering a crucial solution to a non-speculative problem—authenticating online reviews. Just as crypto traders seek confirmations for their strategies, online shoppers now benefit from a mechanism ensuring trust in product evaluations. Whether in the volatile spheres of financial markets or e-commerce, the importance of transparency remains paramount. While Celestia and Injective aim to surpass market barriers, Web3Bay is simplifying online shopping decisions by making reviews trustworthy and dependable.

However, as its price prediction for 2025 hovers around $5, analysts are questioning whether Pi Network (PI) can maintain its momentum, or if new competitors, like Coldware (COLD), will steal the show. Coldware (COLD): The Emerging Competitor Despite the success of Pi Network (PI), new competitors are entering the market, and Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a formidable rival. With its Layer 1 DePIN blockchain, Coldware (COLD) is offering solutions that are not only scalable but also provide real-world use cases. While Pi Network (PI) remains speculative and community-driven, Coldware (COLD) is carving a niche in the DeFi space, attracting whales and institutional investors. The real utility of Coldware (COLD) makes it a more appealing option for those seeking long-term investments. Coldware (COLD) is gaining traction as a secure and scalable alternative to speculative meme coins, positioning itself as a serious contender in the cryptocurrency market. Pi Network (PI): From Mobile Mining to Market Domination? When Pi Network (PI) first launched, it was met with skepticism. A mobile mining app that allowed users to mine coins using their smartphones seemed too good to be true. However, over the past few years, Pi Network (PI) has proven its resilience, expanding its user base and increasing its market capitalization significantly. Currently, Pi Network (PI) is trading at around $2 per coin, having surged recently after its listing on exchanges. The hype surrounding Pi Network (PI) is largely driven by its massive community and the anticipation of its mainnet launch. Analysts predict that the price of Pi Coin could hit $5 by 2025, driven by growing market interest and the eventual introduction of real-world utility. Pi Network (PI) and Coldware (COLD): A Battle for Dominance As Pi Network (PI) continues to rise in popularity, it faces increasing competition from Coldware (COLD). While Pi Network (PI) has the advantage of a massive user base, it must prove its real-world utility and scalability if it is to maintain its momentum. In contrast, Coldware (COLD) is focusing on providing tangible value with its DeFi ecosystem and Layer 1 blockchain, which could make it a strong contender for market leadership. Conclusion: Will Pi Network (PI) Maintain the Hype? As Pi Network (PI) continues to rise in value and reputation, analysts are divided on whether it will be able to sustain its success. While Coldware (COLD) presents a serious challenge, Pi Network (PI) has the potential to reach new heights, especially if it can successfully implement real-world applications and further expand its community. However, the competition is fierce, and Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a favorite among whales and institutional investors looking for long-term growth.

If history has taught us anything, it’s that early investors in meme coins often see ridiculous gains. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is proving that point being the top meme coin presale to buy right now, throwing out a massive 100% bonus on its presale. But here’s the kicker—it’s only available for a limited time. Meanwhile, AI16Z and SNEK have already cemented themselves as powerhouses in the meme coin ecosystem. They’ve held strong during market cycles, proving their staying power. But let’s be real—nothing gets the crypto crowd hyped quite like a high-reward presale, and BTFD Coin is delivering just that being the top meme coin presale to buy now. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin Movement That’s Rewarding Early Believers Forget waiting for dips—BTFD Coin is handing you the best entry point on a silver platter. The project is currently in its 14th presale stage, with over 71 billion BTFD coins sold to more than 11,300 holders. That’s $6.27 million raised and counting! If you act fast on this top meme coin presale to buy now, you can grab BTFD at just $0.00016 per coin before it jumps to $0.0006 at the end of the presale, promising a 275% ROI without the bonus—or an insane 550% ROI if you use the LAUNCH100 bonus code. And speaking of that 100% Bonus, here’s how it works: Buy BTFD tokens now, enter “LAUNCH100” at checkout, and DOUBLE the tokens. That means a $2,500 investment turns into $5,000 worth of BTFD instantly. At $0.0006 per coin post-presale, that $2,500 investment would be worth $9,375, and that’s before any market surge. BTFD’s Referral Program: Get Paid Just for Spreading the Word If you thought BTFD’s 100% bonus was the only reason to jump in on this top meme coin presale to buy, think again. The BTFD rewards program is making waves. The top 20 referrers earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens at the end of each month. That’s free tokens just for bringing others into the presale. And since this competition resets every month, there are continuous chances to stack up more rewards. Play2Earn Game: Earn While You Play The BTFD Play2Earn (P2E) Game’s full version has officially launched, and players are already cashing in. Gamers can earn BTFD Coins just by playing, making it a win-win for both crypto and gaming enthusiasts. This game isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a fully interactive way to earn rewards while being part of the BTFD movement. 90% APY Staking: A Meme Coin That Pays to Hold Holding BTFD isn’t just about riding the hype—it’s about making serious passive income. With a massive 90% APY staking reward, early holders get paid for simply holding onto their coins. That’s crypto working for you, ensuring that your BTFD stack keeps growing over time. Stage 13 Burn: A Supply Shock Incoming If you thought things couldn’t get crazier, here’s the latest bombshell—all unsold tokens from Stage 13 have been burned. That’s millions of BTFD Coins permanently removed from circulation, tightening the supply and increasing demand. This isn’t just a smart move; it’s a textbook setup for explosive price action when BTFD finally hits exchanges. AI16Z (ElizaOS): AI Meets Meme Coin Hype AI16Z, now known as ElizaOS, isn’t your standard meme coin. This project has positioned itself as the go-to AI-powered token, integrating artificial intelligence into the blockchain world. Unlike traditional meme coins, AI16Z leverages AI-driven trading bots, smart contract optimizations, and automated market strategies. The crypto crowd has been all-in on AI projects, and AI16Z has made sure it stays in the mix. Investors see it as a long-term hold, capitalizing on both the meme coin hype and AI advancements. SNEK: The Cardano-Based Meme Titan SNEK has become a dominant meme coin on the Cardano network and for good reason. With a community-driven approach and strategic supply burns, it has managed to stay relevant while others have faded. Cardano enthusiasts love SNEK for its decentralized roots, and it continues to be one of the most talked-about meme coins in ADA-based circles. But here’s the reality—SNEK is already established. While it has room to grow, it’s not in the presale phase like BTFD, meaning the biggest multipliers have already been realized. Early-stage investors are now looking at BTFD to repeat the success stories of SNEK and AI16Z. Final Call: This is Your Moment to Move! Based on market trends and historical data, early meme coin presale investors have consistently outperformed those who wait for exchange listings. The opportunity in front of you in the form of the top meme coin presale to buy now with BTFD’s 100% bonus, referral rewards, staking, and P2E game is one of the biggest we’ve seen in 2025. With the presale already in Stage 14, and prices set to jump from $0.00016 to $0.0006, there’s only a small window left to lock in this 550% ROI opportunity. The Stage 13 token burn means supply is tightening, and the next wave of buyers will be paying significantly more. No more waiting. No more second-guessing. This is how meme coin wealth is built. Join the BTFD presale now, enter LAUNCH100, and claim your 100% bonus before it’s gone.

The overall crypto market crash over the last 24 hours has eroded more than $170 billion of investors’ wealth with market analysts predicting more pain ahead. Will Bitcoin Price Crash to $75,000? Bitcoin price has once again come under heavy selling pressure, facing strong rejection at $92,500 and extending weekly losses to more than 11.15%. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that over $1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) long positions were liquidated today. The massive liquidation highlights the intense market volatility currently impacting the cryptocurrency sector. Source: Ali Martinez Bitcoin Forms a Bearish Pennant Says Peter Brandt Veteran trader Peter Brandt has shared a technical analysis suggesting the recent Bitcoin price action confirms a bearish outlook. In the latest chart structure, Brandt has identified three critical technical developments hinting at further downside pressure. Market completes double top. Top retested by pennant. Pennant completed, confirms bearish chart Bitcoin (BTC). Source: Peter Brandt The analysis highlights a double top formation with peaks reaching approximately $108,100, followed by a bearish pennant pattern. According to Brandt, Bitcoin made a “deep retest” of its previous high near $95,321 before breaking down through the pennant formation. The chart also indicates that Bitcoin price found temporary support at $81,513 following the breakdown, but the completion of the bearish pattern suggests further downside potential. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes also believes that there could be more pain left ahead for BTC. He wrote: “An ugly start to the week. Looks like $BTC will retest $78k. If it fails, $75k is next in the crosshairs. There are a lot of options OI struck $70-$75k, if we get into that range it will be violent”. Will BTC Enter Bear Market After US CPI? Several market analysts believe that Bitcoin is finally entering a bear market as market sentiment deteriorates despite the launch of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve . Furthermore, the initiative has revealed an apparent lack of intent to purchase anything beyond seized BTC. On the other hand, institutional demand for Bitcoin has dried up significantly, as evident by the massive outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. Between March 3 and March 7 (ET), Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced significant outflows, signaling waning investor sentiment in the market. Data shows a net outflow of $799 million during the period, with Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) accounting for $201 million of the total. All eyes will be on the US CPI data for February coming this week, ahead of March 12. February’s U.S. consumer price data is expected to reflect gradual progress in controlling inflation, a key concern for Federal Reserve policymakers. The central bank may opt to maintain a cautious stance, monitoring the broader economic landscape amid evolving fiscal policies. According to projections, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) excluding food and energy likely increased by 0.3% , as per a Bloomberg survey of economists.

Among the top projects generating buzz are Pi Network (PI) and Coldware (COLD), two Web3 altcoins vying for attention from investors and traders alike. As Donald Trump prepares for his next crypto announcement, both Pi Network and Coldware (COLD) are positioning themselves to benefit from the anticipated changes. In this article, we explore why Coldware (COLD) could potentially be the best altcoin to buy before Trump’s next big announcement, while also examining Pi Network’s (PI) market entry and growth potential. Coldware (COLD): A Strong Competitor in the DeFi Space While Pi Network (PI) has made impressive strides, a new Web3 altcoin, Coldware (COLD), has emerged as a serious contender in the DeFi space. Coldware (COLD) is a Layer 1 DePIN blockchain, offering unique solutions for decentralized finance, scalability, and security. Coldware (COLD) distinguishes itself from Pi Network (PI) by not only leveraging mobile mining but also providing a robust and functional ecosystem that supports real financial services such as staking, yield farming, and decentralized lending. The key unique selling proposition (USP) of Coldware (COLD) lies in its security and scalability. It provides institutions and whales with a platform that is both secure and efficient for handling high transaction volumes. Coldware (COLD) also stands out because of its tokenomics, which incentivize users to stake and earn rewards while contributing to the ecosystem’s growth. With Coldware (COLD), investors can expect to benefit not only from speculative gains but also from long-term value, backed by real-world applications and a sustainable economic model. Pi Network (PI): A Revolutionary Shift in Mining Launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, Pi Network promised to revolutionize cryptocurrency mining by enabling users to mine crypto via smartphones with minimal energy consumption. While initially met with skepticism, Pi Network made waves in the crypto community by offering mining capabilities to anyone with a smartphone, challenging the traditional mining ecosystem that requires expensive and specialized hardware. Since transitioning to an Open Network in February 2025, Pi Network has experienced notable growth. The Pi Coinquickly surged to over $2 on various exchanges, sparking excitement among its vast user base. The network now boasts over 70 million users, with millions of them having completed the required KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process. Market Momentum for Pi Network (PI) As Pi Coin becomes more accessible through exchanges like OKX and MEXC, investors are eagerly watching its price movements. Currently trading at around $1.87, Pi Coin has the potential to reach $5 by April 2025, given its strong community backing, the increasing number of dApps, and the possibility of further exchange listings. One of the significant factors that could influence Pi Network’s (PI) price is real-world adoption. While Pi Coin has grown in popularity, its ability to achieve meaningful use cases in commerce and services will be a critical determinant of its price trajectory. Additionally, new exchange listings such as Binance could provide substantial liquidity and market visibility, potentially pushing Pi Coin’s value to higher levels. Trump’s Crypto Announcement and What It Means for Pi Network and Coldware Donald Trump’s upcoming crypto announcement could have significant implications for the market. As the former president has expressed interest in establishing the United States as a global crypto leader, his upcoming statements are likely to focus on regulatory clarity for digital assets and the potential for creating a crypto reserve. This announcement may spur market movements and attract new capital to certain crypto projects. Pi Network (PI), with its rapidly expanding user base and promising real-world applications, could see a surge in demand if Trump’s announcement includes favorable policies for retail-friendly coins. On the other hand, Coldware (COLD) could benefit from institutional support, especially if the US government pushes for innovative DeFi solutions to be integrated into the broader financial ecosystem. Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) as the Best Web3 Altcoin With both Pi Network (PI) and Coldware (COLD) making waves in the crypto space, Coldware (COLD) stands out as a solid investment opportunity ahead of Trump’s announcement. As a Layer 1 DePIN platform offering robust DeFi solutions and a secure, scalable blockchain, Coldware (COLD) is positioned to benefit not only from speculation but also from real-world adoption in the growing Web3 ecosystem. Investors looking to capitalize on the next big Web3 altcoin before Trump’s crypto announcement should strongly consider Coldware (COLD), which offers both stability and growth potential as a Layer 1 blockchain built for the future of decentralized finance.

Binance, the world’s largest centralized exchange, is adjusting its token listing process by introducing a community co-governance structure, allowing users to vote on which tokens should be listed or delisted. Meanwhile, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) is urging Elon Musk to take stronger action against bots on X, which continue to spread scams and misinformation, particularly in the crypto space. Binance Introduces Community Co-Governance Model for Token Listings Amid Surging Crypto Growth Binance, the world's largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a community co-governance structure that will allow its users to vote on the listing and delisting of tokens. This move comes as the industry grapples with an explosion in new cryptocurrency projects, making it increasingly difficult for exchanges to maintain quality control and regulatory compliance. According to Binance's announcement, the exchange will pre-select projects that will be put up for a community vote. The tokens that receive the most votes from Binance users will then undergo a due diligence process before being listed on the platform. Additionally, Binance has introduced a ”monitoring zone” for projects that fail to meet community and exchange standards. Projects can be placed in this category if they: Fail to provide regular progress updates or disclose necessary token information. Engage in malfeasance or unethical behavior. Have inactive developer teams and communities. Once a project is added to the monitoring zone, Binance users will have the ability to vote on whether to delist it from the exchange. This system introduces a crowdsourced accountability mechanism, where projects must maintain engagement and transparency to retain their listings. Binance's decision to introduce community voting comes as the number of cryptocurrency tokens has skyrocketed. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the number of unique digital assets increased from 11 million on Feb. 8 to 12.4 million today—a massive surge in just a few months. The rapid expansion of token offerings has created challenges for major exchanges, as they struggle to vet and evaluate new projects effectively. The influx of low-quality or scam tokens has led to concerns about market dilution, potentially affecting investor confidence and price stability across the broader crypto market. Binance is not alone in reconsidering its approach to token listings. In a Jan. 24 post on X, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong highlighted the difficulties of manually evaluating the overwhelming number of new tokens. ”We need to rethink our listing process at Coinbase given there are [roughly] 1 million tokens a week being created now, and growing — high-quality problem to have — but evaluating each one by one is no longer feasible,” Armstrong said. Armstrong further suggested that regulatory frameworks need to evolve to accommodate the growing scale of the crypto industry, stating that applying for approval for each token is impractical under current models. Coinbase is now exploring a hybrid model that incorporates allow-lists, block-lists, community reviews, and on-chain data to determine which projects are suitable for listing. What This Means for Crypto Traders and Projects The introduction of a community co-governance model at Binance marks a major shift in how centralized exchanges interact with users and projects. While Binance has always maintained a dominant position in the crypto exchange space, this new approach could signal a broader trend toward more decentralized and community-driven decision-making. For crypto traders, this model presents both opportunities and risks: More control over listings: Traders will have a direct say in which projects are added or removed, potentially leading to more democratic and transparent listings. Increased accountability: Projects will be under greater pressure to maintain transparency and engagement to avoid getting delisted. Potential manipulation risks: If not implemented carefully, community votes could be manipulated by large token holders or coordinated groups, leading to unfair delistings or spammed listings. The crypto industry's growth is outpacing traditional regulatory and operational models, forcing major players like Binance and Coinbase to experiment with new approaches. Binance's community co-governance initiative represents an attempt to balance decentralization with due diligence, giving users a more active role while maintaining standards for token quality. Whether this model proves to be effective, scalable, and resistant to manipulation remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: as the crypto landscape continues to evolve, exchanges must adapt or risk becoming obsolete. CZ Urges Elon Musk to Ban Bots from X as Crypto Scams Surge In related news, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has once again called on Elon Musk to take decisive action against bots on X, which have long plagued the platform, especially within the crypto community. In a March 9 post, CZ suggested that while users should be allowed to copy and paste AI-generated content, automated API posting should be disabled to curb bot activity. This renewed call for action comes amid growing concerns about crypto scams, phishing attacks, and pump-and-dump schemes, all of which have been amplified by armies of automated bots posing as real users. CZ’s March 9 X post directly addressed Musk, urging him to clamp down on bot activity, ”If someone uses Grok, ChatGPT, or DeepSeek to generate a tweet and copy and paste it here, fine, but API posting should be disabled.” CZ later clarified that while AI agents—which can assist with tasks like hotel bookings and code writing—are useful, social media bots serve no constructive purpose. Instead, they contribute to widespread spam, deception, and manipulation in online discourse. The bot epidemic on X is particularly severe in the cryptocurrency space, where malicious actors use fake accounts to spread phishing links, impersonate influencers, and manipulate token prices. These scams often involve: Fake token promotions promising high returns to lure unsuspecting investors. Phishing links directing users to fraudulent websites designed to steal funds. Pump-and-dump schemes, where bots artificially inflate a token’s price by spamming misleading information. According to a 2023 study by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), bots have played a key role in manipulating altcoin prices, coordinating posts across thousands of fake accounts to generate artificial hype. Ever since Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in 2022, the crypto community has been pressing him to eliminate bots from the platform. While Musk has acknowledged the problem, efforts to curb bot activity have had mixed results. Musk’s proposals to combat bots have included: Requiring users to register a credit card to create new accounts, thereby adding a small financial barrier to mass bot creation. Introducing paid verification (Twitter Blue) to make it harder for bots to pass as real users. Enhancing AI-based bot detection systems to automatically flag and remove suspicious accounts. Despite these measures, bots continue to thrive on X, often adapting to changes faster than detection systems can respond. Romance Scams and AI-Powered Fraud on the Rise Beyond simple spam and phishing, AI-powered chatbots have also contributed to more sophisticated fraud schemes. One such example is the ”pig butchering” scam, a long-term con in which scammers pretend to form romantic relationships with victims, gradually convincing them to invest in fake cryptocurrency projects. According to Cyvers, crypto romance scams stole an estimated $5.5 billion from investors in 2024 alone. These scams take advantage of AI chatbots that can engage in human-like conversations, building trust with victims before orchestrating financial fraud. While CZ’s proposal to ban API-based bot posting could help mitigate some of the problem, it is unclear whether Musk and X will take action. Completely banning API posting could hinder legitimate automation on the platform, including useful bots that provide news updates, crypto price alerts, and trading signals. Moreover, scammers and bot farms have repeatedly demonstrated an ability to adapt to countermeasures, often creating more sophisticated versions of automated accounts that mimic human behavior. For now, the bot problem remains a significant issue, particularly in the crypto space, where investors are at constant risk of falling victim to scams. As industry leaders like CZ continue to push for change, the question remains: Will Musk finally take decisive action, or will bots continue to run rampant on X?",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-10 05:30:00

Most of the tokens rise and fall, but two projects remain in the spotlight for the potential they show. Cardano has weathered the fluctuations of the markets, entrancing traders with its technical merits. Remittix, a new payments-focused platform is also gaining steam, gaining plaudits for its practical applications. As next year’s trends start to take shape, these two projects head the pack. One of them has a track record of building solid foundations, and the other introduces a fresh twist to cross-border finance. With a focus on real utility, they have the potential to outlast the short-term hype. Here are five of the most important reasons why investors believe that Cardano and this new PayFi solution have the potential to be among the best of 2025. Cardano’s Market Potential and Path to $1.2 Cardano (ADA) has seen price swings that tested investors’ resolve, but some analysts perceive the drops as temporary. Following a massive rally in the first half of the year, ADA retraced to a familiar price level. Still, chart watchers say it could trend to the $1.2 level if bulls succeed in sustaining key support around $0.78 to make it a good investment. Also, the narrow trading range is indicated by the market structure. Regardless of Cardano’s failure to break out, a strong uptrend on the Directional Movement Index (DMI) signals sustained positive momentum. Still, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) signals subdued buying interest, meaning that ADA may remain in its current range unless enthusiasm improves. If sentiment becomes more positive in general—especially with the help of Bitcoin—Cardano’s resistance level of $1.2 could be an achievable target. Source: Tradingview Remittix (RTX) and Its PayFi Breakthrough While ADA takes care of the technology aspect of the blockchain, Remittix (RTX) is crafted to enable easy crypto payments to the benefit of all stakeholders from small businesses to large enterprises. Valued at an estimated $0.0734, Remittix has raised over $13.6 million in the presale and sold over 516 million tokens to date. Instead of riding the social media wave, it is solving an immediate issue: converting digital funds into local money without delay or cost. Envision a clothing store that serves international clients but is frustrated with exchange rates and wire transfers. Using the Remittix PayFi solution, the store can accept payments in crypto and settle nearly instantaneously in its domestic currency—avoiding traditional banking headaches. That certainty appeals to businesses that would prefer to have a steady cash influx even if the markets decline or increase. Because Remittix aims to solve real-world hurdles, it could stand firm as crypto markets shift direction. While other tokens mostly rely on hype cycles, Remittix brings the digital world and the world of fiat together by being usable in real life. As the platform becomes more streamlined for daily life, investors increasingly see RTX as a secure choice in an area too frequently plagued by short-term hype. Why ADA and RTX May Outperform in 2025 Both Cardano and Remittix target gaps in the market. Cardano’s ongoing network upgrades and potential rally to $1.2 show how a solid community plus strong fundamentals can yield steady gains. As for Remittix, its emphasis on PayFi technology taps into a critical need for simpler cross-border payments, suggesting more room for long-term expansion. In a space where short-lived mania can overshadow practical solutions, these two projects offer a contrast. Cardano’s seasoned community and robust network updates may set it apart, but Remittix holds even greater promise with its PayFi system. By making cross-border payments near-instant, Remittix addresses everyday issues that businesses and freelancers wrestle with. For investors who value tangible solutions over fleeting hype, Remittix could well be the bigger story in 2025’s crypto landscape. Curious about PayFi’s role in reshaping cross-border finance? Take a look at Remittix and learn why a token rooted in real-world solutions might share the stage with Cardano in the year ahead.

China’s retaliatory tariffs on US farm goods took effect, following the US hiking tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%. Traders reacted to fresh data from China over the weekend, which showed that consumer prices fell the most in 13 months in February, while producer deflation persisted for the 29th month despite a slower fall. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.42% to around 3,990, while the broader Topix Index edged up 0.1% to 2,712 on Monday, recovering some losses from the previous session. The Japanese yen strengthened past 148 per dollar on Monday, hovering at a five-month high. Domestically, data showed that Japan posted a current account deficit in January for the first time in two years, as imports outpaced exports. Additionally, inflation-adjusted real wages—a key measure of consumer purchasing power—fell 1.8% year-on-year, marking the first decline in three months. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.62% to below 3,360, while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.3% to 10,810 on Monday, extending losses from the previous session as persistent deflationary pressures underscored China's economic challenges, and the offshore yuan depreciated around 7.25 per dollar as investors reacted to China’s weaker-than-expected inflation data . China announced on Saturday that it will impose a 100% tariff on imports of certain Canadian agricultural products, including rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas, along with a 25% levy on aquatic products and pork. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 2.29% to 23,888 on Monday morning, extending losses from the prior period amid widespread sector falls. Locally, Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves fell to an 8-month low in February, following a period of stability over the previous three months. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.40% to 74,601 in early deals on Monday, hitting a near two-week peak, with the Nifty 50 climbing 0.4% to above 22,600, after being flat in the previous session, supported by strength in consumer goods, metals, and realty. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.18% to around 7,970 on Monday, recovering some losses from the previous session, as mining and energy stocks led gains amid firmer commodity prices. The Australian dollar steadied around $0.63 on Monday, pausing a two-day decline. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher recovered from earlier losses after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated confidence in inflation progress while emphasizing no urgency to cut rates. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump described the economy as undergoing “a period of transition” during a Fox News interview, when asked about the risk of a recession. U.S. stock futures declined on Monday ahead of the inflation and JOLTS data: Dow -0.43% ; S&P 500 -0.46% ; Nasdaq -0.51% . Markets are closely watching consumer inflation expectations set for release on Monday, followed by consumer inflation data on Wednesday, producer inflation figures on Thursday, and a consumer sentiment report on Friday.

S&P 500 futures dropped 0.8%, Nasdaq 100 futures slid nearly 1%, and Dow Jones futures sank 268 points (0.6%), per data from CNBC. This comes after last week’s brutal selloff, where the S&P 500 plunged 3.10%, the Dow lost 2.37%, and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.45%—its worst performance since September. The selloff was also fueled by Washington’s economic policies and tariff negotiations with Mexico and Canada, creating uncertainty that sent investors running for cover. Throughout the week, a flood of economic reports will be released and they likely would add to the chaos. The New York Fed’s consumer expectations survey is set for release Monday, but the real concern is inflation—something the Federal Reserve and investors are watching closely. So we got the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February will be released Wednesday, followed by the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday, and then the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index comes on Friday. Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said, “The total and core CPI likely rose at a more moderate pace in February after sharp increases in the prior month.” Bill also explained that tariffs and trade uncertainties continue to push producer prices higher. On Friday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the uncertainty, saying the central bank is “focused on separating the signal from the noise.” He pointed out that his team isn’t in a hurry to adjust interest rates, adding that the Fed will wait for “greater clarity” before making changes. The Biden administration’s economic policies also remain a factor. President Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admitted on Friday, “The economy is starting to roll a bit.” Investors are watching to see whether Washington will step in with any measures to stabilize the markets, but let’s face it, with Trump saying “I’m not even looking at the stock market,” last week, they probably won’t. Bitcoin sinks as US creates strategic reserve The market bloodbath wasn’t limited to stocks, the crypto market took a hit too. Early Monday, Bitcoin fell more than 5%, trading at $80,622, according to data from CoinGecko. Ethereum and XRP weren’t spared either, both dropping by 6% and 7.5% respectively. The plunge came after Trump signed an executive order to establish a US strategic bitcoin reserve. The reserve will be funded with bitcoins seized from criminal and civil forfeiture cases, and there are no plans for the government to buy more. That announcement disappointed investors, many of whom expected massive and aggressive federal purchases of Bitcoin. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, wasn’t convinced the market’s reaction made sense. Bitcoin price chart. Source: Jai Hamid/TradingView “I absolutely think the market has this wrong,” Matt said on CNBC’s Squawk Box Asia. “The market is short-term disappointed” that the US didn’t announce a 100,000 or 200,000 bitcoin purchase. David Sacks, White House Crypto and AI Czar, promised that the US could acquire more bitcoin in the future using “budget-neutral strategies” that wouldn’t cost taxpayers anything. The idea of a strategic bitcoin reserve has long-term implications, and Matt believes it’s the key to Bitcoin becoming a key geopolitical asset, so now we’re all watching to see if other governments follow suit and start stockpiling crypto. Bitcoin Magazine’s David Bailey told Bloomberg TV last week that Middle Eastern countries and even China are secretly making plans to jump into crypto too. Wall Street faces uncertainty as investor panic grows Jim Cramer, speaking on CNBC, didn’t hold back in his assessment of the situation. “Our president, Donald Trump, tells us that ‘what we are doing is big,’ so there might be economic consequences to come that we don’t like,” said Jimmy. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hasn’t helped the situation, giving conflicting signals about tariffs. “Howard tells us to worry about tariffs, then not to worry, and then to worry again,” Jim said. “What was the last worry or not worry turn? I forget. Is he freelancing?” With $36 trillion in national debt, tariffs alone won’t fix the economy. Jimmy pointed out that tariffs worked when Alexander Hamilton was building a manufacturing base, but today’s situation is completely different. With 4% unemployment and a worker shortage in manufacturing, he questioned how effective they can be. “Just target those countries dumping on us or hitting us with high tariffs,” Jimmy suggested. “Take the history books we studied that proved over and over again that tariffs helped cause the Great Depression. They weren’t lies. They weren’t propaganda. They were just empirical observations.” The instability has investors running. “It’s like the whole point of the exercise post-inauguration is to get you to sell all of the stocks you own and certainly not to put any money to work,” said Jimmy. “The major stock benchmarks are barely down. But look at this endless rotation out of anything with earnings risk, anything with exposure to data centers, personal computers, semiconductors, and enterprise software—about 50% of the market is now radioactive.” What’s next for the markets? Wall Street is watching for signs of stabilization, but it’s hard to see through the uncertainty. “Pass me the binoculars; I don’t see one yet because the dust storm the White House keeps kicking up is obscuring everything,” Jimmy bantered. For investors, the biggest question is whether the market collapse is sustainable. Trump’s presidency was expected to be bullish for stocks, but the opposite has happened. “Everything you thought would be good for the stock market under Trump hasn’t happened, and everything you knew would be horrendous for the stock market has happened times ten,” Jim pointed out. Still, he doesn’t think the downturn is permanent. “I think Trump is going to try to figure out something good for the markets,” he said . “But not when the Dow Jones falls 10% from here. He cares that our markets will soon be the worst in the world, and no one with pride can ignore that.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The sell-off has penetrated a bullish trendline that starts with the low registered after the June 2022 crash of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, which destroyed billions in investor wealth. The decisive breakdown means ether's near three-year-long bullish trend has likely ended, shifting focus to more profound losses, potentially to support identified by September-October 2023 lows near $1,500. Trendlines help visualize the direction in which traders are allocating funds and where price movements are likely to occur. An ascending or bullish trendline represents levels where demand is expected to be sufficient to avoid further price declines. When a prolonged bullish trendline is breached, as seen in the case of ETH, it signals a weakening of demand or that sellers are overpowering buyers, indicating a potential bearish shift in market trend. The breakdown often prompts other traders to sell, leading to even deeper losses. Ether's near 20% drop took out dual support – the trendline and the area around $2,100, characterizing repeated seller exhaustion since August. The next support is seen at $1,500, with the past week's high of $2,523 a level to beat for the bulls.",Markets|Ether|Technical Analysis|Markets,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-10 05:55:01

Key Levels to Watch Amid Market Volatility,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-low-can-bitcoin-price-drop/,"The post How Low Can Bitcoin Price Drop? Key Levels to Watch Amid Market Volatility appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has had a rough start to the week, hanging to just above $80,000 on March 10. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warns that BTC could soon retest $78,000, and if that level fails, $75,000 will be the next target. He pointed out that a massive amount of Bitcoin options open interest is concentrated between $70,000 and $75,000 , meaning that if BTC enters this range, volatility could rise, triggering fear of more liquidations. Billions Lost as Bitcoin Falls The market crash has already wiped out over $5 billion in bullish bets, mostly long positions in just four days. Bitcoin is now down nearly 30% from its January highs, and traders are worried because the price has fallen below the 200-day moving average, a key signal that often predicts more losses. Many had hoped that the BTC Strategic Reserve , a new initiative, would boost confidence, but it hasn’t helped. At the same time, big investors are pulling money out of Bitcoin ETFs at record levels, showing that institutional demand is drying up. A ‘Textbook Correction’ in Progress According to 10x Research, this drop is a “textbook correction”, meaning it’s a natural pullback after a big rally. Analysts noted that 70% of sellers are recent investors who bought Bitcoin within the last three months and are now panic-selling. Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has been bouncing between $80,000 and $95,000, reacting to economic and regulatory news. Moreover, investor sentiments are fading, with the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index dropping to extreme fear at a reading of 20. Meanwhile, trading volume has fallen, meaning fewer people are buying in at current prices. Adding to the woes, El Salvador, one of Bitcoin’s biggest supporters , has reportedly halted its Bitcoin-related projects, further weakening the market’s outlook. Brace For Upcoming Events The volatility may continue this week as two key U.S. inflation reports are due, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. If inflation remains high, the Fed may maintain its restrictive stance, adding pressure to risk assets like Bitcoin. On the geopolitical front, Canada has responded to recent U.S. trade tariffs with retaliatory measures, further unsettling global markets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Prediction for Next Week , What’s Next for Bitcoin? Crypto analyst Jacob King also highlights Bitcoin’s sharp drop below $80,000, wiping out over $5 billion in long positions within four days. BTC is now down nearly 30% from its January highs, with its price slipping below the 200-day moving average—a bearish signal. The much-anticipated BTC Strategic Reserve failed to ignite bullish momentum, while institutional interest is fading, as seen in record ETF outflows. Bitcoin’s ability to hold the $80,000 support level will be crucial in determining its next move. If prices stabilize, a recovery could follow, but if BTC breaks below key support levels, a further drop toward $70,000 is possible. With weakening institutional demand, rising liquidations, and tariff war, traders are bracing for more volatility in the days ahead. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

BITO tracks Bitcoin futures, not spot prices, causing inefficiencies and higher costs compared to spot ETFs like IBIT, which holds actual Bitcoin. Despite political and economic factors favoring Bitcoin, technical indicators suggest potential volatility, making it uncertain if BITO will hold above $17 or fall to $10. Given the tracking errors and mixed signals from technical analysis, I recommend holding BITO rather than buying or selling in this uncertain environment. ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) is falling since the beginning of 2025 and lost 18.32% of its value so far. That’s why it doesn’t offer an investment opportunity as advantageous as Bitcoin itself, although it varies depending on the type of investor. In this article, I will explain the reasons for this in detail. I’d like to start the article by comparing returns of Bitcoin with the returns of BITO because many investors are wondering why BITO is not performing as well as IBIT or Bitcoin itself. TradingView Since BITO’s launch in October 2021 it lost 53.77% of its value, while Bitcoin has gained 35.08%. Both instruments reflect Bitcoin’s price movements, but structural differences in design are leading to a significant and permanent performance difference. Similarly, when I calculate the annual expected return rates, BITO has an expected return of 3.17% since 2022 while Bitcoin has an expected return of 51.17%. There is a truly huge difference between the two. So what causes this difference? Understanding BITO BITO tracks futures contracts traded on the CME instead of holding Bitcoin directly. While this allows the fund to operate within regulatory circles it introduces negative complications such as contango and rollover costs too. The fund periodically rolls over expiring contracts into longer-term contracts which is insuring costs. Unlike BITO, for example IBIT completely eliminates the problems and costs associated with futures trading because it holds actual Bitcoin for the fund. BITO’s reliance on futures creates contango. Contango means longer-term contracts trade at a premium to shorter-term ones. Contango intensifies during bull markets, especially after March 2023 which forced BITO to sell low and buy high on a monthly basis. iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) 0.25% Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ( BTC ) 0.15% Franklin Bitcoin ( EZBC ) 0.19% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) 0.20% VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) 0.20% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) 0.21% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) 0.25% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) 0.25% Median 0.21% In addition to that BITO’s expense ratio is really high. While the median expense ratio of spot Bitcoin holding ETFs is generally around 0.21%, BITO’s expense ratio is significantly higher than this ratio with 0.95%. Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITS ) 0.65% CoinShares Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) 0.75% Bitwise Trendwise Bitcoin and Treasury Rotation Strategy ETF ( BITC ) 0.85% CoinShares Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF ( BTF ) 1.24% Median 0.80% Maybe it’s not right to compare the futures ETF with the spot. That's why I took the median of the futures ETFs expense ratios, which resulted 0.80%. BITO has a lower expense ratio than BTF, but it still has an expense ratio above the median. This expense ratio also seriously affects the performance of the fund. In addition to these expenses, there is also the issue of dividend distribution. BITO distributes monthly dividends from futures earnings and taxes them as ordinary income (up to 37% federal rate). On the other hand, spot ETF’s can delay these taxes until the sale. Since this tax burden is compounded, it is also written off as a burden on performance. BITO seems to be a less efficient investment, both compared to Bitcoin itself and spot ETFs. So if this inefficiency is weighing on performance, why do I have a “hold” position instead of a “sell” position? This is a decision that depends entirely on Bitcoin's own performance. After all BITO is a Bitcoin fund and even though its performance is not exactly the same, it aims to reflect Bitcoin's movements. So I will analyze Bitcoin technically and determine whether BITO can compensate for its expenses. Charting TradingView Historically, I see that Bitcoin has been in a constant logarithmic upward trend. In addition, when the average return of each year is calculated since 2018, when Bitcoin began to mature, the expected return is at 76.75%. Therefore, I think that this performance will compensate for BITO's expenses in the long run. TradingView When I focus on shorter term I see that Bitcoin moves in accordance with the 80 and 500-week weighted moving averages. Bitcoin supported from the 80-week moving average about 3 times in the bull run after 2023. I think this moving average is critical for Bitcoin even right now. The 80-week moving average is at $74,200. If Bitcoin holds at this level, it means that BITO will find support at $17 proportionally. As long as it holds at this level and continues its run, I think BITO will be able to cover its costs, but it will still significantly underperform compared to Bitcoin or spot ETFs due to contango. I think after finding, the support target level is going to be maximum $28 for BITO. TradingView But if Bitcoin cannot hold at this level, I have to start talking about the price action support level of $53,000 and the 500-week moving average level of $34,433 which means a bearish call. In this scenario, I think BITO will fall by the amount of Bitcoin's loss of value + other costs. We saw this in practice in 2024. While Bitcoin was suppressed and lost about 27% of its value from March to September, BITO lost up to 52% in this period. This indicates an additional 25% loss in value. Therefore, my analysis shows that a drop to the $53,000 support will take BITO down to $10. I have to say that both possibilities are really close to each other, which is the biggest reason why I keep a ""hold"" position. The changes in the global political and economic ground generally seem to be in favor of Bitcoin. President Trump recently signed a decree by keeping his promise to hold Bitcoin in the Federal Reserve and organized the first crypto summit at the White House. Plus US holds 212,000 Bitcoins , China 194,000, the UK 61,000 and this number continues to increase every day. So in the global political and economic arena, states have started to turn to Bitcoin for certain reasons and this naturally increases the demand for Bitcoin. So the increase in these developments will contribute to Bitcoin remaining above the 80-week moving average. But at the same time, the RSI indicator’s bearish divergence formation reminds me of 2021 in technical terms. This negative formation is a sign that the price is not met with enough momentum and is inclined to slow decline. In addition, the MACD indicator’s death cross is another negative signal. So if this selling pressure continues we can witness a break of $74,200. Risks BITO exhibits a serious tracking error due to its structure based on futures. While spot ETFs such as IBIT have tracking error rates of 0.5% this rate is between 5-10% annually for BITO. This means that the fall or surge of Bitcoin will be reflected in BITO in a very different way. Therefore, the risk may increase unexpectedly. Conclusion Political and global economic developments have begun to take shape in favor of Bitcoin. This could cause BITO to hold above $17 and run to $28. However, technical analysis also indicates that BITO will be undecided about whether to hold at this level and could fall to $10. In this uncertain environment, I am staying on the side of holding rather than buying or selling.",BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-10 05:59:32

The approval come as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation takes full effect across the European Union. This approval for BBVA marks the conclusion of a multi-year process for the Spanish lender to allow for its clients to get exposure to digital assets. In 2020, CoinDesk reported that BBVA planned to dip its toes in the sector, pending regulatory approval because MiCA wasn't yet in place. BBVA initially planned to launch its crypto services from Switzerland rather than Spain or other EU countries because Switzerland already had a clear regulatory framework for digital assets under the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). In January, BBVA launched crypto trading in Turkey through a local subsidiary.

The former central bank chief oversees the nation while President Donald Trump’s administration applies economic pressure on Canada. Carney received almost 86% of the vote to lead the Liberal Party of Canada, and at one point, he held top positions at the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. Trudeau would hand the baton over to Carney, who would then have the option (though not the obligation) to call a national election shortly after taking power. Carney caps an escalating dispute between Canada and the US. The echo of Trump’s trade policy is giving Canada headaches overnight. Trump proposed a 25% tax on many products from Canada and Mexico. He also said he would postpone the taxes on countries in the North American trade agreement for one month. He subsequently threatened new tariffs on Canadian lumber and milk. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that he expected to place 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on March 12. With Canada’s economy heavily reliant on trade with the US, Trump has openly vowed to use economic pressure to keep the country aligned with American interests. His aggressive stance has sparked outrage across Canada, fueling calls to boycott US goods and prompting Ottawa lawmakers to reassess the nation’s trade partnerships. Carney cautioned that Trump’s threats cannot buy off Canada. Canada will never be part of America On Sunday, Carney tried to do just that in his victory speech. Saying America is not Canada, he also warned that Canada “will never be part of America.” He also likened the trade dispute with the US to a hockey game, saying Canadians always come prepared when challenged. He said Americans should not underestimate Canada; in trade, as in hockey, Canada would win. Carney promised that Canadian retaliatory tariffs on US goods would remain as long as the American government failed to show respect and fairness in trade. He also said the proceeds from these tariffs would go toward assistance for Canadian workers. He also addressed his plans to strengthen Canada’s economy, forge new trade relations with trusted partners, and make Canada an “energy superpower.” During the Liberal Party leadership race, Carney positioned himself as an experienced leader who knew how to deal with crises. He steered Canada’s central bank through the global financial crisis and helped the U.K. during its troubled exit from the European Union. But Carney has never been an elected politician and does not currently sit in Parliament. Carney, a former chair of Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. and Bloomberg Inc., stepped down from both roles to launch a leadership bid. As prime minister, he would seek new international markets for Canadian products and work to eliminate trade barriers inside Canada. Carney also intends to scrap the Liberals’ planned increase in capital gains tax and abolish the consumer carbon tax. He aims to use taxpayer money to fund large-scale infrastructure projects that will invigorate Canada’s economy. Carney’s fiscal plan involves splitting the federal budget into two halves: an operating budget that he vows to keep balanced and a capital spending budget that will allow the government to pour billions into infrastructure. Carney said Canada had so much more to offer itself than Donald Trump could take away from it. He stressed that it would not be business as usual and that the country would have to take steps it had never previously conceived, doing them at speeds it had never considered possible. Canada must hold an election by October, but the Liberal Party’s perilous status in Parliament, where it has fewer than 50% of the House of Commons seats, means it’s expected sooner. Carney has to decide whether to plunge the country into a springtime election — leaving it with a caretaker government for several weeks, during which a trade war may be raging — or attempt to gain support from at least one opposition party to govern for a period of time. Carney clashes with Poilievre over transparency, leadership, and Canada’s future Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre criticized Carney’s statement, questioning his transparency and business dealings and calling on him to reveal his financial holdings to avoid conflicts of interest. Poilievre further accused Carney of attempting to mitigate where he steered Brookfield’s trajectory when he relocated the company’s headquarters from Toronto to New York in 2022. Carney was still the company chair at that time. Carney responded to Poilievre’s jab in his speech. He pointed to Poilievre’s threat to oust Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem in 2022. He stated the leaders of the opposition and their critics who signed the letter are casting scorn on the work of the bank, Carney said, mentioning Poilievre and saying he would leave the bank “crippled” during an economic uncertainty. He also pressed Poilievre on climate policy. In the Liberal attempt to replace Trudeau, Carney beat out well-known figures, including former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, former government House Leader Karina Gould, and businessman Frank Baylis. Freeland helped kill Trudeau’s political career—her resignation letter in December dealt a significant blow. Three weeks later, Trudeau said that he would resign. Trudeau delivered what may be his last political address as prime minister to the Liberal Party gathering in Ottawa. He called on Liberals to hold firm against the threats presented by Trump’s government. “Let there be no mistake, this is a nation-defining moment,” Trudeau said. “Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given.” So Canadians must wait and see whether those bonds deepen — or wither — as Carney takes the reins. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Unfortunately, so do scams. One common type of fraud involves unsuspecting investors being added to WhatsApp or Telegram groups . These groups are run by people pretending to be experts, using titles such as professor, advisor, or assistant. If you’ve been scammed on WhatsApp involving USDT or Bitcoin, you’re not alone. Here’s an example of how these scams work and what steps you can take to recover your funds. The Real Case: A Fake Job Offer A company referred to here as Company A , approached an individual through WhatsApp with a job offer. The role involved “reviewing products” and earning commissions based on sales. Initially, the job appeared legitimate, with daily funding of $50–$100 and commissions sent in cryptocurrency. The Scam Unfolds Increased Requirements : After about two weeks, the company claimed the victim’s sales were increasing and asked for payments for extra product purchases. They promised reimbursement and additional commissions. Fake Bonus : The victim was informed they had earned a “lucky bonus” of $250,000. However, to claim it, they had to pay: $30,000 as an invoice. $10,000 in late fees. Total: $40,000 New Demands : When trying to withdraw the $250,000, the scammers claimed there was an error and demanded a “repair fee” of $80,000, later reduced to $25,000. The victim refused to pay further. Warning Signs Fake Identities : All individuals involved had fabricated names and non-verifiable histories. Forged Documents : They sent a fake document with the “CEO’s” forged signature, which was later verified as fraudulent. Untraceable Communication : The WhatsApp numbers used by the scammers could not accept calls. The victim was eventually removed from the WhatsApp group of about 50 members, who also claimed to be “sellers.” Later, another person attempted to scam the victim using the same tactics, indicating it was part of a larger operation. Steps to Check If You’re Being Scammed If you’re in a similar situation, here’s how to determine if you’re being scammed: Verify Communication : Check the identities of the people who offer the job. Check if the WhatsApp number can accept calls. Be cautious of individuals who avoid video calls or use fake photos. Examine Documents : Verify any documents or signatures they send. Cross-check with official company details. Look for Red Flags : Unreasonably high promises of earnings. Requests for large upfront payments or “fees.” Being removed from groups or blocked when you question them. Steps to Recover Your Money If you’ve already fallen victim, here’s what you can do to try to recover your funds: Report to Authorities : File a report with the FBI or your country’s cybercrime unit.

Trace Your Funds : Visit Bitquery’s Crypto Investigation Services . Fill out their form to initiate a detailed investigation. Their team can trace your funds and guide you through legal and recovery processes. Conduct Your Investigation : Verify the identities of individuals involved. Check if others have reported similar scams. Protect Yourself from Future Scams Be Skeptical of Offers on WhatsApp : Especially unsolicited offers that seem too good to be true. Do Not Send Upfront Payments : Legitimate companies will not ask you to pay fees to receive earnings. Verify Legitimacy : Research the company thoroughly before engaging. By following these steps, you can minimize your losses and avoid falling for similar scams in the future.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 542,00 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart has plunged into oversold territory. Traders keep a close eye on the RSI as it can often signal trend reversal points. The crypto strategist says that since November of 2022, Bitcoin has mounted strong rallies each time the RSI dropped to oversold levels on the daily time frame. “Bitcoin’s Daily RSI equaled 2022 Bear Market RSI levels (RSI=23.93) when the price crashed into the high $70,000s. The only lower Daily RSI in this cycle was back in August 2023 (RSI=18.28). Throughout this cycle, each visit into sub-25 RSI resulted in a trend reversal to the upside over time.” Source: Rekt Capital/X According to Rekt Capital, historical data shows that Bitcoin may find a solid bottom between $78,000 and $71,700. “Bitcoin has made yet another Lower High on the Daily. There’s no denying that. But throughout this entire cycle, whenever Bitcoin would reach 28 or lower on the RSI… Bitcoin’s price would either bottom or be between -2% to -8% away from the bottom.” Source: Rekt Capital/X To support his stance that Bitcoin is now in the process of bottoming out, the trader says BTC may be following in the footsteps of the layer-1 protocol Cronos ( CRO ). According to Rekt Capital, CRO may be in the midst of ending its downtrend with a double-bottom pattern. “What’s interesting to see is that BTC is trying to build out a potential Double Bottom-like formation here. Whereas CRO has potentially broken out from its own Double Bottom, in fact leading Bitcoin. Other Altcoins are in varying phases of their own respective Double Bottoms.” Source: Rekt Capital/X A double-bottom structure is traditionally viewed as a bullish reversal pattern as it indicates that the asset has found a price floor and is gearing up for an upside burst. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that CRO has taken out the resistance of the pattern at around $0.08. At time of writing, CRO is trading at $0.80. Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $82,207, down over 4% in the past day.

Some legal experts suggest that Ripple could potentially settle using XRP tokens rather than cash – we’ll cover this in detail below. On a different front, StratoVM ($SVM) could draw attention as a Layer 2 solution that could finally integrate Bitcoin effectively into decentralized finance. By using the Bitcoin blockchain as an anchor for its data, StratoVM potentially offers improved transaction speeds and reduced fee structures—addressing longstanding limitations that have disrupted Bitcoin’s practical utility in DeFi applications. Let’s check out the deets. XRP News: Could Ripple’s $125 Million Fine Be Paid in XRP? Back in August 2024, Ripple Labs got hit with a $125 million fine from the SEC for breaking securities laws when selling XRP to institutional investors. While Ripple is still fighting its legal battles, people are now wondering how the company might pay this fine. Yassin Mobarak , a member of the XRP community, has suggested that Ripple could actually pay using XRP tokens instead of cash. He points out that the government recently created a digital asset reserve meant to hold highly liquid cryptocurrencies like XRP. If Ripple pays with XRP, this would be the first time the US government officially holds XRP tokens. Mobarak thinks this could be good news, as it would align the government’s interests with XRP holders, possibly leading to clearer regulations and wider adoption. Attorney Jeremy Hogan supports this idea , too. He references a Supreme Court case from 1869 (Willard v. Tayloe), which ruled that payments could legally be made in commodities if both sides agreed. This could set the stage for Ripple and the SEC to settle using XRP. Could StratoVM ($SVM) be the Project That Finally Helps Bitcoin Expand into the DeFi Sector? Here’s How This Layer-2 Platform Works Despite Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market, it has lagged behind Ethereum when it comes to DeFi applications, AI integrations, and meme token ecosystems. StratoVM ($SVM) might change that as an EVM-compatible Layer-2 solution that lets developers build smart contracts and decentralized apps on Bitcoin. Interest in StratoVM has been growing fast, with its price jumping an impressive 6,911% in just one month to reach about $0.1906, according to CoinGecko . SVM 30-day chart, Source: CoinGecko While the price movement is grabbing headlines, the real value of StratoVM might be its potential to expand Bitcoin’s functionality in DeFi while maintaining the security Bitcoin is known for. The project is showing promising early results. Its testnet has already attracted more than 113,000 wallets and handles around 56,000 transactions daily. As StratoVM prepares for its mainnet launch, it could change what’s possible within the Bitcoin ecosystem. It’s also worth noting that StratoVM’s current market cap sits at $17M, while its comparable project CoreDAO is valued at $990M. Meanwhile, the broader Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) space has expanded dramatically from $307M to $6.6B over the past year, according to DeFiLlama. If this trend continues, StratoVM could become a major player in this growing sector. The project’s community is also expanding rapidly, with over 100,000 followers across social platforms, including X, Telegram, and Discord. With more than 50 strategic partnerships and rumors of a centralized exchange listing on the horizon, StratoVM might be ready to finally bridge the gap between Bitcoin and the world of decentralized finance. The Bottom Line Ripple’s $125 million penalty has brought interesting discussions about payment methods. Some analysts suggest the company might settle using XRP tokens instead of traditional currency – a move that could establish a precedent for how digital asset cases are resolved in the future. At the same time, StratoVM could generate serious buzz as a Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. As its mainnet launch approaches, the platform could potentially transform how Bitcoin interacts with decentralized finance, opening new opportunities for BTC holders who have traditionally been limited in their DeFi participation options.

The cybercriminals, working for the North Korean regime, swiped the funds two weeks ago in what has become the single largest crypto hack in history. Despite global efforts to track and freeze the stolen assets, at least 20% of the stolen money has vanished. The stolen funds are being funneled through an elaborate laundering process, with experts warning that the money is likely funding North Korea’s nuclear and military programs. Source: Elliptic Crypto analysts tracking the movements say the hackers are working nonstop, using sophisticated tools to evade detection. “Every minute matters for the hackers who are trying to confuse the money trail, and they are extremely sophisticated in what they’re doing,” said Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic. ByBit’s security breach allowed Lazarus to hijack funds The ByBit attack happened on February 21, when Lazarus infiltrated one of ByBit’s suppliers. The hackers secretly changed the destination of a massive 401,000 ETH transfer, making ByBit send the funds straight into their hands instead of its own wallet. The criminals took advantage of the loophole before the exchange even realized what had happened. ByBit CEO Ben Zhou confirmed that no customer funds were affected, but the company had to replenish the stolen money through investor loans. $150K worth of stolen assets, now frozen and seized. Source: Elliptic “We are waging war on Lazarus,” Ben said, announcing a bounty program where people can earn rewards for helping track and freeze the stolen funds. So far, 20 people have received a total of $4 million in rewards for helping recover $40 million of the stolen crypto. The strategy relies on the fact that all transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, making it possible to trace the movement of the stolen money. But the problem is that Lazarus is too good at laundering crypto. Lazarus is using crypto exchanges to cash out stolen funds While ByBit and other exchanges are actively freezing stolen funds, not all crypto companies are cooperating. One exchange, eXch, has been accused of allowing Lazarus to cash out more than $90 million. ByBit and other firms have called out Johann Roberts, the owner of eXch, for not acting fast enough to block the criminals. Roberts, however, denies the accusations. Over email, he admitted that eXch did not initially freeze the stolen funds, claiming that his company was in a long-standing dispute with ByBit and wasn’t sure the funds were from the hack. He now says eXch is cooperating, but at the same time, he criticized the push for more regulation, arguing that it compromises the privacy and anonymity of crypto. The U.S. and its allies blame North Korea for dozens of crypto hacks over the years, using stolen funds to support the country’s sanctions-hit economy. Lazarus was previously focused on hacking banks, but in the last five years, crypto exchanges have become their primary target. Dr. Dorit Dor, a cybersecurity expert at Check Point, says North Korea has perfected the art of cybercrime. “North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy, so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering, and they don’t care about the negative impression of cybercrime,” she said. The ByBit hack is just the latest in a long list of Lazarus attacks, including the 2019 UpBit hack ($41 million stolen), the 2020 KuCoin hack ($275 million stolen, most recovered), the 2022 Ronin Bridge attack ($600 million stolen), and the 2023 Atomic Wallet breach ($100 million stolen) The U.S. has added Lazarus members to its Cyber Most Wanted list, but the chances of anyone getting arrested are slim unless they leave North Korea. Despite international sanctions and law enforcement tracking their every move, Lazarus is still pulling off some of the biggest heists in the world—and cashing out.

Here is the Latest Bitcoin Purchase Amount!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/el-salvador-continues-to-buy-bitcoin-despite-imf-here-is-the-latest-bitcoin-purchase-amount/,"El Salvador has continued its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy despite pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to halt purchases, increasing its holdings to 6,111 BTC. El Salvador Defies IMF, Continues Bitcoin Accumulation The Central American country added 6 BTC to its reserves on Sunday, bringing its total holdings to 6,111.18 BTC, worth about $504 million at current market prices. That’s up from 6,072 BTC on Feb. 9, according to the country’s Bitcoin Office. IMF Agreement and Rising Tensions El Salvador reached a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF in December, with the total financial package expected to exceed $3.5 billion. As part of the deal, the country agreed to reduce its Bitcoin engagement in exchange for financing. In January, the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly passed a bill to comply with IMF requirements tied to the loan. On March 3, the IMF released a new report reinforcing the expectation that El Salvador will limit government involvement in Bitcoin-related activities. Bukele Remains Firm on Bitcoin Strategy Despite these agreements, President Nayib Bukele has made it clear that El Salvador will not stop accumulating Bitcoin. In a March 5 post on X (formerly Twitter), Bukele countered speculation that the country would abandon its Bitcoin-first approach. “No, it won’t stop,” Bukele wrote. “If it didn’t stop when the world shut us out and most ‘bitcoinists’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now and it won’t stop in the future.” El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, a move that initially drew criticism from global financial institutions including the IMF and the World Bank. The government has since launched initiatives such as Bitcoin-backed bonds and a volcanic-powered Bitcoin mining operation. Despite concerns from the IMF and credit rating agencies, the Bukele administration continues to frame Bitcoin adoption as a long-term strategy for financial independence and economic growth. *This is not investment advice.

But that’s not all—BTFD has rolled out a 100% bonus for a limited time with the exclusive LAUNCH100 code. Investors can double their holdings instantly. Meanwhile, Bonk (BONK) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) remain top players in the meme coin market, holding strong established names. But let’s be real—newcomers with explosive growth potential are where the real money is made. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in this weekend, here’s why BTFD Coin is the golden ticket you don’t want to miss.

In this game, players join the Bulls Squad, take on multiple challenges, and win BTFD tokens. What’s the best part?

Despite facing recent market corrections, BONK remains one of the most talked-about meme coins, securing a spot in major decentralized exchanges and driving high trading volumes. What sets BONK apart is its continued integration into the Solana network, offering low fees and high-speed transactions. Investors who have held BONK since early 2024 have seen significant gains, proving its place as a strong alternative investment. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Coin Giant Still Holding Strong Shiba Inu (SHIB) has become a household name in the crypto space. With its Shibarium Layer 2 solution, SHIB staking, and metaverse expansion, it continues to attract long-term holders. While SHIB remains a dominant force, its massive market cap makes triple-digit gains harder to achieve compared to high-growth presales like BTFD Coin.

Over the last week, ETH has lost more than 16%, thereby extending its year-to-date losses to more than 37%, suggesting a strong bearish sentiment for the altcoin. On the other hand, the Ethereum ETF outflows have also surged last week, suggesting dropping institutional interest. Will Ethereum Price Crash Further From Here? The world’s largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has come under strong bearish grip eroding all of its gains following the US Presidential election in November 2024. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Ethereum is breaking down of a parallel channel, a technical pattern that suggests bearish price action ahead. If Ethereum price fails to hold this support, it can crash by another 75% all the way to $1,250 levels. Source: Ali Martinez Today’s ETH price drop comes amid the broader crypto market correction as market liquidations soar to more than $600 million as per the Coinglass data . Additionally, the ETH open interest has dropped by 2.67% to $19 billion, hinting bearish sentiment among futures traders. Ethereum Liquidations Skyrocket The Ethereum market faced significant turbulence yesterday, with over $230 million in long positions liquidated, according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez. The wave of liquidations has shaken out overleveraged traders, highlighting the current market volatility surrounding the altcoin. Source: Ali Charts Furthermore, the institutional interest in Ethereum has been falling fast. During the last week, the total outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs surged over $120 million. Despite this fall, crypto market analysts continue to stay bullish for ETH expecting it to kickstart its recovery journey again. Will ETH Recover Anytime Soon? Despite the bearish onslaught over the past few weeks, market analysts continue to be bullish about an Ethereum price recovery in the coming days. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reports that Ethereum’s largest whales have purchased 330,000 ETH in the past 48 hours, signaling strong accumulation by major holders. Source: Ali Martinez Additionally, over 600,000 ETH have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges in the last week, pointing to a potential shift toward long-term holding. These trends highlight growing confidence among large investors and reduced selling pressure on exchanges. For Ethereum momentum to shift on the upside, the bulls must reclaim $2,460 resistance. A massive 10.95 million investors hold ETH at these levels, and thus, investors need to break past this to trigger a rally to the upside. Crypto trader and analyst Crypto Patel has expressed bullish sentiment on Ethereum (ETH), emphasizing his strategy of buying during market dips. “Buying $ETH on every dip for $10k/ETH,” Patel shared. He believes that this is the last opportunity for accumulation before Ethereum’s next major price surge.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another week of outflows from March 3-5, with nearly $800 million exiting the funds. This follows a record outflow week that saw over $2.61 billion in redemptions, extending the negative flow streak to four consecutive weeks with total net outflows exceeding $4.5 billion. Notably, Bitcoin ETFs recorded net negative flows throughout last week, starting with $74.19 million on Monday, followed by $143.43 million, $38.3 million, $134.26 million, and culminating in the largest outflow of $409 million on Friday. On the final day of the week, ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB led the outflows with $160.03 million, followed closely by Fidelity’s FBTC, which saw $154.89 million withdrawn by investors. Other major ETF issuers, including BlackRock’s IBIT, Grayscale’s GBTC, and Bitwise’s BITB, also experienced outflows of $39.85 million, $36.46 million, and $18.6 million, respectively. VanEck’s HODL was the only fund to buck the trend, recording a modest inflow of $619.55K. Meanwhile, the nine spot Ethereum funds also reported two consecutive weeks of negative flows, with $455 million exiting the funds, reflecting broader bearish sentiment in the crypto market. You might also like: Bitcoin tumbles to $80K as Trump’s economic policies stir debate Despite widespread anticipation that the White House Crypto Summit could provide a boost to the market, Bitcoin ETFs continued their downward trend. Analysts attribute this decline to ongoing macroeconomic concerns, particularly President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and overall economic uncertainty, which appear to be shaking investor confidence in digital assets. Some experts suggest that strategic market shifts are also contributing to the sell-off. One prevailing theory is that hedge funds have been capitalizing on low-risk arbitrage trades between Bitcoin spot ETFs and CME futures. As these trades unwind, liquidity is drying up, leading to increased selling pressure and exacerbating ETF outflows. Another factor influencing Bitcoin’s recent price swings is Trump’s announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. While many traders expected the Crypto Summit to be a bullish event, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price instead dropped from $90,000 to $85,000 following the signing of the executive order. According to Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of Komodo, Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing major outflows despite the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve due to a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” In such scenarios, assets typically rise in anticipation of an event but decline once it materializes. Stadelmann noted that speculation about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve began in July 2024 when Trump first mentioned the initiative. By the time the official announcement was made during Thursday’s Crypto Summit, the market had already priced it in, leading to a sell-off. He added that in these situations, “people who are less informed, connected, and monied often buy the news and lose money.” Additionally, the summit took place during a challenging time for the market, with concerns over trade tariffs compounding existing worries about inflation, a slowing real estate market, weak consumer spending, and declining savings.

Yesterday, the Bitcoin price dropped by around 6.37% – the most severe drop since the March 3 decline of 8.53%. Currently, at $82,362.27, the BTC market is struggling to recover from yesterday’s correction. Interestingly, Bloomberg Economics’ analysis of the gold-to-BTC ratio reveals what could be expected in the gold-BTC market in the coming days. The price of gold now stands at $2,909.42. The gold-to-Bitcoin ratio now stands at 0.034. The analysis suggests that there is a high chance for a sharp shift in the gold-to-BTC ratio in the near future. Dive in for more details! Gold-to-Bitcoin Ratio Could Drop A drop in the gold-to-BTC ratio means the price of gold has decreased in comparison to the price of BTC. In early March 2024, the gold-to-BTC ratio was very close to its current level. In early September 2024, it touched the yearly peak of 0.047. In late November 2024, when the US political landscape shifted in favour of the crypto industry, the ratio was at 0.029. On the first day of this year, the ratio was around 0.028. Though in late January 2025, it slipped to as low as 0.026, in February, it showcased constant growth. On February 26, it touched a peak of 0.035. Currently, the ratio remains at 0.034. Notably, in February, when the ratio experienced steep growth, the BTC market recorded a severe drop of 17.5%. A post on X by Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, suggests that there is a chance of the gold-to-Bitcoin ratio declining in the coming days. Gold $3,000, Bitcoin $70,000? The ounces of #gold equal to a #Bitcoin at about 28x on March 9 is at risk of dropping toward 21x, based on Bloomberg Economics' model. My bias is leaning that way, especially if the US #stockmarket reverses some of last year's almost $12 trillion… pic.twitter.com/tWrftnGyhi — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) March 9, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is Crypto Market Down Today ? When Will it Recover? , Bitcoin May Gain Strength Over Gold What McGlaone’s post indicates is that Bitcoin could become more valuable than gold in the coming days. The analyst states that if the US stock market falls, it may affect gold and Bitcoin. In the last month, the S&P 500 has recorded a fall of 4.87%. In the last week alone, the market has plummeted by over 3.50%. The YTD performance of the S&P 500 market remains at 1.68%. In conclusion, Bloomberg’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin may gain more value compared to gold in the coming days, especially if the US stock continues to decline. The recent shifts in the gold-to-BTC ratio highlight Bitcoin’s potential strength. If the trend follows past patterns, Bitcoin’s price could rise while gold’s comparative value declines. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On-chain data from Onchain Lens reveals that between April and November 2022, this investor acquired 25.12 million XRP from Binance at an average price of $0.429, spending approximately $10.77 million. During this period, the whale contributed their holdings to a liquidity pool with Binance Coin (BNB), accumulating an additional 1.38 million XRP. With the asset experiencing renewed market activity, the investor has chosen to exit, securing an estimated $56.87 million in profits. The timing of this large deposit suggests a potential shift in sentiment among major XRP holders, particularly as significant policy changes take effect in the U.S. crypto landscape. XRP Sell-Off Aligns with U.S. Digital Asset Strategy The whale’s Binance transfer happened just one day after the U.S. government released finalized documents detailing its approach to managing its Digital Asset Stockpile and establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve . This development has fueled concerns about the potential treatment of the token and other cryptocurrencies under the new framework. The policy grants Bitcoin special protection from liquidation, ensuring that any BTC added to the reserve cannot be sold. In contrast, XRP and other digital assets do not have the same safeguards, leaving them vulnerable to potential sell-offs at the discretion of the U.S. Treasury. The lack of restrictions on liquidating these assets introduces uncertainty that could influence market behavior. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Implications and Investor Sentiment The decision by this long-term XRP holder to cash out at this moment has led to speculation regarding its motives. While profit-taking is likely a key factor, the withdrawal coincides with growing concerns about XRP’s regulatory standing and role in the broader crypto market. Historically, policy changes have influenced market dynamics, and the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s future treatment could be a contributing factor in large holders reconsidering their positions. If major investors anticipate potential government intervention or forced liquidations, they may opt to secure profits now rather than face the risk of increased volatility later. Although this single transaction does not necessarily indicate a larger trend, it highlights the ongoing regulatory uncertainties surrounding XRP. Whether other long-term holders will follow suit remains to be seen, but market participants will likely continue monitoring whale activity and policy developments for further signals. This recent whale transaction underscores XRP’s market resilience and the evolving regulatory landscape that could impact its future. With Bitcoin receiving special protections under the new U.S. policy while XRP remains exposed to potential sell-offs, investors are now assessing the long-term implications. As institutional and retail sentiment fluctuates, The token’s price movement will likely be influenced by regulatory clarity, whale activity, and broader market trends in the coming months.

Referred to as House Bill 230 , Utah’s State Senate passed the bill with a 19-7-3 vote on March 7. However, this version no longer includes the Bitcoin reserve clause. The bill is now headed to Governor Spencer Cox for approval. Initially, the bill proposed allowing Utah’s state treasurer to invest up to 5% of certain public funds into Bitcoin and other qualifying digital assets. Utah was leading the Bitcoin reserve race and was widely expected to be the first U.S. state to pass such a law due to its short 45-day legislative window and strong political momentum. However, the clause was scrapped during the final Senate reading on March 7, and the House later concurred with the amendment in a 52-19-4 vote, sealing its removal from the bill. With the reserve clause gone, HB230 only includes provisions that protect the right to mine Bitcoin, run a node, and participate in staking, ensuring residents can engage in blockchain activities without regulatory overreach. It also establishes basic custody protections, giving Utahns clearer rights when holding digital assets.

According to Bitcoin Laws, two Arizona Senate bills and the Texas Senate bill (TX S) are now next in line to establish a state-backed Bitcoin reserve. Arizona’s bills have already cleared committee stages and are awaiting final floor votes, while Texas’ proposal has moved to the House . Meanwhile, other states, including Kentucky, New Hampshire , Illinois, and Iowa, still have live Bitcoin reserve bills in progress, but they remain further behind in the legislative process. In related news, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 7 that establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. However, the reserve would be funded via assets seized by the federal government instead of direct investments.

Priced at just $0.006, the token has already raised over $17 million, attracting a surge of investor interest. Despite the challenges faced by the broader crypto market, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach and strong community support are driving its growth and appeal. With a focus on bridging AI and blockchain, this rapidly growing project is seen as a promising opportunity by both new and seasoned investors. As uncertainty continues to loom over the market, Lightchain AI’s early momentum positions it as one of the most intriguing altcoins to watch in 2025, offering potential for significant returns amidst market turbulence. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what sets Lightchain AI apart and why it has garnered such overwhelming support. Market Sentiment and the Crypto Fear Index The crypto market has been under intense pressure, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reflecting a state of heightened anxiety among investors. Market sentiment has been shaky, with prices fluctuating wildly due to economic uncertainty, regulatory concerns, and major institutional developments. As fear dominates the market, many investors are retreating into safer assets, unsure of the market’s next move. However, this climate of fear also creates opportunities for those willing to look beyond the chaos. Some altcoins, such as Lightchain AI, have managed to stay resilient, showing a strong presale performance and attracting substantial investor interest. As the fear index rises, investors are looking for promising alternatives that can weather the storm, and Lightchain AI’s innovative approach to AI and blockchain technology may be exactly what the market needs. Can Lightchain AI Maintain its Momentum? As the crypto market experiences heightened fear and uncertainty, Lightchain AI is standing out with impressive momentum. Despite the overall downturn in market sentiment, Lightchain AI’s presale has seen significant success, attracting millions in investor demand. This momentum is fueled by the project’s innovative integration of AI and blockchain, offering a unique value proposition that sets it apart from traditional cryptocurrencies. While market conditions remain volatile, Lightchain AI’s solid fundamentals and growing investor interest position it as a potential leader in the emerging AI-driven crypto space. The challenge will be whether the project can maintain this momentum as it moves from presale to wider adoption. However, with a dedicated team, clear use cases, and strong backing, Lightchain AI has the potential to continue attracting attention and growth in the face of market adversity. Why Lightchain AI is Worth Watching In a market overwhelmed by fear and uncertainty, Lightchain AI has emerged as a project worth watching. Its presale has already raised significant funds, reflecting investor confidence despite the broader market downturn. The project stands out due to its unique combination of AI and blockchain technology, offering innovative solutions for both industries. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI is driven by tangible use cases and promises to integrate artificial intelligence in ways that can disrupt existing ecosystems. With an expanding network of supporters and a focus on long-term utility, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a potential leader in the evolving crypto space. Investors are keeping a close eye on its progress, as it combines cutting-edge technology with a solid roadmap, making it one to watch in 2025 and beyond. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://twitter.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-10 07:29:59

Since its mainstream launch Dogecoin has surprised the public multiple times with unexpected achievements. The current value of DOGE stands at $0.2039 while the market shows stability in this volatile period. Expert analysts suggest DOGE could reach $6.24 as long as traders keep their positions higher than $0.16 support level. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the presale success attracts 4,900 holders while raising $2.7 million. MUTM demonstrates high investment potential based on its present $0.015 value while Phase 2 of its presale shows 85% completion success. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin with Serious Potential The cryptocurrency Dogecoin achieved impressive growth while changing its position from a joke currency to a prominent cryptocurrency in the market. DOGE has attracted strong community support even while its origins were seen as a joke and now attracts increasing investment from institutional entities. Technical analyst Ali Martinez observed that Dogecoin (DOGE) remains under an ascending parallel channel as it trades on the market. The price of Dogecoin could rise to $2.74 then potentially up to $6.24 if its support level remains above $0.16. If Dogecoin manages to secure an ETF approval it would likely enhance its future position. Firms including Grayscale and WisdomTree have shown their institutional backing for DOGE by submitting their applications to regulatory bodies. The index’s target at $6.24 would become more reachable after this development brings significant liquidity and stability. Mutuum Finance: A DeFi Powerhouse in the Making The core community support behind Dogecoin remains its foundation but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains market value through its practical applications in the real world. The project’s decentralized lending model and innovative tokenomics have positioned it as a standout in the crowded DeFi space. Early investors can acquire MUTM tokens during its present Phase 2 presale period at $0.015 until the price increases to $0.02 during the subsequent phase. The demand for Mutuum Finance grows from its distinct characteristics which combine mtTokens with its buy-and-distribute model. MUTM demand remains stable because the distribution system utilizes platform revenue to acquire MUTM before giving them to staking participants. Uplifted market price values accompany the incentive system which encourages users to maintain token ownership. Initial investors who purchased at $0.06 during presale would earn 400% profit when the token launched. After launch analysts predict MUTM will achieve $1.50 which would bring investors a remarkable 9,900% ROI from the present presale value. The projected financial gains demonstrate how this project provides huge lifetime benefits to purchasers who make their investments early. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out Mutuum Finance has bridged innovation with pragmatic design elements in order to achieve its current level of success. Financial utility stands as the main strength of MUTM because it operates through a platform that enables lending and borrowing services for users. The platform achieves operational stability through its collateral structure which also draws both parties because of its adaptive interest rate system. The current project success demonstrates increasing demand because the presale phase raised $2.7 million and Phase 2 is approaching completion. Since security and transparency are core priorities of this platform it further strengthens its market appeal. Mutuum Finance works with established security firms to examine its smart contracts which helps establish its secure and robust environment. MUTM presents investors with a strong option thanks to its focus on safety and its creative features that drive long-term market expansion. The Two Cryptos You Need Dogecoin and Mutuum Finance stand out among other tokens because they show strong potential to expand tremendously through 2025. Dogecoin attracts high-risk investors through its popular culture aspect and trading patterns although Mutuum Finance introduces a measured DeFi entrance through its useful crypto model. Investors who seek to take advantage of future market opportunities should consider the MUTM presale as their best opportunity to obtains tokens at their base value. With Phase 2 of the presale nearly filled, time is running out to join the Mutuum Finance revolution. Don’t miss your chance to be part of a project poised for significant growth.

William Banks posts with friends from prison. Source: William Banks X/Twitter His name has flooded X (formerly Twitter), with some calling him a scammer and others hailing him as Robin Hood. Either way, the story is real, and it all played out in real-time on social media, proving once again that there is no place more entertaining than the crypto community. So, who is William Banks exactly? William, known for his unhinged performances in short films and underground comedy, made headlines in February after launching a Solana-based meme coin called White Moses (MOSES) on Pump.fun. Investors poured money into the project, causing its market cap to skyrocket to $257,000 in under an hour. Then, just as fast, William dumped his holdings, tanking the price and leaving investors with nothing. He later deleted all posts promoting the coin and posted on X, saying, “William Banks is Robin Hood. Thank you to the crypto community for buying my pretend memecoin and helping me to raise $50,000 for the crisis in Gaza. Free Palestine.” The Palestinian charities William Banks donated to. Source: X/Twitter William also shared five separate receipts showing $10,000 donations to various Palestinian charities. Some organizations confirmed receiving the money, while others were still yet to comment as of press time. The internet went into full meltdown mode. Some accused him of fraud. Others called him a hero. Political commentator Eden Riley posted on X, “He escaped from jail only to immediately rug-pull a bunch of crypto bros to donate the money to Palestine… he might be the greatest to ever do it.” Escaping from jail and going viral William’s crypto stunt came just weeks after his prison escape, which was also documented on X. He had been arrested in Connecticut for allegedly stealing and throwing away five Israeli signs from people’s yards. He was sentenced to eight months in jail in October 2024, posting before his trial, “Hey I just want to be honest with everyone. I’m facing some pretty serious charges in the state of Connecticut that could result in my imprisonment. My trial is tomorrow and I might be going away for a little bit.” Two days later, he hilariously updated his followers: “I have terrible news. The state of Connecticut has sentenced me to 8 months in jail beginning on Nov 15. I have always tried to make the most out of my life, but today I am presented with an overwhelming challenge to overcome.” While behind bars, William continued posting on X, gaining a cult following for his bizarre content. But what happened next defied reality. A riot broke out inside the jail, and in the chaos, William escaped. William later posted a video reenactment, showing himself crawling under a fence, racking up over 20 million views. By the time authorities realized he was gone, he had already moved on to his next scheme—crypto. How amazing is that? Life on the run with a girlfriend and a fanbase Despite being a fugitive, William is still active online, and he’s not hiding. He’s been posting videos with his new girlfriend, a mystery “baddie” who appears in clips laughing, dancing, and even smoking with him. William Banks and his girlfriend. Source : William Banks X/twitter. Cryptopolitan would describe their content as “bizarre”, but neither us nor William’s followers can look away. And X users have mixed reactions to his chaotic rise to fame. One person wrote , “William Banks got an 8-month jail bid for stealing Israel signs out of people’s yards, does 4 months, says fuck it, becomes White Moses and orchestrates a breakout. My new greatest of all time.” Another guy posted, “William you have to stop. You smoke too tough. Your swag is too different. Your girl is too bad. They’ll kill you.” This one guy humorously said , “Nothing against William Banks but any time I see a guy with a beautiful girlfriend I hope he gets hit by a car.” William Banks and friend in prison. But others believe it’s nothing but a bit, with one guy saying , “Can’t wait to watch William Banks get shot in the neck before bleeding out in an efficiency apartment on some random account’s live stream two days from now. (I’ll be smiling quietly because I’m a special smart boy and I know it’s a bit).” Cryptopolitan has reached out to William for a comment, and will promptly publish an update if he responds. For now, the hero remains free, still posting, still dodging the law, and with a fanbase that’s watching his every move, including the author of this article.

The number of weekly active addresses has surged to a fresh record high, indicating heightened interest among traders. Despite this spike, XRP price is still struggling to gain momentum. As market interest rises, can XRP price stage a recovery? XRP price today trades at $2.19 after a nearly 6% drop in 24 hours. XRP Price Hints at a Rebound as Weekly Active Addresses Hit ATH Data from Santiment shows that the number of weekly active XRP addresses has increased significantly over the past week. These addresses have surged to 1.15M, indicating high network usage and market interest. XRP Weekly Active Addresses This rise has also coincided with a surge in transaction activity. According to market analyst ScottMelker, XRP transactions have skyrocketed to $5 billion within 24 hours. At the same time, wallet activity has increased by more than 600%. The surge in active addresses and transaction count may precede a rebound for XRP price due to rising interest. However, such a rebound is dependent on whether this rise in network activity is sustained. Short Sellers Increase Positions on XRP Data from Coinglass shows a massive increase in short positions on XRP. This is after a sudden spike in negative funding rates, which points towards increased pressure from short sellers betting that XRP price will drop further. XRP Funding Rates If the funding rates remain negative for an extended period, it increases the risk of a short squeeze. If Ripple price makes a sudden recovery, and these short sellers are forced to close their positions, it could accelerate the upward momentum. XRP Price Retests Multi-Month Support as Sell Signal Emerges XRP price has dropped to retest a multi-month support level at $2.14. Ripple has bounced from this support price before, but if sell-side pressure continues, it may lead to a breach of this critical level. The MACD line has crossed below the signal line and formed a sell signal, which may push Ripple price lower. However, the Stoch RSI suggests that Ripple may be oversold, which could hint at possible seller exhaustion and trigger a reversal. For Ripple price to avert a drop below the $2 psychological level, it needs to flip critical resistance at $2.60. If it makes a decisive breakout above this level, it could pave the way for XRP price to rally past $3 . XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart The rising network activity suggests that market interest in Ripple is rising. If this surge leads to traders accumulating XRP during the dip , it could trigger an XRP price recovery.

In a Mar. 10 post on X, Bailey suggested that Silk Road liquidations could be happening despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, potentially contributing to the recent downturn in BTC’s price. Bailey’s claim sparked discussion within the cryptocurrency community. If the DOJ has been liquidating America’s bitcoin with haste (in defiance of the President) ever since getting court approval to do so 3 months ago… then Bitcoin’s price action makes perfect sense. — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) March 10, 2025 Some users have rejected the notion asserting that the DOJ’s holdings, just like Germany’s 2024 Bitcoin sales , lack enough volume to have a substantial effect on the market. Others pointed to broader macroeconomic factors as having a greater impact on Bitcoin’s price. Bailey has also previously suggested that Trump should enable Bitcoin payments for his proposed “Gold Card,” aimed at attracting foreign investors. Though entirely theoretical, the concept shows the rising convergence of global capital flows, politics, and Bitcoin. At the same time, some experts have proposed selling off other assets seized by the U.S. government to prop up Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . As of Mar. 10, the federal government held 60,850 Ethereum ( ETH ), around $125 million, 122 million Tether ( USDT ), and other assets such as Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ), according to data from Arkham Intelligence. Proponents of the idea have pointed out that these holdings have the potential to provide an extra 5,000 BTC if they are liquidated.

Risky assets like Bitcoin may be under more pressure if bond spreads continue to expand, he cautioned. Bitcoin is like playing a game of Chicken with central banks.

In this thread, I'll explain how these factors interact… pic.twitter.com/gWaGlVyo2A — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) March 10, 2025 But he remained optimistic, pointing to factors like growing nation-state Bitcoin holdings, possible ETF inflows, and the possibility that Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy will buy up to 200,000 BTC this year. As the market continues to respond to the uncertainties surrounding Trump’s economic policies, the price of Bitcoin fell to $80,052 on Mar. 10, a 7% decrease over the previous day. Traders are now watching key economic reports, including the Consumer Price Index on Mar.12 and the Producer Price Index on Mar.13, which could influence Bitcoin’s next move.

A correction of this magnitude is nothing new in a bull market, and previous cycles have seen larger pullbacks, so prices could drop even further. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted further losses on X on March 9, saying that BTC would retest $78,000, where it last hit on Feb. 28. “If it fails, $75,000 is next in the crosshairs,” he added. Meanwhile, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, Anthony Pompliano, observed that the Fear and Greed Index for crypto one year ago was at “extreme greed” of 92, and today it is at “extreme fear” of 17. “Bitcoin is 20% higher over the same time frame,” he said before adding, “Don’t get tricked by online sentiment. It is all noise.” Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back was also bullish, saying that people are undervaluing the US strategic Bitcoin reserve announcement : “It is huge for moving the overton window, the actual US government promoting Bitcoin. provides the new ultimate reference for sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds to add bitcoin allocations.” people are undervaluing the US strategic bitcoin reserve announcement: it is huge for moving the overton window, the actual US government promoting bitcoin. provides the new ultimate reference for sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds to add bitcoin allocations. — Adam Back (@adam3us) March 9, 2025 Price Leads Narrative Analyst Miles Deutscher was a little more pragmatic, saying that “price often leads narrative.” “Even though it seems like there is no north star right now, at any point, we could see a huge rally – and everyone will create reasons to be bullish again,” he said before adding that it has happened time and time again. BTC was trading down 4.3% on the day at $82,394 at the time of writing and had lost 11% over the past seven days.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 5.61% in 24-hours to $2.19. Ripple’s XRP finally neared the long-awaited $3 mark after President Donald Trump announced a new U.S. strategic crypto reserve that will include XRP and other digital assets. The number of active XRP addresses has shot up by an astonishing 620% in a week, rising from 74,589 to 462,650. XRP price is currently down 5.61% to $2.19. If the bullish momentum kicks in, XRP could aim at its next resistance levels at $2.35. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, XRP price will remain range bound between its key support levels at $2.08 and $2.09. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $2.46 Market Cap $141.02 billion Trading Volume $14.24 billion Circulating Supply 57.94 billion XRP All-time High $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time Low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 24-hour high $2.95 24-hour low $2.43 XRP Price Prediction 2025 A few factors will likely shape XRP’s market performance in 2025. The main factor that will decide XRP’s trend in 2025 is the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . Successively, analysts are expecting a resolution in March, considering that the SEC has dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. However, there’s more in store, as the U.S. President Donald Trump had mentioned XRP being included in the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve. Moreover, Ripple and Ondo Finance will be bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to XRPL, to improve speed, efficiency, and adoption by institutions. Talking about on-chain, the active receiving addresses have shot up to 356,581, compared to 43,882 on February 17. XRP Ledger Active Receiving Addresses If things go in favor of Ripple, XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness a strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be at $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040 and 2050.

Not even Trump’s advice to “never sell your Bitcoin” at Friday’s crypto summit was enough to boost the asset back over $90,000, and it has weakened over the weekend. Markets will have key inflation reports to digest this week, and hotter-than-expected figures could rattle risk on assets such as stocks and crypto. Economic Events March 10 to 14 Wednesday will see the release of February’s Core CPI data. The Consumer Price Index is one of the two key inflation indicators as it reflects price trends in the economy, shapes consumer spending, and directly affects the Fed’s policy rate decisions. Bitcoin prices fell following higher-than-expected CPI figures in February, so history could repeat itself if the figures are not favorable. “A hot CPI print will likely scare the market,” Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, told Reuters. “The market still wants the Fed to come to the rescue… Until inflation and inflation expectations come down, the Fed is handcuffed,” he added. The reports are followed by February’s PPI (Producer Price Index) report on Thursday, which reflects input prices for producers and manufacturers. This data measures the costs of producing consumer goods, which directly affects retail pricing and is also viewed as a signal of inflationary pressures. US inflation has increased every month since September and hit 3% last month, and the trend is likely to continue with CPI for February expected to have climbed 0.3%, according to a Reuters poll. The inflation reports will be among the last key pieces of data before the Federal Reserve next meets on March 18 and 19, when it is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at 4.25% to 4.5% Key Events This Week: 1.

February PPI Inflation data – Thursday 6. MI Consumer Sentiment data -… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 9, 2025 A preliminary consumer sentiment analysis is due on Friday, offering further insight into consumer inflation expectations. This week, job openings and jobless claims reports will also be released, offering insight into changing labor market trends. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets continue to weaken with total capitalization tanking 6.5% on the day in a fall to $2.8 trillion. Bitcoin has slumped 4.5% in a fall to just over $80,000 in early trading in Asia on Monday morning. The asset made a slight recovery to reclaim $82,000 at the time of writing, however, it remains down more than 11% since this time last week. Ethereum has fared worse as usual, tanking 6% to a 16-month low of $2,000 on March 10 and it hasn’t shown signs of recovery. The altcoins were bleeding with larger losses for Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, Pi Network, Chainlink, and Hedera.

This latest decline places the cryptocurrency roughly 25% below its all-time high of $109,900. Analysts attribute the downturn to ongoing trade tensions—linked to President Donald Trump’s latest tariff measures—and the fears of a looming recession. Meanwhile, a weakening US Dollar Index (DXY), which has fallen from 110 to 103 since mid-January, coinciding with Trump’s second term in office and could be a potential bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price. In a series of posts on X, Jamie Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, offers a look at the current market environment, highlighting two key metrics that could shape central bank policy—and, by extension, Bitcoin’s trajectory. “Bitcoin is like playing a game of Chicken with central banks,” Coutts writes. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Signal Aligns With Price Tops, CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals He explained that while the dollar’s recent decline supports a bullish framework for Bitcoin, rising Treasury bond volatility (tracked by the MOVE Index) and widening corporate bond spreads are causing concern: Coutts emphasized the role of US Treasuries as the global collateral asset. Any spike in their volatility, he argued, forces lenders to impose larger haircuts on collateral, tightening liquidity. “Rising volatility forces lenders to apply haircuts on collateral, thereby tightening liquidity. Above 110 [on the MOVE Index] and I suspect there will be a few concerns at the central planner levels.” Over the past three weeks, US investment-grade corporate bond spreads have been widening, a shift Coutts views as a signal that risk assets—including Bitcoin—could face pressure: “This suggests that the demand keeping yields compressed relative to Treasuries is fading—and further widening could be negative for risk assets.” Despite these cautionary flags, Coutts remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s medium-term prospects, primarily due to the dollar’s “rapid decline.” He noted that the dollar’s drop in March—one of the most significant monthly dips in 12 years—historically has coincided with bullish inflection points in Bitcoin’s price. According to his research, “They have all occurred at Bitcoin bear market troughs (inflection points) or mid-cycle bull markets (trend continuations).” Related Reading: If This Happens, Bitcoin Price Will Shoot To $140,000, Says Analyst While acknowledging the limited historical dataset for Bitcoin, Coutts also cited key catalysts he believes could propel the digital asset higher: Nation-State Adoption: “A global nation-state race is underway,” Coutts wrote, describing a scenario in which countries either include Bitcoin in their strategic reserves or ramp up mining efforts. Corporate Accumulation: He points to the possibility of companies—particularly Strategy (MSTR)—adding 100,000 to 200,000 BTC this year. ETF Positions: Exchange-traded funds may “double their positions,” further driving institutional inflows. Liquidity Dynamics: In Coutts’s words, “The Spice Must Flow.” Coutts also mentioned that Bitcoin appears to be “filling a big gap” and reiterated his view that a slide below the high-$70,000 range would signal a fundamental market shift. Meanwhile, he sees central bankers edging closer to possible intervention as Treasury volatility and credit spreads climb: “If Treasury volatility and bond spreads keep rising, asset prices will continue their decline. Meanwhile, this will likely push the central planners to act.” In closing, Coutts offered a concise summary of why he believes Bitcoin is effectively locked in a showdown with central banks: “Think of Bitcoin as a high-stakes game of chicken with the central planners. With their options dwindling—and assuming HODLers remain unleveraged—the odds are increasingly in the Bitcoin owner’s favor.” For now, the world’s largest cryptocurrency appears to be treading a line between macroeconomic headwinds—highlighted by a volatile bond market—and the tailwinds of a weakening dollar. Whether Bitcoin continues to retreat or resumes its long-term ascent will likely depend on how global policymakers respond to mounting bond market pressures—and whether holders are prepared to keep playing “chicken” with the central planners. At press time, BTC traded at $82,091.

This has caused the creation of certain tokens like Monero for privacy and anonymity. Combining Monero with new DeFi project Remittix will ensure the highest form of security as far as crypto liquidation and transfers are concerned. Already, XMR and Ripple users are flocking to the new project, even if it’s for different reasons. The XRP price is already suffering from the negative crypto policy backlash in the past few days. Here’s more on the crypto gist. Ripple Users are Withdrawing Holdings from XRP The Donald Trump-led administration promised to have an easier, softer grip on crypto regulations, allowing the sector to grow adequately. However, for the most part, all the policies in these first few months have not yielded the results most crypto folk would expect. An example is the hard fall that hit the XRP price after Trump’s executive order for a Strategy crypto reserve. The reserve seeks to use the top stable cryptos as a hedge against inflation, but the current focus is on Bitcoin. Subsequently, metrics like the XRP price and other chart parameters started to fall. As there was little hope for a change in the order at the White House Crypto Summit, most XRP traders have started to transfer out their holdings. Some traders withdrew about $130 million worth of Ripple tokens from Binance, contributing to the 1.31% weekly loss. Monero with Remittix: Anonymity and Privacy at its Best! The XMR blockchain has a reputation for being the strictest platform when it comes to privacy. While the regular crypto network promotes decentralisation and anonymous trading, Monero takes its own policies even a notch higher. As a result, the blockchain is a hub of sorts for criminal asset transfers, especially the active black market in the US and the Middle East. Already, the US Treasury has had to seize $1.6 million worth of crypto assets associated with the Nemesis darknet, assets that were traded across blacklisted Monero and Bitcoin addresses. Still, all the anonymity only makes Monero a top choice for transactions. XMR coins trade at $219.56, with a 2.21% fall in the past week. Using the Monero chain together with Remittix (RTX) will only boost the level of privacy and anonymity on crypto transactions. That’s probably where that flux to the RTX presale is coming from. Transfer Crypto Tokens in Private with Remittix Privacy, especially with the level of globalization we’re experiencing, is going to be really difficult to navigate on the regular crypto network. There are chain monitors that flag huge token movements and asset movements associated with certain wallets. That’s where Remittix gains the upper hand over the average crypto blockchain. Sure, traders can withdraw their crypto assets directly into fiat bank accounts, but the transaction can never be traced back to the crypto platform. The Remittix API incorporates one-time-generated smart contracts that operate independent of the blockchain, converting crypto assets into appropriate fiat currencies before resolving the transactions in the provided fiat accounts. By eliminating the introduction of intermediate service providers for converting and resolving transactions, Remittix removes the possibility of being traced, making it a secure, anonymous route to get crypto tokens from wallets into fiat bank accounts. Plus, unlike Ripple, the Remittix project caters directly to traders’ needs, allowing them to liquidate their assets directly into their fiat accounts without paying more charges than the standard gas fees. While Ripple might be best for corporations like banks, Remittix is the crypto equivalent of SWIFT–fast, secure, private, and user-friendly. Get Into the Remittix Presale Early! Joining a new project early is the fastest way to benefitting maximally from it. Remittix is more of an investment for the long run–the anonymity and privacy are big selling points for crypto traders, along with its drastically low fees. Even then, you could get some ROI from the presale, but only if you buy early enough. Each RTX coin goes for $0.0734 now–build your stash and hold for even greater returns!

Since then, though, the valuation has crashed by over 50%. Pi Network’s native token started trading on February 20 when the team launched its Open Network. The massive milestone was highly expected and came nearly six years after the project’s birth. During its first trading days, PI’s price experienced huge volatility, ranging from $0.64 to a peak of almost $3 (registered on February 27). Since then, though, the valuation has been gradually declining. Several hours ago, PI tanked to as low as $1.26 before rebounding to the current $1.41 (per CoinGecko’s data). This represents a 12% decrease on a daily scale and 16% on a weekly basis . PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most evident factor negatively affecting PI’s performance is the overall correction of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly plunged to $80,000, while many leading altcoins are also deep in the red for the day. Another element could be Binance’s intervention, or more precisely, its lack of action. Last month, the biggest crypto exchange held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see PI available for trading. The results became official on February 27, with over 86% of the voters clicking the “yes” option. However, the company has remained silent on the matter. A potential listing would boost the coin’s liquidity and accessibility and could create upward pressure on the price. Some well-known crypto exchanges that have already allowed trading services with PI include Bitget, OKX, and MEXC.

With only a few days left until the final migration deadline, many users report unresolved technical issues, raising concerns about the project's management and transparency. The Pi Network has set March 14, 2025 , as the critical deadline for users to complete their Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and migrate their tokens. According to the network’s announcement, those who fail to finalize the process by 8:00 AM UTC will lose most of their Pi holdings, except for coins mined in the last six months. The team argues that multiple extensions have already been given to ensure maximum participation, but the current deadline is final. Despite these assurances, many Pioneers report being stuck in the migration process, unable to transfer their Pi despite completing all required steps. Some users claim that they have followed every instruction but remain locked out of Mainnet migration. One user, Jaro Giesbrecht , expressed his frustration on social media, stating that despite completing the checklist, his balance remains unverified, with no response from the support team. Other users echo similar concerns, describing the process as confusing and unhelpful. Several have taken to social media to demand an extension of the migration deadline until all technical problems are resolved. A major complaint revolves around Step 9 on the Mainnet checklist— “Migrate to Mainnet” —which some users say remains unresolved, preventing their tokens from being transferred. The controversy comes as Pi Coin experiences a significant price decline in the market. Over the past week, Pi Coin has dropped sharply, with its price down by double digits. Some analysts remain hopeful that Pi Day, March 14 , will bring a price rebound, as excitement builds over potential market movements. However, the token’s price struggles raise questions about its long-term sustainability. Adding to the uncertainty, Pi Network supporters are pushing for a Binance listing . The exchange recently launched a ""Vote to List"" feature, allowing users to vote on new coin listings. The Pi Coin community overwhelmingly voted in favor, with 86% of participants supporting a listing. However, Binance retains the final decision-making power, and so far, the exchange has not made any official announcements regarding Pi Coin’s fate. The lack of response has fueled anger among Pioneers, with many accusing Binance of ignoring community demands. In protest, frustrated users have flooded Binance and Bybit with one-star reviews on the Google Play Store, attempting to pressure the exchanges into taking action. This reaction follows previous skepticism from industry leaders, including the Bybit CEO , who has openly called Pi Network a scam. As the March 14 deadline approaches , tensions continue to rise. If Pi Network does not address users' concerns, it risks further backlash from the community. Many Pioneers now face the possibility of losing their tokens due to unresolved technical issues, leaving the project’s credibility in question. Whether Binance will move forward with a listing remains uncertain, but for now, Pi Network users remain in limbo.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-10 07:56:51

Interestingly, the most significant drop came from the Ethereum price struggles, catering to the 65% of the loss. In addition, the rest of the altcoins took a considerable toll, revealing the poor state of the market. The reports suggest that $619M has been liquidated in the last 24 hours, resulting in the global crypto market cap declining to $2.7T, which was last seen before Trump’s election win. Crypto Market Crash: The Trump Effect on Crypto The crypto stance of Donald Trump has led to the crypto space’s betterment. The crypto market witnessed significant gains but lows as well. This started with investors’ rising confidence in the industry, Bitcoin’s price hitting new highs, Trump announcing a U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, hosting the Crypto Summit, and much more. These events reveal the ongoing developments and the effect Trump has on the crypto space. Before this, the crypto industry was battling stricter regulations instead of developments. With the Crypto Summit, more things will align positively for the industry. However, critics have presented a different take, especially on Trump’s crypto portfolio as a conflict of interest. With higher expectations and rising uncertainty, the crypto market crashed. Analysts believe this happened as uncertainty surrounded these key events. However, things may turn in favor in the long term with these events catering to benefit the industry with grown adoption. Donald Trump Crypto Move: A Risky Precedent? Amid the high optimism around the U.S. Strategic Reserve, analysts have pointed out several risks with forming a government-backed reserve. The Solana co-founder’s controversial post claims it is against the nature of decentralization, while the others add that it could result in market manipulation by the government. In addition, it could bring corruption risk, favoritism of assets, regulatory capture, as they could shape policies in their favor, and much more. Crypto critic Peter Schiff even mocked Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve, claiming he is launching one himself. These incidents reveal the investors’ diverted sentiments on these Trump events, resulting in the crypto market crash. Conclusion: Was Crypto Better Before Donald Trump? Along with highs, crypto has seen devastating lows since Trump’s political resurgence. While his crypto policies aim to make the United States the crypto capital, they have also increased volatility. Along with that, ethical concerns are also rising, with many questioning Trump’s effect. With numerous crypto market crash incidents since Donald Trump came into power, few critics believe the market was better before. However, this is a conditional claim, and the outlook seems optimistic for the long term, as the U.S. The President’s crypto stance could push for global adoption and regulation.

While some states have introduced regulatory sandboxes for financial and blockchain innovation, the absence of a nationwide approach makes compliance across different jurisdictions complex. Experts argue that establishing a unified sandbox would provide a controlled testing environment for emerging financial technologies, allowing regulators to develop well-informed policies while fostering responsible growth in the industry. Industry figures, including representatives from OilXCoin and Asset Token Ventures LLC, emphasize that while state-level sandboxes offer some flexibility, they lack the scale and coordination necessary for businesses to expand across borders. A federal sandbox would create a standardized framework that enhances clarity, encourages innovation, and maintains consumer protection. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major hurdle for blockchain and AI-driven fintech projects , as companies struggle to navigate varying interpretations of digital asset regulations. Several countries, including the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates, have already implemented national regulatory sandboxes , giving them a competitive edge in attracting fintech investments. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK pioneered this approach in 2014, enabling fintech startups to test products in a supervised environment while regulators refined their policies. Similarly, the UAE has four distinct sandboxes that focus on digital banking, blockchain, payment systems, and AI. Despite support from various industry leaders and some US regulators, challenges remain. The fragmented US regulatory system , with oversight from multiple agencies like the SEC and CFTC , complicates the process of establishing a single sandbox framework. Congressional approval would be required to implement such a system, potentially facing legal and political obstacles. However, bipartisan collaboration and regulatory flexibility could help bridge the gap between innovation and oversight, ensuring the US remains competitive in the global fintech space.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-10 08:00:27

However, after swift negotiations with the hacker, the platform managed to recover most of the stolen funds. The attacker agreed to return a large portion, keeping the rest as a bug bounty in exchange for their cooperation. This incident sheds light on both the vulnerabilities within decentralized finance and the increasing trend of ethical hacking in the industry. The breach, which occurred on March 5, stemmed from an exploit in an outdated version of the platform’s Fusion v1 resolver smart contract . Attackers leveraged this flaw to conduct unauthorized transactions . Notably, the exploit did not directly affect 1inch users but instead targeted a third-party market maker, TrustedVolumes. Upon detecting the intrusion, 1inch promptly redeployed its resolver contracts to prevent further exploits and minimize additional risks. Security firm Decurity, which analyzed the attack, confirmed that the hacker initiated an on-chain message shortly after carrying out the exploit. They proposed a deal to return the funds in exchange for a reward. Negotiations between TrustedVolumes and the attacker led to a rare resolution where a hacker voluntarily returned a significant portion of stolen assets. This highlights a shift in DeFi security responses, where white-hat negotiations sometimes prove more effective than traditional recovery methods. While this case ended with a mostly positive outcome, it marks the second major security incident for 1inch in the past six months. In late 2024, the platform suffered a front-end compromise due to a supply chain attack, exposing users to phishing threats. These repeated security challenges emphasize the importance of continuous smart contract audits , proactive monitoring, and swift mitigation strategies. In response to the latest attack, 1inch has urged all resolvers to transition to Fusion v2 , its updated version, which features enhanced security measures to prevent similar exploits. The company is also strengthening internal auditing procedures to ensure a higher level of protection against future vulnerabilities. Despite successfully recovering the stolen assets, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the persistent risks in decentralized finance. As DeFi protocols continue to evolve, maintaining rigorous security standards remains crucial for protecting users and reinforcing trust in the industry.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-10 08:03:34

While these established assets have strong fundamentals, their growth potential appears limited in the short term. As a result, investors are increasingly turning their attention to high-reward opportunities in the presale sector, where early-stage projects like The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) are generating significant interest. Could $TLD be the best altcoin to buy right now? Let’s analyze the market conditions, the struggles of Solana and Dogecoin, and why $TLD is rapidly gaining momentum. Solana (SOL) Faces Resistance as It Tries to Rebound Solana, often praised for its high-speed transactions and low fees, has been struggling to regain bullish momentum. Currently trading around $142, SOL has faced resistance at $147.88, preventing further breakout attempts. Analysts suggest that while Solana’s long-term outlook remains strong, its short-term performance may be sluggish due to profit-taking and macroeconomic factors affecting the crypto market. Many investors are hesitant to enter SOL at current levels, as the market cap is already substantial, limiting the potential for exponential gains. With Ethereum dominating the Layer 1 sector, Solana must prove itself through continued network growth and adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) Struggles with Speculation and High Volatility Dogecoin has long been a favorite among retail traders, thanks to its strong community and backing from public figures like Elon Musk. However, DOGE has struggled to hold key support levels, currently trading around $0.20, after a 1.93% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite efforts to increase its utility through Dogecoin’s integration with X (formerly Twitter) and potential payment use cases, the meme coin remains highly speculative. Without strong fundamentals or a clear roadmap for long-term growth, DOGE investors are looking for alternative assets with better upside potential. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) – A High-Growth Alternative with Real Utility While Solana and Dogecoin battle market uncertainties, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) is rapidly becoming one of the most sought-after early-stage crypto investments. The project introduces an innovative Play-to-Invest model that seamlessly integrates blockchain gaming and DeFi, creating a unique ecosystem where players can mine resources, battle for rewards, and gain early access to high-potential Web3 projects. Despite being in the presale stage, The Last Dwarfs already has a fully functional platform with over 300,000 users. The platform is integrated with Telegram and the TON blockchain, allowing it to tap into a massive audience of over 900 million potential users. The $TLD ecosystem is built around a gamified launchpad, where players can engage in the game while simultaneously investing in high potential tokens. $TLD Presale – The Final Opportunity Before Major Growth The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) has just entered Stage 2 of its presale, meaning that early investors have already missed the lowest price. However, there is still time to buy before the next price increase. Key benefits of the presale include: 300% APY staking rewards for early adopters. A referral program that allows investors to earn extra tokens for every referred purchase. With the presale rapidly selling out and the official launch approaching, $TLD is positioning itself as one of the most exciting investment opportunities of 2025. Final Thoughts – The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) Stands Out as the Best Crypto to Buy Now As Solana and Dogecoin navigate uncertain market conditions, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) emerges as a high-growth alternative with real-world utility and strong adoption potential. Unlike traditional altcoins, which rely on market speculation, $TLD offers a tangible use case through its gamified investment model, making it an attractive option for investors looking for long-term growth. With Stage 2 of the presale selling out fast, now may be the last chance to get in before $TLD hits major exchanges and gains even more traction. Investors looking for possibly the next 100x opportunity should keep a close eye on The Last Dwarfs ($TLD). Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano’s ADA led losses with a nearly 10% slump over the past 24 hours, data shows, with XRP falling more than 7%. BNB Chain’s BNB, ether (ETH) and tron's TRX) fell 5%, while BTC lost 4%. This has sent the well-followed crypto fear and green index to a multi-year low reading of 17 — which indicates ‘extreme fear’ — in its lowest level since mid-2023. The index measures investor emotions and ranges from 0 (lowest sentiment) to 100 (highest sentiment), helping identify whether investors are too scared (potential buying opportunity) or too greedy (possible market correction). It is based on price volatility, momentum, social media sentiment, Google trends data, and bitcoin’s overall market share. It tends to act as a contrarian indicator in the short term. Major tokens have fully pared all gains made after President Donald Trump announced a strategic crypto reserve in the U.S. earlier this month, sending tokens XRP, Solana’s SOL, and ADA higher by as much as 60% in days following. Traders expected windfall plans of buying pressure from the U.S. for majors, but hopes were doused as Trump repurposed previously seized BTC holdings as a reserve and said non-BTC seized assets would be considered a ‘stockpile’ of tokens. Then, an anticipated White House Crypto Summit on Mar.7 ended in a “nothingburger” without the expected bold announcements. The summit resulted in a framework for stablecoin legislation by August and a promise of lighter regulation, but these outcomes did not stimulate the market as anticipated. Losses were magnified as global markets took a hit amid an ongoing tariff war sparked by Trump and other world leaders. A widely tracked dollar index (DYX) , a measure of the U.S. dollar's strength, is at its lowest since November, to under 105 (a DXY index above 100 is considered strong, which tends to put pressure on risk assets). Traders are now in a wait-and-watch mode as they approach the coming months, mainly eying macroeconomic data and decisions for cues on further positioning. “The summit signaled for more optimism,” Kevin Guo, Director of HashKey Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Despite expectations for more substantial announcements as crypto assets continue to follow US equities in a negative trend in the wake of February's job report that saw generally stable results despite government job cuts. “Investors don't expect a reverse of the trend as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell assured that the Fed will continue to show patience on a bumpy road to a 2% inflation rate, which further lowered expectations of a rate cut this year,” Guo added. Traders have been buying short-dated treasuries, per Bloomberg , expecting the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates as soon as May to keep the economy from deteriorating — a sign of hope for crypto bulls and lower rates tend to create inflow into riskier assets.",Markets|Fear & Greed Index|Bitcoin|Dogecoin|XRP|ADA,EN,0,0,MARKET|ADA|DOGE|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-10 08:04:17

However, on-chain activity suggests that the positive momentum for DOGE could resume soon amid a 270% surge in active addresses over the last 24 hours. Also, the DOGE whale activity has surged, indicating big players are buying the dips, thereby hinting a potential rebound moving ahead. Dogecoin Price Rebound Ahead? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical support level for DOGE as it approaches the lower boundary of its current price channel. According to Martinez, maintaining a position above $0.16 is essential for the cryptocurrency to sustain momentum and potentially fuel a strong rebound. Source: Ali Martinez As of press time, the Dogecoin price is trading 9.29% down at $0.1726 with its daily trading volume surging 115% to more than $2.01 billion. Also, the open interest has tanked 12.91% to $1.45 billion while the 24-hour liquidations have shot to $21 million, per the Coinglass data . Previously, analyst Ali Martinez stated that if bulls manage to hold above the DOGE support levels of $0.16, it can trigger a rally toward $2.74 or even as high as $6.24. DOGE Active Addresses and Whale Activity Despite the Dogecoin price heading lower amid broader crypto market correction , market analysts are bullish amid strong on-chain developments. In a significant development for DOGE, the number of active addresses on the network has skyrocketed by 270% in just 24 hours, increasing from 71,750 to 264,000. Source: Ali Charts On the other hand, the largest whales on the Dogecoin network have reportedly accumulated 1.7 billion DOGE over the past 72 hours. This massive accumulation suggests that major players could be positioned for the next big move, underscoring growing activity and interest in the meme coin. Additionally, the Dogecoin wallet addresses have reached an all-time high, hinting further momentum ahead. Key Demand Zones for DOGE Pseudonymous analyst “TheGift94” has outlined potential demand zones where DOGE might stabilize amidst intense selling pressure. In a recent TradingView analysis, the analyst identified three “buying demand zones” critical to the meme coin’s price movement. The first support zone, at $0.20, was breached as Dogecoin’s price fell by 13% yesterday, closing at $0.1678. The analyst further highlighted two additional zones that could act as support levels: $0.16 and $0.13. These levels are now being closely monitored as potential turning points for the meme coin.

Like most top altcoins, the Cardano coin exploded, maintaining a 40% gain on the weekly chart. The Ethereum price also retested $2,500, although it now trades downward. However, IntelMarkets (INTL) stole the spotlight after hitting the $11 million fundraising milestone in record time, joining its 900% upswing in the past few months. Scheduled to go live this quarter, experts believe it might be a more compelling alternative than top crypto coins like ETH and ADA. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Big Thing in the DeFAI Sector IntelMarkets (INTL) stands out for its significant upside potential as a low-cap AI gem. Its bullish narrative—a blend of artificial intelligence and DeFi—further drives demand, contributing to the growing interest. Boasting higher growth prospects than the Cardano coin and more budget-friendly than the Ethereum price, INTL basks in the spotlight. By combining AI technology, blockchain and DeFi, IntelMarkets will stand out as an AI-powered trading platform. Unlike conventional exchanges, it will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels, offering unmatched computing power. Its dual-chain compatibility and quantum-proof custody solution are other distinguishing features. In the tenth stage of the ICO, it is heavily discounted at $0.091, presenting an opportunity to invest early in what has been dubbed the future of trading. In addition to its 900% rally from the initial price of $0.009, a 75x rally is projected after Tier-1 exchange listings. Hailed as 2025’s best ICO, it is among the best altcoins to invest in this year. Cardano (ADA): 40% Weekly Gain The Cardano coin is up over 40% on the weekly chart, retailing around $0.94. Primed for another breakout above $1 after hitting $1.1 earlier this week, it is one of the altcoins to watch. Moreover, key technical indicators like the 10-EMA and 20-VWMA hint at further upswings in the Cardano coin price. At the same time, its inclusion in the US crypto reserve sparks bold price predictions. Cryptotarget11, a crypto analyst on X, identifies $1.10 and $1.20 as the next resistance zones for the Cardano coin and a potential breakout above $1.50. CW8900, a leading expert on X (formerly Twitter), predicts sustained bullish momentum, stating there is no “significant sell wall until $1.95.” Despite the upside potential of the Cardano coin, it pales compared to IntelMarkets, a new AI coin. This new AI coin is dubbed the best new crypto to invest in due to its bullish narrative and small market size. Ethereum (ETH): Technical Indicators Hint at a Bounce The Ethereum price fell from $2,500 and currently consolidates between $2,100 and $2,200. It is down over 20% in the past month, which, on the bright side, puts it in an attractive buy zone. Moreover, as a part of the US crypto reserve, it is primed to skyrocket. Also, its long-term outlook is promising, as evident in the bold Ethereum price predictions being thrown out. Web3Samantha, a crypto analyst, targets a bounce between $2,100 and $2,600 before breaking out above $4,000. A more bullish Ethereum price prediction was made by CryptoBoj—a rally past $10,000 this bull run. Further, technical indicators like the 9-HMA and the neutral 14-day RSI suggest a bounce in the Ethereum price. Despite this, savvy investors are betting more on the INTL token. Tipped to soar as high as 75x this year, it is among the best altcoins to invest in. IntelMarkets (INTL): In the Spotlight Alongside Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) Early funding in the ongoing IntelMarkets presale crossed $11.3 million in record time, putting it in the spotlight. Given its bullish AI narrative and upside potential, it is a better bet than the Cardano coin. Moreover, at $0.091, it is significantly undervalued compared to the current Ethereum price, adding to its retail appeal.

The Key Opinion Leader (KOL) Label monitors the holdings of influencers with over 100,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), revealing whether they truly believe in the projects they promote or are simply taking part in paid endorsements. This update comes at a time when meme coins are rapidly gaining traction, often with little utility or long-term stability. The introduction of this tracking feature has sparked heated discussions among crypto investors and traders. Supporters see it as a move toward greater transparency , making it easier to distinguish between genuine investment recommendations and potential pump-and-dump schemes. Critics, however, argue that the tool could be misleading, as many influencers use multiple wallets to avoid detection. Reports suggest that nearly three out of four influencer-backed tokens fail , with their value dropping drastically within a few months. Research also indicates that influencers with larger followings tend to promote tokens with the worst performance. This raises concerns about the ethical responsibility of high-profile figures in the crypto space, as many influencers allegedly receive large payments for promotional posts while secretly selling off their holdings. Recent investigations have exposed several influencers involved in coordinated price manipulation schemes, further eroding trust in the market. By using Arkham’s tracking tool, investors can verify whether influencers actually hold onto the tokens they promote. If an influencer quickly dumps a token after pushing it, that could be a red flag signaling potential deception. Crypto leaders, including Tron founder Justin Sun, emphasize the importance of conducting thorough research instead of blindly following influencer endorsements. Many experts suggest evaluating real social engagement , checking project fundamentals, and reviewing a token’s underlying structure before making investment decisions.

The Broccoli-themed tokens gained popularity after CZ shared a story about his dog, but the rapid launch of multiple versions has left investors confused and caused prices to plummet. Many believe that consolidating these fragmented projects would increase the chances of securing a Binance listing and reviving investor interest. The proposal to unite Broccoli meme coins has sparked intense debate. A popular trader argued that the odds of any single Broccoli token achieving major gains are slim, but if combined, they could see significant growth. The problem, as pointed out by community members, is that investors don’t know which version of Broccoli will receive enough liquidity to sustain momentum. This uncertainty has led to price crashes and skepticism about the future of the tokens. Earlier this year, Binance Alpha introduced three Broccoli-themed projects, raising speculation about an eventual exchange listing. However, all three have struggled, with prices dropping sharply after their initial hype. Investors now question whether a merger could be a lifeline for the meme coins, providing a stronger foundation for future growth. CZ’s stance on the matter has further fueled speculation. While he has not officially endorsed any particular project, his acknowledgment of the idea suggests that a single, unified Broccoli token might stand a better chance of long-term success. This aligns with Binance’s approach to community-driven projects, where listing decisions are often influenced by user demand and engagement. Despite CZ’s comments, the execution of such a merger remains uncertain. The biggest challenge lies in uniting different Broccoli communities under one token. Each version of Broccoli has its own backers, making it difficult to determine a fair way to consolidate them without alienating some investors. Additionally, the current meme coin market is volatile , and even a well-planned merger does not guarantee price stability. Some traders see this as an opportunity to clean up the Broccoli ecosystem and increase its legitimacy. If the merger gains traction, it could lead to a larger, more organized community with greater influence over exchange listings. However, without a clear strategy, the plan could backfire, leading to further price instability. Another factor that could influence the future of Broccoli tokens is Binance’s evolving stance on meme coins. Recently, Binance introduced a new voting feature that allows communities to decide which tokens get listed. This mechanism could play a key role in determining whether a unified Broccoli coin has a real chance of securing a spot on the exchange. While the concept of merging meme coins is not new, its success largely depends on community participation and investor confidence. If the plan moves forward, it could reshape the way meme coins evolve, offering a model for other fragmented projects. However, the risk of failure remains high , and investors should remain cautious about the potential impact of consolidation on token value. For now, the future of Broccoli meme coins remains uncertain. With CZ’s support, the discussion around a merger is gaining momentum, but it is unclear whether developers and investors will agree on a unified approach. The coming weeks could determine whether Broccoli becomes a stronger force in the meme coin space or fades into obscurity.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|MARKET|BNB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-10 08:10:39

Looking for a retest, the price is up today following a steady increase in the past days. After witnessing a notable breakdown in February, CRO managed to stay above $0.068 and established support in the late month. This led to an early month bounce, and the price increased briefly to $0.1035. A sharp rejection from that level rolled the price back to the bottom, but luckily, the previous support level held well on Tuesday, and the price increased steadily to where it’s changing hands at $0.092. These price actions have created a double-bottom pattern on the 4-hour chart. But the bullish pattern looks more like a trap as the overall crypto market still follows strong negative sentiments weekly. The price will likely face some threat anytime soon. It currently trades near the recent monthly high. Reclaiming this high could bring a sigh of relief, bringing a suspension in the bearish trend. Failure to scale through it could lead to another impulsive bearish move. That said, CRO is still considered bearish on the daily chart. Having seen a temporal halt in selling, it has lost over 20% in the past month. More losses can be expected as soon as it resumes drops. CRO’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Right now, CRO’s bulls are charging back at $0.1035. If they reclaim it, the next target resistance level to keep in mind is $0.123. Above it lies the $0.1495 level. While there’s still room for a drop, the price must dip below $0.078 and the $0.682 support before considering an extension. The key level for support on the way down is $0.06. Key Resistance Levels: $0.1035, $0.123, $0.1495 Key Support Levels: $0.078, $0.0682, $0.06 Spot Price: $0.092 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Global banks and fintechs are launching their own stablecoins, capitalizing on the increasing adoption and favorable regulatory environment. Joining an established list of payment providers like Standard Chartered, PayPal, and Revolut, Bank of America (BoE) is considering launching its stablecoin. This growing trend among financial institutions aims to disrupt the dominance of major players like Tether and Circle. Banks and Fintechs Capitalize on Stablecoin Growth According to Financial Times , top banks and fintechs are racing to introduce their own stablecoins to secure a foothold in the rapidly evolving cross-border payments space. The favorable regulatory environment and growing adoption of stablecoins add momentum to the development. Notably, the regulatory recognition that stablecoins can play a legitimate role in the financial system has boosted enthusiasm. This, in turn, has influenced financial institutions to leverage the capabilities of these assets. This regulatory shift, following President Donald Trump’s election victory in 2024, has been driven by his pro-crypto stance. Likening this increasing demand for stablecoins to the gold rush, where people made more money selling shovels to miners than actually mining for gold, Simon Taylor, co-founder of fintech consultancy 11: FS, stated, It’s about people selling shovels in the stablecoin gold rush. The other thing that’s driven it is there’s real volume. Founders want to get a piece of it because they know they’re going to get stablecoin regulation and so it’s all of those things coming together. Stablecoin Frenzy: Big Players Enter the Fray Large players like Bank of America, PayPal, Standard Chartered, Stripe, and Revolut have expressed their interests in adopting stablecoins. Stripe co-founder John Collison stated, “Stablecoins and the more modern chains are really interesting for the payments use case, and that makes up our business.” Recently, Bank of America announced its potential plans to launch its own stable asset upon receiving regulatory approval. CEO Brian Moynihan stated, ““If they make that legal, we will go into that business.” Last month, Standard Chartered revealed its plans to develop a Hong Kong dollar-backed token, adhering to the new stablecoin regulatory policies in the territory. Similarly, PayPal intends to expand its stablecoin payment option, PYUSD, in 2025, anticipating significant adoption among US businesses making international supplier payments. According to Visa data, stablecoin transactions on PayPal totaled $163 million this month, a fraction of Tether’s $131 billion. US Department of Housing and Urban Development Experiments with Stablecoins In a recent development, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development is planning to integrate blockchain technology and adopt stablecoins. According to a ProPublica report, the department is considering blockchain-based solutions for grant tracking and stablecoin payments, with pilot testing proposed for one of its offices. Notably, the team believes that the current experiment signals the adoption of crypto and blockchain across the federal government. US Regulatory Landscape Boosts Crypto Adoption President Donald Trump’s crypto-focused policies have generated significant optimism. This marks a substantial shift in the US government’s stance on digital assets. Trump’s administration is introducing new policies aimed at establishing stablecoins. Recently, Trump announced plans to adopt Bitcoin, XRP, SOL, and ADA as US crypto reserve assets, signaling a commitment to integrating digital assets into the country’s financial ecosystem. This move was followed by an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . These developments underscore the government’s progressive stance on cryptocurrencies. It focuses on fostering innovation, investment, and integration into the traditional financial system. The Trump administration’s policies aim to position the United States as a leader in the global digital asset economy.

Canadian crypto mining company HIVE Digital has released its February production results, revealing that its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings increased by more than 20% year-over-year. In a March 9 press release , the Vancouver-headquartered company said it had mined 89 BTC, increasing its HODL portfolio to 2,620 BTC, valued at around $220 million. While the company’s Bitcoin holdings increased by 23% YoY, its month-over-month crypto holdings saw a decline, though HIVE Digital didn’t disclose the amount of Bitcoin sold during the month. “ on a month-over-month basis, BTC holdings saw a decline as HIVE strategically sold a portion of its BTC to invest in capital assets, including Bitfarms’ 200 megawatt hydro-powered Bitcoin mining assets in Paraguay.” HIVE Digital You might also like: Crypto miner HIVE Digital’s shares soar amid 263% surge in Bitcoin reserves Following the news, HIVE Digital shares jumped 4.76% to $2 after hours, per data from Nasdaq.

The average price target represents an increase of nearly 200%, per the firm. HIVE Digital chief executive Aydin Kilic says the company is focused on executing a “transformative year” that would position the company as “one of the largest and most efficient Bitcoin miners in the world,” adding that HIVE’s 300 MW expansion in Paraguay to 4x its hashrate from 6 EH/s to 25 EH/s by September 2025 “remains on track.” HIVE says it expects to finalize the strategic acquisition of the Bitfarms’ 200 MW Yguazú site in Q1 2025.

Meanwhile, crypto scammers are exploiting trade war fears in Canada by using fake news articles featuring government figures to promote fraudulent investment schemes. Additionally, a long-dormant Bitcoin wallet that is linked to the Nucleus darknet marketplace recently moved $77.5 million in BTC, fueling speculation about the motives behind the sudden reactivation of old wallets. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Faces Setback Ethereum's latest Pectra upgrade encountered some unexpected issues during its rollout on the Sepolia testnet, one of which led to errors and an exploit that resulted in the mining of empty blocks. The upgrade was deployed on March 5, but Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden reported on March 8 that the team quickly started seeing error messages on their geth node. The problem stemmed from the deposit contract, which triggered a transfer event instead of a deposit event, leading to incorrect processing. A fix was quickly issued, but a missed edge case allowed an unknown attacker to exploit the system. By sending a zero-token transfer to the deposit address, the attacker managed to trigger the same error again. As a result, empty blocks continued to be mined, which prompted the developers to investigate further. Initially, they suspected a mistake from one of the trusted validators but soon realized the transaction originated from a new account funded through a faucet. Van der Wijden explained that the ERC-20 standard does not prohibit zero-token transfers. This means that anyone—even without holding any tokens—could interact with the deposit contract. This loophole was identified and used by the attacker to disrupt block production. To mitigate the issue, the team privately deployed a fix to select DevOps nodes, filtering out all transactions interacting with the deposit contract. The developers suspected that the attacker was monitoring their communications, so they did not publicise the fix and instead silently updated a few controlled nodes to restore normal block production. By 2 pm, all nodes received the fix, and the problematic transaction was successfully mined. Van der Wijden shared that despite the disruption, the incident never resulted in the loss of finalization, and the issue was limited to Sepolia because it used a token-gated deposit contract rather than the standard mainnet deposit contract. This was not the first time the Pectra upgrade encountered difficulties. Its previous testnet deployment on Holesky on Feb. 26 also faced issues. Due to these latest challenges, Ethereum developers decided to postpone the Pectra upgrade to allow for more testing. The Pectra fork follows Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, which was successfully deployed on March 13 of 2024. Dencun introduced improvements that reduced transaction fees for layer-2 networks and enhanced Ethereum rollup efficiency. Scammers Exploit Trade War Fears Attackers are not only targeting Ethereum and its Pectra upgrade. Crypto scammers are also exploiting trade war fears by using fake news articles and the likeness of government figures to deceive investors, according to securities regulators in Alberta and New Brunswick. The Alberta Securities Commission issued an alert on March 7, warning that a fraudulent crypto investment scheme called CanCap falsely claimed an endorsement from former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The scam used a fake news article that was designed to appear as if it came from Canada’s national broadcaster, CBC, which stated that Trudeau supported the scheme as a response to US tariffs. The Financial and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick issued a similar warning on March 5, and stated that CanCap also used a fraudulent news article claiming that New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt endorsed the platform. The fabricated article mimicked the design of a Telegraph-Journal web article, and alleged that Holt backed the investment program due to US tariff hikes. It even included a fake interview transcript and manipulated photos to make the endorsement look more authentic. The warnings were made during a time of economic uncertainty in Canada after US President Donald Trump’s recent trade policies. His 25% tariffs on Canadian goods took effect earlier this month, only to be partially rolled back before he quickly threatened new 250% tariffs on lumber and dairy. Mark Carney, who replaced Trudeau as prime minister on March 9, strongly criticized Trump’s actions by calling them an attack on Canadian families . Carney also warned that Canada will win any trade war. New Brunswick’s financial regulators said that the uncertainty caused by the tariffs is increasing anxiety among residents, making them a lot more vulnerable to financial scams. The commission’s communications director, Marissa Sollows, pointed out that scammers are preying on people who are in a heightened state of financial concern. Scammers have been very quick to adapt, changing the name and appearance of their platforms to evade detection. CanCap already appeared under different names, including CanCentra and Immediate Flectinium, and has been linked to at least six other websites. ( Source: CertiK ) The scale of crypto-related fraud is huge, with global losses from scams, exploits, and hacks totaling close to $1.53 billion in February alone. This large number was mostly driven by the $1.4 billion hack on crypto exchange Bybit, according to CertiK . Even excluding the Bybit incident, losses exceeded $126 million in February, which was a 28.5% increase from the $98 million reported in January. Wallet Linked to Darknet Marketplace Moves Millions To make things even more risky for crypto investors, a Bitcoin wallet linked to the now-defunct darknet marketplace Nucleus reawakened after nine years by moving $77.5 million in BTC to three new addresses while leaving $365 million in the primary wallet, according to Arkham Intelligence . The wallet has been dormant since April of 2016, when Nucleus shut down and left behind 5,000 BTC in vendor and customer deposits. At the time, the stash was worth just $2.1 million. Nucleus was one of many darknet marketplaces that facilitated the sale of illicit goods, including drugs and weapons. While the official reason for its shutdown was a hack, there was speculation that the administrators either ran an exit scam or were arrested. Like other marketplaces of its time, transactions on Nucleus were primarily conducted in Bitcoin because of its relative anonymity. The sudden movement of funds from the dormant wallet came just a day after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the country. The reserve will initially be funded through seized crypto assets. Bitcoin’s surge in price led to a wave of dormant wallets becoming active again. Since early 2023, Bitcoin has climbed from below $17,000 to an all-time high of approximately $109,000. This prompted long-inactive wallets from the 2010s to move funds. In July of 2023, an 11-year-old wallet containing 1,037 BTC became active, while in May of 2024, three Satoshi-era wallets transferred large sums, including one that moved 687 BTC and two others moving a combined 1,000 BTC. June 2024 saw a whale transfer 8,000 BTC from a five-year-old dormant wallet, and in September 2024, five miner wallets from the Satoshi era reawakened after 15 years. Speculation continues to grow over why these wallets are becoming active. Some experts attribute it to rising Bitcoin prices. Meanwhile, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino suggested that advancements in quantum computing could soon pose a threat to early Bitcoin wallets.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-10 09:13:58

In a new press release, the regulatory agency says that banks now have the green light to manage crypto assets, partake in certain stablecoin activities and participate in node verification networks. Furthermore, the OCC is shedding a requirement that forced institutions under its jurisdiction to meet certain requirements before being able to engage in crypto-related activities. Says Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood, “The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones. Today’s action will reduce the burden on banks to engage in crypto-related activities and ensure that these bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology. I will continue to work diligently to ensure regulations are effective and not excessive, while maintaining a strong federal banking system.” Under the Biden Administration, the OCC sent a letter that has since been rescinded, telling US banks they must first clear crypto-related activities with the regulator before being able to legally partake in them. “This letter clarifies that the activities addressed in [previous] interpretive letters are legally permissible for a bank to engage in, provided the bank can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of its supervisory office, that it has controls in place to conduct the activity in a safe and sound manner… The bank should not engage in the activities until it receives written notification of the supervisory office’s non-objection.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to the analyst, both XRP and Cardano (ADA) have the potential to surge to $10, driven by anticipated tax policy changes under Donald Trump’s administration. The Impact of Tax Policies on Cryptocurrency Growth The possibility of removing capital gains taxes on digital assets has been widely debated. Many investors believe such a change could significantly increase participation in the crypto market. Eliminating tax burdens on crypto profits may encourage institutional and retail investors to hold onto their assets, driving demand and boosting prices. According to recent discussions, Eric Trump—Donald Trump’s son—has reportedly suggested that U.S.-based cryptocurrencies like XRP might qualify for capital gains tax exemptions. In contrast, foreign crypto projects could be subject to a tax rate of approximately 30%. This policy shift, if implemented, would align with the Trump administration’s broader efforts to prioritize American cryptocurrency projects. XRP and ADA as Beneficiaries of a Favorable Tax Environment The Modern Investor predicts that XRP and ADA will be the biggest beneficiaries of potential regulatory changes, specifically, repealing capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies. According to the analyst, repealing this tax burden could lead to a substantial surge in value for these digital assets, potentially reaching $10 in a short period. Although this forecast is speculative, it reflects the growing enthusiasm among investors about the positive impact of more favorable tax policies on the cryptocurrency market. Beyond individual price predictions, the prospect of tax-free cryptocurrency transactions could lead to increased market activity, as traders and long-term holders alike may feel less pressure to sell prematurely due to tax concerns. This could contribute to a more stable and liquid market. Trump Administration’s Interest in U.S.-Based Cryptocurrencies Reports indicate that Donald Trump has openly supported strengthening the U.S. cryptocurrency sector. As part of this initiative, U.S.-based digital assets such as XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano are expected to play a key role in a proposed national cryptocurrency reserve , often called the “ crypto stockpile .” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If these policies are enacted, the competitive landscape for digital assets could shift significantly, potentially favoring projects headquartered or heavily involved in the U.S. financial ecosystem. While details remain uncertain, the possibility of tax exemptions for certain crypto assets continues to generate discussions within the industry. Speculation vs. Reality: What Investors Should Consider While the notion of a tax-free environment for U.S. crypto investors is appealing, it is important to approach these claims prudently. The Modern Investor’s predictions are based on speculation, and no official policy has been confirmed. Additionally, any changes to tax regulations would likely require legislative approval, making the implementation’s timeline unclear. Nonetheless, discussions surrounding cryptocurrency tax policies will remain a key factor influencing market sentiment. If the U.S. government moves toward tax exemptions for domestic crypto assets, it could create a more favorable investment climate and potentially drive substantial price movements in the market.

The order, which introduced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, initially sent Bitcoin tumbling by 5% before partially recovering. With a high trading volume of $39.1 billion, market participants remain uncertain about whether the U.S. government will actively acquire Bitcoin. Trade War Tensions & Bitcoin Update Canada, China & Mexico strike back with tariffs, fueling market uncertainty! Meanwhile, #Bitcoin faces major swings—$70K support & $75K resistance are key levels to watch — Bitunix Analyst Stay sharp, trade smart & manage your risk! pic.twitter.com/F80ltdXdQx — Bitunix (@BitunixOfficial) March 5, 2025 The uncertainty surrounding this policy shift has fueled volatility, leaving investors questioning the long-term impact on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Was this dip a buying opportunity, or does further downside loom? BTC struggled above $82,000 amid selling pressure and trade tensions. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve order caused a 5% drop before recovery. Bitcoin is down 4.13%, trading at $82,331.29 with high volume. Trade Tensions Keep Pressure on Bitcoin Beyond the immediate impact of Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Order, global trade tensions have continued to weigh on market sentiment. Recent shifts in U.S. tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports have fueled uncertainty, prompting risk-averse behavior among investors. The temporary waiver of 25% tariffs on select goods under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has contributed to volatile price swings across financial markets, including crypto. Trade policy shifts are adding market volatility and uncertainty. Risk-sensitive assets, including Bitcoin, face increased selling pressure. Investors are moving cautiously amid unclear U.S. economic policies. Given Bitcoin’s status as a hedge against traditional financial instability, some traders see these economic uncertainties as a potential long-term bullish catalyst. However, short-term price action suggests that bearish sentiment is still in control. Inflation Data and Fed Policy: The Next Market Movers The next big test for Bitcoin comes in the form of upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy. On March 12, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be released, followed by the Producer Price Index (PPI) on March 13. The digital currency market is on the verge of an important change. Publishing Consumer Price Index (CPI) and US Producer Price Index (PPI) in the coming days can determine the path of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the next few months. pic.twitter.com/wK1Euq0dXx — Reza Trader (@RezaTraderFarsi) March 9, 2025 Market forecasts indicate: CPI to rise 0.3% in February, with an annual inflation rate of 2.9%. PPI data could further influence market expectations for Fed rate cuts. Traders anticipate up to 70 basis points of rate cuts by December. The March 18-19 Federal Reserve meeting will be crucial in shaping Bitcoin’s direction. If inflation data exceeds expectations, the Fed may delay rate cuts or even consider further tightening, adding pressure on BTC and risk assets. Conversely, if inflation slows, Bitcoin could regain momentum on renewed liquidity optimism. Bitcoin’s Technical Outlook: Will Bears Push BTC to $80K? From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin remains under selling pressure as it struggles to reclaim the $82,725 resistance level. The 50-period EMA suggests bearish momentum, with further declines possible if BTC fails to break back above $83,990. Key resistance: $82,725 and $83,990. Major support: $80,070, with downside potential to $78,196 and $76,198. A break below $80,070 could trigger further selling pressure. Traders should watch for volume confirmation and market sentiment shifts before positioning for either a continuation of the downtrend or a potential reversal. With economic uncertainty and Fed policy weighing on risk assets, BTC’s next move could be pivotal for the broader crypto market.

According to data from Arkham Intelligence, WLFI’s investment of $336 million across nine cryptocurrencies is now worth approximately $226 million. Of the portfolio’s losses, Ethereum ( ETH ) is responsible for 65%. Ethereum is trading at around $2,000 as at Mar. 10, meaning that WLFI, which bought it at an average price of $3,240, is down an estimated $80.85 million, or almost 37% of its total investment. Tron ( TRX ) has proven to be the most resilient of WLFI’s holdings, down just 5%. The portfolio’s other holdings, which have all contributed to the WLFI’s losses, include tokens such as stETH ($10.27M), WHITE ($5.87M), Movement ( MOVE ) ($3.5M), and Ondo ( ONDO ) ($296,000). Despite these losses, WLFI continues to boost its portfolio and expand its network. On Mar. 6, WLFI acquired $21.5 million worth of Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) and Movement Network tokens. In addition, the company recently partnered with Sui ( SUI ), a blockchain founded by former Meta programmers, to explore decentralized finance opportunities.

Founded in 2024, WLFI has managed to position itself as a major player in DeFi. Trump, along with his close family and allies, controls more than 60% of the project. Despite recent losses, WLFI attracted strong investor interest, raising $300 million during its January 2025 token sale. Meanwhile, as Trump’s government works to establish a strategic crypto reserve for the United States, critics argue that his growing influence in the cryptocurrency markets may lead to conflicts of interest. The Trump Organization has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that his children, an outside ethics lawyer, and an independent investment firm run WLFI and that Trump has no direct control over its activities.

Key US economic data , including job openings, inflation reports, and consumer confidence, will shape BTC’s next move. If inflation stays hot and jobless claims rise, risk assets like Bitcoin could take another hit. Moreover, the current sentiment leans negative, with recession fears creeping in as Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts bite deeper into government spending. With the Fed meeting just around the corner, all eyes are on whether inflation surprises again—will Bitcoin take another hit? Here’s what could move the needle: This Week's Market Movers: Mar 10th-Feb 14th, 2025 A huge week for economic data, with JOLTS, CPI & PPI.

A strong report, showing job openings above 7.6 million, could fuel dollar strength and lower Bitcoin’s appeal. However, a weaker reading might raise concerns over economic slowdown, increasing expectations for Fed rate cuts and boosting BTC’s safe-haven narrative.

BTC will pump. Position accordingly while in peak fear. — sickone (@sickonesol) March 10, 2025 Inflation Data Holds the Key The Consumer Price Index (CPI), dropping on March 12, is a major trigger for risk assets. If inflation stays hot at 2.9% or above, rate cuts could be delayed, strengthening the dollar and pressuring Bitcoin. A softer CPI, on the other hand, might revive bullish sentiment by signaling potential monetary easing. Traders are already speculating that a lower-than-expected core inflation number could spark a BTC rally. Jobless Claims and Producer Prices Add More Volatility On March 13, Initial Jobless Claims and the Producer Price Index (PPI) will provide further economic insights. Fewer-than-expected jobless claims could reinforce dollar dominance, drawing investors toward traditional markets and away from Bitcoin. A lower PPI reading, however, may ease inflation concerns and improve BTC’s outlook as an inflation hedge. Consumer Sentiment Could Sway Market Mood The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index survey , due on March 15, will gauge economic confidence. A strong number might shift focus to equities, reducing Bitcoin’s attractiveness. But if sentiment drops below expectations, BTC could gain as investors seek a hedge against economic uncertainty. With a heavy lineup of macroeconomic events, Bitcoin traders are bracing for potential swings.

The accumulation arrives days after the Central American nation acquired 5 BTC, amid a market dip .

President Nayib Bukele recently clarified that their BTC accumulation strategy is not stopping. In a statement last week, he clarified his 7.3 million followers on X that El Salvador won’t stop its BTC accumulating strategy. “If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future,” he wrote. “This all stops in April.” “This all stops in June.” “This all stops in December.” No, it’s not stopping.

The IMF has cited volatility risks, fiscal vulnerabilities, and potential implications for financial stability as primary concerns in its ongoing discussions with the Central American nation. Following the loan, the nation’s Legislative Assembly approved a bill to revise Bitcoin adoption strategy, complying to the IMF’s requirements. Per Reuters, the bill was approved by Congress with 55 votes in favor and two votes against. Despite the pressure, El Salvador has maintained its course, continuing to accumulate Bitcoins. Further, the government maintains that its dollar-based economy remains stable alongside the Bitcoin implementation. A Test Case for Crypto Adoption El Salvador has been building the Bitcoin City Airport that aims to link Bitcoin City to the rest of the world. In February, the country began building the transportation hub, as reported by Cryptonews .

Mutuum Finance stands as the main focus following this development since it currently operates within its second presale phase after collecting $2.7 million while showing positive signs with 4,900 holders. Investors show increased interest in the project because the current price sits at $0.015 during a time when the current project stage is already 85% complete. Cardano (ADA): A Path to $2 The crypto market has placed special attention on Cardano (ADA) since the U.S. chose it for the crypto stockpile. The cryptocurrency demonstrates positive market potential for a rally to $2 based on both recent technical analysis patterns and broader market conditions. Since December ADA has followed a descending broadening wedge pattern which currently uses $1.14 as its main resistance point. Daily trading above $1.14 could ignite a major upward movement of ADA that would take it to $2. ADA continues to be popular with traders and investors even after its price dropped by 7%. Analysts expect ADA to become part of the U.S. crypto stockpile together with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) which supports market optimism. The U.S. SEC created more optimism in the market after it recognized Grayscale’s Spot Cardano ETF filing. Most analysts expect ADA to increase towards $1.30 and $1.40 before the end of the current quarter based on their forecast values. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) breakthrough project within decentralized finance (DeFi) features a distinctive lending operation and integrated buying force mechanism. MUTM brings practical financial capabilities to the network since users can both provide loans to others and borrow funds while earning passive income. The project achieved impressive results from its pre-sale phase by attracting $2.7 million in funding from 4,900 different holders. Between the second phase and next phase stages of presale MUTM will increase in price from $0.015 to $0.02 which provides a 33% profit opportunity for early buyers. Early investors will achieve a 400% return when MUTM launches at a value of $0.06. The market analysts project a price of $1.50 for MUTM tokens by 2025 creating an astounding 9,900% ROI potential. The innovative features of Mutuum Finance include mtTokens as well as its buy-and-distribute mechanism which makes the platform more attractive to users. Through mtTokens users can earn passive income from their deposited funds that grow in value over time. The platform automatically purchases MUTM tokens using its earnings before it disperses them to stakers to maintain constant market demands and long-term price stability. Why Investors Are Flocking to Mutuum Finance Eighty-five percent of the Mutuum Finance presale tokens have reached their selling target during the second phase while attracting investors. Market demand has grown sharply due to the combination of practical application of the project and robust economic dynamics along with promising investment potential. The chance to purchase tokens at their minimum price draws first investors prior to the following round commencement. Mutuum Finance provides lenders and borrowers an attractive partnership by implementing stable overcollateralized lending schemes that minimize risk exposure. Users can choose peer-to-peer (P2P) lending since the platform enables loan term negotiations between its members. The project provides $100,000 as a giveaway to early contributors while simultaneously building a devoted community through these incentives. Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) received significant attention due to the support from a successful Arab billionaire. The technical indicators for Cardano along with market trends indicate ADA holders might experience a price boost to $2 but Mutuum Finance stands out as an attractive investment because of its innovative structure and exciting presale performance. The ongoing presale phase of MUTM tokens has reached its second segment so investors need to acquire their tokens before prices advance ahead of the third phase.

What’s Happening?,https://timestabloid.com/5-billion-xrp-in-24-hours-whats-happening/,"Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency community, recently drew attention to a sharp rise in XRP transactions. She referenced a post from Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast, who highlighted that XRP transactions had skyrocketed, reaching $5 billion in just 24 hours. According to Melker, XRP wallet activity surged by over 600%, signaling significant movement in the market. “Big money is moving—something is brewing with XRP,” he stated. XRP TRANSACTIONS SKYROCKET AS ACTIVITY HITS $5 BILLION IN 24 HOURS $XRP transfers topped $5B in a single day, with wallet activity surging over 600%. Big money is moving—something is brewing with XRP. — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) March 9, 2025 This massive surge in transaction volume has raised speculation about potential market shifts, with analysts and traders closely monitoring the situation. While the reason for this spike remains unclear, recent blockchain activity suggests that whales are moving significantly and may be preparing for something big. Whale Activity and Market Implications Recent data shows that large-scale XRP transfers have increased, fueling speculation about potential institutional involvement or strategic accumulation. A report from Times Tabloid confirmed that 5.37 billion XRP moved within 24 hours, a figure that stands out even in a highly liquid market like XRP’s. The impact of this movement remains uncertain, but such large transfers often indicate either internal restructuring among institutions or preparation for major market events. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More Whale Activity in the Ecosystem Adding to the intrigue, another report recently revealed that XRP whale activity has been consistently rising . While some analysts believe this could precede a major price movement, others caution that it might be a sign of redistribution rather than new accumulation. Further developments include the transfer of 240 million XRP , raising additional questions about market intent. This massive token movement aligns with the broader trend of increased whale activity. With no clear explanation, many in the community are convinced that the whales are secretly accumulating and preparing for a big price jump. What’s Next for XRP’s Price? While many community members are excited about XRP’s short-term trajectory, some expressed skepticism because the asset’s price is currently down over 7%. Currently trading at $2.13, XRP has had a rough few weeks, with all attempts to break out being suppressed by bearish pressure from the broader market. However, this decline provides an appropriate buying opportunity, as the large investors can see the digital asset’s potential, and expect a big move in the short-term.

Market conditions remain volatile, and traders are closely watching price movements. With the BTC price struggling at $82k, investors are now eyeing altcoins to buy that could turn $50 into $5,000. The recent dip erased over $170 billion from the global crypto market . This sell-off comes ahead of key US economic data, influencing crypto sentiment. Despite the downturn, some altcoins present opportunities if the market rebounds. Let’s uncover these altcoins to watch, including XRP, Solana, and DOGE Altcoins to Buy: (Ripple) XRP XRP price has dropped 7% in the last 24 hours, currently hovering around $2.16. The decline follows the overall decrease in cryptocurrencies price. Amid this dip, XRP is among the altcoins to buy for potential future gains. Crypto Expert Ali noted that if the XRP price holds above the head-and-shoulders neckline and surpasses the right shoulder, a bullish breakout could occur. This move might push the Ripple price prediction toward $5, possibly reversing the recent downtrend. Source: Tweet Solana (SOL) Solana price has followed a downward trend, mirroring the broader crypto market decline. The latest SOL price is trading at $128, making an 8% decrease in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, the top altcoin has decreased by more than 20%, slipping below the crucial $150-$130 support levels. Crypto analyst Ali suggests that the Solana price could experience further movement depending on its ability to hold above the $125-$110 support zone. A break below this level may lead to additional losses, while stability could support potential recovery. Speculation surrounding a possible Solana ETF and rising interest in Solana-based meme tokens may also influence market sentiment. Despite the ongoing decline, Solana remains a key best altcoin to buy . If market conditions improve, SOL could regain momentum. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin price has been moving in a bearish trend recently. However, analysts are monitoring its price movements closely. Since October 2022, the asset has seen three major declines. The first two dips resulted in 64% retracements before surging by 300% and 500%. Currently, DOGE has retraced by 66%, raising speculation about a potential rebound. Analysts suggest this could push the Dogecoin price prediction toward $1. Some traders consider it among altcoins to buy that could turn $50 into $5,000 after the recent dip. As of writing, the DOGE price at $0.1715, with a 10% decrease over the past day. Final Thoughts Market volatility continues, but altcoins to buy after this dip could offer significant upside. Investors are closely monitoring price trends for potential gains.

41425231,https://invezz.com/?p=2607174,1741599449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Bitcoin vs. gold: the digital age’s store of value showdown,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/10/bitcoin-vs-gold-the-digital-ages-store-of-value-showdown/,"Most people have heard about Bitcoin these days, and even those who still don’t understand how it works might be aware that it’s widely considered to be a kind of “digital gold”. That’s because Bitcoin shares several characteristics with real gold, such as its scarcity, its perceived value and its usefulness as a hedge against economic turbulence. But how does Bitcoin really stack up to gold, and which one is the best investment over the long term? These are pressing questions for many investors and they’re still up for debate, so let’s take a look at some of the established facts and see if we can guess what the future holds for these two iconic stores of value. Scarcity One of the main reasons why Bitcoin has so many fans is its scarcity. It has a hard-coded limited supply that no one can change. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in total, and a lot of them have already been “lost”, which makes them inherently scarce. That’s similar to real gold, of course, which is a finite resource, albeit with an unknown amount still trapped under ground. But whereas gold mining continues to deliver a steady stream of new ingots onto the global market, Bitcoin’s halving mechanism means that fewer and fewer new coins will be minted, until such a time as the last one is mined. That said, the amount of new gold mined every year isn’t substantial enough to decrease its value, and historically the price of gold has increased slowly but surely for hundreds of years. Economic hedge For centuries, gold has been widely used across the world as a store of value, preserving wealth that can be handed down from generation to generation. Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a digital equivalent, with its deflationary nature making it an appealing investment for those who want to protect their wealth. Bitcoin’s advantages include that the price cannot be inflated easily, and nor can it be controlled or confiscated by banks or governments. Bitcoin’s price is much more volatile than that of gold, but in the 16 years it has been around, the value of this asset has risen sharply overall, consistently hitting new all-time highs at its peaks, even though its price can dip quite alarmingly during bearish conditions. Still, the fixed supply of Bitcoin provides protection compared to traditional fiat currencies, which lose purchasing power over time. In times of economic turmoil such as high inflation, many governments will print more money to counteract it, diluting the value of their currency. Bitcoin, and gold, are immune to this inflationary pressure. Decentralization Bitcoin fans often cite its decentralized nature as a major benefit, and in a way gold is similar. That’s because the gold trapped underground, waiting to be dug up, isn’t owned by anyone. Whoever finds it can claim it, and governments have very little control over gold prices either. Bitcoin lives on a decentralized blockchain that’s controlled by its users. It’s not possible for anyone, not even the US government, to censor or manipulate that blockchain in any way. This decentralization enhances Bitcoin’s security and transparency. It means anyone can acquire Bitcoin, and every transaction is made public, so anyone can verify it. These characteristics also help to make Bitcoin resilient to corruption. Physical vs digital Because Bitcoin is digital, it has a significant advantage over gold in being more portable and easier to store and secure. It lives inside user’s digital wallets installed on smartphones or PCs, and it can easily be transferred and accessed anywhere in the world with a few clicks. Someone could bring millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin with them when they fly to another country, without any difficulty or without anyone knowing, and they don’t even need to bring a smartphone if they can commit their private key to memory. Gold, on the other hand, is incredibly heavy, and when you have several million dollars worth of it, it’s not so easy to transport. You’ll need a fleet of trucks to bring it anywhere, and you’ll also want to consider security – that much gold will likely require armed guards, not to mention a secure hi-tech vault once you reach your destination. Gold’s advantage That’s not to say Bitcoin is superior, for physical gold does have some major advantages itself. For one thing, gold has stood the test of time, serving as a store of value for thousands of years. While Bitcoin is similar, it has only existed for 16 years, so we have no way of knowing if it will be able to retain its value over a similar timeframe. Moreover, gold has some unique properties that make it useful in the real world. It’s widely used in the electronics industry as a corrosion-resistant electrical connector in smartphones, computers, and other devices, and it also has uses in dentistry, aerospace, and some kinds of medical treatments, thanks to its non-reactive properties. It’s even used in glassmaking, helping to reflect solar radiation outwards in climate-controlled buildings. Bitcoin, without such physical properties, will never be useful in industry. Some investors might also consider Bitcoin’s usefulness in the event of societal collapse. If we’re ever unlucky enough to see the onset of nuclear winter and/or a total shutdown of the internet, you’ll surely wish you had bought real gold rather than crypto. Tokenized gold Notably, gold’s distinct advantages are not lost on the crypto industry, and many tokenized forms of gold live today on the blockchain. Some of the best-known gold-backed stablecoins include Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT), and there are many smaller ones such as GoldCoin (GLC), DigixGlobal (DGX), AABB Gold Token (AABBG) and Kinesis Gold (KAU). The price of each of these digital assets is pegged to a specific amount of physical gold, measured in grams or Troy ounces, and the creators maintain a physical supply of gold as collateral to ensure they don’t lose that peg. Such tokens have proven popular with the crypto crowd, and they’re among the most widely-traded stablecoin assets. As with Bitcoin, real gold and USD-backed stablecoins, they’re a stable store of value, used by traders to cash out of the risky positions they might hold in more volatile cryptocurrencies. The popularity of tokenized gold is evident on crypto exchanges such as VALR , which is offering users some big incentives to buy and sell XAUT in its “Great Re-Balancing Trading Competition”, with up to $5,000 in cash prizes weekly for those with the highest trade count. Digital gold is here to stay The transition towards digital economies makes it likely that Bitcoin will cement its status as a reliable store of value. Businesses and governments alike are now looking at Bitcoin as a strategic asset, with El Salvador having created the world’s first “strategic reserve” based on the cryptocurrency, and the U.S. government promising to do the same under President Trump. Bitcoin’s growing adoption leaves no doubt that it fully merits its status as “digital gold”, and while physical gold itself will always be a significant asset, it may one day find that it’s no longer considered to be the world’s de facto store of value.

Previously known as “All Roads Lead to Polygon”, the podcast has evolved substantially under the dynamic hosting style of Polygon’s leading DEX, QuickSwap . With its unfiltered approach and engaging format, QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” has cemented itself as an engaging platform that elevates and unifies discussions on decentralized tech. The show has delivered cutting-edge insights, engaging debates and the latest alpha in the crypto space. Hosted by QuickSwap, the show is a go-to AMA space for top CEOs, media moguls and key opinion leaders in the Web3 and blockchain world. QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” has earned the top-spot on X’s podcast ecosystem due to its in-depth analysis of global innovations with a refreshingly candid tone that has resonated with audiences worldwide. https://t.co/Olx8iQoRuE — QuickSwap 🐲 DragonFi 2.0 (@QuickswapDEX) February 14, 2025 Nurturing Candid Conversations, One Episode at a Time QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” thrives on its open, honest discussions that other creators often avoid due to the looming threat of possible audience backlash on X. Instead of shying away from controversial topics, the hosts— Roc Zacharias with co-host Aztec —help nurture opposing voices together through lively debates, providing a space for all opinions. The QuickSwap team has actively challenged established narratives and aimed to inspire listeners to look at crypto issues from nuanced perspectives. This open-minded, easy-going, fun, but vigilant approach to business tends to be the standard for most of the projects and podcasts associated with their marketing firm Lunar Digital Assets as noted in previous articles . Industry insiders have noted that the show’s raw, unpolished style sets it apart. QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” has an organic blend of chaotic energy and professional insight which is often reminiscent of an early rock ‘n’ roll merged with classic town hall-style sophistication in discussions. The 100th episode was hosted live on X Spaces on the QuickSwap page, and featured influential figures from across the crypto spectrum who shared insights on emerging trends and future challenges. The celebration not only honored the show’s journey but also showcased its significant impact on the crypto media landscape. Listeners reported that they enjoyed the mix of expert analysis and spirited banter, while guest speakers elevated the conversation by exploring potential pitfalls of the rapidly evolving blockchain industry. Moreover, the episode teased future topics that aim to challenge conventional wisdom and spark innovative discussions in Web3 circles and beyond.“We look to challenge industry norms. We also like to treat each speaker as a friend or potential friend regardless of their opinions. We do our best to make sure the show is like The Roman Bathhouse of Web3 where discussions flow freely.”- Roc Zacharias Bridging the Crypto Knowledge Gap Each episode from QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” breaks down intricate concepts, industry jargon and aims to provide practical advice that can empower both crypto novices and seasoned DeFi veterans. Critics, however, argue that while the podcast succeeds in delivering quality content, its informal style occasionally blurs the line between raw insight and polished expertise. Likewise, some listeners have reported that they would rather prefer a traditional interview style show format as opposed to unscripted segments. Nonetheless, the show’s authentic approach is also its key differentiator—a space where lively, deep discussions and raw opinions are respected.QuickSwap’s “The Aggregated” plans to lead with authenticity and enthusiasm in an industry where change is inevitable and perspectives are often PR driven. As the podcast prepares for future episodes, the question remains: can the show's promises continue to keep its finger on the pulse of Web3 developments or would it ultimately lose its charm in the evolving digital ecosystem? Only time will tell. For the time being, interested listeners can tune-in every Friday at 3 p.m. UTC on X to uncover unfiltered crypto insights.

41425039,https://coingape.com/?p=243199,1741599485,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Binance Issues Key Update On These 6 Crypto, What’s Happening?",https://coingape.com/binance-issues-key-update-on-these-6-crypto-whats-happening/,"Cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance again captured noteworthy investor attention as it unveiled a key announcement on six cryptos this Monday. The crypto exchange revealed that the collateral ratio for CELO, IOTX, LRC, ALICE, AUDIO, & ICX tokens under the portfolio margin will be updated shortly ahead. As a response, market watchers speculate over the update’s impact on prices as the new offerings provide less market value. Binance Reduces Collateral Ratio For 6 Crypto Tokens In an official Binance announcement dated March 10, the crypto exchange revealed that it will reduce the collateral ratio for six tokens under the margin portfolio starting March 14 at 06:00 UTC. As per the announcement, this update will be completed in just an hour. Here Are The Updated Collateral Ratio For 6 Crypto: CELO The collateral ratio is to be reduced from 80% to 70%. IoTeX (IOTX) Binance revealed that IOTX collateral ratio is to be reduced from 80% to 70%. Loopring (LRC) Loopring collateral ratio is to be reduced from 80% to 65%, per the update. MyNeighborAlice (ALICE) ALICE’s collateral ratio is to be reduced from 80% to 65%. Audius (AUDIO) The collateral ratio is to be reduced from 70% to 55%. ICON (ICX) ICX collateral ratio is to be reduced from 70% to 55%. For context, a decline in this ratio signals reduced collateral value, thereby limiting the borrowing capacity of these tokens. As a result, these assets could see a decline in investor interaction and trading volumes due to reduced offerings on one of the top crypto exchanges . What’s More? Binance added that the collateral ratio will affect ‘Unified Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR)’ as well. Platform users should monitor the update closely to mitigate any losses potentially resulting from the abovementioned change. How Are These 6 Tokens Performing? CELO price plunged over 6% intraday and closed in at $0.3440. The coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $0.3295 and $0.3682, respectively. IOTX price dropped over 2% intraday and exchanged hands at $0.01540. The coin hit a low and a high of $0.01491 and $0.0159 over the past day. LRC price slipped nearly 1% as of press time and traded at $0.01053. The coin bottomed and peaked at $0.09879 and $0.1073 in the past 24 hours. ALICE price also followed the waning action in tandem with Binance’s announcement, falling 7% to $0.5194. MyNeighborAlice hit a low and high of $0.4999 and $0.5601 intraday. Nevertheless, AUDIO price was up by a remarkable 35% and rested at $0.1071. The coin bottomed at $0.07742 in the past 24 hours. Lastly, ICX price lost 6% value and closed in at $0.09933. Its intraday low and high were $0.0961 and $0.1066, respectively. It’s noteworthy that the broader slumping action also falls in line with the broader crypto market trend today . Besides, the leading exchange’s reduced offerings added to market concerns surrounding the aforementioned tokens’ future performances.

As we move into celebrating Women’s Day and Women’s Month, it is paramount to cherish dynamic women from the Web3 world, who are rewriting the rules of innovation, creativity and leadership. These journeys remind us that every breakthrough in the crypto industry starts with a single idea—an idea nurtured by passion and executed with precision. Let us take a closer look at the women who recently made a transformative impact on the Web3 industry: Bridging Gaming and Blockchain: Mattie Fairchild Mattie Fairchild is a name that resonates in both the gaming and blockchain communities. As the Head of Developer Relations at OP Labs- Polygon and formerly the Senior Director of Crypto Marketing and Developer Relations at Manticore Games, she doesn’t just manage teams—she nurtures communities. At Manticore, she helped integrate blockchain tech into gaming, empowering developers to build, share and monetize games though decentralized ecosystems. She has also led impactful NFT projects including Boys Club, a DAO championing women builders in Web3, proving her fierce commitment to inclusivity and innovation in the blockchain spehere. Before Manticore, Mattie was the co-founder of Wavedash Games and served as its CEO, pushing community-driven Web3 game development to new heights. Her stints at TinyCo and Storm8 influenced her knack for creating engaged online communities. Through bold strategies and the relentless energy of a commander, Mattie has turned challenges into opportunities, driving technical growth and fostering creative spaces where diverse ideas from the Web3 community can thrive. Redefining Art and Ownership: Victoria Fuller Victoria Fuller’s journey is a testament of substantially fusing art and technology. As the founder, lead artist and project director of Rogue Bunnies NFT collection, she has helped shatter the traditional barriers between art and blockchain. Minted on the FLOW blockchain—the same platform powering NBA Top Shot and UFC Strike—Rogue Bunnies delivers stunning digital art, while providing real-world perks to its community. Leveraging her unique background as a former Playboy Playmate and the first licensed artist by Playboy, Victoria has created a bold vision for the decentralized future where Metaverse and in person events converge. She bypasses old-school gatekeepers, empowering artists to reach a global audience and secure ownership of their work through blockchain. As CEO of Gatefold Labs, Victoria is pushing the limits of Web3 through her vibrant Discord channels to orchestrating dynamic NFT activations and in-person events—experiences that have captivated both crypto veterans, newcomers, and the mainstream media alike. In an era where digital assets rival physical ones, Victoria’s work stands as a prime example of democratizing art ownership through creativity and a real life- community focused experience. Empowering Musicians: Violetta Zironi’s Blockchain Beat In an industry where record labels have long held the reins, singer-songwriter Violetta Zironi is rewriting the rulebook. Since diving into blockchain in 2022, Violetta has emerged as a trailblazer and top musician within Web3, using NFTs to empower independent artists and transform fan engagement. Today, she’s celebrated as the #1 independent NFT singer-songwriter globally—raking in $2.5 million in revenue and selling over 10,000 music NFTs. One of her most jaw-dropping feats came when she inscribed a song onto the Bitcoin blockchain as an Ordinal, pairing it with original artwork by her father, the renowned Disney illustrator Giuseppe Zironi. The one of a kind innovation sold for 1 BTC (around $30,000 at the time), proving that music and art can live and thrive on the blockchain. Her project ""Moonshot"" also turned heads, with over 325 ETH worth total sales on OpenSea. Her bold move to step away from traditional music distribution and fully embrace Web3 showcases her entrepreneurial spirit, for a future where artists call the shots. Violetta stands as a beacon for independent artists eager to break free from industry constraints and traditional streaming platforms which often and notoriously pay musicians only a fraction of a penny per stream. Digital and Immersive Storytelling in Web3 World: Nyx (@Nyx3Media) Nyx, known on social media as @Nyx3Media, is another bold example of impactfully amalgamating art, code and storytelling. Not only is Nyx the Director of Strategy at Creative Labs for IBC Group- a Mario Nawfal company, but her project ""Crypto Coven"" is a vibrant, community-driven journey into identity and mysticism, where each NFT tells a unique story that invites collectors to dive in and engage. Nyx has repeatedly enhanced traditional art through blockchain to create interactive, moving story pieces. By embedding smart contracts into her work, she has guaranteed transparent ownership and sustainable royalties, making every piece collectible and testament to decentralized creativity in the Web3 ecosystem. Her innovative approach invites viewers to join the creative process, echoing the collaborative energy seen in projects like MoMA’s blockchain postcard experiment and platforms like Dada.art. Nyx is constantly pushing the envelope, proving that when creativity, networking, and leadership meets blockchain, art transforms into not only a shared journey but a force which further unifies an often tribalistic Web3 space. Crafting Clear Narratives in a Complex World: Nicole GrinsteadIn the ever-growing crypto world, effective communication is the secret sauce that turns tech jargons into stories everyone can enjoy. Nicole Grinstead, at Lunar Digital Assets , has helped transform blockchain complexities into engaging narratives that resonate with the diverse gentry of the blockchain world.

The recent downturn has fueled panic selling and heightened fear, leading many investors to speculate about the potential start of a bear market. As uncertainty grips the market, traders remain cautious about Bitcoin’s next major move. Related Reading: Cardano Bulls Eye $10 Target – Analyst Reveals Key Levels To Break However, despite the ongoing sell-off, key on-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin could be setting up for a recovery rally. The Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) indicator, a metric that tracks long-term holder behavior and capital inflows, suggests that BTC could soon enter a new uptrend. If Bitcoin stabilizes and reclaims key support levels, it could pave the way for a rally toward a new all-time high of $128,000. With Bitcoin at a critical inflection point, the next few trading sessions will be crucial in determining whether BTC can regain momentum or if further downside is ahead. Investors are now closely watching whether selling pressure continues or if long-term holders step in to accumulate, signaling a potential market rebound. Bitcoin Insights Give Hope To Bulls Bitcoin is at a critical juncture, facing a serious risk of continued correction as bearish sentiment grips the market. Many analysts now believe that the Bitcoin bull cycle may be over, as BTC struggles below $85,000 while barely holding above $80,000. With selling pressure intensifying, investors are expecting another leg down, potentially pushing BTC into lower demand zones. Despite the negative outlook, some analysts argue that a recovery is still possible if Bitcoin can reclaim key levels. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, stating that if BTC reclaims $84,000 as support, it could open the path toward a rally to a new all-time high of $128,000. This suggests that while the market remains fragile, there is still potential for Bitcoin to regain strength if bulls step in at critical price points. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the strength or weakness of this cycle. If BTC continues to struggle below key resistance levels, a deeper correction could follow, reinforcing bearish sentiment. However, if bulls manage to push BTC back above $84K, it would indicate a shift in momentum, potentially reigniting the uptrend.

With uncertainty dominating the market, traders are closely watching BTC’s next move, as its ability to hold or reclaim support levels will determine whether this cycle is truly over or if another rally is still on the horizon. BTC Struggling Below $85K Bitcoin has faced massive selling pressure, with the most significant drop occurring on Sunday, when the price plunged from $86,000 to $80,000, marking a 7% decline in just hours. This sharp downturn has fueled panic selling as investors remain uncertain about Bitcoin’s short-term direction. For bulls to regain control, BTC must reclaim the $86,000 level and push above $90,000 to confirm a potential recovery rally. A strong move past these key resistance levels could restore confidence in the market, signaling that Bitcoin’s correction phase might be nearing its end. However, failure to break above $86K could keep Bitcoin under bearish control, increasing the risk of another leg down. If BTC drops below $80,000, it could test the $78,000 low, a level that, if breached, may lead to further downside pressure.

41425755,https://invezz.com/?p=2606985,1741600191,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Inside Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve: A new era for US digital asset policy or just a fluke?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/10/inside-trumps-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-a-new-era-for-us-digital-asset-policy-or-just-a-fluke/,"The US government just made history by officially recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset—a first for any global superpower. President Donald Trump’s new Executive Order (EO) establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, ensuring that seized Bitcoin will be permanently held by the federal government. Now the question is whether or not this is a game-changer or is it just political posturing wrapped in a shiny new label. Critics argue that this move lacks real substance, while supporters see it as the ultimate move to integrate Bitcoin into the global financial system. So, which one is it? What the Executive Order says On March 6, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and a US Digital Asset Stockpile. This means that every Bitcoin seized through civil and criminal forfeiture proceedings will be permanently held by the government. No sales. No liquidations. Just cold storage, indefinitely. The order also tasks the Treasury and Commerce Departments with developing budget-neutral strategies to acquire more Bitcoin in the future. Budget-neutral means that the government can only buy more if it doesn’t increase the deficit, raise taxes, or add financial burden to taxpayers. So while the door for accumulation is technically open, no direct purchases have been announced as of now. Beyond Bitcoin, the US Digital Asset Stockpile will hold other forfeited cryptocurrencies. Unlike the SBR, this stockpile is not considered strategic, and there’s no policy preventing the government from selling these assets. In other words, Bitcoin is now officially separated from the broader “crypto” category in US policy, which is a significant development in itself. Why this matters Bitcoin has spent the last decade clawing its way from a niche internet experiment to a legitimate macroeconomic asset. Institutional adoption has surged, especially following the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. Hedge funds, public companies, and sovereign wealth funds have taken positions. But until now, nation-states had largely remained on the sidelines. That era may be ending. The US government now officially holds 207,189 coins (worth approximately $17.5 billion at today’s prices), making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. So if this is significant, does this move set off a global Bitcoin arms race? If Bitcoin is indeed a strategic asset, other countries may feel pressure to accumulate before it’s too late. With only 21 million BTC ever to exist, late adopters could find themselves priced out permanently. The implications are massive. A world where central banks and sovereign wealth funds scramble to secure Bitcoin would change the global financial system forever. For the US, this decision could also be seen as a hedge against monetary debasement. While the dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, holding Bitcoin could serve as insurance against potential changes to the global financial order. The bearish case: symbolic, unclear, and overhyped Skeptics argue that Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is more about branding than substance. While the government is now officially holding Bitcoin, the lack of an acquisition plan weakens its long-term significance. If the US isn’t actively buying, does this reserve mean anything? The harshest critics say that this is simply a new name for Bitcoin, the government already had. The executive order makes no guarantees that more Bitcoin will be acquired. Without a defined accumulation strategy, the reserve is just a rebranded holding rather than a deliberate sovereign investment. Others point to the market reaction as evidence that this move fell flat. Bitcoin dropped 5% immediately after the announcement, as traders likely searched for the word “buy” in the EO and didn’t find it. If this were a true game-changer, markets should have responded positively. Critics also warn about government interference in markets. The inclusion of other cryptocurrencies in a separate digital asset stockpile raises concerns about the government picking winners. If Bitcoin is in the reserve but other assets aren’t, does this imply implicit approval of one over the other? And if the government were to suddenly decide that Bitcoin should be regulated differently, could this reserve be used as a tool for control rather than a strategic advantage? The bullish case: Bitcoin’s legitimacy moment Supporters of the move see this as one of the most significant moments in Bitcoin’s history. For years, Bitcoin has been lumped in with speculative altcoins. This executive order changes that. Bitcoin is now officially recognized as a distinct, strategic asset by the most powerful government in the world. Unlike previous administrations, which treated Bitcoin with skepticism or outright hostility, this move legitimizes Bitcoin at the highest level. The US is now a sovereign Bitcoin holder, and that alone sets an important precedent. Beyond symbolism, the budget-neutral accumulation strategy could be a brilliant long-term approach. Instead of printing money or issuing debt to buy Bitcoin, the US could acquire BTC through alternative funding methods. Some have suggested that the government could: Sell Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from the IMF Revalue gold reserves to unlock new capital Sell non-Bitcoin digital assets from the stockpile If executed properly, this approach would allow the U.S. to gradually accumulate Bitcoin without destabilizing financial markets or harming taxpayers. Perhaps the biggest implication is what happens next. Now that the U.S. has moved first, other governments will be forced to make a decision. Do they start stacking Bitcoin to maintain a competitive position? Or do they sit back and watch the US secure an early lead? Some countries have already shown their interest in using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve or as part of their sovereign wealth funds. If other nations adopt the same approach as the US, Bitcoin could truly have its defining moment of legitimacy.

Those with liquid cash to stockpile are the Kings and Queens of the investor world in this bearish season. For those who have the extra cash to invest or refraining from ‘wasteful spending’ to buy into the market, here’s a summarized look at the best 3 token presales for crypto Investors in March of 2025. Notice on each of the listed initial coin offerings there are two sections of information. One part is a more detailed format, while the other is a bullet briefing of token data and where to purchase. #1 - Nollars Network (NOLA) The native cryptocurrency of the Nollars Network, called $NOLA, is currently in presale at Nollars.com as part of its initial coin offering (ICO). The brand value of the Nollars Network cryptocurrency has grown significantly, attracting more Google searches than established tokens like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. The project is led by German mathematician Richart Dedekind, indicating high long-term potential. The $NOLA token will serve as the main currency in a new ecosystem that includes a high-speed blockchain, a decentralized exchange, and a dApp for cryptocurrency transactions via WhatsApp. With WhatsApp's user base projected to exceed 3.1 billion by 2025, the adoption of the dApp could lead to a skyrocketing token value, potentially reaching over $100. A total of 15 million $NOLA tokens will be minted, and the current presale price is 50 cents per token. The Nollars Network will enable seamless asset transfers across different blockchains and has passed KYC verification, enhancing its legitimacy. AscendEX crypto exchange plans to list the $NOLA token in January, reducing the risk of scams and suggesting strong future growth potential. Presale Data Overview: Token Name: Nollars Network Symbol: $NOLA Creator: Richart Dedekind Total Token Supply: 15,000,000 Presale Price: $0.50 Listing Day Price: $0.83 Return on Investment Potential: +66% CEX Listing Month: May 2025, contingent upon reaching the soft cap Utility: Facilitates expedited trading and improved spot pricing, resulting in cost savings. Furthermore, it serves as the foundation for a new cryptocurrency ecosystem, which will include a decentralized exchange (DEX) and an e-commerce solution integrated with WhatsApp. Official Website: www.Nollars.com #2 Yeezy (YZY) A new token presale, Yeezy coin, linked to rapper Kanye West (formerly Ye), is rumored to launch in March 2025. The token is expected to be used for purchasing Yeezy shoes, clothing, and merchandise, as Kanye regains control after parting ways with Adidas. The Yeezy brand is valued at over $3 billion, with potential high sales for new collections. If the Yeezy coin launches alongside the relaunch of Yeezy.com, its market capitalization could soar, potentially placing it in the Top 10 cryptocurrencies. A significant return on investment (ROI) is anticipated if the presale price is below the listing price. Background details on another token, Nollars Network ($NOLA), include a presale price of $0.50, a listing price of $0.83, and a potential ROI of +66%. The token will support a decentralized exchange and an e-commerce solution. Presale Data Overview: Token Name: Yeezy Symbol: $YZY Creator: Ye, also known as Kanye West Total Token Supply: Information not available Presale Price: Information not available Listing Day Price: Information not available ROI Gap: Information not available CEX Listing Month: Information not available Utility: The official digital currency for Yeezy footwear, apparel, and merchandise, associated with a brand valued at approximately $3 billion Official Website: www.Yeezy.com #3 - Bitnance (BTN) Each blockchain has its own version of Bitcoin, and the Binance ecosystem is set to see the launch of Bitnance (BTN) on the BEP-20 network. BTN is currently in its presale phase with a soft cap of $1 million and a total supply of 10,500,000 tokens, half of which is for presale. Bitnance aims to provide lower transaction fees than Bitcoin and offers advantages over the Bitcoin blockchain; a digital store of value asset. BTC is projected to reach $250,000 this year, which, while a solid return, requires significant new investment; BTN represents a pioneer investment opportunity. Investors are encouraged to adopt a long-term HODL strategy with BTN, recalling Bitcoin’s growth from less than 1 penny in 2011 to over $100,000 today. BTN is currently priced at $0.38, with nearly 118,000 tokens sold and a gradual price increase in the presale. The cryptocurrency will operate autonomously, controlled by investors' spending power, serving as a store of value against fiat currency inflation. This is commonly referred to as a SOV token or ‘digital store of value asset.’ Presale Data Overview: Token Name: Bitnance Symbol: $BTN Creator: N/A Total Token Supply: 10,500,000 Presale Price: $0.3804 Listing Day Price: $0.47 Return on Investment Gap: +23.66% Centralized Exchange Listing Month: October 2025 (soft cap of $1 million; hard cap of $2.5 million) Utility: Store of Value Official site / white paper: www.Bitnance.net Best 3 Token Presales for Crypto Investors in March 2025 A savvy investor has a varied investment portfolio. As we near April 2025, analysts have firm belief that these cryptocurrencies are the best 3 initial coin offerings for a chance at getting a better return on investment than the precious metal Gold [AU] and most cryptos. Watch Nollars Network (NOLA), Yeezy (YZY), and Bitnance (BTN) closely. While Yeezy (YZY) may not have its presale this month, it’s anticipated that it could launch in March. When making investments, prioritize your financial objectives over the actions of rapper Kanye West. Keep an eye out for announcements regarding the Nollars Network’s decentralized WhatsApp application, as this could mark a crucial development in the cryptocurrency space.

Remittix Continues Marching Into Crypto Greatness With 4x Gains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/has-solana-price-reached-support-or-is-the-worst-yet-to-come-remittix-continues-marching-into-crypto-greatness-with-4x-gains/,"Solana (SOL), now trading at approximately $125.12 having dipped more than 2% in the past 24 hours, sits on the precipice of a vote that would fundamentally change its token inflation mechanism. Tweaking inflation rates in line with staking could support the price of SOL, say experts, but others warn that short-term numbers are dictating a long-term change Meanwhile, fast rising altcoin Remittix (RTX), currently trading in the area of $0.0734 having raised more than $13.7m and selling 516+ million tokens, has caught traders’ attention with its real-world application and future development potential. Solana Dynamic Inflation Proposal Improvement Proposal-0228 (SIMD-0228) would substitute the current fixed model of inflation (4.6% to 1.5%) with a dynamic model that rewards or trims token creation as a function of the ratio of SOL that is being staked. Inflation rises to incentivize more stakers to participate and secure the network if it is low (less than 33% of the network). Inflation is cut to avoid unnecessary dilution if it is high. Tushar Jain and Vishal Kankani of Multicoin Capital and Anza economist Max Resnick head the proposal. Some, such as VanEck’s Matthew Sigel , support the transition, as they argue that it is achievable to have low inflation without sacrificing security. Others, such as MetaDAO co-founders Nallok, have worries about too much dependence on short-term validator data and that a dynamic fee model could prove to be a more appropriate model. SOL prices at around $135. Source: CoinGecko At SOL prices of approximately around $125.12 , opinion remains split as to if the slide by the coin is new support or if more declines await. Solana’s current fervor is centered on tokenomics, but others question if that will hold investors’ fascination. Some see a potential way to an ETF if Solana brings down the level of inflation, with an institutional demand spark as a possible catalyst. Fear exists that adjusting parameters of inflation mid-course will alienate existing validators. Remittix (RTX): The 4x Gainer Bec In Solana’s rollercoaster, the lead is taken by Remittix (RTX), which rose 4x in value in the presale and now is trading around $0.0734. Having raised more than $13.7 million and selling 516+ million tokens, RTX brings something simpler: instant-ish cross-border payments. No end-to-end smart-contract platform to construct or change inflation every quarter; Remittix is all about simple exchange. Someone in Europe sends money in BTC or ETH and someone in Asia gets local cash in the bank in about 24 hours. Such a simple, real-world solution is attracting families, freelancers and small stores who need cheaper, faster transfers. If Remittix (RTX) is paired with e-commerce or payroll services, the number of users could balloon, taking the token price even higher. Why Traders Prefer Remittix to Solana Solana’s dynamic inflation scheme generates new buzz but also brings complexity with it. SOL stakers have to track shifting rates, and validators have to stay on high alert. Remittix (RTX), on the other hand, solves a daily need of low-cost, fast remittances without the need for users to deal with complicated blockchain protocols. Then, the token-locked funds and audit-secured smart contract on Remittix eliminate scam risks, a big plus in an industry with an abundance of perilous presales. Market commentators compare RTX to such tokens as XRP that surged on hopes of simplifying cross-border finance. The difference is that Remittix could roll out answers ahead of the pack, attracting mass users more concerned with savings than with exotic DeFi concepts. That real-world pull could drive saner expansion than a token burdened with inner gov debates. Conclusion: Can Solana’s Innovation Keep Up with the Real-World Attraction of Remittix Solana’s dynamic inflation model needs to calm the future of the chain but could unsettle some players. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX), currently trading at $0.0734 and having raised over $13.7m, sits higher by solving a common problem: sending money affordably across the world. If demand by users drives the next wave of crypto, Remittix could overtake Solana’s conservative tokenomics. Ready to Check Out Remittix?

The market cap of the coins, whose value is pegged to a real-world equivalent such as the U.S. dollar, climbed as high as $205 billion, Glassnode data shows. Demand was buoyed by investors seeking relief from sliding cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin ( BTC ) and ether ( ETH ). Since President Donald Trump won the U.S. election, the stablecoin market cap has grown by $40 billion. With both cryptocurrencies and U.S. equities struggling in recent weeks, stablecoins have emerged as the clear winners. Market leader Tether's USDT has maintained a market cap of around $140 billion since December, while second-placed USDC, issued by Circle, is nearing $60 billion — an increase of $25 billion since the election. At the Digital Asset Summit on Friday , Bessent said, ""We are going to keep the U.S. the dominant reserve currency, and we will use stablecoins to do it."" Bessent's remarks highlight concerns over macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, which could lead to a decline in foreign demand for U.S. debt, pushing treasury yields higher. Over the past year, Japan and China , the two largest holders of U.S. Treasuries, have reduced their holdings. For the dollar to maintain its status as the world’s reserve currency, there must be consistent demand for U.S. debt. The administration identified stablecoins as an ideal partner in this strategy. By holding U.S. debt as reserves, stablecoins can help lower Treasury yields while simultaneously expanding the global reach and dominance of the dollar. Stablecoins need to have dollars available to repay investors looking to cash out. Tether is already one of the largest holders of three-month U.S. Treasuries.",Markets|Stablecoins|Bitcoin|Tether|USDC|Circle,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|USDT|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-10 09:53:09

This has sparked fresh investment among traders. Today, HBAR’s price hovers at $0.22 this week, fueled by a mainnet upgrade and a $2 billion ETF filing by Canary Capital. Also, a trending Asian meme coin, Panshibi (SHIBI) , is capturing attention with its charming panda theme. After achieving over $1.23 million raised in its presale, SHIBI promises wild 100x gains as more Asian traders take a piece. Let’s find out more about HBAR and Panshibi in this article. 10B Market Cap Incoming as Hedera Sparks New Interest Hedera (HBAR) is on fire as it races toward a $10 billion market cap as of March 9, 2025. This surge has got everyone talking as it hopes to go back above 10 Billion. Right now, HBAR’s price is around $0.203 after a recent but short lived uptrend which pushed its market cap to about $9.5 billion. This jump comes after a mainnet upgrade that slashed transaction fees and boosted transaction speed. Also, Canary Capital filed for a Hedera ETF this month. This signals that traders have a big trust in its future. In addition, since Trump’s U.S. crypto reserve announcement, Hedera has enjoyed the general market pump. Posts on X also show traders falling about HBAR’s potential to hit $0.75 by year-end. Since it features an eco-friendly tech that is highly attractive to corporate eyes, this is truly possible. Unlike some coins, Hedera is not just hype. It is built for real-world use, like tracking supply chains or powering apps. This is a reason why it is sparking new interest and pulling in investors who want more than just memes. Speaking of memes, a trending Asian meme coin, Panshibi (SHIBI) , is tempting some Hedera fans to peek over. This is no surprise as Hedera’s steady climb feels like speculation and a less solid bet that depends on many things. With Bitcoin and Ethereum fluctuating constantly, Hedera might feel the influence and also remain unstable. Thanks to the trending Asian meme coin, SHIBI, investors can invest in a coin more definitively as they wait for HBAR to make its leap to a $10B market cap. Investors Explore New Asian Meme Coin That Promises Huge Profits As the market remains unstable, investors are diving into Panshibi (SHIBI), a trending Asian meme coin with a roadmap to the top. This panda-inspired token has pulled in over $1.23 million in its presale and this is just the beginning. With a $10 million cap limit and only 15 days left, more investors are trying to get in before the presale ends. Now, SHIBI presale is at stage 4 and the token is priced at $0.005 after an increase from its starting price. Also, experts say the price is set to jump 1,200% during presale. This offers profits to early adopters who get into Panshibi before it launches. Also, Panshibi will soar 145,000% after hitting exchanges like Uniswap and other DEXs. Apart from the numerous profits, Panshibi also offers real perks. Investors can simply let their tokens work for them by staking $SHIBI and qualifying for a huge 1,200% APY. Also, early buyers will get into the Bamboo Private VIP Club where various exclusive rewards are shared. To prevent rug pulls, the team will lock liquidity for 10 years and team tokens will not be traded for 2 years. After the presale, leftover tokens will also be burned to increase scarcity and price. Thanks to Consuit, this trending Asian meme coin has solid contract security as this independent contractor has verified that there are no loopholes. Conclusion With major cryptocurrency prices fluctuating every other day, some experts say this is not the best time to invest in these coins. However, the trending Asian meme coin, Panshibi, is an outlier with a roadmap to the top of the charts. Just like HBAR investors who have begun to invest in Panshibi, other investors are taking the cue to hop in before it launches. This is an opportunity of a lifetime and experts say many millionaires will be made after the launch surge. Will you be one of them?

41425924,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/viral-020-coin-joins-polkadot-dot-and-shiba-inu-shib-as-februarys-top-picks-for-big-money-investors,1741600753,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41425924.jpeg,Viral $0.20 Coin Joins Polkadot (DOT) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) as February’s Top Picks for Big Money Investors,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/viral-020-coin-joins-polkadot-dot-and-shiba-inu-shib-as-februarys-top-picks-for-big-money-investors,"Investors are making hefty investments in crypto in February 2025, eyeing projects with substantial upside growth. Polkadot (DOT), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Rexas Finance (RXS) are the hottest investments being discussed. As SHIB keeps attracting more enthusiasts toward meme coins, DOT is enjoying a skyrocketing social volume. RXS, on the other hand, has gone viral and is gaining significant capital investment as it approaches its exchange listing. Polkadot (DOT) Gains Momentum as Social Volume Spikes DOT is back in the spotlight, with its social volume reaching 92 recently, indicating an increase in shilling. The spike in engagement is a very good sign for those wanting to trade and buy Polkadot because prices will likely increase. As Polkadot continues with its social dominance this month at 0.4417%, it has also become one of the most talked-about assets in the crypto world. Currently, DOT is hovering around its important support level of $3.74. This price zone has historically been a strong buy region that has helped recover and increase the value significantly. Analysts have divided opinions about DOT. If it exceeds this predicted price, it can reach $5.25 and eventually $6.50. Due to the recent drop, investors speculate that the impending breakout will increase the value significantly. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Keeps Investors Engaged SHIB is still very popular with retail traders as some price predictions have provided a very gradual growth in February. Analysts also expect that SHIB will incorporate new buying activities and an improving crypto market towards an increase from $0.0000152 to $0.0000153. All those who sold SHIB for profits made good returns, making SHIB popular. If market scenarios align for SHIB, further increases seem possible. However, the increased popularity of SHIB has attracted many investors toward newer opportunities, including Rexas Finance (RXS). Reasons Why Rexas Finance (RXS) Is in the Limelight While both DOT and SHIB have become well-known cryptocurrencies, RXS is still in its presale phase, where early investors have the unique opportunity to purchase the token before it hits major exchanges. RXS has completed 90.43% of Stage 12 of the presale and has successfully raised over $46.4 million while selling 452.1 million tokens. Early investors prefer to consider RXS at its current price of $0.20, much cheaper than its expected listing price of $0.25 on June 19, 2025. RXS is unique in its multi-utility ecosystem, which is designed to solve some of the most pressing problems in blockchains. The platform comprises: Rexas AI: An intelligent trading software that improves investment decisions. Rexas Treasury is a liquidity and funding mechanism that helps sustain the project over time. Rexas Token Builder: A platform where users can create their own digital assets on a blockchain with utmost simplicity. These features give RXS utility beyond being just a meme coin. With a CertiK security audit, an active dev team, and a supportive community, RXS is on its way to becoming a powerful token in 2025. Comparison of RXS with DOT and SHIB RXS has a distinct advantage of early entry, as it is still in the presale stage, compared to other established players like DOT and SHIB, which have strong investor bases. The fundamentals for DOT are strong; however, it is extremely volatile and trading in the low accumulation zone, with an uneventful and uninspiring potential upside of 50% to 100% in the foreseeable future. SHIB is also a fan favorite, and many people are attached to it. Still, its volatility makes it an unreliable bet, with price action often subject to social media speculation and hype. RXS is still new and relatively untamed, making it more likely to experience a 10x or even 20x increase quicker than expected. RXS has not yet hit major exchanges. RXS is almost entirely sold out and looks ready to get listed on a major exchange. With whale investors and smart traders betting on its price tag, it makes for a cost-efficient investment. Considering the ecosystem and utility of RXS, it is set to become one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in 2025. Conclusion: RXS Leads the Charge for February's Big Money Picks The February investment spotlight is equally shared among Polkadot, Shiba Inu, and Rexas Finance. However, RXS makes the strongest case for investment, considering the potential multi-fold returns it can offer. DOT's breakout and the overly hyped SHIB meme coin are the only things pumping. RXS offers early-stage investors an opportunity for massive returns before the exchange listings. With whales accumulating as the presale ends, RXS is topping the leaderboard for picks of the 2025 bull run—for now, at least. Investors looking for the next big story this year or searching for a crypto success internationally can look to RXS.

41425908,https://crypto.news/?p=14344045,1741600808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/41425908.jpeg,Japan’s crypto reform bill headed to National Diet after cabinet approval,https://crypto.news/japans-crypto-reform-bill-headed-to-national-diet-after-cabinet-approval/,"The Cabinet of Japan has green lit a proposal to amend the Payment Services Act, which would ease regulations for stablecoins and crypto brokerages. According to a press release issued by the country’s Financial Services Agency , the bill has already been approved by the Cabinet and was submitted to the National Diet on the same day. The bill was previously approved by the FSA and could potentially make it easier for crypto firms to enter the Japanese market. For a bill to pass through the National Cabinet, it must receive a majority vote from the Cabinet members present at the meeting. The Cabinet is led by the Japanese Prime Minister, who plays a key role in determining consensus, as the Cabinet operates under the principle of collective responsibility. Once approved, the bill is formally submitted to the National Diet for legislative debate and voting. Once it passes through to the Diet, the bill is assigned to a relevant committee where it is examined, debated, and potentially amended before it is introduced to the full chamber. If both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors approve the bill, it is then sent to the Emperor for ceremonial promulgation, which will formalize the law and eventually enact it. Read more: Japan’s FSA approves reforms to ease stablecoin and brokerage regulations What are the potential changes to Japan’s crypto regulations? The bill would allow for stablecoins to be backed by short-term government bonds and fixed-term deposits, aside from only the demand deposits. This clause also comes equipped with an upper limit of 50% for government bonds and deposits that can be used as collateral for stablecoins. At press time, stablecoin issuers in Japan are required to match the amount of circulated tokens on a 1:1 ratio with cash deposits in regulated bank accounts. The new rule grants them more flexibility to be able to use other assets like Japanese and U.S. government bonds instead. However, only certain types of bonds can be used, including those with a remaining maturity of three months or less. In addition, the bill will also create a new category just for “intermediary” crypto businesses or brokerages. In Japan, crypto brokerage firms can only operate within the country if they manage to fulfill the same registration requirements as crypto exchange platforms. This means that crypto brokerages need to apply for a virtual asset service provider license, just like domestic crypto exchanges. Under the new bill, intermediaries will abide to their own set of requirements and anti-money laundering obligations, instead of being clumped together with exchanges that operate differently.

However, instead of the bull market, it crashed, liquidating millions of digital assets. Interestingly, a Bitcoin whale has earned $7.5M with these events, leaving the crypto community wondering if it is a Trump insider. What’s the story? Let’s discuss this. Bitcoin Whale Predicted the Trump Executive Order Crash According to the Lookonchain post , an alleged Trump insider executed a short position at $96,500 on February 22. Interestingly, its predictions came true: the Bitcoin price plummeted below $80,000, closing the bottom near $78,900. But that’s just the start, as Trump’s Executive Order brought a price surge in Bitcoin, which favored the whale. As the BTC soared past $94,000, the whale re-entered a short position at the peak of ~$94,424. Overall, this person made another heavy profit even in the crypto market crash , earning $7.5M collectively. The community has tagged it as a Trump-insider, as its two predictions have come true. Interestingly, the trader is again eyeing profits as BTC hovers around $82,054. The Bitcoin whale has set additional short positions between $92,449 – $92,636 and placed limit orders to take profit between $70,475 – $74,192. If the price surged, the trader could earn another $70K–$74K in profits. Bitcoin Price Predictions: What’s Coming Next For BTC? With another crypto market crash, Bitcoin’s price dropped 4.5% in the last 24 hours. It currently trades at $80,350 and is facing bearish sentiments as US CPI data is to be released soon. Amid the mass liquidation and bearish sentiments, investors are concerned about a further downtrend. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has highlighted a declining downtrend with the bearish pennant pattern formation. Adding to his prediction, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicts that BTC will retest $78k, and a failure at that could push it down further. An ugly start to the week. It looks like $BTC will retest to $78K. If it fails, $75K is next in the crosshairs. A lot of options OI is struck at $70-$75K—if we get into that range, it will be violent. Conclusion: Trump Insiders in Action? In addition to the aforementioned Bitcoin whale, another trader made heavy returns with the Donald Trump Executive Order and the crypto market crash. With the Ethereum shorting, an alleged Trump insider profited $81M in just two days. Crypto investors are left in awe of such incidents, where some praised these traders’ skills while others called them insiders. Now, the eyes are all on the Bitcoin price performance and whether this will make the trader another $70,000-$75,000 in profits.

The platform’s revenues are down to $667K in a day, after a long-running downward trend. Pump.fun is no longer a reliable producer of fees. Daily revenues fell to $667K daily as of March 8, the lowest in seven months. While Pump.fun still produces more revenues compared to other protocols, there are no signs of ending the downward trend. Just a day later, Pump.fun posted a little over $110K in daily revenues. The meme token platform also reflected the general loss of optimism for crypto, as even major coins sank deeper in the red. The total fees for the platform fell off a cliff, despite hovering above $1M in the past week. Within days, the fees were down another 90%. Pump.fun continued to bleed revenues, as retail is losing interest in risky meme tokens. | Source: DeFi Llama. The platform achieved its peak daily revenues in January, surpassing $15M in a single day. The downward trend continues, diminishing the platform’s returns every day. The platform has almost returned to its slump from September 2024, but this time, there are doubts about starting a new casino cycle. Token creation, listings also slow down One of the reasons for the lower fees is the low number of graduating tokens, which brings a 1.5SOL ‘graduation fee’. The other source of income is the 1% trading fee for all token swaps. In the past day, only 194 tokens graduated to Raydium with sufficient liquidity. Only 7,233 wallets were engaged with creating new tokens in the past day. Pump.fun still saw over 11K new launches, though most remained in their bonding curves. The platform’s activity slowed down to 159K new addresses, down from a recent maximum of 292K active addresses. The loss of users arrived after Pump.fun ended its random casino stage, where any meme had a chance of making it big. Instead, the platform started carrying more curated tokens, with the risk of insider influence. Pump.fun trading volumes also continued to decline, as traders became discouraged by aggressive rug pulls and sniping. At the peak of the cycle, Pump.fun carried up to $3B in value. Currently, the daily trading turnover is a little over $77M . The lack of ‘trenches’ traders also means launches may become unfavorable, as they would not be able to raise sufficient liquidity. The recent series of launches relies on teams to provide liquidity to move the token to Raydium. Pump.fun mostly tapped Solana insiders More than 72% of Pump.fun traffic comes from direct visits, with 7.73% from Google traffic. Pump.fun is tied to crypto-friendly countries, with the biggest share of traffic coming from the USA. The Pump.fun phenomenon brought new cohorts of users, but did not lead to crypto mass adoption. Only a few of the meme tokens built communities, and none had any utility, unlike meme tokens from the previous cycle. The positions of meme tokens correlate with the performance of Bitcoin (BTC) and the general sentiment of the crypto market. As such, meme tokens are not counter-cyclical, and have fallen deeper compared to other assets. The recent meme token cycle raised doubts about bringing more value to crypto. In total, Pump.fun extracted $500M in the market, liquidating the income through SOL sales. The new value from retail buyers was quickly taken out of the market, and did not move to BTC or other crypto assets. The last $400M in value were extracted between August 2024 and January, tapping the peak meme cycle coinciding with the US elections narrative. This led crypto analysts to view the 2024 cycle as aggressively PvP, where the few winners also caused deep losses for users. Pump.fun was seen as one of the most active PvP markets, which only achieved its fees and turnover based on a wide user base willing to lose SOL for the chance of winning with one hot meme token.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to as low as $80,000 before the bulls recovered some of the losses. The alternative coins have followed the negative performance of the leading digital asset, with many of them charting substantial losses. Another Downtrend for BTC Despite its brief spikes, Bitcoin has been on an evident downfall in the past several days. As CryptoPotato reported , the price consolidated at around $86,000 over the weekend, but the bulls had to take another blow with the start of the business week. A few hours ago, BTC tanked to as low as $80,000, resulting in multi-million liquidations on a 24-hour scale. Since then, though, the asset stepped on the gas pedal again, recovering to almost $84,000 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The enhanced volatility is expected to continue in the short term due to some upcoming events. One of those is the latest US CPI report scheduled for March 12. It will reveal the inflation rate in the world’s biggest economy, which could trigger an interest rate adjustment by the Federal Reserve. Historically, such efforts have affected BTC’s price performance. Meanwhile, the asset’s market capitalization stands at approximately $1.66 trillion, while its dominance against the altcoins is almost the same as on March 9 – around 58.1%. Alts Turn Red, too The altcoins have also gone into red territory. At one point, Ethereum (ETH) collapsed to a multi-year low of under $2,000. It later recovered some of the losses, and as of this writing, it is worth around $2,120. Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and many more have performed quite poorly, too . For its part, Pi Network (PI) continues to suffer and is now worth around $1.43, representing a 14% decline on a weekly scale . The very few top 100 cryptocurrencies that have charted some gains in the last 24 hours include Ethena (ENA), Aave (AAVE), and Story (IP). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization currently stands at roughly $2.82 trillion, representing a 5% decrease for the day .

Recently, Pi Coin’s price dropped by 10%, leaving many investors wondering whether it’s a buying opportunity or a warning sign to stay away. Massive Outflows Raise Concerns The recent drop in Pi Coin’s price happened due to a global crypto market correction, with Bitcoin plunging sharply to $80k. Perhaps many in the Pi community believe that this isn’t the sole reason behind the price plunge. Some traders suspect that a large outflow from the Pi Core Team (PCT) Wallet played a role in the decline. On March 7, nearly 90 million Pi tokens were moved out of the wallet, followed by another 36.4 million tokens the next day. Since this movement happened at the same time as the price drop, it led to speculation that the team might be selling off tokens. Upcoming Token Unlocks Looking ahead, the Pi Network is set to unlock a significant number of tokens over the next month. The largest unlocks are scheduled for March 17 and March 21, with over 23 million Pi tokens set to enter the market on each of these days. In total, around 282 million Pi tokens , valued at approximately $390.93 million, will be unlocked in the next 30 days. This increase in supply could add selling pressure, making it challenging for the price to recover in the short term. Key Resistance Level To Watch Despite the recent decline, technical indicators suggest a possible recovery. Market analyst Rose highlighted that Pi Coin is currently consolidating and testing a key Fibonacci retracement level. If it breaks above $2, a bullish reversal could be in play. The first resistance levels to watch are between $2 and $2.60. If Pi Coin manages to break above this range, it could move toward $3.00 and eventually $3.60. However, for this to happen, strong buying momentum will be needed. As of now Pi coin price is hovering around $1.4 refelcing a drop of 10% seen in the last 24 hours with its market cap hitting around $10 billion.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-10 10:08:12

Rolling out after receiving the mandatory MiCA license, BBVA’s new trading service, available by its mobile application, will allow users to buy, sell, and manage other Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) transactions by it. Notably, the trading service launch for these two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap comes as BBVA wraps up its year-long regulatory formalities with Spain’s financial regulator, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV). The move signals the growing demand for digital assets among traditional banking customers and underscores BBVA’s commitment to integrating innovative financial solutions. BBVA’s Entry into Crypto Trading BBVA has been exploring blockchain and digital asset solutions for several years, with its Swiss arm, BBVA Switzerland, launching Bitcoin trading and custody services in 2021. And now the bank’s latest initiative will extend these offerings to a broader client base in Spain, allowing customers to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin and Ethereum through BBVA’s digital banking platform. BBVA’s crypto trading services are expected to be integrated within its existing mobile banking app, enabling seamless access for retail and institutional investors. Users will be able to manage both traditional and digital assets within a single interface, streamlining the process of portfolio diversification. Regulatory Race for MiCA Permit BBVA’s move comes amid a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in Spain and across the European Union. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, set to take effect in 2024, aims to establish a comprehensive framework for digital assets, ensuring greater transparency, consumer protection, and institutional oversight. By offering crypto trading services, BBVA is positioning itself as a compliant and regulated bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. The bank will implement stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, ensuring adherence to European financial regulations. Additionally, BBVA’s crypto services will not initially include decentralized finance (DeFi) products or staking mechanisms, focusing instead on basic trading and custody solutions. However, the bank has indicated that it may explore additional crypto-related services depending on customer demand and regulatory developments. Impact on Spain’s Crypto Market BBVA’s entry into cryptocurrency trading is expected to have a significant impact on Spain’s digital asset landscape. While Spanish banks have traditionally maintained a cautious approach to crypto, BBVA’s decision could encourage other financial institutions to explore similar offerings. The move also reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, with major banks worldwide—including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank—actively developing digital asset services. BBVA’s involvement could bolster confidence in the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, potentially attracting a new wave of retail and institutional investors in Spain. Crypto industry experts believe that BBVA’s decision could accelerate Spain’s adoption of blockchain-based financial services. What’s Next for Spanish Customers? BBVA has hinted at potential future expansions in its crypto services, including the addition of more digital assets, tokenized securities, and blockchain-based financial products. The bank is also reportedly exploring partnerships with fintech and crypto firms to enhance its digital asset infrastructure. In the long term, BBVA’s involvement in crypto could pave the way for broader blockchain adoption across Spain’s financial ecosystem. As regulatory clarity improves and customer interest grows, the integration of digital assets into traditional banking could become a defining trend in the industry. Thus, BBVA’s decision to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of traditional finance and the digital economy. By providing customers with regulated access to cryptocurrencies, BBVA is positioning itself as a forward-thinking financial institution that embraces innovation. As Spain’s crypto market evolves, BBVA’s leadership in the space could set a precedent for other banks looking to enter the digital asset sector.

Bitdeer plans to start mass production in the second half of this year. However, the next chip design is already in progress. The team is doing the R&D work on the upcoming SEAL04 chip, according to the company’s product release roadmap. Bitdeer Chief Business Officer Matt Kong said that SEAL03 achieved a most critical performance milestone following prototype testing. The R&D commitment is “making possible innovative solutions that are setting new performance benchmarks that will benefit the wider mining ecosystem,” he commented. Additionally, the chip uses an advanced process node, in partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ). TSMC, which supplies semiconductors to the likes of Nvidia and Apple for AI use, recently reported combined revenue for the first two months of 2025 of $16.8 billion . This is a 34% rise in two months compared with the 34% growth during the full-year of 2024. Also, it announced a $100 billion investment in boosting chip manufacturing in the US, specifically building new chip manufacturing plants.

The cash flow statements of ten major US-listed mining companies for 2024 show a total spending of $4.6 billion on general property, plant, and equipment, according to the latest Miner Weekly report by BlocksBridge Consulting . These companies include Bitdeer , Cipher , CleanSpark , Core Scientific , HIVE , Hut 8 , IREN , MARA , Riot , and Terawulf . Per the data tracked by TheMinerMag , the total spending rises to $4.95 billion with the addition of several others companies that disclosed earnings until September last year. “This represents a fourfold increase compared to the $1.2 billion spent in 2023, following the bear market of 2022,” the report noted. Source: Miner Weekly Meanwhile, the companies that provided a breakdown of deposits and purchases for bitcoin mining hardware, spent over $3 billion on it in 2024. Not all companies provide this clear breakdown though. Furthermore, in 2024 – and almost all in Q4 – the ten major mining companies liquidated about $100 million worth of older-generation miners. The reason is the difficulty generating profits. Lastly, according to the report, “the total spending on and trading of mining-related property, plant, and equipment offers insight into how much bitcoin mining is supporting a broader supply chain network in the US and globally.” It cited a report by the economic research firm Perryman Group , commissioned by the Texas Blockchain Council and the Digital Chamber of Commerce , which estimated that Bitcoin mining created 31,000 jobs and generated $4.1 billion in gross product annually for the US economy. Meanwhile, in late February, Bitdeer invested $4 million in BTC despite the market downturn. It said it bought 50 BTC at an average price of $81,475 per coin. This brought its total holdings to over 640 BTC. Read more about it below.

This mover gained significant traction amid global pro-crypto developments, such as Trump’s push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile. SGX To Launch Open-Ended Bitcoin Futures Contracts In 2025 According to a Bloomberg report on March 10, SGX is planning to launch open-ended Bitcoin futures contracts as soon as the second half of 2025. This news was revealed by a company spokesperson via an email, per the report. Notably, this endeavor is set to offer services strictly to institutional clients and professional investors. Meanwhile, retail traders are to be excluded from trading this product. For context, the decision by a prominently established exchange operator to list Bitcoin futures contracts signals a paradigm shift in interest towards cryptocurrencies, coming in an effort to not lag in the global pro-crypto race. So far, Donald Trump’s pro-crypto advancements , such as the BTC reserve and a crypto stockpile announcement, have heated the global race for tapping into crypto’s full potential. Japan Joins The Fray? Also, CoinGape recently reported that even Japan seeks to launch crypto-backed ETPs. Reportedly, Japan sought crypto ETFs listing , as signaled by the nation’s ruling party’s recent proposal about cryptocurrency regulation. Besides, it’s noteworthy that regulatory approval from the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) is yet to be secured for the abovementioned feat. Nevertheless, SGX’s plan echoed a frenzy across the broader market, signaling the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies despite their volatile nature. Market Crumbles Despite Pro-Crypto Ushers Meanwhile, despite robust pro-crypto advancements, such as the White House crypto summit, U.S. BTC reserve, and crypto stockpile announcement, the market is yet to witness an uptick. Bitcoin backtracked to as low as $80K this Monday, whereas major altcoins also reversed recent gains. Reportedly, this waning action comes against the backdrop of over $680 million in liquidations across the crypto market , with macro fears also persisting due to new U.S. tariffs. Simultaneously, even the SGX’s plan to list Bitcoin futures contracts ahead failed to bring a bullish wave in the industry. Traders and investors are scratching their heads as the crypto market shows extreme volatility despite the most bullish developments unfolding across the broader sector over the last week.

In his Telegram channel, on-chain investigator ZachXBT shares a screenshot of a forfeiture complaint filed by federal prosecutors that details how Larsen’s wallet was compromised by a LastPass hack that occurred in 2022. Says ZachXBT, “A forfeiture complaint filed yesterday by US law enforcement revealed the cause for the 283 million XRP hack of Ripple co-founder, Chris Larsen’s wallet in January 2024 was the result of storing private keys in LastPass (password manager which was hacked in 2022).

The stolen XRP would be worth $661.6 million at today’s prices. Despite the massive hack, Larsen still holds roughly $7.18 billion worth of XRP after sending over $100 million worth of the altcoin to crypto exchanges in January alone while the token was rallying, according to ZachXBT. “With the announcement of the US Crypto Reserve here’s your reminder that XRP addresses activated by Chris Larsen (co-founder of Ripple) still hold 2.7 billion+ XRP and these addresses tied to him transferred $109 million+ worth of XRP to exchanges in January 2025… (Disclaimer: multiple of these addresses have been dormant for six to seven years so it’s possible he lost access or sent funds to other people in Feb 2013)…” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

After reaching $1.17 earlier this month, ADA has been declining, following a broader market downturn that triggered significant liquidations. Analysts are monitoring a potential recovery amid growing discussions about an ADA ETF. Will Cardano Price Hit $36 As Simpsons Forecast? Simpsons predicted Cardano price could reach $36, igniting speculation despite market downturns. The animated series has demonstrated accuracy in its predictions since it correctly predicted the elections of Donald Trump and Disney’s purchase of Fox along with the spread of Ebola. Additionally the show accurately predicted three products which include smartwatches along with video chat technology and the existence of a three-eyed fish near nuclear plants. Simpsons predicted both coronavirus and the destructive hornets known as murder hornets before either event occurred. Investors now focus on the recent ADA prediction because they want to understand its practical viability. The current market uncertainty encourages observers to investigate how the Simpsons’ past behavior might affect future price fluctuations. Key Levels To Watch Analyst Ali tweeted that the Cardano price is approaching a key support zone between $0.80 and $0.66. Holding above this range could trigger a strong move. His analysis highlights past price reactions at this level. If ADA maintains support, bullish momentum may build, but a drop below could signal further downside risks in the market. Is More Selling Pressure Ahead for ADA Price? The latest ADA price is trading at $0.74 after experiencing a slight decline of 5% in the last 24-hours. The top coin has recently failed to hold above the $0.80 level, leading to a downward trend. Most of the crypto market has seen a decrease, with The BTC price hovering around the $82k support level and the ETH hovering around $2k as the market faces a lot of liquidation. The current ADA price suggests selling pressure is increasing, with ADA approaching a critical support level near $0.70. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator remains in the negative zone, with the signal line at -0.0287. This suggests bearish momentum is still in play. The histogram also reflects continued selling activity, indicating further downside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36 on the 4-hour chart, showing that ADA is nearing oversold conditions. If bullish makes a comeback, the Cardano price prediction could attempt a rebound toward the $0.80 and $1 resistance level. On the downside, failure to hold the $0.70 support could result in further losses, targeting $0.60 in the short term. Cardano Price Chart: TradingView To sum up, the Cardano price remains under selling pressure, making a rally to $36 unlikely in the near term. However, ADA price trends show a potential for recovery under favorable market conditions. The next move will depend on key support levels and broader market sentiment.

This is occurring against a backdrop of increased pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stop its BTC accumulation strategy. El Salvador Remains Committed to Strategy The National Bitcoin Office announced the development on March 10 via X, revealing that in addition to its regular 1 BTC daily buy, the government acquired 5 more BTC. This brings the country’s total Bitcoin reserves to 6,111.18, valued at approximately $493 million at current market prices. The latest buy comes as Bitcoin’s price continues to decline, hovering just above $80,000 at the start of the week. El Salvador has previously made similar bulk purchases outside of its daily buying routine. The country added 12 BTC on January 19, followed by 11 BTC on February 4, and another 5 BTC on March 3. In December 2024, the Salvadoran government secured a $1.4 billion financing agreement with the IMF. As part of the deal, the nation agreed to revoke Bitcoin’s status as legal tender and limit public sector involvement with the cryptocurrency. The financial institution has consistently voiced concerns about the country’s BTC adoption, warning of financial risks. While some expected the agreement to scale back its accumulation strategy, the latest acquisition shows that the government remains active in increasing its holdings. IMF Pressure Continues Further pressure from the IMF surfaced on March 3, when the organization filed a new request for an extended arrangement under its fund facility for El Salvador. The technical memorandum outlined a condition that prohibited voluntary BTC accumulation by the public sector. Additionally, it called for restrictions on issuing any public sector debt or tokenized instruments linked to the flagship cryptocurrency. Despite these conditions, President Nayib Bukele remains committed to the holding strategy. Responding to the organization’s latest demands, the head of state dismissed the external pressure as ‘whining,’ saying that the Central American country would not stop its purchases any time soon. “No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘Bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future,” he declared in a statement posted on X.

However, lawmakers recently raised doubts on whether a digital euro can take flight, according to a Reuters report on Monday . Lawmakers are hesitant to trust the ECB with the running of a digital euro following an outage that occurred with the Target 2 (T2) payment system last month where it could not settle transactions for a day. T2 handles big transactions. Though an ECB official said that the digital euro would be similar to its instant payments system TIPS which is 24/7 and handles smaller transactions, the report added. CoinDesk reached out to the ECB for a comment. The ECB is keen to ensure the digital euro goes live. ""Fabio Panetta on the Board and then Piero Cipollone, who has replaced Fabio, have taken the lead together with a very good team, which is focused on accelerating the pace and hopefully campaigning enough with all the stakeholders – meaning the European Parliament, European Council, European Commission – so that we can eventually, not put to bed, but put to reality this digital euro,"" Lagarde said at a press conference on Friday . A decision by the EU's Governing Council on whether or not to issue a digital euro is expected to occur after legislation takes effect . The Governing Council includes Lagarde, Panetta alongside other members of the ECB board plus the governors of national central banks. The digital euro - which would be the EU's central bank digital currency (CBDC) - a digital token that a central bank issues - has been met with different viewpoints throughout the years. Some countries like Spain in the past have not seen a digital euro as something that their nation needs . Lagarde emphasised that the need is pressing. ""I think it is critically important, and for the agnostics or the sceptics, it now seems more relevant and more imperative than ever before, both on the wholesale and on the retail level,"" Lagarde said. Should the EU decide to issue a digital euro it will be following in the steps of countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica and Nigeria who have launched their CBDC's and veering away from the U.S.'s stance to not produce one .",Policy|ECB|Christine Lagarde|Digital Euro,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-10 11:51:13

Renç Korzay @renckorzay · Follow 𝐓𝐨𝐝𝐚𝐲, 𝐰𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐃𝐞𝐅𝐢. Until now, users have been stuck with an impossible choice: either accept generic, one-size-fits-all strategies or navigate overwhelming technical complexity on their own. That is… Watch on Twitter View replies 7:04 PM · Mar 7, 2025 48 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies By introducing ARMA agents equipped with protocol toggles, Giza aims to eliminate the longstanding tension between generic strategies and technical complexity, making DeFi accessible to a broader audience. ARMA: Giza’s flagship agents easing DeFi investment According to Korzay, DeFi users have for years faced an unenviable choice: rely on one-size-fits-all strategies that fail to meet individual needs or dive into the daunting world of technical intricacies to customize their financial approaches. This dichotomy has largely confined DeFi to a niche of tech-savvy enthusiasts, with Korzay noting that the lack of personalization has been a significant barrier. Giza’s solution shifts the paradigm by placing personalized agents at the forefront, allowing users to tailor their DeFi experience without wrestling with overwhelming complexity. At the heart of Giza’s innovation is ARMA, Giza’s flagship agent, which Korzay showcased as a game-changer. Launched on January 26, 2025, on the Base network, Korzay’s personal ARMA has been autonomously compounding stablecoins and harvesting ecosystem rewards ever since. Korzay described how it operates seamlessly in the background—whether he’s “touching grass, sleeping, or spending time with loved ones”—delivering profits without requiring constant oversight. The introduction of personalization, accessible through a simple toggle menu, lets users dictate which protocols their agent engages with, all with a single signature to activate. As if that is not enough, Korzay also demonstrated how ARMA users can now enable or disable specific DeFi protocols—like flipping a switch—without navigating convoluted interfaces or signing multiple transactions. This abstraction relegates protocols to backend infrastructure, transforming them from user destinations into silent components of a broader system. With such innovative features, the ARMA agent emerges as the sole user-friendly interface, stripping away complexity while preserving control. As Korzay put it, “The beauty of it is in the simplicity of it,” a sentiment that underscores Giza’s mission to democratize DeFi. A win for DeFi users Giza’s innovative approach carries profound implications for users and the broader DeFi market. For users, sophisticated financial strategies become attainable without the need to decipher underlying mechanisms. Protocols benefit from frictionless user acquisition, as the removal of UX barriers opens the door to wider adoption. The broader market stands to gain, too, with Korzay emphasizing improved capital efficiency and diversity. He pointed out that protocols with robust health parameters will naturally rise to prominence as agentic users gravitate toward them, fostering a healthier DeFi ecosystem. This, he argued, marks the dawn of “user-centric Web3,” where finance adapts to people rather than the other way around. Notably, Giza’s announcement has already sparked conversation within the DeFi community. An X user dubbed Shadow Holder praised the progress but called for enhancements, such as integrating more MorphoLabs vaults (e.g., Gauntlet USDC Core, Steakhouse USDC) and Sky Ecosystem’s sUSDS on Base. They also urged features like auto-reinvestment of rewards and the ability to add or withdraw funds without deactivating agents.

The outflows are the largest seen since December 2022. The withdrawals suggest investors are moving ETH to their private wallets for long-term accumulation. On-chain data revealed approximately 845,000 ETH left exchanges last week. The withdrawals are the highest weekly amount since December 2022. The outflows coincide with increased selling pressure as the crypto markets experience a downward trend. Data indicates over $1 billion worth of ETH exited exchanges last week Coinmarketcap data revealed Ethereum experienced increased volatility in the past month. The asset has lost over 50% of its value since December 2024. The coin is currently trading at $2,073, a 4% decline in the past 24 hours. The volatility comes after President Trump announced he would create a U.S. crypto reserve and include Ethereum in it. massive $1.8B [ $ETH ] outflow from exchanges last week – biggest since Dec 2022 rlly makes u think…while everyone's doom posting, smart money quietly accumulating at these levels + largest weekly outflow in 9 months literally screams accumulation szn pic.twitter.com/NeGwXdc33b — DeFi Protocol Sage 🏛️ (@DeFiProtocolist) March 10, 2025 Investors claimed that Trump’s announcement left more uncertainity in the market. They remained cautious as Ethereum tried to reclaim ground. On-chain data indicate that investors withdrew over 330,000 from exchanges after the president’s announcement on Thursday. The outflows suggested investors were moving Ethereum into private wallets. The withdrawals signal reduce selling pressure and possible long term accumulation. The analytic platform Tradingview suggested that for an ETH recovery rally to occur, bulls must defend the $2,100 level. It added that ETH could see a strong recovery if market sentiment improved and exchange outflows persisted. The platform suggested that a break past the resistance level would signal a renewed buying momentum. It added that an increase in ETH’s price would trigger a push towards higher prices. Nansen crypto intelligence platform research analyst said that Ether supply moving off exchanges was a general bullish signal. The analyst commented that similar trends were observed with Bitcoin. He added that the outflows suggest a natural shift toward self-custody and cold storage. Vugar Usi Zade, Chief operating officer at Bitget, commented that decreasing Ether supply in exchanges indicated that investors were shifting assets to cold storage rather than positioning for short-term sales. He added that such shifts have historically co-related with reduced sell-side pressure and stabilization. Analysts expect Ethereum staking ETFs to be the next ETH price catalyst Marcin Kazmierczak, CEO at Redstone, said that the potential introduction of staking Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) could be Ether’s next price catalyst. He added that it could further tighten Ethereum’s liquid supply. The CEO suggested that reduced supply could reinforce the asset’s proposition as an investment asset. According to Consensys founder Joe Lubin, Ether ETF issuers are expecting regulatory approval for staking in 2025. He added that fund issuers were working hard to create the best solutions for customers to deal with any complexities around staking and slashing. The founder suggested that ETF staking would be great for the ecosystem. He added that it would enable the crypto ecosystem to do a more diversified job. Lubin hinted the technology would also lead to greater client diversity. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced in January the establishment of a crypto task force. The regulator added that the task force would help develop a framework for digital assets to provide more clarity to customers. The regulator added that crypto-friendly Hester Pierce would lead the task force. Pierce commented that approval of staked Ether ETFs was more likely to be achieved with more pro-crypto commissioners within the SEC. Former Polygon financial chief Young Ko said that a Pierce-led task force was great for the industry. The former chief added that Pierce understood the technology and championed the builders. He commented that ETH staking ETF approval would be good for Ethereum and the greater ecosystem. Kean Gibert, an institutional relations contributor to Lido DAO, revealed that Ethereum stalking-enabled ETFs could become a reality under the new U.S. administration. He added that the current inability to stake ETF-held Ethereum represented a significant opportunity cost for institutional investors. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Singapore Exchange, the region’s primary asset exchange, plans to launch Bitcoin ( BTC ) perpetual futures contracts in the second half of 2025 as traditional exchanges expand their offerings in the crypto derivatives market. In a commentary for Bloomberg on March 10, an SGX spokesperson stated that the company will focus on institutional clients and professional investors, with retail customers excluded from access. While no specific timeframe was revealed, the spokesperson added that the offering will “significantly expand institutional market access” to the cryptocurrency. The products still need approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Perpetual futures, which have no expiry date, allow traders to bet on price changes without owning the underlying asset. These contracts are already popular on offshore crypto exchanges, with Citadel Securities-backed ventures also planning to offer perpetual futures in Singapore.

Tron (TRX) is building pressure near resistance, Pi Network (PI) is gaining community traction, and BitLemons (BLEM) is rewriting the rules with real revenue and a fast-selling presale. Which way will the market turn? With TRX’s potential breakout looming and PI’s listing rumors swirling, BitLemons stands out with a business model that’s already delivering. Will investors bet on stability, speculation, or the hottest new opportunity in crypto? BitLemons hits Turbo Mode with unmatched growth BitLemons isn’t just another contender; it’s the leading car on the track. Its web3 gaming platform is fully operational, featuring more than 8,000 games from industry leaders like Evolution and Pragmatic. Unlike projects stuck in neutral, BitLemons is a revenue-generating powerhouse, ensuring it keeps its speed even when market conditions get rough. The presale is moving at breakneck speed. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days. Now, Stage 2, priced at $0.02, is already over 85% sold, with only 4.8 million tokens remaining before the price accelerates to $0.03 in Stage 3. Over $1.86 million has been raised, proving that investors recognize a winner when they see one. Security is top-tier, with dual audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof ensuring a smooth ride for investors. BitLemons’ tokenomics are designed for long-term performance, with 30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) fueling buybacks, burns, and staking rewards. With celebrity partnerships and continuous game releases on the roadmap, BitLemons is building up speed with no signs of slowing down. TRX gears up for a major acceleration Tron has kept its wheels spinning, but analysts believe it could be gearing up for a breakout. TRX has been consolidating near key resistance levels, with predictions of a push toward $0.30 and long-term projections eyeing a potential race to $1, provided momentum stays strong. Market observers are watching closely as TRX approaches resistance. A breakthrough could be the green light for an upward surge, but if momentum stalls, Tron might find itself stuck in traffic, consolidating further before making another push. PI stuck in the pits waiting for a boost Pi Network has built a massive fan base, recently surpassing 4 million followers on X (formerly Twitter). While its community keeps the engine running, Pi’s biggest challenge remains getting listed on major exchanges like Binance. Speculation around a potential listing has fueled excitement, as exchange access would bring more liquidity and visibility. However, without official confirmation, PI remains in the pit stop, waiting for a game-changing boost to enter the fast lane. BitLemons races toward the finish line In a market filled with sharp turns and sudden stops, BitLemons is built for endurance and speed.

The US government's Strategic Reserve for Bitcoin is largely insignificant, as it involves holding seized assets without new buying, impacting prices minimally. Many companies, including Strategy, hold significant Bitcoin in treasury, supporting prices unless a bear market triggers forced selling. Despite current challenges, I maintain a Buy rating on Bitcoin, advising caution in the near term but optimism for long-term gains. Crypto has been in the news yet again recently, as we’ve been hearing about a so-called Strategic Reserve from the Trump administration. A summit took place late last week in a much-anticipated move that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bulls were hoping would result in a tsunami of US government-backed buying. I’m not sure that’s what we’re getting, and as a result, the Strategic Reserve is a bit of a non-event in my view. In addition, while I think Bitcoin is going much higher over time, the current short-term picture is undeniably pretty ugly. Let’s dig in. A failed consolidation Let’s start with the daily chart, and a failed rectangular consolidation. We had a huge run-up to new records in Bitcoin after the election in the US, and that resulted in a multi-month rectangular consolidation. That kind of thing is generally resolved higher, but not this time. Indeed, we had a breakdown in February and that breakdown has held, which is most unwelcomed for bulls. StockCharts.com On the daily chart, we now have both moving averages heading lower, and the price well below both. With this being the case, and the clear breakdown, we have to wait and find a tradable bottom before putting new money to work. The first sign that we have a tradable bottom is, ideally, a move back above that ~$90k level and back into the former consolidation zone. For now, we have no signs of accumulation and are firmly in a bearish phase for the moment as markets in the US go risk-off in general. On the longer-term weekly chart, it’s much easier to be bullish. StockCharts.com We can see that big run after the election and the subsequent selloff, but on the weekly chart, it looks more like a routine test of a breakout level. The PPO and RSI are both ahead of key levels (the PPO centerline, and 40 on the RSI), so again, I’m generally still bullish long-term. There is nothing on this chart that makes me think Bitcoin is in a new bear market. Key support is the 50-week moving average at~$75k, and the breakout level just below that. That will feel like a big bearish move if we get there from the $109k high, but in terms of Bitcoin pullbacks, that would be pedestrian. To sum up the technical picture, Bitcoin is certainly in a bearish phase on the daily chart, but nothing long-term has changed in my view. Much ado about nothing? The idea of Strategic Reserve for Bitcoin is a big reason why Bitcoin shot higher after the election in the US. Without any details, investors were quite excited about the idea that a buyer with virtually endless cash – the US government – would suddenly start to snap up Bitcoin left and right, driving prices higher. That hasn’t happened, and based upon what I’m reading, the Strategic Reserve isn’t likely to mean much of anything for Bitcoin prices. The Executive Order states that the US should have a “Digital Asset Stockpile” that will be capitalized by coins already owned by the US through assets seized through criminal or civil forfeiture cases. In other words, the first part of the EO simply reverses the government’s prior penchant for selling seized assets, Bitcoin included. The government is nowhere near big enough of an owner to impact prices by simply not selling seized assets. It owns about 200,000 coins today, so it’s a significant holder. That’s a few days of trading volume, on average, for Bitcoin, so if the government sells or not I don’t see it as a significant impact long-term. If we think about it in terms of total Bitcoin supply, it's less than 1%. The second part is that the Treasury and Commerce secretaries have the power to acquire additional Bitcoin provided it imposes no incremental cost on taxpayers. What’s interesting about that is the EO says the government can acquire Bitcoin, but also says essentially they cannot spend any money. Not totally sure how that is supposed to work, but that line about it not imposing costs on taxpayers, to my eye, means there is no wave of buying coming. The White House also held a crypto summit with industry leaders, including those of companies that are holding large amounts of Bitcoin. The president has said he wants the US to be the superpower of the world when it comes to crypto. That could be good for operators of data centers, utilities that provide power to miners, and the miners themselves. I’m not sure this has much – if any – impact on the price of Bitcoin itself directly. The bottom line on the EO and the summit is that details are in short supply, and we’re getting a “sell the news” response in Bitcoin prices. For that reason, I think the EO and the summit are indeed much ado about nothing. Other considerations With the summit and the EO now out in the open, and borderline meaningless as far as I can tell, let’s focus on Bitcoin fundamentals itself. I mentioned long-term the price chart looks good, while the daily chart looks less so. But let’s take a look at some other considerations. We have more and more companies holding Bitcoin in treasury, a strategy made popular by Strategy ( MSTR ). But it’s not the only one. Bitcoin Treasuries There are dozens of companies that hold Bitcoin in treasury, and it accounts for about 3.13 million coins at present. If you add the US Treasury, we’re at ~3.3 million coins. That is significant volume, and is akin to a company where insiders hold massive amounts of the float. That can support prices as there are fewer potential sellers, tipping the scales in the favor of buyers. This only holds, however, if there is no bear market in Bitcoin prices. Debt-financed Bitcoin holders, such as Strategy , could indeed face selling pressure if prices plummet. Strategy holds about 2.4% of all Bitcoin supply, so if there’s a margin call risk in Bitcoin, it’s Strategy. To be clear, I do not think we’re going to see anything like that, but it could happen, and if Strategy is forced to liquidate even part of its holdings, Bitcoin prices will struggle to find a floor given the almost-certain confidence crisis that would ensue. On the supply side, difficulty continues to rise over time, as we all know it does. CoinWarz But as difficulty rises, it makes it ever more challenging to add more coins to supply. Indeed, with so many companies buying and/or mining Bitcoin and not selling them, demand for Bitcoin is often much greater than supply. We all know what happens when that is the case. The key thing to remember, however, is that while Strategy has soaked up enormous amounts of supply recently, its financing situation appears to be pretty well maxed out at the moment. That just leaves those companies mining but not selling, which is a much smaller pot of buyers than Strategy buying up 10k or 20k coins at a time. All in all, I don’t think the EO or summit mean much of anything for now. If the Treasury says they’re going to put new money to work, Bitcoin is likely to fly higher. For now, it’s meaningless to me. Bitcoin itself has broken down on the shorter time frames, similar to US stocks and other risk-on assets. I think the long-term picture is fully intact, but this period could get worse before it gets better. I’m sticking with a Buy rating on Bitcoin, with the caveat that the daily chart says to be careful for the near-term.

NEAR’s expanding DeFi ecosystem has increased its total value locked (TVL), yet its price remains closely linked to network engagement. At the same time, PEPE is holding firm at key support levels, hinting at a potential recovery. However, both assets rely heavily on market speculation, leaving long-term value uncertain. Web3Bay , in contrast, moves beyond price trends by integrating DeFi staking into e-commerce, allowing users to turn shopping into an investment. While traders navigate volatility, Web3Bay presents a model built on long-term financial sustainability and practical utility. NEAR Protocol’s DeFi Growth and Price Stability at $3 NEAR Protocol has seen its DeFi ecosystem expand significantly, with a 150% increase in total value locked over the past year, highlighting growing investor engagement. However, this rise in adoption hasn’t insulated NEAR from price fluctuations. After an early 2024 rally of 160%, the token experienced a summer pullback, followed by a 72% surge post-election before stabilizing at $3—a 60% decline from its peak. NEAR’s price movement remains closely linked to network metrics like daily active addresses and decentralized exchange volumes, both of which have yet to show sustained recovery. Analysts suggest that holding the $3 support could open the door to rebounds at $4.70 or $5.00, while a drop below this level might push prices toward $2. Currently, NEAR trades at approximately $3.06, reflecting a slight upward movement, but its future trajectory remains dependent on broader market sentiment and user activity. Pepe Coin Holds Ground as Investors Watch for a Breakout Pepe Coin (PEPE) has experienced significant price swings, dropping 40% over the past month and another 4% in the last week. Despite this volatility, PEPE is stabilizing at a key support level, which could indicate an upcoming reversal. Technical indicators suggest that if support holds, the next target could be $0.000016. A breakout above the $0.11 resistance may pave the way for $0.21, with a long-term possibility of reaching $0.41. PEPE’s future, however, is closely tied to broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance. Current accumulation patterns suggest that selling pressure is easing, potentially creating conditions for upward movement if market momentum aligns. Investors are watching closely, as PEPE’s ability to maintain its support levels could be the first sign of a larger recovery. Web3Bay’s DeFi Shopping Model: Turning Transactions into Passive Income Online shopping is no longer just about buying things—it’s becoming a way to grow your money. Web3Bay is changing the game by merging e-commerce with decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing users to earn while they shop. Instead of letting funds sit idle, buyers and sellers can stake their 3BAY tokens in liquidity pools, generating passive income alongside everyday transactions. For sellers, this means profits don’t just sit in a wallet—they start working immediately, earning additional returns. For buyers, staking rewards help balance out spending, making each purchase a smarter financial move. By integrating DeFi with shopping, Web3Bay is building a marketplace where money never stops working. The concept is already gaining momentum—Web3Bay’s presale has raised $1.6 million, with over 390 million tokens sold at a current price of $0.00524 in stage 5. As more people adopt this model, Web3Bay could completely change how we view online shopping, turning transactions into financial opportunities. Looking Ahead NEAR Protocol and Pepe Coin continue to attract interest, but their long-term viability remains tied to market sentiment. While NEAR’s DeFi sector is expanding and PEPE is stabilizing at key levels, their future depends on broader adoption and investor confidence. Short-term price movements may create opportunities, but sustainability requires more than speculation. Web3Bay offers an alternative approach by merging DeFi with real-world commerce, providing users with a way to earn while engaging in everyday transactions. As the crypto landscape evolves, platforms that prioritize practical utility over price speculation may lead the next phase of blockchain adoption.

In a post on X on March 10, Bailey suggested that the DOJ’s Bitcoin sales may have been ongoing despite former President Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, contributing to Bitcoin’s price decline. If the DOJ has been liquidating America’s bitcoin with haste (in defiance of the President) ever since getting court approval to do so 3 months ago… then Bitcoin’s price action makes perfect sense. — David Bailey $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) March 10, 2025 While some dismissed the idea, arguing that the DOJ’s holdings were insufficient to significantly move the market, others pointed to broader macroeconomic factors affecting Bitcoin’s price. Still, the speculation raised concerns over the potential implications of government-controlled Bitcoin reserves and the administration’s broader economic policies. Adding another layer to the discussion, Bailey had previously floated the idea of Trump enabling Bitcoin payments for his proposed “Gold Card” to attract foreign investment. President Trump should accept Bitcoin paid into the SBR in exchange for the “Gold Card” Many elites in emerging markets want to live in the U.S. but struggle to move $5M in USD out of their home countries. Bitcoin offers a simpler, safer, and more discreet solution. — David Bailey $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) March 9, 2025 Is the DOJ Secretly Selling Bitcoin? Bailey’s theory stems from a U.S. court’s December 2024 ruling granting the DOJ permission to liquidate 69,370 BTC seized from Silk Road. The DOJ has historically executed such sales in bulk auctions, but the lack of transparency around the timeline for these liquidations has left room for speculation. Bailey’s March 10 post on X fueled concerns that the DOJ may have been aggressively selling Bitcoin over the past three months. When one user asked how the community could prevent these sales, Bailey said cryptically, “Working on it.” Another user suggested waiting for David Sacks, the White House’s Crypto Czar, to confirm the sales, to which Bailey replied, “30 days.” While no official confirmation has surfaced, the discussion has intensified amid ongoing Bitcoin price volatility. The cryptocurrency fell to $80,052 on March 10, a 7% decline from the previous day. Source: TradingView Some analysts argue that while DOJ sales may have a short-term impact, macroeconomic conditions—including inflation reports and Treasury bond movements—play a larger role in Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Adding to the controversy, Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts noted that Bitcoin’s price trends align closely with corporate bond spreads and Treasury bond volatility. Bitcoin is like playing a game of Chicken with central banks. While my framework is turning bullish as the dollar plunges, two metrics still raise alarms: Treasury Bond volatility (MOVE Index) and Corporate Bond spreads. In this thread, I'll explain how these factors interact… pic.twitter.com/gWaGlVyo2A — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) March 10, 2025 He warned that expanding bond spreads could further pressure risk assets like Bitcoin. However, Coutts remained optimistic, pointing to growing nation-state Bitcoin adoption, anticipated ETF inflows, and Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy potentially acquiring up to 200,000 BTC this year. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A Double-Edged Sword? The speculation over DOJ sales comes amid broader uncertainty surrounding the U.S. government’s Bitcoin policy. Trump’s recent executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was initially seen as a bullish signal for institutional adoption. However, the policy’s details suggest a more complex reality. According to David Sacks, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be built exclusively from Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases. “The government will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings,” Sacks clarified on X . This revelation dashed hopes of a government-driven Bitcoin accumulation strategy, as the reserve would be formed solely from previously seized assets rather than new purchases. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 Furthermore, while the order prevents the sale of Bitcoin from the reserve moving forward, it does not clarify whether past liquidations, including those approved for Silk Road holdings, had already taken place. This lack of clarity has led to further speculation that the DOJ could have liquidated significant portions of Bitcoin before the executive order took effect. In a related development, some experts have suggested that Trump could bolster the reserve by liquidating other government-seized crypto assets. According to Arkham Intelligence data , as of March 10, the federal government held approximately 60,850 Ethereum ($125 million), 122 million Tether, and other assets such as Binance Coin (BNB) and Wrapped Bitcoin. If liquidated, these assets could yield an additional 5,000 BTC. Looking ahead, traders are closely watching upcoming economic reports, including the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on March 12 and the Producer Price Index (PPI) on March 13. These indicators could provide further insight into inflation trends and the Federal Reserve’s potential monetary policy shifts, which are critical for Bitcoin’s near-term price direction.

Crypto has always been about rebellion and experimentation. Like it or not, memecoins perfectly embody this spirit—not by promising groundbreaking technology, but by playing on emotions, internet culture, and a collective inside joke. You might also like: Only Solana could handle a memecoin supercycle | Opinion Memecoins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), Pepe ( PEPE ), Bonk ( BONK ), and others have all become “people’s money,” empowering users to poke fun at the financial system and established digital assets with pure satire. Crowd psychology: How FOMO and memes drive the market 2025’s crypto market proved one thing: the dumber a memecoin’s idea, the more people want to buy into it. It doesn’t make sense, yet that’s the point. Even after the LIBRA fiasco , the memecoin market cap is standing at over $63 billion, with meme tokens generating $5.45 billion in volume in the last 24 hours as of February 24, 2025. Among them are projects built on the most absurd themes imaginable—think butts, flatulence (sometimes occurring in unicorns), and even the pets of celebrities and influencers. And the craziest part? Their strategies work. Here’s the secret sauce: memecoins don’t just sell tokens—they sell a sense of belonging. Memecoins are not about technology or utility; they’re about being in on the meme. And nothing triggers FOMO like watching an absurd idea go viral and suddenly turn nobodies into millionaires. Social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Discord amplify this hype like gasoline on a fire. Once the meme takes off, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: the more people laugh, share, and talk about it, the more valuable the token becomes. It’s absurd, it’s irrational, and yet it works—because in the world of memecoins, the joke is the utility, and the community is the value. Cult memecoins and their secret recipe to success Memecoins date back to 2013—when Dogecoin started as a joke and became the internet’s currency. But several years later, Elon Musk’s support and influence turned it into a cultural phenomenon and a digital asset with an over $33 billion market cap that’s accepted at numerous stores worldwide. Riding on Dogecoin’s success, SHIB launched in August 2020 as the “Dogecoin Killer.” Of course, Shiba Inu didn’t slay the OG memecoin, but it did establish a loyal fanbase powered by community-driven hype, multiple exchange listings, and one of the best all-time ROIs in crypto at 1,438,500% as of February 24. Then came BONK in December 2022, Solana’s answer to the memecoin madness. Riding the wave of Solana’s comeback after the FTX collapse, BONK didn’t promise revolutionary tech or a complicated whitepaper—just pure, unfiltered meme energy. And somehow, that was enough to revive an entire ecosystem. In April 2023, PEPE launched not to “kill” other memecoins but to ride the wave of viral marketing and internet culture. With no roadmap, no utility, and no promises, it still became a success purely because it was based on one of the internet’s most iconic memes. Then there’s BUTTCOIN ( BUTTCOIN ), a memecoin designed to mock Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the entire idea of cryptocurrency. Ironically, it wants to become “the next Bitcoin.” While it’s obviously not serious, its price skyrocketed after its launch on January 30, 2025. Even after the LIBRA scandal wiped out a portion of the memecoin market cap, BUTTCOIN boasts a YTD ROI of 1,316% . The irony? The more people laugh at these memecoins, the more attention they get, and the more their value increases. How memecoins build loyal communities Memecoins are more than just tokens; they are social movements bringing humor and speculation to the crypto space. At their core are communities that share viral posts daily and often develop a cult following, going all in on their favorite meme tokens. Without the SHIB Army or PEPE holders, no one would know about these billion-dollar-market cap memecoins. Memecoins also gamify token ownership with humor and inside jokes. You don’t have to analyze whitepapers or complicated tokenomics. Just go full “degen mode” and ape in. Take BUTTCOIN, for example, which is based on an absolute joke that engages people—even those skeptical of crypto. And if someone thinks a meme from 2013 is dead, they need to think again: it has a community of nearly 200K members on Reddit alone. The future of memecoins: A bubble or a new culture? Memecoins are here to stay. Despite setbacks like the LIBRA scandal, their humor, simplicity, and strong communities continue to attract users. In crypto, ideas often matter more than technology, and meme tokens prove that hype and humor can build value. The question isn’t if they will survive but which one will rise next. Even without real utility, memecoins have carved out a place in internet culture, challenging norms and uniting communities. In a market driven by attention, memecoins are playing the game better than anyone—and that’s why they’re here to stay.

This sharp decline triggered massive market liquidations, wiping out nearly $650 million in the past 24 hours. With the crypto fear and greed index dropping to 17 (Fear) , investors are now questioning whether Bitcoin can recovery or see more drop ahead. US Bitcoin Reserve Triggered a Drop The U.S. government’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve led to a sharp 7% drop in Bitcoin’s price. The massive price drop was triggered mainly due to the plan that does not involve new Bitcoin purchases. Trump has instructed trade and commerce officials to find “budget-neutral” ways to acquire Bitcoin, but the details of how this would work remain unclear. The reserve will consist of Bitcoin seized by the government, mainly held by the Department of Justice. While this move suggests that the government won’t sell these assets, the lack of a clear buying strategy means it may not have a strong impact on the market. Liquidation Adding more Pressure According to data from CoinGlass, the crypto market saw liquidations worth approximately $650 million in the past day . Long traders took the biggest hit, suffering losses of nearly $500 million, while short traders faced around $147 million in liquidations. The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, worth $32.09 million. Bitcoin Struggles at Key Resistance Despite the sharp drop, Bitcoin managed to bounce back by 2%, reaching around $83,400. According to the crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe , bitcoin’s 12-hour price chart is hovering near critical levels. The first scenario suggests BTC could bounce from its current range and establish a new higher low, paving the way for a potential breakout. However, if it continues to struggle below $86K, a deeper correction could follow, possibly testing support near $78,000. Bitcoin’s price bounce has moved the Relative Strength Index (RSI) from oversold levels back into a weak zone, suggesting that sellers may still be in control.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-10 12:09:08

41430607,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138442,1741608647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial AI Copyright Lawsuit: Judge Greenlights Authors’ Case Against Meta,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-copyright-lawsuit-meta-greenlighted/,"The intersection of artificial intelligence and copyright law is heating up, and a recent court decision has sent shockwaves through the tech and creative industries alike. In a potentially precedent-setting move, a federal judge has allowed a significant portion of the AI copyright lawsuit brought by authors against tech giant Meta to proceed. This legal battle, known as Kadrey vs. Meta, throws a spotlight on the increasingly complex questions surrounding the use of copyrighted material to train powerful AI models. Why This AI Copyright Lawsuit Matters At the heart of this case is the allegation that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, utilized copyrighted books to train its Llama AI models without proper authorization. Authors, including renowned figures like Richard Kadrey and Sarah Silverman, argue that this constitutes a blatant violation of their intellectual property rights . They further claim that Meta deliberately removed copyright information from these books to conceal the alleged infringement. This lawsuit isn’t just about these specific authors; it’s about setting a crucial legal precedent for how AI companies can use creative works in the development of their technology. The outcome could dramatically reshape the landscape of AI development and content creation. Meta’s Defense: Fair Use and Standing Meta, in its defense, has invoked the principle of ‘fair use,’ a legal doctrine that allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without permission under certain circumstances. They argue that training AI models falls under this umbrella. Furthermore, Meta challenged the authors’ standing to sue, claiming they lacked sufficient grounds to bring the case to court. However, Judge Vince Chhabria decisively rejected this argument, stating that the alleged copyright infringement is indeed a ‘concrete injury sufficient for standing.’ This ruling is a significant win for the authors and a clear signal that the court is taking these allegations seriously. Key Allegations: Concealing Copyright Infringement Judge Chhabria’s ruling highlighted a particularly compelling aspect of the authors’ claims: the allegation that Meta intentionally removed Copyright Management Information (CMI) from the books used for training. According to the judge, the authors ‘adequately alleged that Meta intentionally removed CMI to conceal copyright infringement.’ This is a critical point because it suggests a deliberate effort by Meta to obscure the origins of its AI training data and potentially evade copyright obligations. The judge noted that these allegations raise a ‘reasonable, if not particularly strong inference’ of concealment. This aspect of the lawsuit could have far-reaching implications, potentially influencing how AI developers handle copyright information in the future. Setback for Authors: CDAFA Claims Dismissed While the ruling is largely favorable for the authors, it wasn’t a complete victory. Judge Chhabria dismissed claims related to the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA). The dismissal was based on the fact that the authors did not allege Meta accessed their computers or servers directly, but rather their data in the form of books. This part of the ruling underscores the complexities of applying existing legal frameworks to novel technological scenarios like AI training data scraping and usage. It highlights the ongoing need to adapt and potentially create new legal frameworks to address these emerging challenges. Glimpse into Meta’s Copyright Approach The lawsuit has already offered a revealing glimpse into Meta’s internal discussions and approach to copyright in the context of AI development. Plaintiffs’ court filings claim that even top leadership, including Mark Zuckerberg, authorized the use of copyrighted works for training Llama. Furthermore, internal communications reportedly discussed the use of ‘legally questionable content’ for AI training data . These revelations, if proven true, could significantly weaken Meta’s fair use defense and paint a picture of a company willing to push legal boundaries in its pursuit of AI advancement. The ongoing discovery process in this case promises to unearth even more details about how tech companies are navigating the murky waters of AI copyright. Broader Implications for the AI Industry Kadrey vs. Meta is not an isolated case. It is part of a growing wave of AI copyright lawsuits challenging the practices of AI developers. The New York Times’ lawsuit against OpenAI is another prominent example. These legal battles are forcing the courts to grapple with fundamental questions about copyright in the age of AI: Does training AI models on copyrighted material constitute copyright infringement? What constitutes ‘fair use’ in the context of AI training? How should copyright law adapt to the unique challenges posed by generative AI? The answers to these questions will have profound implications for the entire AI industry, potentially impacting innovation, development costs, and the availability of AI technologies. The outcomes of these lawsuits will likely shape the future of AI development for years to come, influencing how companies source data, train models, and navigate the complex legal landscape. What’s Next? With Judge Chhabria allowing the core copyright infringement claims to proceed, the Kadrey vs. Meta lawsuit is far from over. The next stages will likely involve further discovery, where both sides will gather evidence and build their cases. A trial could be on the horizon if no settlement is reached. The AI and creative communities will be watching closely, as the outcome of this case could set a powerful precedent for future AI copyright disputes and redefine the boundaries of intellectual property in the digital age.

Of the total settlement, $26 million will be paid as a civil fine, while $3.75 million will go toward customer restitution, FINRA disclosed on March 7. The regulator found that Robinhood repeatedly ignored red flags related to suspicious activity, failing to establish adequate monitoring systems. Regulatory Scrutiny on Robinhood One of FINRA’s primary concerns stemmed from Robinhood’s clearing system, which experienced severe processing delays due to surging trading demand between March 2020 and January 2021. This period notably coincided with Robinhood’s controversial trading restrictions on meme stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). Additionally, FINRA’s investigation revealed that Robinhood Financial and Robinhood Securities failed to detect or report manipulative trading, suspicious fund transfers, and even instances where hackers took over customer accounts. The company was also found to have opened thousands of accounts without proper identity verification, violating AML regulations. Misleading Promotions and Social Media Oversight Robinhood’s compliance failures extended beyond transaction monitoring. According to FINRA, the platform failed to supervise and retain records of its social media promotions, which included posts by paid influencers. Some of these promotions allegedly contained misleading or exaggerated statements, which misinformed investors about the risks of trading. Further, the regulator criticized Robinhood for “collaring” market orders—converting them into limit orders—which resulted in inaccurate or incomplete disclosures to customers. This practice led to the $3.75 million in restitution payments. Without admitting or denying FINRA’s findings, Robinhood Financial and Robinhood Securities accepted the settlement terms. This development follows a $45 million settlement Robinhood reached with U.S. securities regulators in January, where the company admitted to violating over 10 securities law provisions, including failing to preserve electronic customer communications between 2020 and 2021. Despite these regulatory setbacks, Robinhood’s financial performance remains strong. In Q4 2024, the company posted a record $916 million net income and $1 billion in revenue. Notably, crypto trading contributed $358 million—a 200% year-on-year surge, with crypto trading volumes skyrocketing by 450% to $71 billion.

ONDO Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Ondo Finance uses blockchain to bring reliable financial products to more people. It turns stable assets into digital tokens, making them easier to access and manage. Ondo has two main parts: one creates digital financial products, and the other develops the technology to support them. This setup helps improve how financial products work and reach more people. Ondo deals with trust and safety by teaming up with well-known partners like BlackRock and using Coinbase for secure asset storage. They aim to meet legal standards and offer transparency. USDY, one of their products, combines stablecoin benefits with investment returns. It uses safe assets like US Treasuries to provide reliable financial options for international investors. This approach makes Ondo an interesting choice for anyone looking into digital finance. Solana: A Fast and Scalable Blockchain Platform Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability. It supports decentralized applications (dapps) and competes with networks like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana's architecture aims for faster transactions without using sharding or second-layer solutions. This makes it appealing for developers seeking a high-capacity network. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of this ecosystem. It facilitates transactions and allows custom programs. It also rewards those who support the network. The SOL coin is valuable as it powers the ecosystem, letting users access various projects on Solana. Solana's potential is evident in its capacity to host products and services needing high activity. This technological approach can attract developers and investors. In the current market cycle, these features might make it an attractive option. Sui Blockchain: A New Standard for Global Web3 Adoption Sui is a layer-1 blockchain platform aimed at broad global adoption. It offers a secure and scalable development environment. Sui uses a unique object-centric data model and the Move programming language to overcome current blockchain inefficiencies. The platform focuses on user experience by reducing common blockchain barriers. Features such as zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make applications on Sui accessible and user-friendly. These innovations set new standards for the Web3 space. The Sui coin benefits from this robust technical base and focus on ease of use, making it attractive in the current market. Its potential for wide adoption offers promising prospects. XRP: A Digital Currency for Seamless Global Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be a fast, low-cost digital currency. It is open, borderless, and resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. XRP functions on a decentralized system, which means there is no central authority. This setup makes transactions secure and irreversible. Users do not need a bank account to settle transactions with XRP. Founded by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion tokens. Ripple received 80 billion to develop the ecosystem further. Ripple uses XRP to enhance network liquidity. They have placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control its release into the market. XRP aims to make cross-currency payments smooth and efficient. Its decentralized nature and ease of use make it an attractive option in today's market. UNI Token: Governance and Innovation in Decentralized Trading The UNI token is central to Uniswap, a decentralized platform on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in September 2020, UNI enables holders to participate in governance decisions like fee structures and token distributions. Uniswap reacted to rival SushiSwap by distributing 150 million UNI tokens to reward users, each initially valued at over $1,000. As a decentralized exchange, Uniswap uses an automated liquidity protocol, removing the need for a traditional order book. This setup allows users to trade while retaining control of their funds. Uniswap's open-source approach and easy token listing enhance its accessibility compared to centralized exchanges, contributing to its position as the fourth-largest DeFi platform with assets exceeding $3 billion. The combination of governance power and innovative trading solutions makes UNI a significant player in the crypto space. Conclusion Altcoins like ONDO, SOL, SUI, and XRP offer opportunities but may have less short-term potential. Catzilla stands out, promising a 700% ROI during its presale. With governance features, loyalty rewards, and passive staking, it unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers in pursuing financial freedom. By bringing its community together to dismantle toxic systems and reach new heights, Catzilla invites investors to join its mission.

While the pace of withdrawals has slowed, overall sentiment remains bearish, bringing total outflows over the past month to $4.75 billion, according to a report by CoinShares . This has significantly reduced year-to-date inflows to $2.6 billion and driven total assets under management (AUM) down by $39 billion to $142 billion, the lowest level since mid-November 2024. U.S. Investors Sold Around $1 Billion U.S. investors were the most aggressive sellers, accounting for $922 million in outflows. In contrast, Switzerland, Canada, and Germany saw inflows of $23 million, $14.7 million, and $13.3 million, respectively, suggesting a more optimistic stance in these regions. Bitcoin remained the primary focus of sell-offs, with $756 million withdrawn last week. Short-Bitcoin products also saw outflows of $19.8 million, the highest since December 2024. Other altcoins experienced similar pressure, with Ethereum losing $89 million, Tron $32 million, and Aave $2.4 million. However, some assets bucked the trend—Solana, XRP, and Sui recorded inflows of $16.4 million, $5.6 million, and $2.7 million, respectively. Meanwhile, blockchain equity exchange-traded products (ETPs) were not spared, witnessing $48 million in outflows as investor caution persisted. Whales Start Accumulating Bitcoin Bitcoin’s recent price volatility has been closely tied to whale and shark activity, with large holders making significant moves over the past six months. According to Santiment, wallets holding 10 or more BTC mildly dumped their holdings from mid-February to early March, contributing to the recent market downturn. However, since March 3, these large stakeholders have reversed course, accumulating nearly 5,000 BTC back into their wallets. While prices have yet to reflect this buying activity, analysts suggest that if accumulation continues, the latter half of March could see a more positive market shift, Santiment said. Bitcoin's whale & shark wallets have gone through several key turning points these past 6 months, as the chart below reveals. In short, their mild dumping from mid-February to early March contributed to crypto's latest dump. But since March 3, wallets with 10+ $BTC have… pic.twitter.com/Ybh23PNrzK — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 10, 2025 Meanwhile, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, predicts a critical week ahead for Bitcoin. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, he mentioned $70,000 to $75,000 as a key support zone, with resistance at $85,000–$87,000. A drop below $77,000 could push BTC toward the $70,000–$72,000 range, while a rebound from $75,000 may drive the price back up to $80,000–$85,000. He expects Bitcoin to stabilize near $83,000 by March 18-19, depending on market sentiment and external factors such as regulatory news and the upcoming FOMC meeting. Ethereum, meanwhile, faces a wide trading range between $1,700 and $2,500. If Bitcoin weakens, ETH could fall to $1,714–$1,800, while a strong market could lift it toward $2,300–$2,500. Key drivers include ETF net flows and broader crypto market sentiment.

BTC fell to $80,000 late Sunday, trading below the 200-day simple moving average, and ether took out a macro bullish trendline with a dip below the long-held support of $2,100. Other coins followed the two majors, posting bigger losses. ""Many investors are pulling out of bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House,"" said Zach Burks, CEO and founder of NFT-service provider Mintology. ""It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value. Gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original ‘doomsday asset,’ which is no surprise as tariffs and grenades continues to get thrown across the free world."" The tariffs are making it harder for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts despite the continued decline trend in real-time inflation indicators. On Friday, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is waiting for greater clarity on Trump's policies before making the next move. Meanwhile, Japan's fastest base pay rise in 32 years strengthened the case for a BOJ rate hike, pushing the nation's bond yields and the yen higher. Bouts of strength in the haven currency typically breed downside volatility in risk assets. Still, some observers are unsure if the market weakness, particularly seen over the weekend, could be long-lasting. ""Trading volumes over the weekend were extremely low, reducing the value of the bearish signal,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, told CoinDesk. ""We note that sellers push the price down in periods of low liquidity, but the price bounces back with the arrival of institutional buyers. It looks like the big buyers have enough liquidity left to buy out the drawdown,"" Kuptsikevich said. Stay alert!

AI agent tokens were among the hottest sectors in October and November, seeing rapid listings by exchanges and promotion by influencers on the narrative of a confluence between crypto and artificial intelligence. Zerebro created its own music album and offered NFTs to fans, with plans of introducing a platform that allows token holders to launch their own AI agents. It reached over 120,000 followers on X in a short period. Fundamentals remain strong, however, offering hope for those looking to invest in AI agent tokens. The project was selected as one of the validators for IP-focused blockchain Story last week , playing a role in a future economy that is wholly run by AI agents and machines. A validator is a critical participant in a blockchain network, responsible for verifying and validating transactions and blocks to ensure the security and consensus of any network. Story Protocol validators have specific responsibilities tailored to the protocol’s mission of managing and monetizing intellectual property on a blockchain, and the validators are paid in return for ensuring the network keeps functioning.

Analysis Firm Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-needed-for-bitcoin-bull-trend-to-start-again-analysis-firm-explained/,"As the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin experiences consecutive declines, analysts warn of further declines. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key index that tracks Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sentiment amid panic selling by investors, is at extreme fear at 20. The extreme fear situation is considered a buying opportunity as it shows that people are very anxious and the price is at the bottom, while investors are wondering what is needed for the rise to start. At this point, Matrixport analysts said in their latest report that a stronger catalyst is needed to revive the bull trend in Bitcoin. As tariff war fears grow, Donald Trump’s actions regarding BTC and crypto are becoming increasingly secondary and failing to initiate the expected rise. Matrixport analysts noted that the reaction remained lukewarm despite events such as the White House Crypto Summit and US President Donald Trump signing an executive order to create the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Perpetual funding rates for Bitcoin, Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) are still hovering in the single-digits, suggesting a moderate market reaction. As a result, Matrixport analysts emphasize that Bitcoin will need a stronger catalyst to resume its upward trend. “The White House Crypto Summit and approval of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve failed to trigger a rally in the crypto market as perpetual-term funding rates remained near single digits. This suggests a lack of enthusiasm from retail investors, which contrasts sharply with the enthusiasm seen in April and December 2024 when funding rates rose into the high double digits. Even the momentum surrounding Trump’s inauguration was relatively weak, a clear sign that a more significant catalyst is needed for Bitcoin to launch its next bullish leg.” *This is not investment advice.

41430822,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138443,1741608949,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Revelation: Google Erases Diversity from Responsible AI Team – What’s Next?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-diversity-responsible-ai-shift/,"In a move that has sent ripples through the tech world and ignited debates about AI ethics , Google has quietly scrubbed mentions of “diversity” and “equity” from the webpage of its Responsible AI and Human Centered Technology (RAI-HCT) team. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where decentralization and inclusivity are often core tenets, this action raises critical questions about the values being embedded in rapidly advancing technologies like artificial intelligence. Is this a subtle shift in priorities, or a more profound change in how Big Tech approaches responsible AI development? Let’s delve into what this means for the future of ethical technology. The Vanishing Act of Diversity at Google’s Responsible AI Team The changes, first brought to light by the vigilant watchdog group The Midas Project, reveal a stark contrast between the current and previous versions of the RAI-HCT team’s webpage. Where once phrases like “marginalized communities,” “diverse,“ “underrepresented groups,” and “equity” underscored the team’s mission, now a more generic and less specific vocabulary prevails. Words like “all,“ “varied,” and “numerous” have stepped in to replace the previously explicit commitment to diversity and equity. To illustrate the extent of the change, consider this: Previous Language: Focused on serving “marginalized communities” and ensuring technology benefits “underrepresented groups.” Current Language: Speaks more broadly of benefiting “all” users, with less emphasis on specific communities facing historical disadvantages. Term “Diverse”: Replaced with “varied” or removed entirely in descriptions of the team’s focus and impact. Term “Equity”: Completely absent in the updated mission statement, where it was previously used to frame the team’s goals. This alteration, while seemingly subtle, raises significant concerns about Google’s evolving stance on DEI initiatives , particularly within its critical AI research division. The timing of this change is also noteworthy, aligning with a broader trend across the tech industry. A Trend or a Coincidence? Tech Diversity Rollbacks in the Spotlight Google’s actions are not isolated. This scrubbing of diversity -related language follows a pattern observed across several major tech players. Just recently: Startups Founders Fund Grant Website: Google itself had already removed similar language from this grant website, signaling a potential shift in their approach to supporting diverse founders. Diversity Hiring Targets: Google announced in early February its decision to eliminate diversity hiring targets, further fueling speculation about a retreat from DEI commitments. Review of DEI Programs: The company also indicated it would review its broader diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, suggesting a comprehensive reassessment of these initiatives. Google is in good company – or perhaps, questionable company – in this regard. Other tech giants like Amazon and Meta have also reportedly scaled back DEI measures in recent months. Even OpenAI, a leading force in the AI revolution, recently removed mentions of diversity and inclusion from a webpage detailing its hiring practices. This industry-wide trend prompts a critical question: Is the tech sector collectively stepping back from its public commitments to diversity and inclusion? Interestingly, not all companies are following suit. Apple, for instance, recently defended its DEI programs against a shareholder proposal seeking to dismantle them. This divergence highlights a potential split within the tech industry regarding the future of tech diversity and inclusion efforts. Why Does Erasing Diversity from Responsible AI Matter? For the cryptocurrency community, deeply invested in principles of fairness and decentralization, the implications of Google’s move are particularly pertinent. Responsible AI, by its very definition, should be about creating AI systems that are fair, unbiased, and beneficial to all of humanity. When discussions of diversity and equity are removed from the mission statement of a team dedicated to AI safety and fairness, it begs the question: Does this weaken the commitment to truly responsible AI? Consider these crucial aspects of why diversity and equity are essential in Responsible AI: Bias Mitigation: Diverse teams are better equipped to identify and mitigate biases in AI algorithms. Different perspectives and lived experiences are crucial for recognizing potential pitfalls that might disproportionately affect certain groups. Fairness and Inclusivity: A focus on diversity and equity ensures that AI systems are developed with the needs and perspectives of all users in mind, not just the majority or privileged groups. Ethical Considerations: Responsible AI development requires a deep consideration of ethical implications. Ignoring diversity and equity can lead to AI systems that perpetuate or even amplify existing societal inequalities. Innovation and Problem Solving: Diverse teams are demonstrably more innovative and better at problem-solving. In the complex field of AI, diverse perspectives are invaluable for pushing boundaries and developing robust solutions. By seemingly downplaying diversity and equity, is Google signaling a shift away from these crucial considerations in its approach to Responsible AI? While the company has not yet responded to requests for comment, the changes are undeniable and warrant serious attention. The Political and Economic Winds Shifting Against DEI? The article mentions the backdrop of the Trump Administration targeting what it characterizes as “illegal” DEI practices. This political pressure, coupled with economic factors, may be contributing to the tech industry’s apparent pullback from DEI. Many of these companies, including Google, hold significant contracts with federal agencies, making them sensitive to government policies and priorities. Could this be a strategic retreat in response to political headwinds? Or is it a deeper shift in corporate philosophy? Regardless of the motivations, the erasure of Google diversity and equity language from the Responsible AI team’s webpage is a development that demands scrutiny. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, from finance and healthcare to governance and communication, ensuring its responsible and equitable development is more critical than ever. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI Ethics? Google’s move raises critical questions about the future of AI ethics and the role of diversity and equity in shaping that future. Is this a temporary adjustment, or a sign of a more lasting change in the tech industry’s approach to responsible AI? Will other companies follow suit, further diluting the focus on DEI in AI development? For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where the ethos of decentralization and inclusivity is often championed, this development serves as a stark reminder that vigilance is crucial. As we build and advocate for decentralized technologies, we must also remain steadfast in our commitment to ethical principles, ensuring that these technologies are developed and deployed in a way that benefits all of humanity, with a particular focus on equity and inclusion. The removal of diversity and equity mentions from Google’s Responsible AI team webpage is more than just a semantic change; it’s a symbolic shift that warrants close observation and critical discussion. The conversation around responsible AI, DEI initiatives , and tech diversity is far from over – in fact, it may be more important now than ever before.

Now, technical indicators point to a deeper correction, with $73,000 emerging as the primary target, as noted by trading expert RLinda. Technical analysis: Key levels to watch According to RLinda , Bitcoin’s global growth momentum has stalled, with the asset moving into a deep correction phase. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: RLinda/TradingView The market lacks liquidity, making it unsustainable for Bitcoin to grow solely at the expense of buyers and bullish leverage. The price is currently forming a short-term range between $90,000 and $82,000 after exiting a prolonged global consolidation phase. The false break of the $91,000 resistance level, which previously served as a strong support , has resulted in further downside, with BTC now at risk of dropping to $82,000 and potentially $73,500 if selling pressure persists. Bitcoin has now reached the lower boundary of its range, with $82,000 acting as a critical support level. A sustained breakdown below this point could accelerate losses, driving the price toward $78,000 and further down to $73,000. While the current trend points to further downside, Bitcoin may still attempt a short-term recovery by testing liquidity areas at $83,400 and $84,700 before resuming its downward movement. However, unless a strong bullish catalyst emerges, BTC remains at risk of falling toward the $73,000 mark. Peter Brandt’s analysis: Bearish pennant points to further downside Veteran trader Peter Brandt also echoes this bearish outlook, noting a completed double-top formation at $108,100, which was followed by a bearish pennant retest. 1.

Pennant completed, confirms bearish chart Bitcoin $BTC Don't shoot the messenger Price must recapture #2 to turn positive pic.twitter.com/PE9jlwYIiO — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) March 9, 2025 Now that the pennant pattern is complete, Bitcoin’s chart suggests a deeper correction unless it recaptures the $92,833 to $96,659 range. If BTC remains below this level, further losses toward $78,000 and beyond $75,000 appear likely. Bitcoin market outlook At press time, BTC is trading at $83,293, having plunged 10% in the past week and posting a year-to-date loss of 11%. BTC one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Beyond technical indicators, on-chain data from Santiment reveals significant shifts in Bitcoin’s whale and shark wallet accumulation patterns over the past six months. Mild selling pressure from mid-February to early March contributed to Bitcoin’s recent slump, mirroring the broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets. However, since March 3, wallets holding 10+ BTC have accumulated nearly 5,000 Bitcoin. Despite this accumulation, Bitcoin’s price has yet to reflect any bullish reaction. If large stakeholders continue buying BTC, the second half of March could see a recovery , provided macroeconomic conditions stabilize. That being said, investors are closely watching this week’s economic data releases, which could further shape market expectations.

This renewed push for Chrome divestiture comes amidst ongoing antitrust scrutiny, but with a notable twist – the DOJ appears to be softening its stance on Google’s burgeoning AI investments . What does this mean for Google, and how will it reshape the tech landscape, especially within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where Google’s influence is deeply felt? Why is the DOJ Still Pushing for Chrome Divestiture? The DOJ’s unwavering stance on Chrome divestiture stems from deep-seated concerns about Google’s monopolistic practices. According to the recent court filing, the DOJ believes Google’s control over Chrome gives it an unfair advantage in the online search and advertising markets. Here’s a breakdown of the DOJ’s core arguments: Market Dominance: Chrome’s vast user base provides Google with unparalleled data collection capabilities, reinforcing its dominance in search and online advertising. Anticompetitive Behavior: The DOJ argues that Google leverages Chrome to stifle competition, making it harder for rival search engines and ad platforms to gain traction. Economic Goliath: The filing explicitly states that Google has become an “economic goliath” that “wreaks havoc” on the marketplace, emphasizing the severity of their antitrust concerns. This isn’t a new battle. The DOJ initially proposed the Chrome divestiture under the Biden administration, and its persistence under what the article refers to as the ‘second Trump administration’ (though factually inaccurate as of now, reflecting the article’s source text’s assumption) underscores the bipartisan nature of antitrust concerns against Big Tech. A Shift in Focus: AI Investments Get a Pass While the DOJ remains firm on Chrome divestiture , there’s a significant shift in its approach to Google’s AI investments . Initially, the DOJ aimed to curtail Google’s expansive AI ventures, including its substantial stake in Anthropic. However, the revised proposal indicates a more lenient stance. Let’s examine the key changes: No Mandatory Divestiture: The DOJ is no longer demanding the outright sale of Google’s existing AI investments . This is a major concession from their initial position. Prior Notification for Future Investments: Instead of prohibiting AI investments, the DOJ will now require Google to provide prior notification for any significant future ventures in the AI space. This suggests a move towards monitoring rather than outright blocking Google’s AI ambitions. Android Divestiture Deferred: The decision on whether Google should divest Android is now deferred to the court, contingent on future market competitiveness. This implies a wait-and-see approach, focusing on the evolving dynamics of the mobile operating system market. What are the Potential Implications of the DOJ Proposal? The DOJ’s proposal, while still aggressive in its demand for Chrome divestiture , presents a mixed bag of potential implications for Google and the broader tech industry. Here are some key takeaways: Implication Description Increased Scrutiny on Big Tech: The DOJ’s actions signal a continued and potentially intensified regulatory focus on large technology companies and their market power. Uncertainty for Chrome’s Future: The looming threat of Chrome divestiture creates uncertainty around the browser’s future ownership and direction. This could impact users and developers alike. Green Light for AI Innovation: By stepping back from mandatory AI investments divestiture, the DOJ might inadvertently be fostering continued innovation in the AI sector, albeit with closer regulatory oversight. Legal Battles Ahead: Google has already indicated its intent to appeal the initial ruling, suggesting a prolonged legal battle that could drag on for years, impacting market sentiment and investment decisions. Google’s Response and What’s Next Unsurprisingly, Google has vehemently opposed the DOJ’s proposals. A Google spokesperson labeled the DOJ’s demands as “sweeping” and exceeding the court’s decision, arguing that they would harm consumers, the economy, and national security. Google has offered alternative proposals aimed at addressing antitrust concerns without resorting to Chrome divestiture , focusing on providing partners with greater flexibility. Judge Amit P. Mehta is set to hear arguments from both sides in April, setting the stage for a crucial phase in this antitrust saga. The outcome of these hearings will significantly influence the future of Google, the competitive landscape of the tech industry, and the ongoing debate about tech regulation in the age of AI. The Crypto Angle: Why Should Crypto Enthusiasts Care? While seemingly distant from the world of cryptocurrency, this Google antitrust case has indirect but important implications for the crypto space: Decentralization vs. Centralization: The DOJ’s action against Google reflects a broader societal concern about the concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants. This resonates with the core ethos of decentralization championed by the crypto community. Innovation and Competition: A more competitive tech landscape, potentially fostered by actions like Chrome divestiture , could create more space for innovative blockchain-based technologies and services to emerge and thrive. Data Privacy and Control: Antitrust actions against data-rich giants like Google touch upon issues of data privacy and user control, which are central to many cryptocurrency projects aiming to give users greater control over their digital assets and information. Regulatory Precedent: The outcome of this case could set precedents for future tech regulation , potentially influencing how governments approach the regulation of emerging technologies, including blockchain and AI. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Tech and Regulation The DOJ’s renewed push for Chrome divestiture , coupled with its nuanced approach to AI investments , marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing saga of Google antitrust scrutiny. While the future of Chrome and Google’s AI ambitions remain uncertain, one thing is clear: the debate about Big Tech’s power and the need for effective tech regulation is far from over. For the cryptocurrency world, this case serves as a reminder of the broader forces shaping the digital landscape and the importance of advocating for a more decentralized and competitive future.

Aren't Buying SOL, XRP or ADA? Investors Rotate After Crypto Reserve Disappointment",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/so-the-us-gov-arent-buying-sol-xrp-or-ada-investors-rotate-after-crypto-reserve-disappointment,"Solana, XRP, and Cardano investors were left scratching their heads after it emerged that the U.S. government won’t be adding these cryptos to its reserves. Many are now rotating into sectors with massive growth potential like Web3 gaming and its rising star Rollblock (RBLK). With the demand for crypto gaming growing rapidly, here’s why Rollblock could rally up to 50x this year. Rollblock (RBLK): The Rising Demand for Web3 Gaming The Web3 gaming industry is booming, and Rollblock ( RBLK ) is positioned right at the heart of the action. Every month, the platform sees rising signups and increased deposits across its platform of over 7,000 games. From live dealer poker and blackjack to a newly launched sports prediction league, Rollblock is quickly becoming a dominant player in this $500 billion market. All transactions are secured on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring full transparency - something that traditional platforms simply can’t offer. With over $10.8 million already flowing into its presale launch, Rollblock’s momentum is undeniable, and this project is still just in its early stages. Why Is RBLK So In Demand? Rollblock’s unique tokenomics set it apart as an investment. The platform takes 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK tokens, with 60% of these buybacks being burned to reduce the circulating supply. The remaining 40% is used to provide staking rewards of up to 30% in yield. As Rollblock grows, RBLK becomes increasingly scarce. Stage 10 tokens are selling fast at $0.061, with over 40% already gone. In March, investors can take advantage of a generous referral bonus - invite a friend, and both will receive a 30% RBLK bonus, plus a further 20% purchase bonus. See what makes Rollblock stand out in Crypto Nautic’s detailed review here: https://youtu.be/vF8vIHIvjfE?si=uQsATqLU1fCmYW6b Solana (SOL): Price Still Suffering Despite Growth The lack of inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserves has left some Solana holders questioning its future. However, Solana’s fundamentals remain unquestionably solid. The network continues to be one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain ecosystems. Solana is currently trading at $135 after falling by an encouraging 5% this week. There are signs that a bottom may be forming here. CrypNuevo posted a Solana buy zone recently and wondered, ‘Is smart money accumulating at those prices?’ While short-term sentiment may be shaky, Solana’s long-term adoption growth should clear a path to new highs above $300 this year. XRP (XRP): Legal Woes Weigh on Price XRP (XRP) has been struggling to break out as regulatory concerns remain a major factor. The ongoing legal battle with the SEC has continued to create much uncertainty, leading to a lot of volatility. However, the XRP-SEC case could be over sooner rather than later with a much more amenable administration in the White House. XRP recently slipped 4% today to $2.23 as traders took profits. KryptoGuz highlighted that XRP CEO Brad Garlinghouse was ‘on the list of people who attended the Crypto Summit in the White House. One thing for sure - the market will be highly volatile!’ XRP could see a strong rally above $3, but until then, investors remain cautious. Cardano (ADA): Hoskinson Left Out In The Cold Cardano (ADA) is yet another project that didn’t make it into the U.S. reserves, and it doesn’t look like Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson got an invite to the crypto summit. Despite this, the Cardano network continues to roll out recent updates to Hydra, Cardano’s Layer 2 solution, with the aim of boosting transaction speeds and bringing down fees. ADA is currently trading at $0.77 , having pumped by 7% this week. While some investors are rotating out due to short-term market volatility, Cardano remains a strong contender in the Layer 1 space, especially with its ‘All-American’ tag. Cardano could well surge past $3 this year with enough demand from bulls. Rollblock’s Rally Will Leave Many Sidelined While Solana, XRP, and Cardano navigate a choppy landscape, Rollblock (RBLK) is seeing massive demand. With strong user growth and major exchange listings right on the horizon, RBLK has the potential to deliver the biggest and best gains of 2025.

41433285,https://coingape.com/?post_type=trending&p=243276,1741613022,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Does the U.S. Government Want a Recession to Manage Its Debt?,https://coingape.com/trending/does-the-u-s-government-want-a-recession-to-manage-its-debt/,"As 2025 goes in full swing, the U.S. government is facing mounting pressure due to trillions of dollars worth of debt, bringing the question about resolutions or other significant ways to manage this crisis. This year, $9.2T of U.S. debt will either mature or need refinancing. Considering the seriousness of the matter, some experts believe that the recession in the United States could be a quicker way to lower interest rates and handle this burden. The U.S. Government Debt Dilemma The U.S. national debt comes to a total of $36 trillion, and servicing that deficit is costly. On a serious note, the average interest rate on the Treasury debt has surged to 3.2%, a 15-year high, which is concerning. In addition, the Federal Reserve’s rates have been rising. With that, the average interest on this deficit could increase by about one percentage point, extending the challenges. More importantly, between January and June this year, a whopping 70% of the maturing debt must be refinanced. In this scenario, experts like The Kobeissi Letter believe that cutting the interest rate could offer a significant reprieve for the government’s debt servicing, reducing the financial burden on taxpayers. Could a U.S Recession Help Lower Rates? Recession is a devastating event, but due to some point, this is the solution for the U.S. government’s $9.2T debt problem by lowering the borrowing costs. Historical records reveal that this slump triggered a reduction in the Fed Funds Rate. When the economy contracts, the Fed typically stimulates growth by lowering interest rates, making borrowing cheaper. The Kobeissi Letter considers economic decline as the perfect solution. Their analysis of the yield on the 10-year Treasury notes reveals that it has dropped by 60 basis points in the last two months. The rising expectation of a potential economic decline is a primary contributor. This, combined with increased uncertainty and rate cut discussion, signals a more dovish policy stand by the Fed. The U.S. government is working on this, and President Donald Trump has voiced his support for lower oil prices and interest rates to combat inflation. However, experts argue that economic decline is expected to be the most efficient way to achieve both, claiming that reduced demand would naturally drive down prices, including oil. U.S. Government Take: Will a Recession Be the Solution? Many industry leaders, even President Donald Trump, believe the United States can avoid economic decline through aggressive trade policies and tariffs. Earlier, Trump implemented a tariff on Mexico and Canada, but reports suggest that these have begun to slow economic growth. According to experts, an economic slowdown and reciprocity tariff on foreign goods could exacerbate the situation. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insists that there won’t be a U.S. recession; more importantly, he claims that tariffs would boost the U.S. economy. Still, there are signs that the economic fallout from these policies is already being felt. The latest GDP forecast indicates a higher likelihood of an economic decline, with Goldman Sachs raising the probability to 20%. With inflation on the rise, borrowing costs climbing, and the prospect of a significant debt refinancing on the horizon, a U.S. recession could serve as an unfortunate but effective mechanism for lowering interest rates and easing the debt burden. However, the associates’ take on this situation is unclear. The Bottom Line U.S. recession is not the most straightforward approach, as it would bring significant hardships to the citizens. However, experts claim this is a lesser evil than living with mounting debts on the U.S. government. Another temporary solution is that if the economy slows down, the Fed could bring rate gates to reduce the deficit serving cost. However, there are still questions and concerns about whether the administration will continue to embrace policies that could push the economy into a downturn.

But for investors, the real opportunity may lie elsewhere. DeepSeek AI was recently asked to pick a low-cap gem that could outperform them both, and its answer was clear: Rollblock (RBLK). With sky-high demand and massive bonuses in March, Rollblock holders are looking ahead to a potential 50x rally this year. Rollblock (RBLK): Massive March Bonuses Up For Grabs Rollblock ( RBLK ) is taking control of the Web3 gaming surge, with new signups and deposits climbing month after month. This upstart platform offers over 7,000 classic games, including live poker and high-stakes blackjack, alongside a brand-new sports prediction league. There is truly something for everyone at Rollblock. In a genius move, all bids and payouts are secured on the Ethereum blockchain to bring transparency to this $500 billion industry. Now, with fiat deposits enabled through Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard, Rollblock is more accessible than ever. RBLK’s presale has already attracted $10.8 million in inflows, but March is shaping up to be a huge month for Rollblock investors. Anyone who refers a friend in March will receive a 30% RBLK bonus, and buyers can also claim a 20% purchase bonus. With a prestigious gaming license from Gaming Anjouan and Solid Proof giving investors great peace of mind, it’s no wonder that interest in Rollblock is at an all-time high. What Makes RBLK Such A Safe Bet? It is no wonder that DeepSeek has singled Rollblock out, as its tokenomics give it a serious edge. Rollblock dedicates 30% of its total revenue to buying back RBLK every week, with 60% of those tokens burned to reduce the supply and 40% funding staking rewards of up to 30% in hassle-free yield. This deflationary model will make RBLK increasingly scarce as time goes by. Stage 10 tokens are selling fast at $0.061, with over 40% already gone for good. Investors should take note that the price won’t stay this low for long.

This long-running smart contract platform continues to roll out decent improvements, with its Hydra scaling solution promising much faster transactions and lower fees. ADA is currently trading at $0.77 , which is a stunning 18% increase over the last week. The Cardano Foundation recently partnered with SERPRO , Brazil’s biggest state-operated IT firm, to adopt blockchain technology in a big way. SERPRO oversees 90% of Brazil's government systems and handles billions of transactions each year. Cardano will help deliver education and certification, and this could see demand for Cardano grow exponentially this year. Cardano could even hit new highs above $3 with a push from bulls here. Dogecoin (DOGE): Holding At Support For Now Dogecoin (DOGE) may have been overtaken by Cardano this week, but the original meme coin remains a strong force in the crypto markets. Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to back Dogecoin, and speculation about possible future integrations with Musk’s X platform keeps the community guessing. DOGE recently dropped to $0.18 in the recent market chop. Analysts report that Dogecoin is cooling off after a strong rally. If DOGE can make it back above $0.20 we could set up another breakout, but a drop below $0.18 might trigger further downside. Dogecoin’s long-term growth prospects depend, as always, on real-world adoption. Without new use cases, some investors are understandably looking for higher-upside opportunities elsewhere. Rollblock (RBLK) Remains The Ace In The Presale Pack While Cardano and Dogecoin continue their top-ten battle, Rollblock (RBLK) stands out as the best investment opportunity of 2025. With strong growth and major bonuses available in March, RBLK is DeepSeek’s best bet to outshine them both this year. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

41433679,https://zycrypto.com/?p=103492,1741613279,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Early Bitcoin Investor Explains Why Shiba Inu (SHIB) Could Go to The Moon,https://zycrypto.com/early-bitcoin-investor-explains-why-shiba-inu-shib-could-go-to-the-moon/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) traded steadily on Monday, March 10, 2025, following a week of modest fluctuations. However, the token has faced a significant decline over the past month, dropping 12.96% in the past week and 19.55% over the month. This downturn comes amid broader struggles in the meme coin market, which has seen a sharp 90% drop in activity following the LIBRA debacle, according to a recent CoinGecko report. Despite these setbacks, some analysts remain optimistic about SHIB’s long-term potential. One such supporter is early Bitcoin investor Davinci Jeremie, who has shared his belief that SHIB still has a chance to surge in value. “I like Shiba Inu,” Jeremie said in a Friday video . However, he tempered expectations, adding, “ I think Shiba Inu is going to do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect.” Jeremie, who gained fame in 2013 for advising viewers to invest even $1 in Bitcoin, a move that proved immensely profitable, highlighted the network’s layer-2 network, Shibarium , as a key factor that could drive SHIB’s growth. According to him, the blockchain offers significant utility, providing low-cost transactions and the infrastructure to host decentralized applications (dApps). However, he noted that adoption remains a challenge. “ It’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications on,” he explained. “ It’s pretty cheap to actually trade on Shibarium. However, nobody’s using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet.” Jeremie, however, believes that if developers can address this issue by increasing adoption and integrating real-world applications, SHIB could see a significant rally . “If they get that solved, Shibarium and Shiba Inu will go to the Moon,” he asserted. That said, recent developments in the Shiba Inu ecosystem suggest ongoing efforts to enhance Shibarium’s utility. The team behind SHIB has been actively working on partnerships and initiatives to expand its use cases. Collaborations with projects like Chainlink and K9 Finance DAO could be crucial in this process. For example, Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) allows Shibarium to connect with multiple blockchain networks, potentially boosting accessibility to SHIB and other ecosystem tokens, including BONE, LEASH, and TREAT. Additionally, SHIB’s developers have been focusing on new integrations that could attract more users. Reports indicate that the ecosystem is exploring gaming applications, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi platforms that could leverage Shibarium’s low transaction costs. By diversifying its use cases, SHIB’s team aims to increase adoption and enhance the token’s value proposition. Another factor that could contribute to SHIB’s success is its strong community backing. The SHIB Army has been instrumental in driving awareness and engagement. Community-driven initiatives, such as token burns and staking programs, have helped sustain interest in SHIB despite recent market downturns. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00001267, up 1.87% in the past 24 hours. Its 24-hour buy volume surged 106% to $323 million, with bullish sentiment in the community reached 88%, according to CoinMarketCap data.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-10 13:27:59

By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $3.03 By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $10.11 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.76 Market Cap $26.81B Trading Volume $1.83B Circulating Supply 45B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.811 24-hour Low $0.707 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.60% 50-day SMA $ 0.8555 14-Day RSI 35.81 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 ( Fear) Green Days 11/30 (37%) Cardano ADA shows slight recovery ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart Cardano (ADA) is showing a moderate recovery on the 1-day chart on March 10, currently trading at $0.735 with a 2.10% gain. The price remains below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.786, indicating resistance ahead. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46.84 suggests neutral momentum, while recent volatility highlights market uncertainty. A breakout above $0.786 could trigger a rally toward $1.03, but failure to sustain momentum may lead to further consolidation near $0.53 support. Bulls need stronger volume for a sustained uptrend, while bears may attempt to push the price lower if ADA fails to hold key levels. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart Cardano (ADA) is experiencing downward pressure on the 4-hour chart, currently trading at $0.734 with a 1.50% decline. The price is hovering near the lower Bollinger Band at $0.705, indicating potential support. The MACD remains in bearish territory, signaling weak momentum, while the RSI at 46.84 suggests a neutral trend. If ADA fails to reclaim the middle Bollinger Band at $0.799, further downside toward $0.70 is possible. A breakout above $0.80 could shift momentum toward $0.89 resistance. Market sentiment remains cautious, with a need for stronger buying volume to confirm a bullish reversal in the short term.

On the 1-day chart, ADA is trading near $0.735, struggling below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.786, signaling a lack of strong buying pressure. The RSI at 46.84 remains neutral but leans toward bearish momentum. The 4-hour chart shows further weakness, with the MACD in negative territory, reflecting weak momentum. If ADA fails to reclaim $0.80, a drop toward $0.70 or lower is possible. A breakout above $0.80 could signal recovery, targeting resistance at $0.89 and beyond. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $1.04, with an average trading price of about $0.8992 and a minimum price of $0.8660. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $6.05. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.84 and $6.95, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow down its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2024, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.84. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $10 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $10.11 Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.6, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $9. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano The Cardano Builder Fest #2 is scheduled for April 2025 in Vietnam. Developer Andrew Westberg has proposed reducing the treasury tax from 20% to 10%, which has been the subject of much discussion. Some argue that this would boost staking incentives and short-term price growth, while others worry about its impact on Cardano’s long-term sustainability. According to a Feb 24 notice, the U.S. SEC has acknowledged NYSE Arca’s filing for a spot Cardano ETF, starting a 240-day review process. The proposal seeks to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Cardano Trust under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.

This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451.

Meanwhile, a low-cap gem is capturing huge investor attention: Rollblock (RBLK). With blockchain-backed transparency and a booming Web3 gaming platform, RBLK could rally up to 50x this year, offering the most enormous upside of them all. Rollblock (RBLK): Blockchain Transparency Disrupting GameFi Rollblock ( RBLK ) is revolutionizing Web3 gaming with its offer of a fully transparent, 100% blockchain-backed platform that ensures every bid and payout is instantly verifiable.

PEPE (PEPE) Price Prediction: Can It Flip Shiba Inu? The PEPE (PEPE) community has been in for a wild ride over the past few months, as this frog-based meme token has been even more volatile than usual. The PEPE price is currently down by 20% this week, reaching $0.00000618. However, the PEPE token has seen a surge in interest recently, driven by whale accumulation and speculation that it could flip Shiba Inu in 2025. Despite all this, its recent trading volume has dropped by a significant 40% as $334 million of PEPE was traded across exchanges today. The latest PEPE price prediction suggests that PEPE could surge by up to 32% in the near future. However, for it to overtake Shiba Inu, it will need sustained demand from bulls, which has been lacking lately. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Not Going Down Without A Fight Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most recognized meme coins, backed by an ever more ambitious roadmap. With developments like Shibarium, its Layer 2 scaling solution, and a growing metaverse presence, Shiba Inu is working hard to maintain its relevance beyond the meme coin sector. SHIB recently dropped 4% to hit $0.0000123 . While the token still enjoys a dedicated following with its famous SHIB army, its price action has been relatively slow, leading some investors to explore higher-growth opportunities. According to CoinEdition , Shiba Inu’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 39.81, ‘signaling weak momentum and slightly oversold conditions. A rise above 50 would reinforce bullish sentiment.’ At the time of press SHIB Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 30.90 suggesting possible reversal. Shiba Inu will need to see sustained bullish buying to maintain its lead over PEPE this quarter. Rollblock Will Outrun Memecoins This Year While the battle between PEPE and SHIB continues, Rollblock (RBLK) offers the biggest potential gains to investors. With its deflationary token model and booming gaming platform, RBLK is superbly positioned to deliver massive returns in 2025.

He stressed that the US should never sell its BTC stash, forecasting that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could generate over $10 trillion annually by acting as a “perpetual source of prosperity” for Americans. Saylor projected that by 2045, the reserve could yield between $16 trillion and $81 trillion for the US Treasury, potentially helping to offset the national debt. “The time to act is now. By embracing digital assets and fostering innovation, the United States can secure its position as the global leader in the 21st-century economy,” he added. Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Saylor’s remarks come after President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for the U.S. to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate altcoin stockpile, fulfilling one of his biggest campaign promises to the crypto community. While the EO didn’t lay out an immediate plan to acquire more Bitcoin, it stated that the Treasury and Commerce secretaries would create “budget-neutral strategies” to purchase more Bitcoin while ensuring no added costs for taxpayers. If the U.S. government indeed bought 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply, it would own a whopping 5.25 million BTC. This is far more than the 1 million BTC (representing 5% of the total supply) that pro-crypto Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed in the strategic reserve Bill in August 2024. Currently, the U.S. government holds around 198,109 BTC (nearly 1% of the cryptocurrency’s supply). Meanwhile, Saylor’s firm, the recently rebranded Strategy, holds nearly 500,000 BTC , the largest Bitcoin stockpile of any publicly listed company worldwide. Saylor had previously pitched a Bitcoin reserve strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors, suggesting that the Wall Street giant could create as much as $5 trillion in shareholder value (by 2034) by amassing BTC. However, Microsoft shareholders ultimately rejected Saylor’s advice.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|MicroStrategy|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-10 13:31:09

This important milestone for our U.K. operation accelerates our growth plans and unlocks opportunities to launch even more exciting products and services to meet the evolving needs of U.K. clients. Our EMI license strengthens our market position in the U.K. by allowing us to issue electronic money, facilitating faster deposits and withdrawals for our clients. This serves as a launchpad for future growth, while also creating various opportunities to build partnerships with leading traditional financial institutions. “The U.K. is on the brink of mass crypto adoption, and Kraken is poised to lead the way with industry-leading products. We have major plans for U.K. users that will unlock a wave of demand for crypto-powered financial solutions that showcase real utility for U.K. investors and consumers. Securing an EMI license is a foundational step in our expansion strategy, and we’re thrilled to announce this authorization today,” said U.K. General Manager Bivu Das. Today’s news builds on Kraken’s momentum in securing key regulatory approvals and licenses, including our recent EU MiFID license, which paves the way for us to serve advanced European crypto traders with an expanded regulated derivatives offering. Our EMI license in the U.K. also reaffirms our ongoing commitment to robust security and compliance protocols, ensuring we meet the FCA’s stringent regulatory standards while also driving innovation in the U.K. crypto ecosystem. This comes at a pivotal moment in the U.K., as more adults are diversifying into crypto as part of a broader portfolio. FCA research shows that over seven million U.K. adults – roughly 12% of the adult population – now own crypto, with both awareness and average portfolio values increasing year-over-year. This growing enthusiasm, combined with the expansion and enhancements to our U.K. offering, has fueled incredible successes for Kraken in the U.K.: The U.K. has become one of our most active markets globally by trading volume. In the U.K. we offer over 300 crypto assets for trading. We were the first major exchange to provide a BTC/GBP trading pair in 2014 and we remain a market leader in GBP-denominated volumes. We offer multiple fiat onramps and GBP trading pairs, making it easier than ever for U.K. clients to seamlessly access crypto. We’ve secured major brand partnerships with U.K. sporting giants, including Williams Racing F1 team and Tottenham Hotspur FC . In both 2023 and 2024 Newsweek ranked Kraken in their Top 100 Most Loved U.K. Workplaces. What’s next? In the coming months, we’ll be unveiling several exciting new crypto and fiat products designed to empower U.K. users to build wealth through crypto and unlock accessible ways for them to use all the assets in their Kraken account as a source of liquidity.

The recent price decline has triggered concerns of a bear market after BTC saw its biggest weekly drop in more than two years. The rising outflows from crypto products also suggest that institutions have not been buying the dip after last week’s inflows reached $876M. Crypto Prices Enter Bear Market as Bitcoin Posts Biggest Weekly Drop in History Bitcoin price recorded a massive decline last week, with the prices fluctuating between $94,000 and $80,000. During the week, BTC price experienced a -$14,000 move, which marked its biggest weekly decline in history. BTC/USD: 1-Week Chart This drop follows a drastic decline in the crypto market sentiment, which is currently in a state of extreme fear. Moreover, surging long liquidations have continued to exert more downside pressure on crypto prices, Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, these liquidations reached $649M . Analysts predict that Bitcoin price could see another wild swing this week and drop to $75,000 after US CPI data . Per Reuters, a high CPI print will likely scare the market. Moreover, data from the CME FedWatch Tool suggests that inflation remains a concern, with 97% of investors expecting interest rates to remain unchanged during next week’s FOMC meeting. CME FedWatch Tool Digital Asset Outflows Reach $876M Crypto prices have also been edging lower after digital asset outflows reached $876M last week per CoinShares. This marked the fourth consecutive week of outflows, indicating that institutional interest in crypto products has diminished. Crypto Asset Flows Bitcoin saw the biggest outflows of $756M followed closely by Ethereum with $89M outflows. Cardano price also dropped after $1.9M outflows. Despite the waning interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum, some altcoins saw notable inflows despite declining crypto prices. Solana had the highest inflows of $16M, while XRP and SUI saw $5M and $2M inflows, respectively. What’s Next for Crypto Prices – Is a Rebound Imminent? Crypto prices are still poised for a volatile week ahead due to the upcoming US CPI data. However, a rebound could happen after MicroStrategy revealed plans to issue up to $21 billion in Series A stock to acquire more Bitcoin. This acquisition could drive Bitcoin and altcoin prices higher. Moreover, Santiment has revealed that wallets owning at least 10 BTC have accumulated nearly 5,000 Bitcoin in their wallets. This indicates that large Bitcoin holders are buying the recent dip. Bitcoin Whale Activity If institutions begin to accumulate Bitcoin again and traders start buying the dip, it could bode well for crypto prices. However, a significant surge in the buy-side pressure will occur if the market sentiment shifts from fear to greed.

Solana (SOL) has already proven itself as a major contender in the layer 1 blockchain space, but this could well be the catalyst that sends it soaring by 2000%. Here’s why experts believe that Solana will soar in 2025… Can The Solana Price Rally By 2000%? Solana (SOL) has been a standout performer so far this cycle, benefiting from incredible trading volume around its pump.fun meme launchpad as well as numerous high-profile launches, including TRUMP. Currently, Solana is trading at $134 , having lost nearly 3% today. The latest push for Solana ETF approval could be the next major catalyst , potentially driving Solana to new all-time highs. The Chief Revenue Officer at Bitpace, Meryem Habibi, believes that Trump’s inclusion of Solana in a crypto reserve ""should accelerate approval of ETFs for the likes of Solana."" This would bring in potentially billions of dollars of institutional capital to the Solana ecosystem and could push its token price up by 2000% at the peak of this cycle. This would see Solana trade at just over $3,000, which would make now an incredible time to invest. BitGuru confirms this bullish outlook, noting that ""A breakout above this level could push the price higher, potentially retesting $152.90. On the downside, failure to hold support may result in a drop toward $130, the next key support zone."" A bounce from support at this level would likely be seen as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity for committed Solana holders, and its price could rebound rapidly to $200 given its recent strength. Rollblock (RBLK): Real-Time Transparency For The Gaming Masses The revolutionary Rollblock (RBLK) GambleFi protocol just dropped a major new update and announced the upcoming launch of its innovative Burn Dashboard. This new tool will provide live insights into the RBLK token’s burn rates and the reduction in its circulating supply, led by the platform’s growing GameFi revenue.

At the same time, XYZVerse has broken past $9 million in its presale, aligning with a rebound in the market. These significant moves are capturing attention and hinting at intriguing shifts in the landscape. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Cross-Border Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to facilitate fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, making transactions irreversible and secure. Launched with an initial supply of 100 billion XRP, 80 billion were gifted to Ripple, a company that uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to ensure a controlled release of the supply. XRP’s technology aims to enable seamless payment transfers across various currencies without the need for a bank account. Its resistance to censorship and counterfeiting, combined with its speed and low transaction costs, positions it as a potential solution for global financial settlements. In the current market cycle, XRP’s focus on cross-border payments and partnerships with financial institutions may contribute to its utility.

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

A price surge at the start of last week accompanied speculation on the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the White House Crypto Summit , but as news was confirmed, traders took a “sell-the-news” approach, and the market quickly erased gains. The options market also added to the volatility last week, with a significant $3 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum contracts expiring last Friday, further driving price swings. Options realised volatility surged above 80 percent , signalling heightened instability as traders reacted to shifting macroeconomic conditions. Implied volatility jumped 35.7 percent just ahead of the summit, as traders hedged positions. Despite this, on-chain data revealed that many traders saw significant losses last week, with realised losses across market participants hitting $818 million per day, with February 28 and March 4 ranking among the largest single-day loss events in this cycle. Such widespread capitulation often precedes market stabilisation, though geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns remain a significant overhang. Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio. (Source: Bitcoin Magazine Metrics) Bitcoin’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) dipped into loss territory for the first time since October 2024, indicating significant distress selling. Short-term holder SOPR recorded its second-largest negative print of this cycle at 0.95, signalling that new market entrants are capitulating. Historically, any SOPR measure above 1.0 signals re-accumulation and bullish continuation, while extended weakness below this level could suggest further downside. If the bull market structure remains intact, buyers should begin stepping in at these levels, making SOPR a key metric to monitor in the coming weeks. Unemployment Rate and Nonfarm Payroll Month-over-Month Change (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics) Current macroeconomic indicators, however, are not pointing to a clear direction moving forward. US job market, productivity, and manufacturing sector data are decidedly mixed, with steady employment growth, rising wages, and efficiency gains offset by inflationary pressures, trade disruptions, and cautious business expansion. The US job market remains resilient , with 151,000 jobs added in February, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1 percent due to government job cuts. Wage growth remains strong , but rising labour costs and inflation pressures could challenge expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts this year. Worker productivity, on the other hand, increased by 1.5 percent in Q4 2024, helping businesses offset rising costs without expanding their workforce, but long-term risks remain if hiring stagnates. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector faces growing instability as new tariffs drive up production costs and slow new orders, raising concerns about the sector’s ability to sustain growth amid trade uncertainty. US President Donald Trump’s establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, consolidating over 187,000 BTC worth $13 billion, marks a historic shift from auctioning seized Bitcoin to holding it as a national asset. His administration also seeks stablecoin legislation by August and aims to end restrictive policies like Operation Choke Point 2.0, reinforcing the US position as a global crypto leader. With Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan, the US may retain BTC as a long-term financial asset instead of selling it, potentially influencing global crypto policy. Meanwhile, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force is set to hold a roundtable on March 21 to clarify the security status of digital assets, signalling a shift toward more structured regulatory guidance.In Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party is implementing crypto-friendly tax reforms , reducing the capital gains tax to 20 percent and classifying cryptocurrencies as a distinct asset class. The reforms also propose tax deferrals on crypto-to-crypto swaps and equal tax treatment for derivatives, encouraging digital asset investment.

Meanwhile, South Korean presidential frontrunner Han Dong-hoon is advocating for Bitcoin ETFs and crypto deregulation to position South Korea as a global leader in the industry. In Spain, BBVA received regulatory approval to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services, expanding its crypto offerings amid the EU’s MiCA regulatory transition. Traditional financial institutions are making it a clear priority to embrace digital assets despite the current outflows. Cryptocurrency ETPs Continue Bleeding Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) experienced their fourth consecutive week of outflows after shedding $876 million in the past trading week. This continued decline happened after record outflows of $2.9 billion the week before, bringing the four-week total to a staggering $4.75 billion, according to data from CoinShares on March 10. Despite the slower pace of outflows, investor sentiment is still deeply bearish, and James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noticed signs of market capitulation. (Source: CoinShares ) Bitcoin ETPs were the primary driver of this outflow trend, and accounted for $756 million, or 85% of last week's total outflows. Additionally, short-Bitcoin ETPs recorded outflows of $19.8 million, the highest since December of 2024. The sustained outflows greatly impacted year-to-date inflows, which have now dropped to $2.6 billion. Meanwhile, total assets under management (AUM) declined by $39 billion to $142 billion, which is the lowest level since mid-November 2024. This decline is attributed to both sustained outflows and negative price movements in the market. The bearish sentiment was not limited to Bitcoin, as a broad range of altcoins also recorded large outflows. Ethereum ETPs saw $89 million in withdrawals, while Tron and Aave ETPs registered outflows of $32 million and $2.4 million, respectively. However, some altcoins managed to attract investor interest despite the broader market decline. Solana, XRP, and Sui ETPs recorded inflows of $16.4 million, $5.6 million, and $2.7 million, respectively. These inflows suggest that some investors are still looking for exposure to select assets even as the broader market struggles with continued outflows. (Source: CoinShares ) While outflows have slowed compared to the previous week, the market is still under a lot of pressure, with investors extremely cautious amid ongoing uncertainty. South Korean Candidate Pushes for Bitcoin ETFs Despite the fact that crypto ETPs have been struggling, a leading candidate in South Korea’s upcoming presidential elections, Han Dong-hoon, recently outlined his stance on cryptocurrency, and advocated for deregulation and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. In an interview on March 9, Han pointed out that there is a need for South Korea to position itself at the forefront of crypto innovation by easing existing regulatory constraints. He stated that cryptocurrency regulations should be relaxed, and added that introducing Bitcoin ETFs could facilitate institutional adoption and allow corporations to invest in digital assets. Han’s pro-crypto stance is seen by many as an effort to appeal to younger voters in the South Korean political landscape where neither the ruling party nor the opposition has nominated a presidential candidate because of ongoing legal disputes. With the potential for an election later this year, Han is considered a frontrunner for the PPP nomination and could face Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung in a national poll. Han Dong-hoon Han also mentioned South Korea’s strong digital literacy, and argued that the nation’s rapid crypto adoption is a reflection of its technological advancement. He pointed out that crypto’s decentralized nature makes it more challenging for governments to control and suggested that excessive regulation could stifle innovation. He also took credit for the National Assembly’s decision to delay the implementation of a crypto tax until 2025, and stated that his opposition to the measure ultimately led to bipartisan support for the delay. Han himself once served as Attorney-General, and criticized lawmakers who once demanded the publication of a list of citizens who invested in cryptocurrencies. He dismissed the request as absurd and argued that many policymakers lack a fundamental understanding of digital assets. He is especially concerned about whether regulatory bodies, including the Department of Justice, truly understand the complexities of the crypto industry, and warned that misguided regulation could undermine South Korea’s digital economy. Han also once again mentioned his vision for South Korea to become a global leader in the crypto sector, warning that restrictive policies could drive capital out of the country. He placed a lot of emphasis on his belief that those who seek to impose excessive regulations do not understand the fundamental principles of cryptocurrency and that regulatory missteps could cause South Korea to miss its opportunity to establish global leadership in the industry. Spain’s BBVA Expands Crypto Services Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) announced on March 10 that it received approval from Spain’s securities regulator, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services to its customers. BBVA is Spain’s second-largest bank, and will now allow its users to buy, sell, and manage digital assets through its mobile app. The bank also developed its own cryptographic key custody platform, ensuring full control over customer holdings without third-party involvement. The initial rollout will be limited to a select group of users before expanding to all private customers across Spain in the coming months. BBVA’s involvement in the crypto sector started in Switzerland, where it launched Bitcoin custody and trading services for private banking clients in June of 2021. Over time, the Swiss branch expanded its offerings to include Ethereum and the USDC stablecoin. More recently, BBVA’s Turkish subsidiary, Garanti BBVA Kripto, introduced crypto trading services to the public in January of 2025. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA ) The move is taking place after the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) reached full implementation at the end of 2024. Although the framework is now in effect, crypto firms operating in the European Union have until July 2026 to fully comply with its requirements under an 18-month transitional phase. In response, traditional finance institutions and crypto-native companies have been working to secure MiCA licenses and integrate digital asset services. Prime brokerage Hidden Road got its MiCA license in the Netherlands on Dec. 30 of2024, followed by Standard Chartered in Luxembourg on Jan. 9 and Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody in Germany on Jan. 17. Major crypto exchanges are also adapting to the new regulatory environment. In January 2025, OKX, Crypto.com, and HashKey secured MiCA approval, while Bybit, which recently faced the largest hack in crypto history, was removed from France’s blacklist .

The actions were taken due to manipulation of orders or liquidity. To protect the interests of users, the platform banned the market maker from operating on the exchange and confiscated its funds, which will be used to compensate the affected users of GPS and SHELL. According to the statement, representatives of the projects will later announce the details of the payments. Binance has likely blocked Chinese company Whisper. Changpeng Zhao, founder of the trading platform, shared a tweet by analyst Quai Dong about its involvement. According to EA, the scheme started with venture capital firm Spark Digital Capital. Initially, the firm provided projects with financial support and marketmaking in exchange for free tokens. However, as competition increased between 2021 and 2022, this approach lost popularity. Spark changed its strategy and launched Web3Port service for deals and attracting venture funds in return for 1-3% free tokens. According to Dong, the new model wasn't profitable enough. That's when Web3Port founded Whisper. This structure allegedly masqueraded as a liquidity provider to sell tokens left by the team.

While digital asset investment products saw significant outflows in the fourth consecutive week, XRP marks remarkable gains. XRP has surpassed not only Bitcoin but also Ethereum, signaling a shift in market sentiment. Let’s dive into the evolving market trends and explore how XRP is outpacing the top cryptocurrencies. XRP Secures Inflows, Flips Bitcoin and Ethereum XRP defied broader market trends, drawing significant investor interest with a notable inflow of $5.6 million. This substantial investment, as per CoinShares’ weekly data , underscores XRP’s growing appeal in the market. Notably, digital asset investment products have witnessed a streak of significant outflows, with the current week marking the fourth consecutive week of substantial withdrawals. Over the past week, these products recorded an outflow of $876 million, taking the total net outflow to $4.75 billion. Significantly, Bitcoin was the biggest loser in terms of weekly outflows. Bitcoin experienced significant outflows of $756 million last week. Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin investments also saw outflows of $19.8 million, indicating that investors may be nearing a state of capitulation. Ethereum followed Bitcoin with an outflow of $89.2 million. Cardano was also one of the losers with an outflow of $1.9 million. Interestingly, Solana became the top gainer with a weekly inflow of $16.4 million. Closely following was XRP, which saw inflows of $5.6 million. Sui also gained attention with more than $2 million in weekly inflows. What Drives XRP’s Positive Market Sentiment? In recent weeks, XRP has garnered significant investor support, fueled by several key developments. These developments include the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) XRP ETF acknowledgements, Rpple lawsuit updates, and Donald Trump’s crypto reserve plans. The SEC’s recognition of multiple asset managers’ XRP ETFs has invoked a positive sentiment across the community. In addition, increasing anticipations surrounding the Ripple lawsuit settlement have significantly contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding the token. Triggered by President Donald Trump’s crypto reserve proposal that includes Bitcoin, XRP, SOL, and ADA as the country’s reserve assets, the Ripple coin gained notable attention. XRP’s significant inflows over the past week highlights its increasing investor demand and adoption. Crypto Market Crash: How Top Cryptocurrencies Perform? Today, the crypto market has seen a severe downturn, with top cryptocurrencies recording notable dips. Bitcoin is trading below $83k, marking a decline of 10% over the last week. Ethereum experienced a 10.61% plummet over the week, currently trading at $2,123. Meanwhile, XRP is exchanging hands at $2.20, with a massive decrease of 17% over the last seven days. Though the Ripple coin hit a monthly high of $2.9 recently, the current crypto market crash pushed the price down. During the period that saw key developments, XRP bucked the market trend, attracting investors even as top assets suffered massive outflows. Previously, when Bitcoin and Ethereum saw severe withdrawals of $2.59 billion and $300 million, respectively, XRP secured notable gains of $5 million. Now, despite the downtrend, the token is showcasing remarkable investor sentiment with the 121.9% hike in the daily trading volume, at $7.69 billion. It needs to be seen if Ripple’s token will continue to attract investors on a similar pace. Traders remain keen to know how the token price will be impacted with the potential developments in the XRP ETF and Ripple lawsuit.

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/financial-giant-robinhood-agrees-to-pay-thousands-of-dollars-in-fines-heres-why/,"Robinhood announced that it has agreed to pay $29.75 million in fines and restitution to drop the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (FINRA) multiple investigations into the company’s oversight and compliance failures. Robinhood Will Pay $30 Million to Drop US Regulatory Investigation The agreement consists of: $26 million in civil fines $3.75 million compensation to affected customers According to FINRA, Robinhood failed to respond to multiple adverse events related to potential misconduct that led to violations in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, auditing practices, and disclosure requirements. Key Findings from FINRA's Investigation The regulator identified several significant compliance failures, including: Failure to Monitor Clearing Systems: Robinhood did not properly monitor its clearing system, leading to significant trading delays between March 2020 and January 2021, when the company restricted trading in meme stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). Inadequate Fraud Detection: The company failed to detect, investigate or report manipulative trading activity, suspicious money movements and hacked customer accounts. Unauthorized Account Openings: Robinhood violated AML compliance requirements by opening thousands of accounts without properly verifying customer identities. Misleading Social Media Promotions: The Company did not appropriately monitor or maintain the social media communications of paid influencers, some of whom made misleading or unbalanced investment claims. Market Order Manipulation (“Catch”): Robinhood misrepresented how it processed market orders and converted them to limit orders without providing clear disclosure to customers. Both Robinhood Financial and Robinhood Securities consented to FINRA's findings without admitting or denying the allegations. This settlement follows a $45 million settlement Robinhood reached with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2025, in which the company admitted to violations related to the storage of electronic communications and other securities law violations between 2020 and 2021. *This is not investment advice.

Technical indicators now point to a potential 50% price decline, also fueled by the broader crypto market’s downward trend and recent US policy decisions. South Korean traders, however, are offering some lifeline for bulls, with Ripple gaining over 1.5% against the local currency over the last 24 hours. According to analysts on TradingView, there’s a head-and-shoulders pattern on XRP’s 3-day chart, a formation that often precedes a downward move. The pattern consists of three peaks: a higher high (head) flanked by two lower highs (shoulders). Once the price breaks below the neckline, it typically triggers a decline equal to the pattern’s height. 50% dip on the horizon; Will XRP survive? XRP/USD already broke through its neckline support by almost $2.20 on Monday, which makes it more likely that it will lose even more. Technical indicators predict the trend will continue, and XRP could fall to about $1.15, which is 50% less than where it is now. Analysts believe Ripple is testing a micro-support level at $2.17. A failure to hold above this point could lead to a further drop to $1.94. If XRP remains above this level, there is potential for an upward movement toward $3.18, $3.58, and $3.85. Still, if it breaks below $1.94, the immediate support lies at $1.81, followed by a zone between $1.80 and $1.40. On the daily chart, XRP is struggling to hold above the $2.20 level after failing to sustain gains beyond $3. Resistance remains firm between $2.50 and $2.60, with stronger selling pressure emerging near $3. An intraday 122% spike in trading volume shows there’s heightened selling activity, pitting stronger bears against holders that look more likely to let go of their holdings in the coming weeks. Any green price reversal would require significant buying interest at current levels, with sustained accumulation needed to push XRP above $2.50 and to start a breakout. Trump’s policies exacerbate bearish pressures, traders look to South Korea The Ripple market sentiment took a big hit when President Donald Trump signed an executive order that explicitly states the US government will not allocate taxpayer funds to purchase additional altcoins. Trump ordered the government to only maintain its existing crypto holdings, which reportedly include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but not Ripple. The US dollar index is still close to its lowest level in four months, which makes things even less stable overall. This means that risk assets, like cryptocurrencies like XRP, could be very volatile. XRP is struggling against the US dollar, which is why holders will be looking at its performance in South Korean markets. The token is up 1.8% against the South Korean won, currently changing hands at 3,264 KRW per coin on Upbit . XRP/KRW trading chart. Source: Upbit Per data from CryptoQuant, the total XRP exchange reserves on Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, went down by 8% over the weekend, while exchange outflows reached a seven-day high $7.8 million today, signaling a decline in selling pressures in the Asian country. The uptick comes when the South Korean won is depreciating in value against the dollar, largely attributed to ongoing global trade tensions. A report last week revealed that South Korea is preparing countermeasures against the US’s proposed tariffs on auto imports, set to take effect in April.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance emerges as a serious challenger to Shiba Inu, offering real-world utility and strong investor demand at just $0.20 ahead of its launch. Table of Contents The limitations of Shiba Inu Enter Rexas Finance: The new contender Final thoughts Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) became well-known thanks to the meme-coin phenomenon, recent market research indicates that its target price of $0.0002 in 2025 might stay out of grasp. By contrast, a fresh challenger, Rexas Finance (RXS), sometimes known as the “SHIB Killer,” shows potential for a parabolic rally. Rexas Finance, which is now selling at just $0.20 during its last presale stage, has a novel ecosystem, useful real-world applications, and transforming technologies that could upend the market. Here is why RXS might be the altcoin redefining investors’ portfolios in 2025. The limitations of Shiba Inu Even though SHIB has received considerable interest and experienced massive increases in price before, many things indicate that getting to $0.0002 might be a tougher goal than expected. Whale activity, which previously impacted SHIB prices greatly, has been relatively quiet. This absence of sizable whale transactions could explain SHIB’s slower price appreciation. The technical indicators for SHIB show an unclear situation, with some suggesting further declines. SHIB is also trading in a descending channel pattern, a bearish signal. Its price might be difficult to sustain growth without underlying technological progress or practical use. You might also like: Rexas Finance price prediction: Can RXS deliver on its presale hype? Enter Rexas Finance: The new contender Rexas Finance is a strong substitute in the middle of this ambiguity. Its stated goal is to democratize blockchain innovation through practical use. At $0.20 per token during its last presale, RXS offers a rare opportunity for early backers. Unlike SHIB, which depends on viral trends, Rexas Finance combines security with innovative capability based on the strong Ethereum blockchain. In its last presale stage, which is already 90.49% filled, RXS has already raised over $46.4 million and sold over 452.4 million tokens, proving tremendous market demand and excellent investor confidence. Rexas Finance offers a Token Builder and a Launchpad, which enable companies to create and use unique tokens more efficiently. These solutions remove the strong technical obstacles that have usually hampered blockchain acceptance. Market players keen to fund initiatives with great value and practical usage are already drawn to this straightforward approach. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself primarily from others by emphasizing Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. The potential to digitize tangible assets, including real estate, commodities, and financial instruments, is changing everything at a time when conventional finance and decentralized technology are progressively merging. RXS is leading this trend, seeking to release liquidity from illiquid markets and provide a platform enabling the flawless integration of conventional assets into the blockchain ecosystem. This strategy diversifies Rexas Finance’s use cases and offers real value that can inspire ongoing investor interest. As more conventional assets become tokenized, demand for a safe and effective platform to manage them will only rise. With its creative strategy, long-term investment possibilities, and possible explosive returns, Rexas Finance sees itself as a potential leader in the developing sector of asset tokenizing. Security and transparency are paramount in crypto. By completing a thorough Certik audit, Rexas Finance has established confidence in its project. This rigorous security analysis has verified the integrity of its smart contracts and general platform, lowering risks for investors and offering a solid basis for expansion. Furthermore, Rexas Finance is already shown on important tracking systems such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which improves its profile and facilitates investors’ tracking of its performance. With an official launch set for June 19, 2025, investing in RXS at $0.20 offers a rare opportunity to get in early before the token experiences general market adoption. Rexas Finance offers a $1 million giveaway, with 20 lucky winners receiving $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. This will further encourage investment. Final thoughts Shiba Inu never fails to enthrall with its viral appeal, but its speculative character could eventually restrict their long-term expansion possibilities. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, presents a well-rounded investment possibility with a creative ecology, real-world utility, and low entrance cost. RXS is a convincing substitute with parabolic returns for investors hoping to profit on the next big bull run in 2025.

The leading altcoin has dropped by more than 48% from its mid-December 2024 high above $4,000 to a current value of $2,068. While prices trend downward, significant accumulation by whales points to a contrasting sentiment building in the background. Whales Accumulate, Exchange Drain According to data from Santiment, Ethereum whales have accumulated 1.10 million ETH in the past 48 hours, which accounted for nearly 0.92% of the total circulating supply of 120 million ETH. This significant accumulation signals a potential shift in the market, even as the price remains under pressure. Historically, similar whale activity has led to notable price swings, as seen in January 2025, when the purchase of 330,000 ETH triggered a brief rally. Supporting this accumulation narrative, Intotheblock revealed that $1.8 billion worth of ETH was withdrawn from exchanges last week – marking the largest weekly outflow since December 2022. Such significant withdrawals often indicate long-term holding strategies rather than immediate selling intentions. Nevertheless, the broader market sentiment stays cautious as Ethereum continues to face stiff resistance and struggles to regain bullish momentum. The current divergence between price action and whale behavior could indicate that investors are positioning for a potential rebound despite short-term uncertainty. The ongoing slump in digital asset prices is taking a toll on high-profile investors. For instance, US President Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial is facing significant losses, with its cryptocurrency portfolio down $110 million from an initial investment of $336 million, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. Although the firm holds nine different cryptocurrencies, Ethereum accounts for 65% of the total loss, which makes it the largest contributor to the decline. Speculation of Rebound Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader said that Ethereum appears to be mirroring its 2016 price pattern, which has raised speculation about a potential repeat of its historic rally. While observing the long-term chart, he pointed out that ETH has followed a similar structure to its previous cycle, including a sharp correction and a consolidation phase. As such, the recent price dip may represent the “fake-out” stage – a period of market uncertainty and false breakdowns – that preceded Ethereum’s explosive move in the past. If this pattern holds, the altcoin could be poised for a significant breakout in the coming months.

Its complexity has limited its adoption, but the “ Post Web ” stack is taking shape with AI agents emerging as autonomous economic actors. Smart contracts, decentralized networks, and verifiable computation will remain. But now they are being optimized for AI-driven execution, coordination, and intent-based automation. The question isn’t whether it’s happening but how fast we need to adapt. For the past decade, we have been beta-testing decentralized systems and applications. While millions of people engage with blockchain networks, DeFi protocols, and decentralized applications (dApps), the reality is that Web3 remains vastly underutilized. Despite approximately 10% of the world allegedly owning crypto, only a fraction of these holders actively use decentralized applications as a real alternative to Web2 or centralized platforms. This disconnect isn’t due to a lack of capability in Web3 technology, but rather its usability challenges and inherent complexity. In hindsight, Web3 was never designed for human users at scale. It was designed for machines. Now, with AI agents emerging as autonomous economic actors, the sleeping giant of Web3 functionality is waking up. The “Post Web” — a term we coined at Outlier Ventures — creates a world where agents execute tasks, manage assets, and transact on our behalf. Every component of the Web3 stack will be repurposed. Once hindered by complexity, the infrastructure built for a decentralized world is now ideally suited for an internet optimized for machines. AI agents will not just use Web3. They will unlock all of its potential. The Giant Awakens Web3 has been misunderstood. Many expected it to be a more decentralized version of Web2, where users own their assets, participate in governance, and interact with permissionless applications. In practice, Web3 has revolutionized back-end systems. As yet, its technology remains too complex for the average user to handle. Smart contracts, self-custody, and bridging across chains, require time, effort, and technical understanding that most people simply don’t have. This is where AI agents change everything. Unlike humans, agents thrive in complexity. They can process vast amounts of information, automate intricate workflows, and operate seamlessly across decentralized networks. While human users struggle with onboarding, agents can directly integrate with smart contracts, optimize for efficiency, and execute transactions without friction. For the first time, Web3 will have users who can fully leverage its capabilities. AI agents will seamlessly interact with decentralized infrastructure, allowing Web3 to operate at the scale it was always meant to. The Post Web Tech Stack: Built for Machines Web3 has spent the past decade building decentralized infrastructure without considering AI. With the rise of autonomous AI agents, our thinking about this stack must fundamentally change. In the Post Web, where AI agents replace humans as primary users, the stack undergoes two critical transformations: Optimizing the existing Web3 stack for AI agents – Upgrading decentralized infrastructure to support machine-driven transactions, intent execution, and autonomous coordination. Building out a new agentic layer on top – A new computational and coordination layer for hosting, managing, and orchestrating AI agents that handle social and economic activity on behalf of users. In our broader work at Outlier Ventures on the Post Web, we’ve examined this evolution in greater detail. Put simply,, the Post Web stack consists of three core layers, each essential for enabling an internet optimized for machines. 1) The Agentic Layer: AI as the New Interface In the Post Web, users won’t have to navigate wallets, exchanges, or dApps themselves; AI agents will do it for them. These agents act as personalized digital intermediaries, executing transactions, managing assets, and making complex economic decisions. For this to work, the Agentic Layer will be the bridge between intent and execution. Users will express intent-based, high-level goals and objectives, such as investing in assets, booking travel, or negotiating contracts, and agents will handle the rest. Smart wallets will evolve into sovereign identity hubs, storing personal data, assets, and permissions, allowing agents to act with precision. This shift means that instead of relying on centralized platforms, individuals will delegate actions to sovereign AI, giving them complete control while eliminating the need for direct interactions with complex systems. The agentic layer is the largest green-field opportunity for bold founders who have the desire and ability to combine probabilistic AI capabilities with deterministic smart contracts and DLT. There is a need for marketplaces, coordination layers, frameworks, and more, all of which need to be developed and improved. 2) The Trust Layer: Smart Contracts & DLT as the Backbone If AI agents are to execute real-world tasks, they need deterministic, verifiable environments where transactions and agreements can be enforced without ambiguity. This is where blockchain and smart contracts become critical. Today’s AI models operate on probabilistic logic. Based on training data, they predict the next most likely outcome. However, economic transactions require certainty and enforceability: a bank transfer, legal contract, or trade must be executed with absolute finality. Smart contracts provide this missing piece. They offer immutable, self-executing agreements, allowing AI agents to conduct economic activity with complete transparency and verifiability. More importantly, decentralized ledgers ensure that agent-driven transactions are secure, permissionless, and trust-minimized, preventing manipulation or central control over digital economies. In short, the Post Web cannot function without the trust layer of decentralized networks. Agents need verifiable execution environments, and Web3 provides precisely that. The shift is clear for those building in Web3 today: Your infrastructure must be agent-friendly. Protocols that enable composability, seamless execution, and verifiable data will outperform those relying on fragmented, manual processes.In short, the startup rule book is evolving rapidly. 3) The Infrastructure Layer: Compute, Data & DePIN AI agents don’t just need smart contracts; they need resources. They require computing power, storage, and access to decentralized data networks to function autonomously. This is where Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) come into play. DePIN provides on-demand computing, storage, and bandwidth, allowing agents to operate at scale without relying on centralized cloud providers. Instead of a few hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud controlling AI compute, DePIN distributes these resources across permissionless networks, optimizing for cost, accessibility, and resilience. This layer ensures that AI agents aren’t just participants in digital economies. They are sovereign entities capable of operating without centralized gatekeepers. From decentralized GPU networks like Akash and Render to permissionless data exchanges like Ocean Protocol, the infrastructure for agentic autonomy is already forming. Startups building in the Post Web era must consider how their products integrate with decentralized compute and storage markets. AI-first applications will demand cheap, scalable, and permissionless infrastructure, and the projects that provide it will become foundational to the new economy. Outside these three layers, there are more granular components such as privacy-enhancing technologies, modularity, middleware, scaling mechanisms, and so on, which all broadly fall under one or more of these categories, which we discuss in detail in our other work. The Internet Is Being Rewritten For decades, the Internet has been built around human interfaces, platforms, apps, and centralized gatekeepers that dictate how we interact with digital services. That era is ending. The Post Web stack doesn’t just improve Web3; it redefines it into a world where AI agents are the primary users. With an agentic layer for execution, a trust layer for verifiability, and a decentralized infrastructure layer for scale and resilience, we are witnessing the rise of an autonomous, machine-driven internet. This isn’t the next version of the Web; it’s the disappearance of the Web as we know it. The question isn’t whether this shift will happen but whether you are building for it.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-10 13:53:20

Great news for Litecoin investors is that institutional investors have jumped in big time. Considering ‘smart money’ is what really moves the market, Litecoin is poised for a strong upmove. Analyst Ali Martinez took to X to inform crypto enthusiasts that whales bought over $43M worth of $LTC in just two days. Ali also pointed towards Litecoin’s chart, saying that its current trading inside a broad range, and a strong hold above $98 could see the token fly to $135. Additionally, we can also see $LTC taking support at the 200 EMA (exponential moving average), which further confirms its bullish outlook. With top cryptocurrencies like $LTC, $BTC, $ADA, and $ETH spiking investor interest – Trump just announced strategic crypto reserves for Bitcoin and other tokens, for instance – the market looks ripe for a huge rally. To help you make the most of it, we’ve highlighted a few tokens with the potential to 100x your investment . 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Ride Bitcoin’s Growth Although a meme coin at its heart, BTC Bull Token ‘s interesting fundamentals make it one of the best cryptos to invest in . After all, it’s the ONLY crypto project whose token holders will be rewarded with free $BTC. Every time Bitcoin hits a new price landmark, such as $150K, $200K, $250K, and beyond, BTC Bull Token developers will automatically send real $BTC to $BTCBULL token holders. The only requirement is that these tokens must be stored in Best Wallet . Not only that, but the fact that these Bitcoin airdrops are directly tied to the $BTC’s price makes BTC Bull Token ideal for those looking for a low-cost way to invest in Bitcoin’s historic growth. The project will also follow a deflationary model, wherein the total token supply will be artificially reduced at periodic intervals. Combined with a heavy focus on marketing, i.e., maintaining market hype, BTC Bull Token could easily be the next crypto to explode . You can join the BTC Bull Token presale ($3.4M+ raised) by shelling out just $0.002405 per token. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Top Meme Coin with Real Utility Although a hub for meme coin development and trading, Solana ($SOL) has lately been struggling to keep up with the increasing demand. The network has been overwhelmed, which is why it’s been coughing up frustrating outages and sustainability issues. Solaxy ($SOLX) is set to be Solana’s knight in shining armor. Or the princess who kisses the frog (in this case Solana) to turn it into the prince that it really is. That’s because Solaxy plans to build Solana’s first Layer-2 chain. By processing transactions off-chain, Solaxy will significantly reduce the pressure on Solana’s mainnet. This will better equip it to manage increased demands during traffic surges, such as the one it faced during the launch of $TRUMP in January. The Solaxy presale , with over $25.7M in its kitty, is already among the best crypto presales of the year. However, it’s now gaining noticeable momentum because Solana validators are about to vote on two critical upgrade proposals this month. These upgrades could result in a strong upside momentum for $SOL. This would then also have a positive impact on $SOLX’s price. Currently, 1 $SOLX is available for only $0.001658. Here’s how to buy it . 3. Catslap ($SLAP) – Listed Meme Coin with a Slap-to-Earn Model Catslap ($SLAP) might not have a rock-solid purpose like the above tokens, but it’s proof that it doesn’t have to make sense to make you money. Based on the viral ‘slapping cat’ meme, Catslap ($SLAP) follows a one-of-a-kind slap-to-earn model. The rules are simple: token holders pick their favorite (or rather least favorite) real-life character, like Elon Musk and Donald Trump. And then slap them like there’s no tomorrow. Those who manage to channelize their inner strength and make it to the list of the top 10 slappers stand to make real cash – up to a whopping $10K each. Although $SLAP ‘s price has been in the red ever since it rose by over 45% in the first week of January, there are a few reasons to be optimistic about this token’s future. The Catslap team will continue to hold 10% of the total token supply for the next 10 years. This shows their confidence in the project. There are regular token burn and buyback events, both of which are typically associated with a price increase. You can invest in possibly one of the best meme coins for just $0.0005694 per token. 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Solana Crypto Poised to Make a Comeback Fartcoin initially gained traction for its nonchalant nature. The very idea of being able to earn free tokens by submitting fart jokes is so absurd it’s brilliant. Add to that the amusement of hearing a fart sound every single time you make a transaction on the platform. And you get a coin that had a +480,000% historical performance in five months. It wasn’t long ago that $FARTCOIN was sailing high, touching new highs every week. It reached its all-time high of around $2.4 in the third week of January. But it has since then lost almost 90% of its value. It’s currently trading at $0.2369 . However, a surge of nearly 16% in a single day might just be the first sign of the resurrection of Solana’s OG meme coin. The token’s recent price jump came on the back of the White House ‘Crypto Summit.’ This clearly shows that the token has the potential to rally come a new crypto bull run. Moreover, with big-time crypto traders like Altcoin Sherpa and Unipcs backing Fartcoin to go to the moon, it could prove to be an excellent high-risk/high-reward situation. Bottom Line Although we’ve had several pieces of positive news about multiple big cryptos, like Bitcoin, Solana, and Litecoin, we’re still a few knots away from an out-and-out bull run. This means you can’t just get in and get out as you would in a trending market. So, invest carefully, including putting in only a reasonable sum of money. Additionally, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice. You must always do thorough firsthand research before investing.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|LTC|SOL|MARKET,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-10 13:58:28

SEC Lawsuit News Update: Is a Resolution on the Horizon?,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-news-update-is-a-resolution-on-the-horizon/,"TL;DR Leadership changes at the SEC, including Gensler’s exit and key reassignments, could signal a reduced penalty or resolution for Ripple. Contrary to speculation, no official settlement has been reached, with experts calling the case more complex than other crypto lawsuits. What’s New? Despite dropping or pausing many of its lawsuits against crypto businesses, the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) keeps confronting Ripple on the legal front. Over the past several months, the dispute has seen numerous developments that may change its course and indicate that its final resolution might be imminent. One example is the departure of the former anti-crypto Chairman Gary Gensler. He stepped down on January 20 and was succeeded by Mark Uyeda, who has an entirely different stance on the digital asset industry. A few months ago, US President Donald Trump appointed Paul Atkins to take the helm at the agency. However, he should first receive the Senate’s confirmation. The popular attorney, Fred Rispoli, believes that Ripple might be waiting for him to step in charge so he can potentially drop or reduce the previously ruled $125 million penalty on the company. Recall that Judge Torres ordered the firm to pay the amount for violating certain rules. The sum represented just a fraction of the $2 billion the SEC initially asked for, and Ripple’s execs were ready to pay the fine. However, the Commission filed a last-minute appeal in October 2024, thus prolonging the case indefinitely. Gensler’s departure is not the only change in the SEC’s leadership. Not long ago, the regulator transferred one of its top crypto litigators – Jorge Tenreiro – to its IT division. He joined the watchdog more than a decade ago and signed the aforementioned notice of appeal against Ripple. John Reed Stark (former director of the SEC Internet Enforcement Office) recently claimed that Tenreiro’s allocation could be one of the reasons why the Commission might soon pause or fully withdraw all of its appeals against crypto entities. “Yet, this SEC trial lawyer, who championed the victories of Coinbase and Binance, is now glaringly absent from both the Coinbase and Binance pleadings, ordered to pack his pencils and legal pads and transfer to the SEC’s IT department,” Stark stated. Have We Missed the End? Another well-known individual who recently touched upon the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit is Anthony Scaramucci. Earlier this month, the former White House official took part in an interview, placing the legal battle among those that the regulator has already dismissed. The host of the conversation , Scott Melker (known as The Wolf of All Streets), agreed with this assumption. However, no official information shows that the two entities have shaken hands on a mutual agreement or reached a settlement. In fact, some legal experts have predicted that the resolution will not be that simple, claiming that this battle is much more complex than the rest involving the SEC and crypto entities. “The SEC broke up with Coinbase after a couple of dates. Ripple and the SEC live together and have a baby,” US lawyer Jeremy Hogan opined . The post Ripple v.

Since the US election , DeFi TVL rose to as high as $138 billion on Dec. 17 but has retracted to $92.6 billion by March 10, as noted by analyst Miles Deutscher. Solana has borne the brunt of criticism as its memecoin popularity faded , but Ethereum has faced its own challenges in recent cycles, failing to reach a new all-time high while Bitcoin soared past $109,000 on Jan. 20 , the day Trump took office. Ethereum’s TVL has dropped by $45 billion from cycle highs, DefiLlama data shows. Source: Miles Deutscher Ether’s ( ETH ) record high price of $4,787 from November 2021 remains unbroken despite positive industry developments, such as spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launching in the US and Trump’s executive order for a strategic Bitcoin reserve . Related: Bitcoin risks weekly close below $82K on US BTC reserve disappointment Ethereum’s $1.8 billion weekly net exchange outflow Nearly 800,000 Ether, worth approximately $1.8 billion, left exchanges in the week starting March 3 , resulting in the highest seven-day net outflow recorded since December 2022, according to IntoTheBlock data. The outflows are unusual given Ethereum’s 10% price decline during the period, hitting a low of $2,007, per CoinGecko. Typically, exchange inflows signal selling pressure , while outflows suggest long-term holding or movement into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as staking or yield farming. “Despite ongoing pessimism around Ether prices, this trend suggests many holders see current levels as a strategic buying opportunity,” IntoTheBlock stated in a March 10 X post. Before March 3, Ethereum experienced net exchange inflows daily, indicating that investors were selling during the downturn, said Juan Pellicer, senior research analyst at IntoTheBlock, in comments to Cointelegraph. He noted that ETH’s drop to $2,100 may have triggered accumulation, which then led investors to withdraw funds from exchanges. Pectra upgrade meets own roadbumps Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap has reduced congestion and gas fees but introduced liquidity fragmentation. The upcoming Pectra upgrade aims to address this by enhancing layer 2 efficiency and interoperability. By doubling the number of blobs, it reduces transaction costs and helps consolidate liquidity. Additionally, account abstraction allows smart contract wallets to function more seamlessly across Ethereum and layer-2 networks, simplifying bridging and fund management. The Pectra upgrade rollout encountered setbacks on March 5 when it launched on the Sepolia testnet. Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden reported errors on Geth nodes and empty blocks being mined due to a deposit contract triggering an incorrect event type. A fix has been deployed.

Stablecoin Market Cap Surpasses $200 Billion as US Backs Digital Dollar Strategy This increase follows the recent statement made by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the Digital Asset Summit, where he pledged to leverage stablecoins to help preserve the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. According to Glassnode data, stablecoin market value peaked at $205 billion as investors flocked to these dollar-pegged assets amid falling cryptocurrency prices. Stablecoins Lead the Market Since Donald Trump’s election victory, the stablecoin market has expanded by $40 billion, making them clear winners amid struggles in both the crypto and equity markets. Tether (USDT) remains the dominant player, maintaining a market cap of $140 billion as of December. Circle’s USDC rose by $25 billion, approaching a $60 billion valuation. Bessent’s comments reflect growing concerns about geopolitical and macroeconomic changes that could dampen foreign demand for U.S. debt. Over the past year, Japan and China, the two largest holders of U.S. Treasuries, have reduced their positions. Stablecoins are seen as a critical tool to counter this trend: Holding U.S. debt as reserves, helping to stabilize Treasury yields Increasing global demand for U.S. dollars in digital finance Increasing liquidity in dollar-backed assets for international markets Notably, Tether (USDT) is currently one of the largest holders of three-month US Treasury bonds, underscoring the growing influence of stablecoins in traditional finance. As policy support and institutional adoption grow, stablecoins are solidifying their role in the future of global finance. *This is not investment advice.

Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, plans to raise $21 billion through its class A strike preferred stock as the firm seeks to bolster its investment portfolio. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a company statement , Strategy will use proceeds from the sale to fund general corporate operations, which could include more Bitcoin ( BTC ) buys. Offering STRK shares via an at-the-market sale sale adds to Strategy’s existing ATM equity program for the “21/21” roadmap, a plan to raise and invest $42 billion in BTC championed by executive chairman Michael Saylor. Currently, Saylor’s company owns approximately 499,096 BTC valued at over $41 billion. Strategy has spent about $33.1 billion acquiring this massive BTC cache at an average price of $66,357—mostly funded by capital raised from equity sales. You might also like: Japan’s 40Y Bond Yield nears all-time high, here’s how it impacts the crypto market STRK, which is a perpetual preferred stock, adds a new layer of flexibility for Strategy as it continues to buy BTC through share sales. Perpetual preferred stocks aren’t bound to a maturity date or a fixed redemption period like bonds. Instead, vehicles like STRK pay a predetermined dividend in perpetuity, 8% in Strategy’s case, while the issuer remains in business. STRK investors can also swap their holdings for class A common shares, although this process involves specific requirements and conditions. Furthermore, Strategy can exercise a buyback option for the total unbought allocation if STRK’s value declines 25% below its initial value at issuance. TradingView data noted that STRK was down 2.1% at last week’s close. Strategy did not see new patronage for its class A common stock between March 3 and March 7, meaning the firm will likely not disclose a new BTC acquisition this week.

41437993,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=690200,1741620487,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41437993.jpeg,"Trump says tariffs will make America so rich, ‘you won’t know where to spend it’",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-says-tariffs-will-make-america-rich/,"President Donald Trump, speaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday, said tariffs will make the United States richer than ever before, dismissing economic concerns and doubling down on his aggressive trade policies. He told Fox News that the country will take in “hundreds of millions of dollars” and reach a point where Americans “won’t know where to spend all that money.” Trump made these comments during a brief interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, where he also waved off concerns about a potential recession. “I’ll tell you what, of course, you hesitate,” he said when asked whether he was worried about an economic downfall. “All I know is this—we’re going to become so rich.” Meanwhile, hours after Trump’s interview aired, Dow Jones futures dropped nearly 500 points, a 1.2% loss. S&P 500 futures fell 1.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled 1.6%. Last week was already rough for the markets. The S&P 500 had its worst week since September, dropping by 3.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.37%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid by 3.45%. Trump’s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico have been nothing short of chaotic. They were initially paused for a month, then reinstated last Tuesday, only to be partially reversed on Wednesday, before being delayed again on Thursday. This unpredictable back-and-forth approach has left businesses and investors scrambling. Wall Street and economists warn of recession risks While Trump insists that tariffs will make the U.S. wealthy, economists and financial analysts aren’t as convinced. Byron Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, wrote that continued economic instability under Trump increases the likelihood of a downturn. “The longer we have chaos and turmoil from Trump, the higher the probability that we will eventually have data trend negative,” he said. The Federal Reserve is also closely watching the situation. Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, said the Fed is “well positioned to wait for greater clarity” as Trump’s administration implements “significant policy changes” in trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. He added that uncertainty remains high, and the central bank is focused on “separating the signal from the noise.” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told CNBC that while a recession isn’t certain yet, Trump’s unpredictable behavior is making things worse. “The U.S. economy is resilient, I would say, largely despite Donald Trump,” he said. “His zigzagging on tariffs shows that he has little idea of the potential consequences of his policies.” New data will test Trump’s trade strategy The upcoming week is packed with economic reports that could either support or contradict Trump’s confidence in tariffs. The New York Fed will release a survey on consumer expectations, and on Wednesday, the government will publish February’s Consumer Price Index. Thursday will bring fresh producer price data, and Friday will feature the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment report. Economic signals are already flashing warning signs. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow tracker predicts a 2.4% contraction in U.S. GDP for the first quarter of the year. If that number holds, and the following quarter also shows negative growth, the U.S. will officially be in a recession. The labor market is also showing cracks. February’s nonfarm payrolls report showed 151,000 new jobs, missing expectations and failing to keep up with previous months. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, adding to concerns that the economy could be slowing down. Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard, believes Trump’s policies could push the economy in multiple directions. “The sum of Trump’s actions can yet skew the economy in any which way, including an implosion of capital spending,” he wrote . JPMorgan analysts warn of continued volatility While Trump continues to push his tariff policy, major financial institutions are not on board. Analysts at JPMorgan’s U.S. Market Intelligence unit have warned that the U.S. economy is entering “another period of uncertainty” due to Trump’s unpredictable trade war. “We have already seen the negative impact that policy/trade uncertainty has had on both household and corporate spending,” JPMorgan analysts said. “It seems likely that we see a larger magnitude of this over the next month.” They also pointed out that a rapidly rising unemployment rate could push the stock market into what they call a “Recession Playbook.” While a U.S. recession is not their base-case scenario, they warned that the “undetermined length of tariffs” and the possibility of an accelerated trade war could further weaken the economy. JPMorgan analysts now hold a bearish stance on U.S. stocks, expecting more volatility. “Given the lack of a potential end to this escalation, the expectation is that tariffs of this magnitude will drive both Canada and Mexico into a recession,” they wrote . “Look for U.S. GDP growth expectations to crater and for earnings revisions to be materially lower, forcing a re-think of year-end forecasts.” Despite the warnings from analysts, economists, and investors, Trump remains firm in his belief that tariffs will bring unprecedented wealth to the country. “We’re taking in so much money,” he said during his Fox News interview. “You’re not going to believe it.” The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s latest remarks or the ongoing confusion surrounding his tariff policies.

Recent attempts at recovery have been met with resistance, leaving many investors uncertain about its near-term potential. With slow network growth and limited buying pressure, SHIB’s performance has failed to meet expectations, prompting some holders to explore alternative investment opportunities. One project that has been gaining attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol designed to offer real utility in the DeFi sector. Mutuum Finance provides users with lending and borrowing opportunities while generating passive income. As SHIB struggles to break out of its stagnant phase, investors are beginning to shift their focus toward projects like MUTM, which present structured financial models with long-term growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol designed to give users full control over lending and borrowing digital assets. By eliminating intermediaries, it ensures a more transparent and efficient financial system. Lenders earn passive income by supplying assets to liquidity pools, while borrowers access liquidity without selling their holdings. The platform supports two lending models. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to deposit assets into liquidity pools, earning interest as borrowers take out loans with rates that adjust based on demand. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) offers direct agreements between lenders and borrowers, making it possible to lend riskier assets like DOGE or PEPE. Mutuum Finance’s presale is moving quickly. Currently in Phase 2, the token is priced at $0.015, but with over 81% completed, it will rise to $0.02 in the next phase. More than 4,750 holders have already secured their positions, contributing to the $2,560,000 raised so far. The planned exchange listing price is $0.06, offering early investors a 300% gain at launch. With the upcoming beta platform release, demand for MUTM is expected to increase, further driving its potential growth. SHIB faces challenges in bouncing back Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced difficulties in regaining upward momentum, with its price struggling to break through key resistance levels. While some large holders have accumulated more tokens, overall trading activity has remained stagnant. The slowing burn rate has further reduced the impact of supply reduction, making it harder for SHIB to sustain any meaningful recovery. With over 547 trillion SHIB tokens concentrated around the $0.000014 resistance level, selling pressure remains a major hurdle. Without a surge in demand or market catalysts, SHIB risks prolonged consolidation or further declines. As a result, some investors are beginning to explore alternative opportunities with stronger growth potential. Why SHIB investors are moving to MUTM Many SHIB investors see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a token with stronger long-term potential. Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on market sentiment and burns, MUTM operates within a structured DeFi ecosystem, creating real demand through lending services. Its sustainable tokenomics and built-in buy pressure make it an attractive choice for those looking beyond speculative assets. With these factors in place, many believe MUTM could outperform SHIB in long-term growth and deliver greater returns. Mutuum Finance is attracting investors with a $100,000 giveaway, rewarding early supporters and boosting community engagement. This initiative encourages participation ahead of the token’s exchange launch, strengthening interest in MUTM’s long-term potential. Mutuum Finance is emerging as a strong DeFi contender, offering real utility through its lending model and sustainable growth mechanisms. As SHIB investors seek projects with long-term potential, many are turning to MUTM for its structured financial approach and steady value creation. With the presale nearing its next price jump and the beta launch on the horizon, interest in MUTM continues to rise. Its combination of lending opportunities, passive income, and a solid token model positions it as a promising investment for the future.

He voiced his opposition during a current appearance on Jason Calacanis’ All In podcast. Sacks dismissed host Jason Calacanis’ suggestion of a 0.01% tax on all crypto transactions, an idea proposed to fund a US Strategic Bitcoin reserve. Sacks opposed the idea. He stated that all taxes always start very small and then grow over time. Therefore, he called the idea burdensome. Crypto Investors Agree: Small Fees Could Hurt Adoption He is not alone in these thoughts as crypto investors also expressed disapproval, citing concerns that even small transaction fees could hinder widespread acceptance.

One project is leading the way: Rexas Finance (RXS). Positioned as a game-changing challenger to standard cryptos and top meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Rexas Finance is gaining traction thanks to its unique approach, clear roadmap, and anticipated mega exchange listing. Here is why analysts consider RXS too good to miss crypto in 2025. What is Rexas Finance (RXS) and how does it work? Rexas Finance (RXS) is redefining the blockchain tokenization of RWAs, including real estate, commodities, and fine art. By fractionalizing these precious assets, Rexas Finance offers unmatched investment options for all capital sizes. Instead of investing millions of dollars in commercial real estate, an investor can purchase tokenized shares of a property through Rexas Finance, quickly exposing themselves to the market. The same holds true for precious metals, equities, bonds, and even art, all of which may be represented as digital tokens and easily traded. Rexas Finance is a real revolution in the financial scene. It removes obstacles, including high capital needs, delayed transactions, and opaque ownership structures. Its ecosystem guarantees a perfect connection with current economic systems and is tailored for institutional and retail investors. Why RXS is the best high-utility crypto investment The primary distinction between Rexas Finance (RXS) and meme coins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) is their tangible applications. RXS is more than a speculative asset; it is an infrastructure initiative enabling blockchain-based ownership of real-world assets, a sector estimated to be worth $16 trillion by 2030. One of the most important factors driving RXS token acceptance is its multifunctional ecosystem, which includes Rexas Token Builder: A no-code solution for easily designing and releasing unique tokens. It is excellent for enterprises and people who want to tokenize assets without technical knowledge. Rexas QuickMint Bot: A Telegram and Discord-integrated bot that allows users to immediately create and distribute tokens, making asset tokenization more accessible than before. Rexas AI Shield: A security technology that assures the integrity of smart contracts, decreasing risks for investors and token holders. Rexas Treasury: A multi-chain yield optimizer that allocates funds to high-yield agricultural prospects, optimizing investor earnings. Rexas Launchpad: A platform for launching and supporting new blockchain initiatives that offer RXS token holders early access to great crypto companies. RXS is more than just another altcoin; it is a foundational blockchain project that addresses real-world banking, DeFi, and asset management issues. Unlike speculative tokens that rely on hype-fueled cycles, this offers long-term staying strength. Click here to buy Rexas Finance (RXS) presale RXS presale nearing completion: FOMO surges among investors The Rexas Finance (RXS) presale has peaked, and investor interest is soaring. Stage 12 (Final Stage) is already 90% sold out, indicating strong FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) ahead of the formal market launch. RXS’ current price is $0.20, a whopping 566% rise over its Stage 1 price of $0.03. This astonishing price increase demonstrates increased investor confidence in the project and its long-term potential in the RWA tokenization market. As of publication, 451 million RXS tokens had been sold, with the presale raising a whopping $46.3 million. This huge response demonstrates how cryptocurrency investors have positioned themselves for massive gains ahead of RXS’s exchange debut. Upcoming RXS exchange listing: why analysts predict a 100,000% surge The official listing of RXS on major exchanges is quickly approaching, and the impact might be spectacular. Rexas Finance has verified that RXS will launch on at least three of the world’s top ten crypto exchanges, exposing it to millions of traders worldwide. The RXS listing price is fixed at $0.25, allowing even late-stage presale buyers to enter the market and profit immediately. However, the true excitement stems from the anticipated liquidity rush and the normal post-listing rally observed in top exchange launches. Historically, high-utility coins that launch on top-tier exchanges have seen price increases of 10,000% or more, but analysts foresee even larger swings for RXS. According to some estimations, RXS might experience a 100,000% price increase upon debut when demand for RWA tokenization reaches new highs. Will RXS be the next Shiba Inu (SHIB) success story? Meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) made early investors millionaires, but the truth is that SHIB has no real-world value. Its price changes are solely driven by speculation, making its long-term viability unclear. As of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.00001542, more than 80% behind its all-time high price achieved during its rally peak in 2021. In comparison, Rexas Finance (RXS) has real use cases, a Certik audit , and significant institutional interest in RWA tokenization. With a final presale stage quickly selling out, a huge exchange debut on the horizon, and a $1 million giveaway driving adoption, RXS is poised to be one of the biggest breakout altcoins of 2024. Investors looking for the next crypto moonshot with substance should keep an eye on Rexas Finance (RXS). With a trillion-dollar market opportunity and a community committed to its long-term mission, Rexas Finance (RXS) has the potential to be the best crypto investment of the year.

In February, Bank of America said it was open to the launch of stablecoin. In doing so, the bank expressed its willingness to follow Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut and Stripe into a business dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). The enthusiasm of new entrants is fueled by the growing adoption of ”stable coins” by regulators around the world, the FT noted. The momentum is largely due to the return to office of US President Donald Trump. The cryptocurrency working group formed by him has prioritized developing a regulatory environment for stablecoins. Congress is already discussing a related legislative bill. ”If they make it legal, we will get into that business,” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said. Last month, Standard Chartered said it would lead a joint venture that plans to launch a token based on the Hong Kong dollar. Payments company Stripe closed its $1.1 billion acquisition of infrastructure platform Bridge. ”Stablecoins and more advanced networks are really interesting for use in payments, which is what our business is built on,” said Stripe co-founder and president John Colison. PayPal, which has already released PYUSD, plans to expand the coin's use cases in 2025. The company is counting on increased demand from U.S. importers paying for shipments to foreign counterparties. New entrants face stiff competition in the sector. According to Visa, PYUSD transaction volume this month totaled $163 million, while Tether's figure exceeded $131 billion. The total capitalization of the stablecoin segment is approaching $236 billion, of which USDT accounts for ~$143 billion and USDC (CoinGecko) for ~$58 billion. Crypto trading remains the most common use case for stablecoins. However, the assets have gained popularity in some emerging markets as a substitute for hard currency. In some cases, they are used for cross-border transfers. For example, SpaceX thus withdraws funds from the sale of Starlink services in Argentina and Nigeria. Index Ventures partner Martin Mignot noted that stablecoins are ”attractive” for markets with a lack of ”developed infrastructure or large liquidity”, as well as the presence of high currency risks. However, for the leading economies, the scenarios for their use ”do not look so obvious,” the expert believes. Analysts warn that the market ”may not be able to tolerate” dozens of new coins as consumers begin to scrutinize the quality of the companies behind the assets. Simon Taylor, co-founder of fintech consulting firm 11:FS, pointed out that stablecoins are quasi-money, so reflect the issuer's credit risk. As a reminder, bitcoin exchange Crypto.com scheduled the launch of its own ”stable coin” for the third quarter of 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|USDT|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-10 15:37:06

This drop is primarily because of the ongoing crypto sell-off. Still, the Chainlink price may bounce back over time, helped by a $350 trillion opportunity sported by Sergey Nazarov, its founder. Also, Chainlink is about to start a trial with SWIFT, and is part of the holdings by the US government. Chainlink Price May Rise as a $350 Trillion Opportunity Emerges Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink’s founder, believes that the oracle network will play a role in the future of finance. This industry will marry the blockchain technology with traditional finance, creating a $350 trillion opportunity. He said : “We don’t want our industry to be about $3.5 trillion. We want it to be about $35 billion, and eventually $350 billion . To do this at this stage of the game, generating crypto tokens will benefit and do some of that, but won’t take us to $10 trillion. What will take us there is if all regulated asset value come together. Chainlink as a technology stack will be important for implementing that flow of value.” Chainlink is already working on large industries. For example, it is already working with SWIFT Network, a society that moves transacts over $150 trillion annually. The two entities will conduct a vendor system test on May 2nd and a pilot system on July 19. UBS, the biggest wealth manager globally, is part of this Chainlink and SWIFT pilot . After that, they will release the MX standards in November. SWIFT hopes that using blockchain technology will be an essential part of the financial services in the future. Meanwhile, Chainlink price may benefit from being included in US government’s assets. Arkham data shows that wallets linked to the US government holds over 100k LINK tokens currently worth over $1.7 million. This means that LINK may become part of Donald Trump’s digital stockpile. LINK Price Megaphone Pattern Points to a Rebound The weekly chart shows that the Chainlink price bottomed at $5.25 between May 2022 and June 2023. It has bounced back, and formed two higher highs, and two higher lows. The ongoing retreat is part of the third higher low. LINK price has formed a megaphone pattern , which is a popular bullish continuation sign. This pattern is made up of two ascending and diverging trendlines, and historically, it often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Therefore, it is likely that the Chainlink price will drop and retest the lower side of the megaphone and then rebound. If this happens, the most viable LINK price forecast is it rising to $31, up by about 120% from the current level. This price is its highest level in December. Chainlink Price Chart The bullish view will become invalid if the price of Chainlink drops below the lower side of the megaphone. Such a drop will see it retreat to the key support level at $5.25, the lowest level in 2022 and 2023.

For those navigating the volatile cryptocurrency markets and seeking diversification or understanding broader financial trends, the movements of major currency pairs like EUR/USD offer crucial insights. Recently, a significant player in the financial world, Bank of America (BofA), has released a compelling analysis suggesting a continued EUR/USD upside . Let’s dive into what this means for traders and the factors driving this optimistic Euro to Dollar outlook . Why Bank of America is Betting on Further EUR/USD Gains Bank of America’s analysts aren’t just throwing darts at a board. Their positive EUR/USD forecast is grounded in a detailed assessment of various economic indicators and market dynamics. So, what’s fueling their bullish stance? ECB’s Hawkish Stance: The European Central Bank (ECB) has been signaling a more aggressive approach to combatting inflation. This hawkish monetary policy, which often involves raising interest rates, tends to strengthen the Euro. As the ECB continues to prioritize price stability, the Euro is likely to find support. US Economic Slowdown Concerns: Conversely, the US economy is showing signs of cooling down. While the Federal Reserve has also been raising interest rates, concerns about a potential recession or slower growth in the US could weigh on the US Dollar. This relative weakness of the Dollar provides a tailwind for the EUR/USD pair. Technical Analysis Signals: Beyond fundamental factors, technical analysis – the study of price charts – also plays a role. BofA’s analysts likely observe chart patterns and indicators suggesting continued upward momentum for EUR/USD. These technical factors can reinforce the fundamental outlook. Market Positioning: Understanding how other traders are positioned in the market is crucial. If a significant number of traders are positioned for a weaker Euro, a shift in sentiment or economic data could trigger a ‘short squeeze,’ further propelling EUR/USD upwards. Decoding the EUR/USD Upside: What Does it Mean for You? Whether you’re a seasoned Forex trader, a crypto enthusiast exploring traditional markets, or simply someone interested in global finance, understanding the potential EUR/USD upside has implications. Here’s a breakdown: For Forex Traders: This bullish outlook presents potential trading opportunities. Traders might consider long positions on EUR/USD, aiming to capitalize on the anticipated upward movement. However, as always, risk management is key. Using stop-loss orders and managing leverage are crucial to protect your capital. For Crypto Investors: While seemingly distinct, the Forex market and cryptocurrency markets are interconnected. A stronger Euro and potential Dollar weakness can influence broader market sentiment and risk appetite. Understanding these dynamics can provide a more holistic view of the financial landscape. Furthermore, some crypto trading platforms offer Forex pairs, allowing for diversification and hedging strategies. Economic Indicator Awareness: The factors driving the Euro to Dollar outlook , such as ECB policy and US economic data, are important economic indicators to watch. Monitoring these releases can provide insights into potential future movements in EUR/USD and other markets. Navigating the Forex Market Trends: Opportunities and Challenges The Forex market trends are constantly evolving, presenting both opportunities and challenges for traders. While BofA’s analysis points to a potential EUR/USD upside , it’s essential to be aware of the broader context. Opportunities: Profit Potential: A clear directional bias, as suggested by BofA, can offer defined trading opportunities. If the Euro to Dollar outlook materializes, well-positioned trades can yield significant profits. Diversification: For crypto-focused individuals, Forex trading offers diversification into a different asset class. Understanding currency movements can broaden your trading skillset and portfolio. Liquidity: The Forex market is the most liquid financial market globally. This high liquidity ensures tight spreads and ease of entry and exit from trades. Challenges: Volatility: While liquid, the Forex market can also be volatile, especially around major economic data releases or geopolitical events. Unexpected news can quickly reverse trends. Leverage Risks: Forex trading often involves high leverage, which can amplify both profits and losses. Mismanaged leverage can lead to significant capital depletion. Economic Complexity: Understanding the macroeconomic factors influencing currency movements requires continuous learning and analysis. Staying informed about global economic trends is crucial. Actionable Insights for Trading EUR/USD Based on BofA’s Forecast So, how can you translate Bank of America’s EUR/USD forecast into actionable trading strategies? Here are a few insights: Actionable Insight Description Monitor ECB and Fed Policy: Keep a close watch on statements and decisions from both the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve. Changes in their monetary policy stances will directly impact EUR/USD. Track Key Economic Data: Pay attention to economic releases from both the Eurozone and the US, such as inflation figures, GDP growth, and employment data. These releases can trigger significant market movements. Utilize Technical Analysis: Incorporate technical analysis tools and charts to identify entry and exit points for your trades. Look for confirmation of the bullish trend in price action and indicators. Implement Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Determine an appropriate position size based on your risk tolerance and account balance. Avoid over-leveraging. Stay Informed on Global Events: Geopolitical events and global economic developments can also influence currency markets. Stay updated on major news that could impact EUR/USD. Conclusion: Riding the Potential EUR/USD Wave Bank of America’s optimistic EUR/USD forecast paints a potentially lucrative picture for Forex traders. Fueled by the ECB’s hawkishness and concerns about the US economic outlook, the Euro to Dollar outlook suggests further upside for the pair. While opportunities abound in these Forex market trends , challenges such as volatility and leverage risks must be carefully managed. By staying informed, employing sound risk management strategies, and utilizing both fundamental and technical analysis, traders can position themselves to potentially capitalize on the anticipated EUR/USD upside . Remember, the Forex market is dynamic, and continuous learning and adaptation are key to long-term success.

From Friday to Sunday, Ripple’s native asset dropped 17.8%, as traders reacted to the event with a classic “sell the news” move. The decline came after Trump officially announced the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile for altcoins, fulfilling his earlier promises. IF THE SEC DROPS ITS APPEAL, #XRP COULD ENTER UNCHARTED TERRITORY! pic.twitter.com/yZ9fx8hCCT — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) March 10, 2025 Despite top crypto executives leaving the White House with a sense of victory, the market reacted with another wave of sell-offs, highlighting lingering investor caution. XRP has struggled over the past week, posting a 17% loss. However, it remains the best-performing cryptocurrency among the top five, holding onto a 5.4% gain for the year. Meanwhile, other leading assets have fared worse, with Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) recording annual losses of 11.6%, 36.4%, and 32.2%, respectively. XRP Has Found Strong Support at These Levels Multiple Times The $2.10 level has been acting as a key support area for XRP for at least two weeks and the chart reflects the relevance of this level as it has bounced multiple times shortly after tagging it. In the past 24 hours, XRP has lost 2.8% but has managed to stay above this key threshold. Trading volumes during this period have skyrocketed by 125%, meaning that buyers have shown up en masse to scoop up the token at this level. Below this level, XRP has several key support zones where it has previously rebounded, with the lowest point in recent months at $1.72. This suggests a downside risk of 21.6% if the market retests its February 3 lows. However, XRP has consistently closed above these support areas, favoring traders who take long positions when the price reaches the $1.70 – $2.10 range. Momentum indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below the signal line, while the MACD histogram has turned negative. A break below $2.10 could trigger further declines to $1.95, and if selling pressure intensifies, XRP could fall as low as $1.70. While XRP’s near-term prospects appear uncertain, investor interest is shifting toward MIND of Pepe ($MIND), a new AI agent token that has been gaining traction through its highly successful presale.

The sustained withdrawals and an ongoing cryptocurrency market drawdown have erased gains made since November 2024 after Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential elections, pushing total assets under management (AUM) down by $39 billion to $142 billion. Investor sentiment in the U.S. is particularly bearish, with $922 million in outflows, while investors in Europe and Canada brought in modest inflows, data from CoinShare’s Digital Asset Fund Flows report shows. Investment products focused on bitcoin saw $756 million in outflows, while products shorting the cryptocurrency saw $19.8 million in withdrawals, the largest since December 2024 according to the report. Ethereum-focused products endured $89 million outflows, while products focusing on solana (SOL), XRP, and Sui (SUI) saw inflows of $16.4 million, $5.6 million, and $2.7 million respectively. Despite the collapse in assets under management for cryptocurrency investment products, cryptocurrency prices remain above the levels seen before Trump was elected.

Trump expects the same this time around. However, Powell is not in a hurry. Powell already cut its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%. Therefore, in January, Powell decided that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The Fed governor Christopher Waller explained that there are cuts for “good news” and cuts for “bad news.” “Bad news” cuts happen when the Fed lowers rates because it thinks the economy is slowing down. This is what happened last year and what Trump is panicking about. “Good news” cuts happen when the Fed thinks inflation is back to its goal level of 2%. According to Waller, the Fed can pull off “good news” rate cuts later this year. However, he didn’t think that a cut would happen at the Fed’s next meeting this month. Powell blames Trump’s policies for the crisis Trump hit the ground running immediately after entering office. It has been policy after policy with the help of his administration and Musk’s DOGE. The tariff agenda was the first in line. This has caused chaos not only with those hit by the tariffs but they have had an impact on America as well. Trump has turned to the FED to solve its mess. He instructed Powell to cut interest rates. Powell didn’t do it. According to him, Trump should fix it. Powell said the White House “is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation It is the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy.” Trump told Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. Powell didn't do it. Now Trump is trying to force Powell to cut interest rates by crashing asset prices. We will see who blinks first. — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) March 9, 2025 Powell noted that the uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. He said the Fed is focused on something different. He said the focus is on “ separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.” Powell’s stance is on a positive note. In his assessment, Powell said mostly good things about the big picture. He said the U.S. is in a good place with a solid labor market and inflation moving back to its target. The Labor Department revealed a gain of 151,000 jobs in nonfarm payroll for the month of February. Some people thought the number would be a little higher, but Powell said the report shows that the labor market is solid and broadly in balance. However, recent polls showed people were worried about the direction of inflation, which was mostly caused by Trump’s talk about tariffs. Their favorite measure of inflation showed that it was 2.5% over the past 12 months, or 2.6% if food and energy were taken out of the equation. Powell said, “The path to sustainably returning inflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue.” The markets responses Today, the U.S. stock index futures went down because people were still worried about how the Trump administration’s tax policies might affect the biggest economy in the world. China will put tariffs on some U.S. goods as a response today, and the U.S. will likely put tariffs on some base metals later this week. Investors will also watch U.S.-Canada ties. This is especially true because official results show that Mark Carney, a former central banker, won the race to become leader of Canada’s ruling Liberal Party. He will take over as prime minister from Justin Trudeau. This uncertainty caused the benchmark S&P 500 to drop the most in a week since September. On Thursday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 10% from its December record high. As of last week, the CBOE Volatility measure was at a level that hadn’t been seen since December. Chinese stocks that are traded in the U.S., like Alibaba, fell 2.4%, Bilibili fell 4.4%, and Xpeng fell 2.7%. This was after reports from China made people less optimistic about the world’s second-largest economy’s recovery. Crypto stocks like MicroStrategy fell 5.3%, Coinbase fell 5.5%, and Riot fell 4.3%, all of which were in line with bitcoin’s 4% drop. This week has begun with further crashes. Stocks in the Dow fell 299 points, which is 0.7%. Stocks in the S&P 500 fell 48.75 points, which is 0.84%, and stocks in the Nasdaq 100 fell 198.5 points, which is 0.98%. Also, Nvidia fell 2%, while Meta and Amazon.com both fell more than 1.3%. The price of Tesla stock was not an exception, as it dropped 2.6%. The crypto market has been further damaged. Regardless of the White House crypto meeting, the major coins have declined yet again. Bitcoin has returned to the $80K range, following a recent comeback to $90K. It is now priced at $83,195. On the other hand, Ethereum has dropped to $2,000. It is currently at $2,121. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

41438381,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138637,1741621817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial EUR/CZK Forecast Update: UBS Predicts Surge Amid Europe’s Positive Sentiment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ubs-eur-czk-forecast-update/,"In the ever-turbulent world of Forex trading, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. Just like in the crypto markets where every tweet can send ripples, traditional financial markets too are swayed by sentiment and expert analysis. Recently, a significant shift has occurred in the European Forex landscape, prompting financial giant UBS to revise its projections for the EUR/CZK currency pair. Let’s dive into what this means for traders and investors keeping a close eye on European economic indicators. Understanding the Revised EUR/CZK Forecast UBS, a globally recognized financial institution, has recently adjusted its EUR/CZK forecast . This revision comes in the wake of increasingly positive economic sentiment emanating from Europe. But what exactly does this adjustment entail, and why should you, as someone interested in dynamic markets, pay attention? Upward Revision: UBS has revised its forecast upwards, suggesting a potentially stronger Euro against the Czech Koruna than previously anticipated. Positive Sentiment Catalyst: This adjustment is primarily driven by a growing wave of positive sentiment across the European economic landscape. Implications for Traders: For Forex traders, especially those dealing with European currencies, this forecast adjustment could signal potential trading opportunities and the need to reassess existing positions. To put it simply, UBS believes the Euro is poised to perform better against the Czech Koruna in the near future, thanks to a brighter outlook for the European economy. Decoding Europe’s Positive Sentiment: What’s Driving the Optimism? What exactly is this Europe sentiment that’s causing ripples in the Forex market and influencing major players like UBS? It’s a confluence of factors painting a more optimistic picture for the European economy: Easing Inflationary Pressures: Across the Eurozone, there are signs that inflationary pressures are beginning to ease. While inflation remains a concern, the rate of increase is slowing, offering hope for economic stability. Resilient Economic Data: Despite global headwinds, recent economic data from key European economies has shown resilience, surpassing some analysts’ expectations. This includes indicators like manufacturing output and consumer spending in certain sectors. Geopolitical Stability (Relative): While the global geopolitical landscape remains complex, there’s a sense of relative stability within Europe itself, which is contributing to improved business and investor confidence. Energy Price Moderation: After the energy price shocks of recent times, there has been some moderation in energy costs in Europe, alleviating pressure on businesses and consumers. This positive sentiment is not just abstract feeling; it translates into real-world market movements and influences financial institutions’ outlooks. The Role of the Czech Koruna in the Forex Equation While European sentiment is on the rise, understanding the Czech Koruna ‘s position is equally crucial in grasping the EUR/CZK dynamic. The Czech economy, while closely linked to Europe, has its own unique characteristics: Independent Monetary Policy: The Czech National Bank (CNB) operates an independent monetary policy, which can sometimes diverge from the European Central Bank (ECB). This independence influences the Koruna’s value. Inflation Challenges: The Czech Republic has faced significant inflationary pressures in recent times. The CNB has been actively combating inflation through interest rate hikes, which can impact the Koruna’s strength. Economic Ties to Germany: The Czech economy is heavily reliant on trade with Germany and the broader Eurozone. European economic performance directly affects the Czech Republic’s economic outlook. Tourism Sector: Tourism is a significant contributor to the Czech economy. Fluctuations in global travel and tourism trends can influence the Koruna. The interplay between the positive European sentiment and the Czech Republic’s specific economic situation is what shapes the EUR/CZK exchange rate and makes it a pair to watch. Navigating Forex Market Trends: Insights for Traders For anyone involved in Forex market trends , especially those trading European currencies, the UBS forecast adjustment and the underlying positive sentiment offer valuable insights. How can traders leverage this information? Monitor EUR/CZK Movements: Keep a close eye on the EUR/CZK exchange rate. The upward forecast suggests potential buying opportunities for the Euro against the Koruna, but always conduct your own thorough analysis. Track European Economic Indicators: Stay updated on key European economic data releases, such as inflation figures, GDP growth, and employment numbers. These indicators will provide further clues about the strength of the positive sentiment. Consider CNB Policy: Be aware of the Czech National Bank’s monetary policy decisions and statements. Interest rate changes by the CNB can significantly impact the Koruna’s value. Diversification and Risk Management: As always in Forex trading, diversification and robust risk management strategies are essential. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and use tools like stop-loss orders to protect your capital. The Forex market is inherently volatile, and forecasts are not guarantees. However, expert analysis like UBS’s provides valuable context and helps traders make more informed decisions. UBS Forecast: A Credible Indicator? Why should traders and investors pay heed to the UBS forecast ? UBS is a major global financial institution with a strong reputation for its economic research and market analysis. Here’s why their forecasts carry weight: Extensive Research Resources: UBS has a vast team of economists and analysts who dedicate their time to studying global economic trends and currency movements. They have access to a wealth of data and resources. Track Record: UBS has a generally solid track record in forecasting, although, like all financial institutions, their forecasts are not always perfectly accurate. Past performance provides a degree of credibility. Market Influence: UBS’s forecasts are closely watched by other market participants. When a major institution like UBS revises its outlook, it can influence market sentiment and even trigger self-fulfilling prophecies to some extent. Comprehensive Analysis: UBS’s forecasts are typically based on comprehensive analysis of various economic factors, geopolitical events, and market dynamics, making them more than just guesswork. While no forecast is infallible, the UBS EUR/CZK forecast revision is a significant indicator worth considering for anyone trading or investing in these currencies. Conclusion: Navigating Forex with Informed Optimism The adjustment of the UBS EUR/CZK forecast in response to Europe’s positive sentiment underscores the dynamic nature of the Forex market.

The exchange plans to offer both large and nano-sized contracts, it said in a press release , for both retail and institutional traders which will be available 24/7 in an effort to bridge the gap between fixed trading hours and the round-the-clock nature of the crypto market, it said. This gap, Coinbase said, ""forces traders to sit on the sidelines during key market moves, limiting their ability to react in real time."" The exchange is also working on launching perpetual-style futures in the U.S. with long dated expirations. According to Coinbase, derivatives account for 75% of trading volume globally, making them a ""cornerstone"" of crypto markets. As a result of that, there has been strong demand from crypto-native U.S. clients for regulated futures. This launch, which is in partnership with Nodal Clear for CFTC-regulated clearing, represents the first 24/7-available crypto futures in the U.S. CME Group, the largest traditional derivatives exchange in the U.S., has been offering several different crypto futures, however, those are only available to trade during U.S. trading hours.",Markets|Coinbase,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-10 15:50:20

Uncertainty caused by trade tariffs on Canada and Mexico and the risk of a trade war with China also impacted investor sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC) is down over 3% in the past 24 hours and is trading around $82,800 after registering a substantial decline on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTC) Continues Decline Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market have declined as investors assess the impact of Trump’s economic policy, trade tariffs, a Bitcoin reserve, and a potential trade war with China. The flagship cryptocurrency declined substantially on Sunday, falling to a low of $80,005 despite President Trump signing an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a digital asset stockpile. According to QCP Capital, the reaction is because investors have realized no actual budget has been allocated for Bitcoin purchases. “The knee-jerk reaction lower likely stems from the realization that no actual budget has been allocated for Bitcoin purchases in the near term.” Trump’s executive order directs the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to develop a budget-neutral strategy to acquire additional Bitcoin. However, it stops short of using taxpayer funds for purchases. This did not go well with investors who pulled their capital from the market. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, stated, “Bitcoin tumbled about 5% immediately following the announcement before partially recouping most of the losses, reflecting short-term expectations that the U.S. government will not be immediately committing to acquiring crypto assets in the open market.” Despite the market reaction, many analysts see a strategic Bitcoin reserve as a significant milestone for the asset. The order also mandates a 60-day Treasury review of legal and investment considerations for the reserve while Treasury and Commerce explore additional avenues to acquire Bitcoin. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, stated, “I think the market has this wrong. The market is short-term disappointed” that the government didn’t say it was immediately going to start acquiring 100,000 or 200,000 bitcoins. I think the right question to ask is: did this executive order make it more likely that in the future Bitcoin will be a geopolitically important currency or asset? Will other governments look to follow the U.S.’s lead and build their own strategic reserve? And to me, the answer to that is emphatically yes. I think the market will soon find its footing and realize that this is incredibly bullish long term for this asset and for crypto as a whole.” Is History Repeating Itself? Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high following Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2025. It also hit a local top at the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, with both events followed by a market correction. Since Trump’s inauguration, the flagship cryptocurrency has dropped to $80,000, a decline of almost 30%. While the price action indicates bearishness, Bitcoin bulls view it as a long-term catalyst, especially with the US switching to a more favorable stance towards Bitcoin and crypto. However, a lack of buying pressure suggests short-term weakness. BTC reported a similar price action when the highly anticipated spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched. BTC surged from $25,0000 in October 2023 to $49,000 in January 2024, a 40% rally. However, after reaching a local top following the launch, BTC declined as much as 20% before eventually reaching a new all-time high above $73,000 in March. This time, BTC surged almost 60% after Donald Trump won the elections, hitting a new all-time high of $109,000 in January before undergoing a 30% correction. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to an intraday low of $80,005 on Sunday as markets faced a substantial downturn. The drop occurred as traders reassessed the impact of global trade tensions, President Trump’s Bitcoin reserve order, tariffs against Canada and Mexico, and a potential trade war with China. According to the executive order, the strategic Bitcoin reserve will be funded by the BTC seized during criminal and civil cases. The order also stated the government could not sell any BTC added to the reserve. The order also directs the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to develop a budget-neutral strategy to acquire Bitcoin. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, stated, “Bitcoin tumbled about 5% immediately following the announcement before partially recouping most of the losses, reflecting short-term expectations that the U.S. government will not be immediately committing to acquiring crypto assets in the open market.” BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday, dropping below $80,000 to a low of $78,173. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $84,362. The price recovered on Saturday, rising over 2% and settling at $86,182. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as markets rallied. As a result, BTC surged over 9% to reclaim $90,000, move past the 20-day SMA, and settle at $94,322. However, the rally was short-lived as the price dropped nearly 9% on Monday, falling below $90,000 and the 20-day SMA to $86,225. BTC fell to an intraday low of $81,500 on Tuesday before recovering to register an increase of 1.27% and settle at $87,316. Buyers retained control on Wednesday, and BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $90,000 and settle at $90,639. Source: TradingView BTC was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.75% to slip below $90,000 and settle at $89,597. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell 3.53% to $86,781. BTC started the weekend with a marginal decline, falling to $86,267. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC plunged below the 200-day SMA, falling to a low of $80,005 before settling at $80,736. BTC rose to an intraday high of $84,978 during the current session as buyers attempted a move past $85,000. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to its current level, dropping below $80,000 to $79,990. If BTC continues to fall, it could retest its recent low of $78,000. A break below this level could see the price drop to $75,000. Buyers must push BTC above the 200-day SMA and reclaim $90,000 to invalidate such a scenario.

Now, with MUTM emerging as a new performer, investors believe it could be the next Ethereum-based token to take off in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting much attention and an increase in investor interest, with its presale gaining huge momentum. Over $2.7 million has already been raised, with more than 4900 investors securing early positions. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2, demand continues to grow as investors anticipate the next price increase. With a projected launch price of $0.06, early participants stand to gain up to 300%, with additional upside potential once the token reaches major exchanges. Smart money is moving fast, with over 85% of Phase 2 of the presale already sold out. SHIB & PEPE: Ethereum-Based Meme Coins That Made Millionaires Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) have dominated Ethereum’s meme coin scene, proving that small investments can lead to massive returns. Shiba Inu, priced at $0.000013, skyrocketed from obscurity to a top-tier token, fueled by a loyal community and strategic ecosystem expansions. Pepe Coin, currently at $0.0000069, followed a similar path, delivering massive gains to early adopters through viral hype and strong market momentum. Both tokens show the power of Ethereum-based assets in creating exponential growth, and with investors now searching for the next breakout, many are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.015 as a potential winner. Redefining DeFi Lending with an Innovative Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance is transforming decentralized lending with a unique dual-lending model that incorporates both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model employs smart contracts to optimize liquidity pools with efficient use of capital by real-time manipulation of interest rates that dynamically adjust according to market conditions. P2P bypasses middlemen so that the users can enter lending contracts directly with complete openness and full autonomy over terms. With the option of fixed and floating interest rates, the system is ideal for a broad variety of risk profiles and provides users with greater financial flexibility. Audited smart contracts also provide better security for a secure and convenient lending experience. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is experiencing a surge in investor enthusiasm, with its presale gaining significant momentum. Over $2.7 million has already been raised, with more than 4900 investors securing early positions. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2, demand continues to grow as investors anticipate the next price increase. Early participants stand to gain up to 300%, with additional upside potential once the token reaches major exchanges, with a projected launch price of $0.06. Growth Potential & Exclusive Investor Rewards Mutuum Finance is building a solid foundation with plans for strategic token buybacks, staking rewards, and prominent listing on exchanges. To commemorate its rapid expansion, the site launched a $100,000 giveaway, giving 10 lucky winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a referral program that boosts member involvement through incentives for bringing in new investors to the site. Mutuum Finance will become an important stakeholder in the digital finance industry, with increasing demand for novel DeFi solutions. Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin turned small investments into massive gains, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be next. Priced at just $0.015, its presale has already raised $2.7 million, attracting over 4,900 investors. A launch price of $0.06 means early buyers could see 300% returns, with even more upside after exchange listings. Over 85% of Phase 2 is already sold out. Act now before the next price jump.

41438828,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-sovereign-state-era,1741622372,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Bitcoin has formally entered its sovereign state era,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-sovereign-state-era,"This is a segment from the Supply Shock newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Bitcoin is writing history as we speak. Blockworks’ newest podcast Supply Shock now actively connects the dots between the current state of Bitcoin and its tumultuous timeline — all anchored by the unique perspective of its host Pete Rizzo, the Bitcoin Historian. So, let’s get you up to speed with the three most memorable moments in Bitcoin from the past week: Uncle Diamond Hands It’s happening: The US government officially holds bitcoin as a reserve asset. Could last Thursday’s executive order have been more bullish? Maybe. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will, in the beginning, only hold bitcoin seized in criminal and civil cases — a list that presumably includes Silk Road, which Arkham puts at 198,109 BTC ($16.64 billion) in total, though it’s likely much less . That’s more than 40 times larger than the separate Digital Asset Stockpile to be composed of seized coins other than BTC, which today amount to about $419 million. Still, the order authorized the Secretary and Commerce Secretaries to develop “budget-neutral strategies” to actively buy bitcoin in the future, as long as taxpayers don’t foot the bill. Key officials have already said they are actively exploring the idea through at least two government agencies. The same can’t be said for other cryptocurrencies — with the executive order stating the government will not acquire more assets for the Digital Asset Stockpile outside of forfeiture proceedings. No. Second. Best. 11th hour in Utah The Utah Senate passed the Bitcoin-focused bill known as HB230 by a 19-7-3 vote on Friday — which should’ve allowed the state to create its own strategic bitcoin reserve. Lawmakers pulled the key provision effectively at the last minute. Had they not, Utah might’ve become the first US state to actively buy bitcoin. Initially, the bill had made room for the state treasury to invest up to 5% of certain funds into digital assets, including accounts related to state disaster recovery and income tax fund budgets, among others. The catch: the treasury could’ve only bought coins with a market cap above $500 billion, averaged over the last year. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that fits that definition right now, so the bill was largely considered a move towards a de facto strategic bitcoin reserve. https://twitter.com/Bitcoin_Laws/status/1898224218686599297 There’s good news. The bill enshrined certain rights for Bitcoiners into law, including the right to mine, self-custody and run nodes. Other provisions allow for staking, including for coins other than bitcoin, while devs will be able build software on blockchain rails without shirking money transmitter laws. All well and good. But at least the state bitcoin reserve dream is still alive in more than a dozen states including Arizona, Texas, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Florida and Georgia. Five states have so far rejected related bills. Hydro-powered by Bitcoin The Kingdom of Bhutan is a Buddhist Bitcoin whale that’s been mining since as early as February 2021. Last week, we were blessed with the first known interview with Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay about the kingdom’s mining operations, which aim to offset declining tourism revenue. “There are hundreds of people who have made billions of dollars on the back of Bitcoin. Why aren’t governments doing more?” Tobgay told Al Jazeera. “We have used bitcoin for health — to provide free healthcare, for [the] environment. But these are minor. The main use of Bitcoin has been to finance the salaries of public servants.” A Blockworks analysis last September found Bhutan was raking in up to $4.9 million BTC per day and in total had generated 27,727 BTC up until that point, valued at nearly $2.3 billion at current prices. At the time, the government may have netted around $578.5 million from selling its mined coins over time. Its wallets currently contain 10,635 BTC ($876 million), per Arkham . And when asked whether the Bhutanese will one day make bitcoin offerings to Buddha, the outlet said that Tobgay thinks the world is “heading inevitably towards using and exchanging bitcoin just like any other currency.” I couldn’t have said it better myself.

However, the memecoin sector is on a steady decline as the memecoin frenzy continues to fade. Dogecoin and Pepe now have a new rival pioneering a hybrid crypto exchange. Market data shows that Dogecoin’s performance leads among the best-performing memecoins. Pepe’s rally also proves it’s a top performer. However, BinoFi has taken the digital market space by storm. Successful tasks dominate the registry because they show increasing market capitalization numbers. Token market value hinges on the trading volume of its issued tokens. BinoFi enters the digital domain at the start of its presale stages while revealing its boundless potential to establish itself in the market. The project forecast for 2025 shows great promise. Dogecoin suffers from network inactivity, which extends its price to remain in consolidation. According to market predictions, BINO will become more popular than existing memecoins during Q4 of this year. Specialists believe BINO tokens have the potential to increase by 1700% based on their prediction. BinoFi’s utility sets it apart from memecoins like Dogecoin and Pepe BinoFi unveils a hybrid project with interoperable features for Centralized Exchanges (CEX) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEX). The project’s orders are executed systematically. Matching is done off-chain while the settlement is done on-chain. BinoFi also incorporates automated order routing mechanisms that direct orders to the most liquid market between the DEX pools and the CEX order book. The feature sets it apart from other crypto exchanges. This makes it possible to transact across a liquid market, ensuring accurate and effective trade execution. Since BinoFi combines DEX and CEX features, experts anticipate a growing adoption for the asset. Among the secured CEX listings include exchanges like Crypto.com and Coinbase, whereas DEX listings include PancakeSwap and Uniswap. Accessibility to this project might greatly boost its adoption, thus creating demand for the asset driving its value through the roof. Experts predict BINO could outperform DOGE and PEPE Experts have concluded that BinoFi is a lucrative project for early investors and crypto enthusiasts. The project’s early adopters will ride the bullish wave in 2025 when BinoFi’s DeFi solutions go mainstream. Some believe early investors will witness more gains than Dogecoin and Pepe investors. Early adopters who purchase BINO tokens in BinoFi’s presale will join the project’s anticipated bullish wave in 2025. Dogecoin’s most recent updates show a further consolidation at $0.20 credited to a significant drop in active addresses. The addresses are down to 87k, a figure that has not been seen since Q4 of last year. BINO has just opened its first page on its ICO event and is distributing BINO tokens to investors at a set price of $0.02. The developers have already sold more than 3 million BINO tokens to early supporters showing the project’s great potential as 2025 unfolds. Analysts believe the project’s phase 1 will end soon paving the way for phase 2. The second phase will implement a slight increase in BINO’s retail price giving phase 1 investors their first unrealized gains. BinoFi anticipates a final price of $0.058 at the end of the last ICO phase. The project will finally launch with BINO tokens priced at $0.3 opening the project to trading liquidity and more retail investments.

41438667,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=709613,1741622407,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"This Analyst Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash From $91,000, Why It’s Far From Over",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-crash-from-91000/,"RLinda, a TradingView crypto analyst who predicted Bitcoin’s previous crash from $91,000, has shared another bearish forecast for the pioneer cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, more pain may be on the horizon for Bitcoin, as it is expected to plummet as low as $73,000. Bitcoin is currently struggling to maintain its former momentum as bearish factors dominate the market. According to RLinda, the cryptocurrency has entered a sell zone after failing to hold above the buying zone above $91,000, thus initiating a false resistance breakdown. Given its current bearish position, the analyst predicts a major crash to new lows for Bitcoin, anticipating an 11% decline to $73,000 soon. Bitcoin Price Set To Crash To $73,000 RLinda revealed that the market’s volatility was partially attributed to Donald Trump’s comments on the Federal Reserve. The market reacted to the US President’s statements with a global shake-up, causing liquidations across the crypto space. Related Reading: Bitcoin 9-Month Cycle Says It’s Not Over, Analyst Shows Where We Are In The Bull Run Additionally, the crypto summit, which was expected to spark bullish sentiment, did little to boost prices. Instead, it prevented the market from turning green. This market downturn has led to profit-taking by investors due to the lack of market and manipulation by big players. Based on the analyst’s price chart, Bitcoin is trading within the $90,000 – $82,000 range. The cryptocurrency dropped to this price after experiencing a slight price pump in late February. Following this increase, Bitcoin lost all of its gains and has since been aiming for a recovery. RLinda warns that if Bitcoin breaks below the $82,000 support level, it could experience a significant price breakdown towards $78,000 – $73,000. The TradingView analyst has highlighted $73,000 as the primary crash target, citing that Bitcoin is currently in a deep correction phase. With global growth temporarily suspended, RLinda revealed that the market is in dire need of liquidity. The analyst indicated that if the market’s growth relies too much on bullish leverage and new buyers without proper correction, it may become unstable. A correction phase, like the one Bitcoin is currently experiencing, may allow liquidity to reset and prepare the market for future upward movements. BTC Key Resistance And Support Zones RLinda has pinpointed key resistance and support levels for the Bitcoin price, sharing insights into potential reversal points. The TradingView analyst asserts that the price zone with the most interest and liquidity is $73,000 – $66,000. Related Reading: Legendary Analyst Peter Brandt Lists 6 Reasons Bitcoin Has Flipped Bullish While a breakdown to $66,000 may seem like a steep decline, it could serve as a critical area for market stabilization. Moreover, further bearish movements would be confirmed if Bitcoin drops below $82,000. Currently, the resistance levels to watch are $89,400, $91,000, and $93,000. Conversely, the support areas to take note of are $82,000, $78,000, and $73,000.

33767162,[object Object],1741622408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Here’s Why The Dogecoin Price Crashed Over 12% In The Last Day,https://bitcoinist.com/why-dogecoin-crashed-over-12/,"The Dogecoin price has crashed over 12% in the last day, providing a bearish outlook for the foremost meme coin. This price crash has occurred due to several factors including the bearish sentiment following the White House Crypto Summit. Why The Dogecoin Price Has Crashed Over 12% CoinMarketCap data shows that the Dogecoin price has crashed over 12% in the last day. This price decline follows the White House Crypto Summit , which sparked a bearish sentiment among crypto investors, leading to a wave of sell-offs. Investors seemed to have expected more from the first-ever summit, which failed to live up to the hype. It is worth mentioning that prior to the summit, US President Donald Trump had signed an executive order for the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. However, this bullish news wasn’t enough to prevent this price decline, suggesting that news was already priced in, possibly from when Trump won the presidential elections last year. Meanwhile, another reason for the Dogecoin price decline is the market uncertainty sparked by developments on the macro side including Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. Canada’s new Prime Minister Mark Carney has fueled this ongoing trade war by asserting that his country’s reciprocal tariffs on the US will remain. Another macro factor contributing to the Dogecoin price decline is US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s statement, in which he mentioned that the Committee is in no rush to cut interest rates. As such, it remains unlikely that the Fed will cut rates anytime soon, which is bearish for DOGE and other crypto assets, as investors will remain cautious about allocating their capital to these risk assets. DOGE Is Nearing A Crucial Support In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the Dogecoin price is nearing a crucial support level at the lower boundary of an ascending channel. He added that holding above $0.16 could fuel a strong rebound. The analyst had also recently mentioned that DOGE could rally to as high as $2.74 if it holds the support at $0.17. Amid this Dogecoin price crash, there are still some positives for the foremost meme coin. Martinez revealed that the number of active DOGE addresses has surged 270% in the last 24 hours, jumping from 71,750 to 264,000. Meanwhile, despite the recent decline, DOGE whales still look to be heavily bullish on the Dogecoin price. In another X post, Martinez revealed that the largest whales on the Dogecoin network have accumulated 1.7 billion DOGE in the last 72 hours, as they look to position for a bullish reversal. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.17, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Dogecoin|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin Address|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Donald Trump|Jerome Powell|Mark CarneyStrtegic Bitcoin Reserve|White House Crypto Submit,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-10 16:00:08

Japan is taking a significant leap forward in embracing digital assets. A groundbreaking proposal to amend the Payment Services Act has just been approved by the Japanese Cabinet and is now heading to the National Diet. This move signals a potentially transformative shift in how cryptocurrencies are treated in one of the world’s leading economies. For anyone involved in or observing the cryptocurrency space, this development in Japan crypto reform is definitely something to watch closely. What Does the Japan Crypto Reform Bill Mean for the Industry? While the full details of the bill are still under wraps, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan has confirmed its submission to the National Diet. Based on previous proposals from Japan’s ruling party, we can anticipate some potentially game-changing updates. Let’s break down what we know and what it could mean for the future of cryptocurrency in Japan and globally: Reclassification of Cryptocurrencies: One of the most anticipated changes is the potential exclusion of cryptocurrencies from being classified as securities. This is a major point in the Japan crypto reform discussions. Currently, the classification of digital assets can be complex and sometimes burdensome. If cryptocurrencies are no longer treated as securities, it could significantly simplify regulations and encourage innovation within the industry. Tax Relief on Crypto Gains: High taxes can stifle any market, and cryptocurrency is no exception. The proposed reduction of the capital gains tax rate on crypto transactions from a hefty 55% down to 20% is a monumental shift. This crypto tax Japan change is designed to make cryptocurrency investment and trading more attractive and competitive, potentially drawing in more investors and traders to the Japanese market. Clarity in Regulation: Ambiguity in regulations can create uncertainty and hinder growth. This Japan Payment Services Act amendment is expected to bring more clarity to the regulatory landscape. Clear rules of the game are crucial for businesses to operate confidently and for investors to feel secure. This clarity is a cornerstone of responsible crypto regulation Japan . Benefits of Japan’s Crypto Regulatory Changes These proposed reforms are not just about keeping up with the times; they are about strategically positioning Japan as a hub for cryptocurrency innovation and investment. Let’s explore some of the key benefits: Increased Investment and Market Activity: Lower taxes and clearer regulations are powerful magnets for investment. By reducing the crypto tax Japan burden and providing a more transparent regulatory environment, Japan is likely to see a surge in both domestic and international investment in the cryptocurrency sector. Boost to Innovation: When regulatory hurdles are reduced, innovation thrives. A less restrictive environment encourages startups and established companies to explore new applications of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. This could lead to Japan becoming a hotbed for crypto innovation. Enhanced Competitiveness: In the global race to attract crypto businesses and talent, clear and favorable regulations are a competitive advantage. Japan’s proactive approach to crypto regulation Japan could make it a more attractive destination compared to countries with less defined or more restrictive frameworks. Consumer Protection: While promoting innovation, effective Japan crypto reform also needs to consider consumer protection. Clarity in regulation can lead to safer and more reliable crypto services, ultimately benefiting users. Challenges and Considerations for Japan’s Crypto Future While the advancements in Japan crypto reform are promising, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations as Japan moves forward: Implementation and Enforcement: The effectiveness of any regulatory change hinges on its implementation and enforcement. Japan will need to ensure that the new regulations are effectively implemented and consistently enforced to achieve the desired outcomes. Global Regulatory Alignment: The cryptocurrency space is global by nature. Japan’s regulations will need to be mindful of international standards and strive for a degree of alignment with global regulatory trends to avoid creating friction or isolation. Market Volatility and Risks: Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. Even with improved regulations and lower crypto tax Japan , the inherent risks of the crypto market remain. Education and risk awareness will continue to be crucial for investors. Technological Evolution: The crypto landscape is constantly evolving. Regulations need to be adaptable and forward-looking to keep pace with technological advancements and emerging trends in the blockchain and digital asset space. Examples of Potential Impact Let’s consider some concrete examples of how these reforms could play out: Scenario Potential Impact of Japan Crypto Reform Startup Launching a New Crypto Exchange Simplified regulatory processes due to clearer guidelines under the revised Japan Payment Services Act . Lower crypto tax Japan for users could attract more trading volume. Institutional Investor Considering Crypto Allocation Greater confidence due to reduced regulatory uncertainty and a more favorable tax environment. The 20% capital gains tax makes crypto investments more appealing compared to the previous 55%. Individual Crypto Trader in Japan Significantly lower tax burden on profits from crypto trading.

For Crypto Businesses: Evaluate the potential of expanding or establishing operations in Japan. The evolving crypto regulation Japan landscape could offer a more favorable environment for growth. Prepare to adapt to the new regulatory framework once it’s finalized. For Policy Makers Globally: Observe Japan’s approach to crypto regulation Japan closely. The outcomes of these reforms could provide valuable lessons and insights for other countries considering their own crypto regulatory frameworks. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Japan and Crypto Japan’s move to reform its crypto regulations is a bold and potentially transformative step. By addressing key issues like crypto tax Japan and regulatory clarity through amendments to the Japan Payment Services Act and submission to the National Diet , Japan is signaling its commitment to fostering a vibrant and responsible cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The country has now allowed the use of Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) on licensed digital asset exchanges. This decision follows a growing demand for stablecoins in crypto trading and payments worldwide. Thailand Regulator Adds USDC, USDT Stablecoins With this approval, Thailand opens its doors to stablecoins, a crucial part of the global crypto market. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are widely used for trading, payments, and remittances due to their price stability. By adding USDT and USDC to its list of approved cryptocurrencies, alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Stellar, Thailand is expanding its digital asset ecosystem. This move not only enhances trading opportunities but also strengthens Thailand’s position as a growing hub for crypto adoption in Asia. The new regulations, set to take effect on March 16, will allow licensed exchanges to list and trade these stablecoins, making it easier for investors and traders to move funds within the crypto ecosystem. Thailand Aligns with Global Crypto Trends The decision to approve USDT and USDC comes after a public consultation held in February, where most participants supported the idea. Across regions like Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, stablecoins have gained popularity due to their reliability and ease of use in transactions. Tether alone contributes to around 40% of the total trading activity in the country. As of now, USDT holds a massive $142 billion market capitalization, while USDC follows with $58 billion. Push for Transparency The approval of Tether’s stablecoin comes at a time when the company is facing scrutiny over its financial transparency. Just last week, the company appointed Simon McWilliams as its Chief Financial Officer to address concerns regarding its financial audits. The company has been publishing quarterly reports verified by BDO Italy, but some critics argue that a full financial audit is needed.

Solana is currently trading at its lowest level since September 2024, with traders now concerned about a possible decline below $100. While historically low prices have often presented an opportunity to buy the dip and hence a rebound, below are the top three reasons why SOL price may fail to reach $200 this month. Here’s Why Solana Price May Not Reach $200 This Month Solana price today trades at $121 today after a drastic 9% drop in 24 hours as the crypto market crashed . In just one week, Solana has erased nearly $16 billion from its market capitalization, despite bullish news like SOL being included in a US digital assets stockpile. As Solana edges lower, here are the top 3 reasons why the price may fail to reach $200 in March 2025. Looming Death Cross One of the reasons why Solana price may not reach $200 this month is an approaching death cross. The 50-day SMA is nearing a bearish crossover with the 200-day SMA, which may increase the bearish momentum. Solana price has also breached a critical support level of $124. If this support fails to hold, SOL price faces a drop towards $110, which could pave the way for sub-$100 levels. With buyers failing to defend support due to a lack of conviction in a recovery, SOL may not reach $200 in March 2025. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Meme Coin Activity on PumpFun Fades The PumpFun platform played a major role in fuelling a Solana price rally earlier this year. However, this is no longer the case after a drastic decline in the total market cap of Solana meme coins as trader interest fades. Data from Dune Analytics shows that meme coin activity on the launchpad peaked between December 2024 and January 2025. However, in February and March, the level of activity dropped significantly. As fewer developers and traders interact with PumpFun, it supports a bearish Solana price prediction . PumpFun Monthly Volume Declining Social Dominance Could Impact Solana Price The level of social dominance around Solana has also plummeted to its lowest level in four months. This drop indicates that the engagement around SOL is diminishing as traders focus on other assets. This drop is contributing to reduced demand for the asset. Solana Social Dominance The reduced social buzz around SOL makes it harder for the altcoin to sustain a strong uptrend. Moreover, if retail traders are shifting their attention away from Solana, it can drain capital and liquidity from the altcoin, making it harder for it to rally. Given these factors that show that bearish trends are still prevalent in Solana price, the altcoin could fail to make a recovery past $200 this month. Nevertheless, the approaching deadline of a spot SOL ETF could offer a brief relief rally.

As blockchain projects evolve, only those with tangible value propositions will stand the test of time. Among the rising stars, BitLemons ($BLEM) is making waves with its innovative GambleFi model, competing alongside industry movers like Prosper (PROS), Solana (SOL), and Tron (TRX). But which of these coins has the potential to redefine the market and reward early investors the most? Is BitLemons the Crypto Jackpot? BitLemons isn’t just another token—it’s disrupting the $450 billion casino industry with a fully functional crypto casino that never sleeps. Unlike traditional gambling platforms, Bitlemons uses blockchain technology to create a fair, transparent, and high-reward ecosystem. With three exclusive in-house games—$BLEM Keno, Crash, and Wheel of Bitlemons—BitLemons maximizes revenue by cutting out costly third-party providers. This means higher margins and more substantial long-term value for investors. Momentum is at an all-time high—stage 1 of the BLEM presale sold out in 16 days. With Stage 2 nearly closed at $0.02 per BLEM and Stage 3 set to rise to $0.03, the clock is ticking for investors. Over $1.86 million has already been raised, with 85.27% of Stage 2 sold out. The roadmap is stacked with new games, user incentives, and strategic partnerships, and with whispers of major influencer and sports celebrity endorsements, Bitlemons could be heading for a breakout moment. Is PROS a Smart Bet on Predictive Markets? Prosper is gaining traction with its transition to Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), expanding its ecosystem and increasing transaction volumes. Investors have noticed a 66.19% surge in trading volume in the last 24 hours. PROS is at a critical technical level with key resistance at $0.55 and support at $0.52. If adoption continues and the infrastructure upgrades deliver, PROS could see a major breakout. But with limited real-world application beyond betting markets, can it compete with revenue-generating projects like Bitlemons? Is Solana Cementing Its Place as the DeFi King? Solana is no stranger to headlines. With its high transaction throughput and low fees, SOL remains a leader in the DeFi and DEX sectors. Its latest milestone? U.S. institutional crypto ETFs now include Solana, sparking renewed investor interest. Currently holding key support at around $150, with resistance at around $180, SOL’s price action is worth watching. Solana’s dominance could strengthen as the DeFi sector expands and institutional adoption grows. However, some investors remain cautious with the network’s past reliability issues. Can Tron’s Latest Bet Pay Off? Tron has always thrived on hype, and its founder, Justin Sun, keeps the momentum going. His recent $30 million investment in World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed crypto project, has fueled renewed interest in TRX. With support around $0.22 and resistance near $0.25, TRX is in a consolidation phase. Its focus on decentralized content-sharing and ongoing adoption could keep it relevant. However, without a strong revenue-sharing model like BitLemons, TRX lacks the passive income appeal investors crave. BitLemons Sets the Standard While all four projects have strong narratives, BitLemons presents a unique combination of revenue generation, deflationary tokenomics, and industry disruption. With a rapidly selling-out presale, a live casino, and major strategic partnerships on the horizon, $BLEM is positioned for exponential growth. Unlike speculative tokens, BitLemons offers a business-backed model where investors benefit directly from platform success.

Interestingly, the expert has even updated his XRP price prediction, stating that the crypto could reach $333. Expert Defends $280 XRP Price Prediction Dark Defender has defended his $280 XRP price prediction following criticisms from the crypto community. In an X post , the expert reacted to a post by another crypto expert who seemed to mock the prediction. He stated that the pattern is close to $280 but added that the precise Fibonacci level sits at $333, indicating that XRP could reach this price level. As CoinGape reported, Dark Defender had laid out a bullish XRP analysis yesterday, suggesting that the crypto could replicate its 2017 bull run performance again . His accompanying chart showed that the coin could reach as high as $280. However, based on his recent statement, XRP could surpass this price target and reach $333. One of the major criticisms regarding this XRP price prediction is the market cap, which the crypto would have to attain to reach this price target. For context, based on the crypto’s current circulating supply, XRP’s market cap would sit around $1.6 trillion if its price reaches $280. However, the expert suggested that the total market cap doesn’t matter in this regard. According to him, the total market cap doesn’t mean that much amount of money poured into the asset. He gave an example and then remarked that market cap in crypto is an illusion. An Insight Into The Current Price Action Amid this development, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has provided insights into the current XRP price action. The analyst noted that the crypto has witnessed a pullback from range highs back to prior flipped resistance levels, which should now act as support. He remarked that holding these levels as support would be incredibly bullish. However, if XRP loses this support zone, the analyst remarked that it is almost certain that the crypto will drop below $2 again, which he claimed would make for an “epic buy opportunity.” CrediBULL Crypto stated that it is a win-win situation regardless of what happens as far market participants stay patient and play the current price action correctly. As to what they could do correctly, the analyst advised market participants to do nothing as long as XRP holds this support zone and rise their spot bags to higher highs. If the XRP price drops below $2, he advised that they should look for potential long opportunities and spot buys below $2, starting at $1.80. Based on a CooinGape market analysis, XRP could soon rebound after the number of addresses and transaction count surged. Santiment data showed that weekly active addresses have surged to a record high above 1.15 million.

In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, BAYC, and MAYC NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Apecoin Symbol APE Current price $0.5060 Market cap $381.01M Trading volume $72.39M Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.4826 on Aug 5, 2024 24-hour high $0.5271 24-hour low $0.4656 APE price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 16.66% 50-day SMA $0.7656 200-day SMA $0.9790 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 20 (Extreme Greed) Green days 12/30 (40%) APE price analysis At the time of writing (March 10), APE’s price had dropped by 19.33% in one week and 1.87% in the last 24 hours, trading at approximately $0.507. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume rose by 178.88% in 24 hours. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APE/USD 1-day price chart APE fell below $1 in January. The bear run continued into February and March. The MACD histogram shows that the price is experiencing little momentum as the drop slows. The William Alligator trendlines show rising price volatility. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APE/USD 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s drop after it peaked at $1 in February. It registered continuous red candles that saw it fall to as low as $0.54. At current levels, the drop has slowed, and trades along a horizontal parallel channel. The direction of the next breakout is not apparent, however, the general market sentiment remains bearish.

APE price analysis shows the market has been bearish despite bullish activity in the last quarter of 2024, meaning the bears are now in control. Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or for settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal Apecoin price prediction March 2025 The APE March price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $1.15, with an average of $0.69.

Sony’s layer-2 network, Soneium, has just dropped a bombshell in the Web3 space. They’ve launched their highly anticipated Web3 entertainment robot NFT collection, featuring the adorable ‘aibo’, on the leading NFT marketplace, OpenSea . Minting is officially live, and the crypto world is buzzing with excitement. But what does this launch really mean for the future of NFTs and entertainment? Let’s dive in and explore everything you need to know about Soneium’s groundbreaking move. What Makes Soneium’s Web3 Entertainment Robot NFT Launch Sensational? Soneium, a layer-2 network backed by the tech giant Sony Group, is making waves with its foray into the NFT universe. This isn’t just another NFT drop; it’s a strategic move by a major player to explore the potential of Web3 for entertainment. The choice of ‘aibo’, Sony’s iconic robotic dog, as the subject of this Robot NFT collection is particularly noteworthy. Aibo is not just a robot; it’s a symbol of innovation and companionship, resonating with both tech enthusiasts and the general public. By bringing aibo into the Web3 realm, Soneium is bridging the gap between physical and digital collectibles, offering a unique proposition to NFT collectors. Here’s a breakdown of why this launch is generating so much buzz: Brand Recognition: Sony and aibo are globally recognized brands, lending instant credibility and appeal to the NFT collection. Innovation in Entertainment: This launch signals a significant step towards integrating NFTs into the broader entertainment industry. Layer-2 Network Advantage: Soneium being a layer-2 network implies potentially lower transaction fees and faster processing compared to main Ethereum network, making NFT minting and trading more accessible. OpenSea Marketplace: Launching on OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, provides immediate visibility and access to a vast community of NFT collectors and traders. Exploring the World of Web3 NFT and its Entertainment Potential The concept of Web3 NFT is still relatively new to many, but it represents a paradigm shift in how we perceive digital ownership and value. Unlike traditional digital assets, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique and verifiable on the blockchain, ensuring scarcity and authenticity. When combined with the principles of Web3 – decentralization, openness, and greater user control – NFTs unlock exciting possibilities, especially within the entertainment sector. Benefits of Web3 NFTs in Entertainment: Benefit Description Enhanced Fan Engagement NFTs can offer exclusive access, experiences, and rewards to fans, fostering a deeper connection with their favorite brands and content. New Revenue Streams NFTs create novel monetization opportunities for creators and entertainment companies, beyond traditional models like advertising and subscriptions. Digital Ownership and Collectibles NFTs empower users to truly own digital assets, fostering a vibrant market for digital collectibles and art. Interoperability and Metaverse Integration Web3 NFTs can potentially be used across different platforms and metaverses, enhancing their utility and value. Why Choose a Soneium NFT? The Unique Appeal of aibo Robot NFTs In a crowded NFT market, what makes Soneium NFT collections stand out? The answer lies in the inherent charm and legacy of the aibo robot. Aibo, first introduced by Sony in 1999, is more than just a gadget; it’s a symbol of robotic companionship and technological advancement. Owning an aibo NFT is not just about possessing a digital collectible; it’s about owning a piece of technological history and participating in the evolution of digital pets in the Web3 era. Key Features of aibo Robot NFTs: Nostalgia and Innovation: Aibo blends nostalgia for a beloved robotic pet with cutting-edge Web3 technology. Unique Digital Art: Each aibo NFT is likely to be a unique digital artwork, potentially with varying traits and rarities. Community and Utility: Soneium may introduce community benefits and utilities for aibo NFT holders, further enhancing their value. Entry into the Sony Ecosystem: Owning a Soneium NFT could potentially offer access to future experiences and products within the broader Sony ecosystem. Navigating the OpenSea NFT Marketplace for Soneium’s aibo Collection OpenSea is the go-to platform for many NFT enthusiasts, and Soneium’s choice to launch their OpenSea NFT collection here is a strategic move to tap into a massive and active market. For those new to OpenSea, navigating the marketplace might seem a bit daunting at first. Here’s a quick guide to get you started: Connect your Wallet: You’ll need a Web3 wallet like MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet to interact with OpenSea. Connect your wallet to the platform. Browse the Collection: Search for “Soneium aibo” or navigate to Soneium’s official OpenSea page to find the collection. Explore NFTs: Browse the available aibo NFTs, check their traits, rarity, and prices. Mint or Buy: If minting is still live, you can mint a new aibo NFT. Alternatively, you can purchase NFTs already listed for sale by other users. Secure Transactions: Always ensure you are interacting with the official Soneium collection on OpenSea to avoid scams. Verify the contract address and official links. Challenges and Future of Entertainment NFTs like Soneium’s aibo While the launch of Entertainment NFT collections like Soneium’s aibo is incredibly exciting, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and the road ahead. The NFT market is still evolving, and factors like market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and mainstream adoption remain crucial considerations. Challenges for Entertainment NFTs: Market Volatility: The NFT market can be highly volatile, and the value of NFTs can fluctuate significantly. Gas Fees and Scalability: Transaction fees (gas fees) on some blockchains can be high, impacting accessibility. Layer-2 solutions like Soneium are aiming to address this. Understanding and Adoption: Educating the broader public about the value and utility of NFTs is crucial for wider adoption. Sustainability Concerns: The environmental impact of some blockchains (though less so for layer-2 solutions and newer blockchains) is a growing concern. Despite these challenges, the future of entertainment NFTs looks bright. As technology evolves and adoption grows, we can expect to see even more innovative and engaging NFT experiences emerge, blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds. Actionable Insights: Getting Involved with Soneium’s aibo NFTs Interested in diving into the world of Soneium’s aibo Web3 entertainment robot NFTs ?

Start Small: If you’re new to NFTs, consider starting with a smaller investment to learn the ropes.
