44253544,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157759,1746573607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Accusation: Trump Crypto Ventures Labeled ‘Open Corruption’ by US Congressman,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-crypto-open-corruption/,"The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to controversy, but when it intersects directly with high-profile political figures, the temperature rises dramatically. Recent comments from a U.S. Congressman regarding Trump crypto ventures have ignited a fiery debate, bringing accusations of misconduct and conflicts of interest squarely into the digital asset space. This isn’t just about technology; it’s about ethics, transparency, and the potential entanglement of personal financial interests with public service. Why Are Trump’s Crypto Ventures Raising Concerns? The spotlight has recently intensified on the various digital asset activities linked to former President Donald Trump and his family. These ventures include the launch of non-fungible token (NFT) collections and, more recently, speculation surrounding a meme coin allegedly tied to the Trump brand or family, often referred to as the Donald Trump meme coin (DJT). While some see these as savvy business moves or innovative ways to engage supporters, others, like U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, view them through a much more critical lens. In a candid interview with DL News, Representative Gerry Connolly , a Democrat from Virginia, did not mince words. He described the involvement of Trump and his family in these cryptocurrency endeavors as amounting to nothing less than “open corruption.” This is a significant accusation, suggesting a blatant disregard for ethical boundaries rather than mere potential conflicts. Connolly’s concerns stem from a broader view of Trump’s political career, particularly referencing the initial period of his presidency. He stated that the first 100 days of the Trump administration were “rife with conflicts of interest.” This historical context is crucial because it frames the current crypto activities not as isolated incidents but as part of a pattern where personal financial interests are perceived to potentially influence or benefit from public position or political power. What Constitutes ‘Open Corruption’ in This Context? When a figure like Gerry Connolly uses a term as strong as “open corruption,” it implies more than just a conflict of interest; it suggests a situation where private gain is openly prioritized or pursued through means enabled by political influence or status. In the context of Trump crypto activities, the accusation likely revolves around several key points: Leveraging Political Status: Using the former President’s name, brand, and political following to promote and potentially profit from digital assets like NFTs and meme coins. The value of such assets is often heavily reliant on hype, speculation, and the perceived endorsement of the associated figure. Lack of Transparency: Questions surrounding the ownership, control, and financial beneficiaries of these crypto ventures. Who truly profits? Is it Donald Trump directly, his family members, or associated entities? The opaque nature of some crypto projects can exacerbate these concerns. Potential for Market Manipulation: The significant influence a figure like Trump holds means any comments or actions related to a specific coin or NFT project could drastically impact its value, potentially benefiting insiders or creators at the expense of retail investors. Preferential Treatment Allegations: Connolly also cited “preferential treatment given to figures in the digital asset industry.” This suggests concerns that the Trump administration, or a future one, might favor specific individuals or companies within the crypto space, potentially those connected to or supportive of Trump’s ventures, leading to unfair advantages or policy decisions. These points collectively paint a picture where the lines between political activity, personal branding, and financial gain in the unregulated or lightly regulated crypto market become dangerously blurred. The accusation of “open corruption” highlights the perceived lack of effort to conceal these potential conflicts. Exploring the Donald Trump Meme Coin Phenomenon The emergence and subsequent volatility surrounding the Donald Trump meme coin , often symbolized by the ticker DJT, perfectly encapsulate the controversial intersection of politics and speculative digital assets. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes or popular culture, often lacking underlying fundamental value and driven primarily by community hype and social media trends. The DJT coin specifically gained traction amid rumors of a direct endorsement or launch by Donald Trump or his son, Barron Trump. While the origins and official connection remain debated and somewhat murky, the coin’s value has been heavily influenced by speculation tied to the Trump name. This situation raises profound questions about: Investor Protection: Meme coins are notoriously volatile and risky. If a political figure promotes or is perceived to be associated with such an asset, it could draw in unsuspecting retail investors who might be swayed by the political connection rather than understanding the inherent financial risks. Political Ethics: Should political figures, especially those who have held or seek public office, be involved in promoting highly speculative assets where their influence can directly impact market value? Regulatory Challenges: How do existing financial regulations or potential future crypto regulation apply to assets tied to political figures? The current regulatory landscape is still evolving, making these situations particularly complex to address. The DJT meme coin saga serves as a live example of the challenges Gerry Connolly and others are pointing to when discussing conflicts of interest and potential corruption in the digital asset space. The Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation The controversy surrounding Trump crypto activities is not just about one individual; it has significant implications for the ongoing debate around crypto regulation in the United States. As more political figures engage with or launch their own digital assets, the pressure on lawmakers and regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC to establish clear rules increases. Here are some potential implications: Increased Scrutiny: Political involvement in crypto will likely lead to greater scrutiny from regulators, ethics watchdogs, and the public. This could accelerate calls for stricter rules on transparency, disclosure, and potential conflicts of interest for public officials dealing with digital assets. Defining Digital Assets: The nature of assets like NFTs and meme coins challenges existing definitions. Are they securities? Commodities? Collectibles? The regulatory response will depend heavily on these classifications. Political Polarization of Crypto: As crypto becomes intertwined with political figures, it risks becoming another politically polarized issue, potentially hindering bipartisan efforts to create sensible regulation. Focus on Market Integrity: Allegations of preferential treatment or potential market manipulation related to political figures’ crypto ventures highlight the need for regulations that protect market integrity and prevent abuse of influence. Gerry Connolly’s strong words reflect a growing concern among some policymakers about the potential for the digital asset space to be exploited for personal gain by those in positions of power. This concern could directly influence the direction and speed of future crypto regulation efforts. Navigating the Intersection of Politics and Digital Assets The entanglement of politics and digital assets presents a complex landscape for everyone involved – politicians, regulators, investors, and the crypto industry itself. While proponents argue that political engagement can bring mainstream attention and potentially favorable policies to the crypto space, critics warn of the inherent risks when personal financial interests collide with public duty. Key challenges and considerations include: Challenge Description Transparency & Disclosure Lack of clear rules on when and how politicians must disclose crypto holdings or affiliations. Conflict of Interest Situations where a politician’s personal crypto investments could influence their policy decisions or public statements. Market Integrity Risk of market manipulation or unfair advantage due to a politician’s influence or access to information. Public Trust Erosion of public trust if political figures are seen as using their position to profit from speculative assets. The accusations leveled by Gerry Connolly underscore the urgent need for clarity and ethical guidelines governing the interaction between politics and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Whether it’s the specifics of the Donald Trump meme coin or broader involvement in the sector, the political implications are significant. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Political Ethics and Crypto Representative Gerry Connolly’s blunt assessment that Trump crypto ventures constitute “open corruption” highlights a critical and increasingly visible challenge: the ethical boundaries for political figures engaging with speculative digital assets. The controversy surrounding activities like the Donald Trump meme coin brings to the forefront concerns about conflicts of interest, transparency, market integrity, and the potential for political status to be leveraged for personal financial gain. As the crypto market continues to evolve and gain mainstream attention, the interaction between digital assets and politics will remain a focal point. The strong reactions from figures like Gerry Connolly signal that policymakers are watching and that calls for clear rules and ethical standards for politicians involved in crypto are likely to grow louder. How this tension between political engagement and the need for ethical conduct and robust crypto regulation is resolved will significantly shape both the future of digital assets and public trust in government.

SHIB bulls and bears are battling with almost equal strength. A 29 trillion SHIB trap could determine Shiba Inu’s next direction. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum’s well-known meme coin, has entered a critical trading zone. With prices hovering around the $0.000012 mark, both bullish and bearish traders are closely watching for its next significant move. This level puts SHIB at a point where neither side has clear control, meaning the next price swing could heavily influence the token’s path in the coming weeks or months. $0.000012: A Key Technical Level for SHIB From a technical perspective, the $0.000012 level is a notable support for SHIB, considering how often the price has tested it. The level’s importance also means it could quickly turn into a strong resistance point if the price decisively breaks and stays below it. Because of this, market analysts are looking closely at other indicators to understand SHIB’s current price action.

Per the South Korean newspaper Hanguk Kyungjae , Lee made a series of pledges to younger voters while speaking at an event in North Chungcheong Province on May 6. The candidate said: “I will create a safer environment for investment. That will help young people build up their assets and plan for the future.” South Korean Presidential Frontrunner: I Will Legalize BTC ETFs Lee said his government would institutionalize crypto spot ETFs. He also said that he would build an integrated monitoring system to police the crypto sector.

He said that he would “bring about a reduction in crypto transaction fees.” It is unclear at this stage exactly how Lee would seek to fulfil this promise. In South Korea, crypto exchanges are currently free to set transaction fees as they see fit. However, Lee’s government, should he win on June 3, could theoretically seek to impose a cap on exchange transaction fees. In recent months, exchanges like Bithumb have sought to boost trading volumes by offering their clients commission-free trading for limited periods. These promotions have proved enormously popular among South Korean traders, with Lee’s camp possibly taking note. Candidates Courting Younger Voters? Money Today reported that analysts think Lee is trying to win over younger voters by making manifesto pledges about “issues that are very important to young people.” Lee has been relatively quiet on crypto-related policy matters in the lead up to June’s poll. May 6’s comments are the first time he has spoken about his crypto stance on the campaign trail. Lee Jae-myung, candidate for the South Korean presidency, speaking at an event in a market in North Chungcheong Province on May 6. (Source: Chuncheon MBC News/Screenshot) It is likely that his comments are a response to recent crypto pledges from Lee’s main rival in the polls, the ruling People Power Party (PPP)’s candidate Kim Moon-soon. Earlier this month, Kim pledged to let South Korea’s state pension fund and the sovereign wealth fund make direct crypto investments . The PPP has also rolled out seven crypto-related manifesto pledges ahead of June 3 . The party says it plans to do away with restrictive banking rules for crypto exchanges. How Sincere Are Crypto Manifesto Pledges? Skeptics will likely cast a cautious eye on the two candidates’ comments. Hanguk Kyungjae noted that Lee’s Democratic Party pledged to green-light crypto spot ETFs ahead of last year’s legislative elections. The newspaper wrote: “Although the party won a landslide victory in the election, there has been no significant progress made on the matter since then.” Lee promised to build a “society that gives opportunities to young people.” He added: “A society that neglects young people will only regress.” DPK intensifies impeachment threats against Supreme Court justices https://t.co/eG9i8HvCqO — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 6, 2025 Recent opinion polls put Lee around 20 percentage points ahead of Kim, with almost 50% of popular support. The election was sparked by the recent impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who unsuccessfully attempted to declare martial law in December 2024.

His startup, NewLimit , focused on developing treatments to reverse the effects of aging, has just announced a substantial funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in its ambitious goal of extending healthy human lifespan. What is NewLimit and Why the Buzz? Founded over four years ago by Brian Armstrong, former GV partner Blake Bryers, and stem cell professor Jacob Kimmel, NewLimit is not your typical crypto venture. Instead, it operates at the frontier of genetic reprogramming, aiming to revitalize aged cells and restore their youthful functions. The company believes it can increase how long people live a healthy life by manipulating cellular genetics. The recent buzz surrounds their impressive Series B funding round, which successfully raised $130 million. This follows a $40 million Series A two years prior, demonstrating accelerated progress and growing investor interest. The round was led by prominent venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, with participation from notable investors like Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, Dimension Capital, Elad Gil, and Patrick Collison. Progress Towards Age Reversal NewLimit claims to have made considerable strides in its research. Blake Bryers shared insights into their progress, revealing the discovery of three prototype medicines specifically designed to reprogram liver cells. Lab experiments reportedly show that this rejuvenation process can restore the cells’ ability to process fat and alcohol, mirroring the function of younger cells. How do they measure this? Bryers explained they compare how cells from younger and older individuals respond to substances. An older liver cell treated with NewLimit’s epigenetic reprogramming techniques begins to behave more like a younger cell. Leveraging AI in Biotech A key component of NewLimit’s strategy is the integration of artificial intelligence into their drug discovery process. While human trials are still several years away, the company is actively developing new anti-aging medicines using an AI model. This AI model allows NewLimit to simulate numerous experiments computationally, drastically narrowing down the potential candidates. Only the most promising machine-generated drugs are then moved to laboratory testing. Data gathered from these lab experiments is fed back into the AI model, refining its capabilities in a process dubbed a ‘lab in a loop’. This approach significantly accelerates the identification of potential treatments for age reversal . The Road Ahead and the Competitive Landscape Despite the promising early results, NewLimit acknowledges that the path to human trials is still long, estimated to be a few years away. The current focus remains on leveraging AI and lab research to identify and develop more effective treatments. NewLimit operates in an increasingly competitive field. Other well-funded startups are also tackling the challenge of extending lifespan through biotech . Notably, Retro Biosciences, backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, raised $180 million and is reportedly seeking a $1 billion Series A. Altos Labs, which launched with an impressive $3 billion in 2022, also counts prominent figures like Jeff Bezos among its backers. This highlights the significant capital and talent flowing into the longevity space. Why is Brian Armstrong Investing in Age Reversal? For readers primarily interested in crypto, Brian Armstrong ‘s involvement in NewLimit might seem like a departure. However, it reflects a trend among tech billionaires to invest wealth and resources into ambitious, long-term projects addressing fundamental human challenges, such as health and longevity. It demonstrates a diversification of interests beyond the core crypto business, focusing on potentially transformative scientific breakthroughs that could have profound impacts on society. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future NewLimit’s successful $130 million funding round is a significant milestone in the pursuit of age reversal . Backed by prominent investors and led by figures like Brian Armstrong , the company is pushing the boundaries of biotech and AI to develop treatments that could fundamentally alter the human experience by extending healthy life. While the journey is still in its early stages, the progress reported by NewLimit offers a compelling glimpse into a future where cellular rejuvenation and enhanced longevity might become realities.

44254254,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157761,1746574802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Solana Name Service Gets Powerful New SNS Token from Bonfida,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-name-service-sns-token/,"The world of decentralized identity and human-readable addresses on the blockchain is constantly evolving. If you’re involved in the Solana ecosystem, you’ve likely encountered the Solana Name Service , which allows users to replace complex wallet addresses with simple, memorable .sol domain names. Now, a significant development is unfolding within this vital infrastructure, spearheaded by the team at Bonfida. Understanding the Solana Name Service Before diving into the new token, let’s quickly recap what the Solana Name Service (SNS) is all about. Think of it as the DNS (Domain Name System) for the Solana blockchain. Instead of sharing a long string of characters for your wallet address, you can register a .sol domain, like ‘yourname.sol’. This makes sending and receiving transactions much easier and more user-friendly. The SNS ecosystem has grown steadily, facilitating easier interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets across Solana. It’s a crucial piece of the puzzle for mass adoption, making crypto feel less intimidating for everyday users. Why a Dedicated SNS Token ? The Shift from FIDA For a while, the Solana Name Service was closely associated with Bonfida’s native token, FIDA. Bonfida, a decentralized exchange built on Solana, was instrumental in developing and launching SNS. However, as the SNS ecosystem matured, the team identified a need for a dedicated token that could more directly serve the community and governance needs of .sol domain holders. According to Bonfida’s announcement, the FIDA token, while valuable for the broader Bonfida platform and its DEX features, didn’t fully align with the specific requirements and future vision for SNS governance and community incentives. This led to the strategic decision to introduce a new, purpose-built token: SNS. The introduction of the SNS token marks a pivot towards empowering the community directly involved with the naming service itself. It’s designed to be the primary driver for governance and participation within the SNS ecosystem going forward. FIDA vs. SNS: A Quick Look To clarify the distinction and the shift in focus, here’s a simple comparison: Feature FIDA (Previous Role in SNS) SNS (New Role for SNS Ecosystem) Primary Utility Bonfida DEX features, Staking, some SNS integration Governance for SNS, Ecosystem incentives, Future SNS-specific utility Governance Focus Broader Bonfida platform decisions Specific proposals and direction for the Solana Name Service Community Alignment Bonfida users .sol domain holders and SNS participants Future Development Remains core to Bonfida platform Foundation for future Solana Name Service features and growth While FIDA will retain limited utility within the Bonfida ecosystem, the SNS token is positioned as the cornerstone for the future development and community engagement of the Solana Name Service. Benefits for .sol Domains Holders So, what does this mean if you own one or more .sol domains ? The introduction of the SNS token is primarily aimed at benefiting the very users who make up the Solana Name Service community – the .sol domain holders. The core benefit revolves around governance. Holding SNS tokens is expected to grant holders voting rights on proposals related to the future of the Solana Name Service. This could include decisions on: Feature development for SNS Changes to domain registration or renewal processes Allocation of ecosystem funds Integrations with other Solana protocols This shift empowers the community, giving them a direct voice in shaping the service they use and rely on. It aligns the incentives, ensuring that those invested in the success and utility of their .sol domains also have a stake in the governance and evolution of the underlying service. Beyond governance, the SNS token may also introduce new ways for holders to participate in and benefit from the ecosystem, potentially through staking mechanisms or other incentive programs designed to encourage active participation and network health. Exploring Bonfida ‘s Role and Vision Bonfida’s decision to launch the SNS token demonstrates their continued commitment to the Solana ecosystem, particularly the infrastructure layer provided by the Solana Name Service. As the initial developer of SNS, Bonfida is facilitating this transition to a more community-governed model for the naming service. This move aligns with the broader trend in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 towards greater decentralization and community ownership. By separating the governance of SNS from the core Bonfida DEX token (FIDA), Bonfida is enabling the SNS community to forge its own path and priorities, fostering a more focused and engaged user base for the naming service itself. Bonfida will likely play a crucial role in the initial distribution and technical implementation of the SNS token and the new governance framework, guiding the ecosystem through this significant transition. The Growing Landscape of Crypto Domain Names The introduction of the SNS token also highlights the increasing importance of Crypto Domain Names in the digital asset space. Services like Solana Name Service (.sol), Ethereum Name Service (ENS, .eth), Unstoppable Domains (.crypto, .nft, etc.), and others are building the foundational layer for a more human-friendly decentralized web. These naming services are not just about simplifying addresses; they are becoming digital identities, linking profiles, avatars, and other data to a single, easy-to-remember name. The move by Bonfida to give the SNS community its own governance token underscores the value and distinct identity that these naming ecosystems are developing. As the space of Crypto Domain Names matures, we can expect increased competition, innovation, and potentially more specialized governance models like the one being implemented for the Solana Name Service. How to Engage with the SNS Ecosystem For existing .sol domain holders or those interested in acquiring one and participating in the ecosystem, here are some actionable steps and considerations: Stay Informed: Follow Bonfida and Solana Name Service official channels for announcements regarding the SNS token distribution, claiming process (if any for .sol holders), and governance portal launch. Understand Governance: Learn how the proposed governance model for the SNS token will work. Your SNS tokens will give you a voice in future decisions. Acquiring .sol Domains: If you don’t have one yet, you can register .sol domains through platforms integrated with the Solana Name Service. Owning a domain is key to being part of the core community. Explore Utility: Look for dApps and wallets on Solana that integrate with SNS, using your .sol domain for transactions or identity. Potential Challenges Ahead While the launch of the SNS token is a positive step towards decentralization and community empowerment, challenges may arise. These could include: Ensuring fair and wide distribution of the SNS token. Engaging the community effectively in governance participation. Maintaining the security and stability of the SNS infrastructure during and after the transition. Navigating potential complexities in the relationship between the SNS ecosystem and the broader Bonfida platform. Successfully addressing these challenges will be crucial for the long-term health and growth of the Solana Name Service under its new token-governed structure. Conclusion Bonfida’s introduction of a dedicated SNS token for the Solana Name Service marks an exciting evolution. By shifting governance power and incentives specifically to the community of .sol domain holders, the team is fostering a more focused, engaged, and decentralized ecosystem for human-readable addresses on Solana. This move not only strengthens the Solana Name Service itself but also highlights the growing significance and distinct value of Crypto Domain Names within the broader Web3 landscape. It’s a clear signal that the future of digital identity on Solana will be increasingly shaped by the hands of its users.

The program, revealed Tuesday, allows individual and corporate users to borrow cash using Bitcoin as collateral without selling the asset. Mallers wrote on X that people shouldn’t have to sell the best-performing asset to access cash. The entrepreneur, who recently took the helm at Twenty-One Capital, a rival to Tether-backed Strategy, emphasized that the offering allows users to unlock the value of their Bitcoin holdings without liquidating them. Strike targets wealthy clients with high-value, credit-free Bitcoin loans The new Strike Lending product will first launch in specific U.S. markets and be followed by an international expansion. The offering is tailored for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. It provides 12-month loans from $75,000 to $2 million at a minimum 12% APR interest rate with the option to pay monthly or to pay back the full interest and loan balance at the end of the 12-month term. It is also worth mentioning that Strike will offer no origination or early repayment fees. These Bitcoin-backed loans will not go on credit reports and have no bearing on credit scores. To provide competitive terms, Strike works with third-party capital providers that have been vetted and who retain the collateral during the loan term. However, Strike remains legally responsible for the collateral the whole time. Strike’s launch comes amid a broader resurgence in crypto credit markets, which are recovering from the dramatic 2022 downturn that saw major players like BlockFi, Celsius, and Genesis collapse. While the sector remains below its 2021 peak—down 43% from the $64.4 billion high, according to Galaxy Research —lenders such as Coinbase and Xapo have recently expanded their offerings. As of Q4 2024, centralized finance (CeFi) leaders Tether, Galaxy, and Ledn collectively hold loan books worth $9.9 billion, comprising nearly 89% of the CeFi market and 27% of the broader crypto lending ecosystem, which includes crypto-collateralized CDP stablecoins. Bitcoin loans redefine financial products as Strike expands into crypto lending Bitcoin loans represent a shift toward expanding how the world’s largest digital asset can be used as a financial product. By offering liquidity without exchanging ownership of the coin, borrowers gain liquidity and maintain their exposure to Bitcoin. Strike is positioning itself as a modern alternative for accessing liquidity during what appears to be a bullish phase for Bitcoin and digital assets. As Mallers pointed out, “If #bitcoin continues to grow faster than your borrowing costs, your asset appreciates faster than your debt.” The growing demand for on-chain lending is also evident in Ethereum, where the decentralized lending sector now exceeds $34 billion. This launch also coincides with Mallers’ recent appointment as CEO of Twenty-One Capital , a Bitcoin-focused financial firm backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. With Mallers now leading both Strike and Twenty-One Capital, questions about potential synergies between Strike’s lending service and a larger Bitcoin financing strategy are emerging.

44254537,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157762,1746575458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US CBDC Rejection: Treasury Secretary Calls Digital Dollar Plan a Sign of Weakness,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-cbdc-treasury-rejection/,"Big news dropped recently concerning the potential future of money in the United States. The conversation around a US CBDC , or Central Bank Digital Currency, has been ongoing, but a recent statement from a high-ranking official has certainly stirred the pot. According to reports, the US Treasury Secretary has expressed a clear lack of support for the idea of the Federal Reserve issuing its own digital currency. What Did the US Treasury Secretary Say About the Digital Dollar? The core of the recent report, initially shared by Watcher Guru on X, is the stance attributed to the US Treasury Secretary . The Secretary reportedly stated a lack of support for the Federal Reserve moving forward with a central bank digital currency . Even more pointedly, the concept was described as a “sign of weakness.” This isn’t just a casual comment; it’s a significant signal from a key figure in the nation’s financial leadership. This statement adds a notable voice to the ongoing debate surrounding the creation of a digital dollar . While the Federal Reserve has been researching and discussing the possibility, indicating no immediate plans but exploring the technology and implications, this Treasury perspective introduces a strong note of caution, if not outright opposition, from the executive branch’s financial arm. Why is a Federal Reserve Digital Currency Being Discussed? The idea of a Federal Reserve digital currency stems from several factors driving central banks worldwide to consider their own digital money. These include: The rise of private digital currencies: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins have highlighted public interest in digital forms of money, prompting central banks to consider offering a state-backed alternative. Improving payment systems: Proponents argue a CBDC could potentially offer faster, cheaper, and more efficient payment systems compared to existing infrastructure. Financial inclusion: A digital dollar could theoretically provide easier access to financial services for unbanked or underbanked populations. Maintaining monetary sovereignty: In an increasingly digital and globalized financial landscape, some argue a CBDC is necessary for a central bank to effectively implement monetary policy and maintain control over its currency’s ecosystem. International competitiveness: As other nations explore or launch their own CBDCs, there’s a concern the US could fall behind in financial innovation without its own US CBDC . Despite these potential motivations, the path to creating a digital dollar in the U.S. is complex and faces numerous hurdles. Is a US CBDC a Sign of Weakness, and Why? The Treasury Secretary’s characterization of a Federal Reserve digital currency as a “sign of weakness” is particularly noteworthy and warrants deeper examination. While the specific reasoning behind this phrasing wasn’t detailed in the initial report, we can infer potential arguments that align with such a view: Undermining the Existing System: Critics argue that introducing a CBDC could disrupt the existing two-tiered banking system, potentially drawing deposits away from commercial banks and concentrating financial power with the central bank. This could be seen as a sign of weakness in the private banking sector or an overreach by the government. Privacy Concerns: A government-issued digital currency raises significant privacy concerns. Opponents fear it could enable unprecedented government surveillance of citizens’ financial transactions, which some might view as a characteristic of less free or weaker societies where individual privacy is compromised. Competition with Private Innovation: The U.S. has a strong history of private sector innovation in payments and finance. Some argue that a government-backed digital dollar could stifle this innovation or unfairly compete with private stablecoins and payment solutions, implying a lack of confidence in the market’s ability to evolve on its own. Security Risks: Centralizing a nation’s currency infrastructure into a single digital system could create a massive, attractive target for cyberattacks, potentially exposing the country to significant financial instability – arguably a sign of systemic vulnerability or weakness. Necessity and Justification: Some argue that the U.S. already has efficient digital payment systems (like credit cards, apps, etc.) and that the stated benefits of a CBDC do not outweigh the significant costs and risks. Pursuing a CBDC without a clear, compelling need could be seen as an unnecessary and potentially destabilizing endeavor, perhaps indicative of a weak rationale. These points highlight that the “sign of weakness” comment likely reflects concerns about potential negative impacts on the existing financial structure, individual liberties, market dynamics, or national security, rather than weakness in the technology itself. Comparing the Digital Dollar Debate: Pros vs. Cons The debate around a central bank digital currency in the U.S. is multifaceted, involving a wide range of potential benefits and significant challenges. Here’s a simplified comparison: Potential Benefits (Arguments For) Potential Challenges (Arguments Against) Faster & Cheaper Payments Privacy Concerns & Surveillance Risk Increased Financial Inclusion Cybersecurity & Systemic Risk Enhanced Monetary Policy Tools Disruption to Commercial Banking International Competitiveness Implementation Costs & Complexity Potential for Innovation Stifling Private Sector Innovation The statement from the US Treasury Secretary clearly aligns more with the “Challenges” column, emphasizing potential downsides over perceived benefits. What Does This Mean for the Future of a US CBDC? The opinion of the US Treasury Secretary carries significant weight within the executive branch and influences policy discussions. While the Federal Reserve operates independently, its decisions on something as monumental as issuing a Federal Reserve digital currency would undoubtedly involve extensive consultation and consideration of views from across the government, including the Treasury. This public stance suggests a high-level resistance within the current administration towards the concept of a digital dollar . It doesn’t necessarily kill the idea entirely, as research and debate will likely continue, but it certainly places a significant political hurdle in its path. It signals that any proposal for a US CBDC would face strong opposition from at least one key financial leader. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and those following the evolution of digital finance, this development is crucial. It underscores the complex political and economic considerations at play beyond just the technological feasibility of a central bank digital currency . It also highlights that the U.S. approach to digital money may continue to favor private sector innovation (like stablecoins) over a direct government-issued alternative, at least for now. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? Given this development, here are a few things to keep an eye on: Further Statements: Will other government officials or Federal Reserve governors echo or counter this sentiment? Legislative Action: Will Congress take steps to either prohibit or authorize the exploration/creation of a digital dollar ? Several bills related to this topic have already been introduced. Federal Reserve Research: How will the Fed’s ongoing research and publications reflect or respond to this high-level feedback? Global Developments: Will progress or issues with CBDCs in other countries influence the U.S. debate? Private Sector Innovation: Will the focus shift further towards regulating and integrating private stablecoins as the primary form of digital dollar in the U.S.? The landscape for a US CBDC remains uncertain, but this recent statement provides a strong indication of the challenges it faces at the highest levels of government. Compelling Summary: The Digital Dollar Debate Takes a Negative Turn In summary, the reported statement from the US Treasury Secretary , rejecting the notion of a Federal Reserve digital currency and labeling it a “sign of weakness,” marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate. It introduces a powerful voice of opposition from within the executive branch, adding complexity to the Federal Reserve’s exploration of a central bank digital currency . While the potential benefits of a digital dollar are discussed, concerns surrounding privacy, financial stability, and market impact appear to be weighing heavily on some key decision-makers. This development suggests that the path towards a US CBDC is likely to be challenging and highlights the deep divisions that exist regarding the role of government in the future of digital money.

Despite ongoing market fluctuations, the cryptocurrency continues to hold key levels, maintaining a bullish path toward the $5 target. Elliott Wave Maps Out XRP Price Path To $5 XForceGlobal, a Certified Elliott Wave analyst, recently shared a medium-timeframe Elliott Wave analysis of XRP, focusing on its price action and wave structure. According to the analyst, XRP remains on a bullish path, indicating a strong potential for upward movement toward the $5.4 target. Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Above ‘Magic Line’ With Bullish Continuation Toward $3 The price chart shows that XRP is in the final stages of a complex corrective pattern and is poised to enter a powerful third-wave rally. The current wave structure indicates that XRP is forming a “1-2 scenario,” with the next Wave 3 expected to launch its price significantly higher. XForceGlobal has outlined a Fibonacci Retracement zone between the $2.00 and $1.80 range as a potential entry point, with price action showing resilience near this area. The critical price level to watch for XRP is the regional low at $1.60, which acts as the most important support level that would determine the cryptocurrency’s next move. This support level is because if XRP’s price remains above it, its projected bullish scenario and current structure remain intact. On the other hand, if the price drops below it, the trend could shift bearish, potentially invalidating the bullish outlook. With $1.60 acting as a strong support foundation, XForceGlobal projects that XRP could soon surge past $3.20 and potentially reach $5.40 in the coming months. This would mark a new all-time high for XRP, representing a 40.63% increase from its current ATH of $3.84. $2.18 Flagged As Key Breakout Level For The Altcoin Sharing a similar bullish forecast, Bitcoin Benny, a crypto analyst, has shared a technical analysis of XRP on the 1-hour time frame to map out its likely price trajectory. According to the analyst, XRP is showing signs of recovery after enduring a sharp market correction in late April. Related Reading: XRP Price Pullback To $2 According To Plan For Historic Breakout To $10, Analyst Says The cryptocurrency had made a significant high of around $2.3 but underwent a dramatic drop, reportedly bottoming out at approximately $2.125, where buyers quickly stepped in to stabilize its price. This support level has since held strong, with the XRP price currently consolidating just below this point. Marked on the right side of the chart, the analyst has pinpointed a key resistance level at $2.18, labeling this level as a critical breakout point. Suppose the altcoin can decisively break and close above $2.18. In that case, Bitcoin Benny predicts that it could trigger what he calls a “send season,” which is a momentum-driven rally that could push XRP toward new levels to potentially retest its previous highs.

In a new interview with the host of the Crypto Banter YouTube channel Ran Neuner, Hayes says central banks will likely boost money printing to address worsening macroeconomic conditions that could push Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto assets to much higher valuations. “I think that the setup is just perfect for a rally in risk assets, just like we saw from the third quarter of 2022 until early 2025. There’s a similar setup today. We have a lot of fear, uncertainty, doubt in the markets, and the monetary authorities, especially in America, cannot handle that, so they’re going to resort to money printing… This is all about the Treasury. [Former US Treasury Secretary] Janet Yellen printed $2.5 trillion from 2022 to 2025. Bitcoin went up 6x. [US Treasury Secretary Scott] Bessent has to do something similar. And so that’s why April 9th was the bottom, and we’re going to go much higher from here.” Hayes also predicts that the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) metric may soon enter a downward phase after tagging the 70% level, setting alts up to outperform the flagship crypto asset. BTC.D calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.81%. “I think Bitcoin dominance goes to 70%-ish. Bitcoin goes to the $150,000 level, something around there. And then we start to get the rotation into altcoins.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,030 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours.

44254871,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157763,1746576053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Benchmark Initiates ‘Buy’ on Canaan, Citing Tremendous Undervaluation and Bitcoin Upside",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/canaan-benchmark-buy-rating/,"Exciting news for investors keeping an eye on the digital asset space! U.S. investment bank Benchmark has recently cast a spotlight on Nasdaq-listed Canaan , a prominent player in the Bitcoin miner sector. This move comes with a significant vote of confidence: an initiated coverage coupled with a ‘Buy’ rating and a $3 price target. Why is Benchmark Bullish on This Bitcoin Miner? Benchmark’s positive outlook on Canaan isn’t just a random pick; it’s rooted in several key aspects of the company’s operations and market position. According to reports, the firm highlighted Canaan’s distinct advantages, particularly its vertically integrated business model. This means Canaan doesn’t just mine Bitcoin; it also designs and produces the very hardware (mining machines) needed for the process. This dual capability is seen as a significant strength, offering control over the supply chain and potentially better cost management. Beyond hardware, Benchmark also pointed to Canaan’s growing self-mining operations. By using its own machines to mine Bitcoin, the company directly benefits from the network’s rewards. Furthermore, Canaan holds a notable amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. These holdings act as a direct lever to rising Bitcoin prices, offering additional upside potential for the company’s value. In summary, Benchmark sees these factors as key value drivers: Vertically Integrated Model: Control over hardware production and self-mining. Growing Self-Mining: Direct participation in Bitcoin mining rewards. Strong Bitcoin Holdings: Asset exposure to Bitcoin price increases. Is CAN Stock Truly Undervalued? Despite the positive fundamentals identified by Benchmark, CAN stock has experienced declines recently. However, Benchmark views this downturn as an opportunity, asserting that Canaan is significantly undervalued when compared to its peers in the Bitcoin mining and hardware manufacturing space. This valuation gap suggests that the market might not be fully appreciating Canaan’s underlying assets and business model strengths. The $3 price target set by Benchmark implies a substantial potential upside from the stock’s current trading levels, aligning with their assessment of undervaluation. For those considering cryptocurrency investment , this analysis provides a specific company to research further, especially if they believe in the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin and the infrastructure supporting it. What Does This Mean for Investors? Benchmark’s initiation of coverage with a ‘Buy’ rating is a notable event for Canaan and potential investors. It signals that a major investment bank sees significant potential in the company. While analyst ratings are just one piece of the puzzle, they can influence market sentiment and draw attention to stocks that might otherwise be overlooked. For individuals interested in gaining exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem through equity, Canaan (CAN) now has a prominent financial institution endorsing its prospects. However, as with all investments, especially in the volatile crypto-adjacent space, potential investors should conduct their own thorough research (due diligence) and consider their own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. The performance of Bitcoin miners like Canaan remains closely tied to the price of Bitcoin itself, which is known for its significant price swings. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal Amidst Volatility Benchmark’s ‘Buy’ rating and $3 price target on Canaan underscore a belief in the company’s core business model and its potential to capitalize on future increases in the price of Bitcoin. By highlighting its vertical integration, self-mining growth, and Bitcoin holdings, Benchmark presents a case for why Canaan might be an undervalued opportunity in the current market. While recent stock performance shows the inherent volatility, the analyst’s view suggests a positive long-term outlook based on fundamental strengths and macro trends in the cryptocurrency market. This initiation of coverage provides a fresh perspective for those exploring opportunities within the Bitcoin mining landscape.

44255821,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=722248,1746577531,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44255821.jpeg,"Sam Altman’s Worldcoin promised a global ID, so why are countries slamming the door?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/worldcoin-global-id-promise-sparks-backlash/,"OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman launched Worldcoin in 2023 to give people a digital identity to verify themselves securely and anonymously online. The idea behind the project required people to scan their irises and, in exchange for their personal data, the company would reward them with a small amount of cryptocurrency, which it believed would inspire more people to sign up. Altman expressed his intention for Worldcoin as a “ proof of personhood ” because AI could mimic human behavior and talk like them, making it more difficult to tell who or what is real online. He also wanted to close the gap between the rich and the poor by giving everyone equal access to digital services without paperwork or passwords. In the beginning, Worldcoin was all hype as social media posts showed people waiting in long lines to scan their irises, especially in countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Most of the volunteers were more than happy to be a part of the global tech movement, while others were in it for the free cryptocurrency the company gave everyone who scanned their irises. However, Altman’s vision of a connected and equal world began crumbling as people and governments raised concerns about the project’s privacy, data safety, fairness, and consent. Privacy groups slam Worldcoin over biometric risks and exploitation Tech experts and privacy groups warned that the biometric data from these eye scans is extremely sensitive because the information connects directly to who you are as a person. And since you can’t change your eyes like your password, a hacker could easily stalk or steal from you. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) also criticized the project by saying the company rushed to collect information from third-world countries because the people were unaware of how Worldcoin would use, protect, or delete their data. In addition, people raised concerns about consent because Worldcoin would sometimes target individuals with limited internet access or education since they are less likely to understand the risks and make a more informed decision. Some users even claimed they only registered for Worldcoin for the free cryptocurrency but did not know how the company would use their data. Worldcoin also faced scrutiny over transparency, as it failed to clearly explain how user data was stored, who had access to it, and what would happen if the company changed ownership or shut down. Although Worldcoin claimed to anonymize the data, experts pointed out that it could still be traced back to the individual with the right tools. Once a scan is in the company’s database, it could remain there indefinitely. Due to mounting concerns, various governments launched investigations into Worldcoin’s practices. Nations like Spain, Portugal, and Kenya are at the forefront of demanding Worldcoin cease operations in their regions. These actions prove that many governments globally are moving too fast, breaking several legislative laws that seek to protect user interests. Worldcoin tries to win back trust after bans Due to the government pushback, Worldcoin quickly tried to save its image and respond to the growing criticism by sharing the code behind its Orb scanning device to help people understand how it worked and prove that it wasn’t secretly collecting more data than it claimed. Furthermore, the company introduced “Personal Custody” to allow users to control their data by storing it themselves or deleting it from the database. Moreover, Worldcoin brought in independent experts to perform third-party audits to ascertain that the company’s technology and policies aligned with the regulations the way Worldcoin claimed. Despite these efforts, legal and tech experts still have mixed opinions because some say it was the first step toward making things right, while others claim that these efforts were not enough and that the company still has big problems to solve. Therefore, even after all the changes Worldcoin has made, the gap between what the company claims and what regulators believe remains wide because regulators say the company still needs to explain, fix, and prove more before the uplift bans. The Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Digital (Komdigi) plans to summon the developers of Worldcoin and WorldID next week. This action follows the temporary suspension of the platforms that collect users’ iris data for alleged regulatory violations.

A significant development signaling this trend is the recent move by a global payments giant. If you’re interested in the future of money and how large corporations are embracing digital assets, particularly stablecoin payments , this news is for you. What’s Behind the Visa Ventures Investment? Visa Ventures , the strategic investment arm of Visa, has thrown its weight behind BVNK, a company specializing in providing infrastructure for stablecoin payments. This isn’t just another small funding round; it follows BVNK’s successful $50 million Series B and represents a notable step for Visa. According to reports, the primary goal of this Visa investment is to facilitate BVNK’s expansion into the crucial U.S. stablecoin market . The United States is a massive market with growing interest in digital payments, and stablecoins offer a potential bridge between the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies and the stability required for everyday transactions. This move suggests Visa sees tangible value in stablecoins as a payment rail, potentially for cross-border transactions, business-to-business payments, or even consumer use cases in the future. It’s a strategic play to get involved early in the infrastructure layer that could power the next generation of digital payments. Why Focus on Stablecoin Payments Now? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar. Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, their price is pegged (or attempts to be pegged) 1:1 with a fiat currency or basket of assets. This stability makes them attractive for transactions, remittances, and settlements, areas where volatility is a major hindrance for traditional cryptocurrencies. For businesses, accepting or making payments in stablecoins offers several potential advantages: Speed: Transactions can often settle much faster than traditional bank transfers, especially internationally. Cost: Fees can be significantly lower than traditional payment processors or cross-border wire transfers. Accessibility: They operate on blockchain networks, potentially offering greater accessibility to those underserved by traditional banking. 24/7 Operation: Unlike banks, blockchain networks operate around the clock. Companies like BVNK build the necessary infrastructure – APIs, compliance tools, settlement layers – to make these benefits accessible and usable for businesses and financial institutions. What Does This Mean for BVNK ? Receiving an investment from a giant like Visa is a major validation for BVNK. Beyond the capital, it brings: Credibility: Association with a global payments leader enhances trust and reputation. Expertise: Potential access to Visa’s deep understanding of the payments landscape, regulatory environments, and network effects. Network Opportunities: Possibility of future collaborations or integrations with Visa’s vast network of partners and merchants. Accelerated U.S. Entry: The investment is specifically aimed at supporting their expansion into the U.S., a complex but lucrative market. This funding will likely be used to build out their U.S. team, navigate the regulatory landscape, develop localized products, and establish partnerships within the region. Navigating the U.S. Stablecoin Market : Challenges and Opportunities While the opportunity in the U.S. is immense, the path is not without hurdles. The regulatory environment for stablecoins in the United States is still evolving. Lawmakers and regulators are actively debating how to classify and regulate stablecoins, with potential frameworks ranging from treating issuers like banks to creating entirely new regulatory categories. Key considerations for BVNK and other players in the U.S. stablecoin market include: Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to state and federal financial regulations, including KYC/AML requirements. Licensing: Obtaining necessary money transmitter licenses or other required permits. Banking Relationships: Establishing and maintaining relationships with traditional banks for fiat on/off-ramps. Consumer Protection: Ensuring robust systems are in place to protect users. Competition: The market is attracting significant interest, leading to increased competition from both crypto-native firms and traditional finance players. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards are substantial. A clear regulatory framework, once established, could unlock significant institutional and corporate adoption of stablecoin payments , creating a massive market for infrastructure providers like BVNK. Is This the Future of Payments? Visa’s Visa investment in BVNK is a strong signal that major players in traditional finance see stablecoins not just as a niche crypto product, but as a potential component of the future global payment system. It reflects a broader trend of convergence, where the efficiency and innovation of blockchain technology are being explored for mainstream financial applications. While cash and traditional card payments are not disappearing anytime soon, the infrastructure being built today by companies like BVNK , with support from entities like Visa Ventures , is laying the groundwork for a future where digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, play a more prominent role in how businesses and individuals transact. Actionable Insight: Businesses should start exploring the potential benefits and mechanics of stablecoin payments, especially those involved in international trade or looking for faster, cheaper payment options. Understanding the infrastructure providers and the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial. In Conclusion: A Bridge Between Worlds The investment by Visa Ventures in BVNK represents a significant bridge being built between the traditional financial world and the emerging digital asset ecosystem. By backing infrastructure for stablecoin payments , Visa is positioning itself at the forefront of innovation in the payments space, specifically targeting expansion within the critical U.S. stablecoin market . This move validates the growing importance of stablecoins as a practical tool for transactions and highlights the increasing collaboration between established finance and crypto-native companies. As the regulatory picture in the U.S. becomes clearer, expect to see more such strategic partnerships and accelerated development in the stablecoin payment sector.

Artificial intelligence continues to transform how we interact with information. Google is leveraging this power with a significant update to its iOS app: the new ‘Simplify’ feature. This development in Google AI is set to make navigating dense web content much more accessible for iPhone users. What is Google AI Simplify? Google’s new ‘Simplify’ feature, integrated into the Google app for iOS, is designed to tackle the challenge of complex online text head-on. It employs advanced AI models to take complicated paragraphs and rewrite them in a simpler, more digestible format, all without requiring you to leave the page you are reading. This means you can encounter technical jargon, intricate explanations, or scientific details and get an instant, clearer version to help you understand the core message. How Does AI Text Simplification Work? The technology powering this feature is rooted in a sophisticated prompt refinement approach developed by Google Research. At its core, the ‘Simplify’ tool utilizes Google’s powerful Gemini AI models. These models are trained to understand the nuances of complex language and effectively paraphrase it. Google’s testing indicates that users who read the simplified text gain a better understanding and retain information more effectively than those reading the original, complex versions. The goal of this AI text simplification is to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the original content while removing unnecessary complexity. Consider this example provided by Google: Original Complex Text Simplified Text (by Google AI) The complex pathology of this condition involves emphysematous destruction of lung parenchyma, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, changes in the composition of lung immune cells, increased production of immunomodulatory factors, and the prominent remodeling of pulmonary vasculature. This complex condition involves damage to the lung tissue from emphysema, a disease that damages the air sacs in the lungs, and widespread scarring of the lung tissue, called fibrosis. The immune cells in the lungs change, and the body makes more immunomodulatory factors, substances that control the immune system. The blood vessels in the lungs also change a lot. As the example shows, the simplified version breaks down medical terms and sentence structures into more common language, making the underlying concepts easier to grasp for a general reader. Google Simplify: Keeping Users in the Ecosystem Google’s introduction of the Google Simplify feature is not just about improving readability; it’s also a strategic move in the competitive AI landscape. By offering a built-in tool for text simplification directly within its app, Google aims to provide users with a convenient solution that prevents them from needing to navigate away to third-party AI tools, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for assistance with understanding complex content. This helps reinforce the Google app as a central hub for information consumption and processing on iOS devices. Accessing the iOS App Feature Using the ‘Simplify’ feature is straightforward for users on the iOS app feature . When you are viewing a web page within the Google app, you can select any portion of text that you find difficult to understand. Once the text is selected, a ‘Simplify’ icon will appear alongside other options like copy or define. Tapping this icon will generate and display the simplified version of the selected text, allowing you to quickly digest the information and continue reading the original page with enhanced comprehension. Gemini AI Powers the Magic The effectiveness of the ‘Simplify’ feature is largely thanks to the capabilities of Gemini AI . Google has emphasized that their goal with this tool is not just to shorten text, but to accurately paraphrase complex ideas. This process must be done without introducing errors or omitting crucial details. The rewritten text must genuinely assist the reader in understanding challenging material while preserving the original information’s integrity. This commitment to accuracy is vital for a tool designed to help users learn and comprehend new topics encountered online. The ‘Simplify’ feature is currently rolling out to iOS users this week, bringing a powerful new capability to the Google app. In conclusion, Google’s new ‘Simplify’ feature, powered by Gemini AI, represents a significant step in making web content more accessible. By providing an easy-to-use tool for AI text simplification directly within its iOS app feature , Google helps users quickly understand complex information and reinforces its ecosystem as a go-to resource for navigating the digital world.

44256782,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157777,1746579605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Bitcoin OP_RETURN Debate: Developers Propose Radical Change,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-opreturn-limit-debate/,"The world of Bitcoin is rarely quiet, and a recent proposal from Bitcoin Core developers has ignited a significant discussion, bordering on a full-blown crypto debate . At the heart of the matter is a technical tweak with potentially broad implications for how data is stored on the blockchain: the humble Bitcoin OP_RETURN output. What is Bitcoin OP_RETURN and Why Does it Matter? First off, let’s break down what we’re talking about. In simple terms, an OP_RETURN output is a special type of transaction output on the Bitcoin network . Unlike regular outputs that send Bitcoin to a specific address, an OP_RETURN output is provably unspendable. Its primary purpose is to allow a small amount of arbitrary data to be embedded directly into the blockchain, typically for applications built on top of Bitcoin. The key thing here is the data limit. Currently, OP_RETURN outputs are capped at 80 bytes. This limit was introduced years ago precisely to prevent the blockchain from being filled with excessive, non-financial data, which could contribute to something called UTXO bloat . So, why does this seemingly small technical detail matter? Because how data is stored and managed directly impacts the efficiency, cost, and decentralization of the entire Bitcoin network . Changes here are a big deal. Bitcoin Developers’ Proposal: Lifting the Cap A group of prominent Bitcoin developers , specifically from the Bitcoin Core project, have put forward a proposal to remove the existing 80-byte size limit on OP_RETURN outputs entirely. Their argument is based on a technical observation: the current limit isn’t actually achieving its goal effectively and, in some cases, is making things worse. Here’s their reasoning: Workarounds Exist: The 80-byte limit doesn’t stop people from embedding more data. Developers and users find workarounds, often by using multiple OP_RETURN outputs or other, less efficient scripting methods. Worse for UTXO Bloat: These workarounds, particularly using multiple outputs, can actually be *more* harmful to the UTXO bloat problem than allowing a single, larger OP_RETURN output. Each additional output adds entries to the UTXO set, which full nodes need to track. Simplifying Rules: Removing the arbitrary limit simplifies the protocol rules, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. In essence, the developers argue that the current limit is an ineffective dam that forces water (data) to flow around it in ways that cause more erosion ( UTXO bloat ) downstream. Removing the dam, they suggest, could lead to a more controlled and less harmful flow. The Crypto Debate Ignites: Concerns Over Spam and Consensus As you might expect in the often-passionate world of cryptocurrency, this proposal hasn’t been met with universal acclaim. It has sparked a significant crypto debate , pitting technical efficiency arguments against concerns about network use and governance. Prominent critics have voiced their opposition. Among them are figures like Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, and Marty Bent from Ten31 Fund and the popular ‘Tales from the Crypt’ podcast. Their core arguments often revolve around: Lack of Consensus: Critics argue that such a fundamental change to how data is handled on the blockchain requires broader community consensus than currently exists for this proposal. Bitcoin development traditionally moves slowly and cautiously, prioritizing agreement across different stakeholder groups. Increased Spam Risk: The fear is that removing the limit could open the floodgates for large amounts of arbitrary, non-financial data being permanently etched onto the Bitcoin network . This could include anything from large text files to encoded images, potentially overwhelming nodes and increasing operational costs. Impact on Node Operators: Full nodes are the backbone of the Bitcoin network . Storing and validating the entire blockchain requires resources. Critics worry that increased data embedding could significantly raise these requirements, potentially pushing smaller node operators offline and leading to centralization. Changing Bitcoin’s Purpose: Some purists believe Bitcoin’s blockchain should be used *only* for financial transactions. Allowing larger data embeds, they argue, deviates from this core purpose and could set a precedent for further non-monetary use cases that compete for block space and resources. This isn’t just a technical disagreement; it touches upon philosophical questions about what the Bitcoin network is for and how its scarce resources (block space and node capacity) should be used. Benefits vs. Challenges: Weighing the Impact Let’s try to summarize the potential upsides and downsides of removing the Bitcoin OP_RETURN limit: Potential Benefits (According to Proponents): Reduced overall UTXO bloat by eliminating less efficient workarounds. Simplification of Bitcoin protocol rules and code. Potentially more efficient ways for developers to embed small amounts of necessary data for layered protocols (though this is debated). Potential Challenges (According to Critics): Increased potential for blockchain ‘spam’ or non-financial data. Higher resource requirements for running a full node on the Bitcoin network . Lack of broad community consensus for the change. Concerns about altering Bitcoin’s fundamental nature. The debate highlights a classic tension in decentralized systems: how to balance flexibility and innovation with stability and resistance to abuse. The Bitcoin developers proposing the change see it as a technical optimization to fix an existing problem, while critics see it as potentially introducing new, worse problems and bypassing established consensus-building processes. UTXO Bloat: Why is it Such a Big Deal? Let’s zoom in on UTXO bloat , as it’s central to the developers’ argument. The UTXO set (Unspent Transaction Output set) is essentially the list of all Bitcoin that currently exists and is available to be spent. Every full node on the Bitcoin network needs to keep track of this set to validate new transactions. When you receive Bitcoin, it’s added to the UTXO set as an output you can spend. When you spend it, that output is marked as spent, and new outputs are created for the recipient and any change. A large UTXO set requires more memory and processing power for nodes. If the set grows too large, it can make it harder and more expensive to run a full node, potentially leading to fewer nodes and thus less decentralization. The 80-byte OP_RETURN limit was intended to keep outputs small and unspendable, thus not contributing to the *spendable* UTXO set directly, but the *number* of outputs still matters. The developers’ point is that workarounds to the 80-byte limit often involve creating *more* outputs (even if some are OP_RETURN or other types), which increases the *size* and *complexity* of the UTXO set data that nodes must manage, arguably causing worse bloat than a single larger OP_RETURN output might. What Happens Next in This Crypto Debate? For now, this is just a proposal from a group of Bitcoin developers . As The Block reported, no release date has been set for any software update that would include this change. The nature of Bitcoin development is iterative and relies heavily on discussion, review, and eventual consensus among a distributed group of developers, users, miners, and businesses. This crypto debate will likely continue to play out on mailing lists, in online forums, and during developer calls. The technical merits of the proposal will be scrutinized, the potential risks debated, and the community’s sentiment gauged. It’s a prime example of how changes, even seemingly minor ones, in a decentralized system like the Bitcoin network require careful consideration and broad buy-in. Summary: A Technical Tweak Sparks Fundamental Questions The proposal by Bitcoin developers to remove the 80-byte limit on Bitcoin OP_RETURN outputs is more than just a technical detail; it’s a catalyst for a broader crypto debate about the future use and health of the Bitcoin network . While proponents argue it’s a necessary step to combat inefficient workarounds and reduce UTXO bloat , critics raise valid concerns about potential spam, increased node costs, and the very nature of Bitcoin’s purpose. This discussion underscores the decentralized and often contentious nature of Bitcoin development. Reaching consensus on significant changes is a slow, deliberate process, reflecting the network’s resistance to rapid alteration. How this debate evolves will be crucial to watch, as it could influence how data is managed on the blockchain for years to come.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Not Yet,https://coinpedia.org/news/pro-xrp-lawyer-says-ripple-lawsuit-is-not-over-yet/,"The post Is the Ripple SEC Lawsuit Over? Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Not Yet appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was one of the longest and most talked-about crypto cases in recent years. In April 2024, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the SEC had agreed to drop the case — just like it had done with other crypto companies. However, unlike those other cases, the SEC has not officially confirmed that it is ending the Ripple lawsuit. Even so, many in the XRP community are already celebrating, thinking the case is over. But a pro-XRP lawyer warned that it’s not finished yet. He explained that some legal steps still need to happen in court before it’s truly done. It is not over yet. Things need to happen first in court https://t.co/Met98eKcc1 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 7, 2025 Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, spoke out recently, asking why the SEC brought the case in the first place. He said the SEC has now dropped every crypto case in the U.S., including its appeal against Ripple. Alderoty explained that the SEC admitted it couldn’t take legal action without first clearly explaining the rules around crypto. Since there were no clear laws for crypto in the U.S., the SEC’s cases didn’t hold up. Now, Ripple wants to move forward — focusing on business, working with Congress, and helping create fair rules for crypto. Their goal is to protect consumers, keep out bad actors, and support innovation in the industry. In other news, Ripple has announced that it will stop publishing its regular quarterly reports on XRP. The company said it made this decision because the SEC used Ripple’s transparency efforts against it during their legal battle. In its Q1 2025 market report, Ripple explained that it started the reports to be open about its XRP holdings and to share information that few other crypto companies were offering. However, Ripple now says those efforts didn’t work as planned and were actually turned against them — especially by former SEC leaders.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 01:09:08

The launch of a new web platform by Particle AI , a company known for its innovative AI news reader , marks a significant step in how consumers access and understand digital news . This move aims to broaden access to its AI-enhanced news experience beyond its mobile app. Exploring Particle’s New Web Platform for AI News Particle has officially rolled out its web presence at Particle.news. This expansion brings the core features of its mobile application to a wider audience, offering a fresh perspective on consuming AI news . The platform aggregates headlines and provides AI-generated summaries from various sources, making it easier to quickly grasp the essence of current events. The website allows users to explore news across numerous categories, including: Technology Sports Entertainment Politics Science Crime Economics Video Games Users can also browse the day’s most popular stories directly from the homepage, ensuring they stay updated on trending topics. How Particle AI Enhances Digital News Consumption Particle’s approach goes beyond simple summaries. The platform is designed with specific AI tools to improve reader comprehension. Instead of just bullet points, Particle extracts key quotes from articles, providing direct insights from the source material. While the web version currently displays user questions and answers from the mobile app, direct AI interaction via a chatbot is planned for the future. A standout feature is the integration of ‘entity pages’. When a significant person, product, or organization is mentioned, users can click on the highlighted term to access a dedicated page. These pages provide foundational information, often sourced from Wikipedia, and crucially, link to additional stories about the subject. This creates a richer context for the news being read. Particle’s Approach to AI Publishing and Supporting Sources A critical distinction for Particle is its stated goal to support publishers, not just use their content without attribution. The platform prominently displays links to the original news outlets alongside its AI summaries. Early data from the mobile app showed readers were indeed clicking through to the publishers’ sites. This led Particle to establish partnerships with major news organizations like Reuters, Fortune, and AFP to give their links greater visibility. On the new website, related reporting links are also included at the bottom of summaries, encouraging users to explore the source material further. Sharing a link from the Particle mobile app now directs recipients to the corresponding page on the website, making the content accessible even to those without the app installed. This model presents an interesting angle in the evolving landscape of AI publishing , aiming for a symbiotic relationship rather than pure content aggregation. The Team and Funding Behind Particle AI Particle was co-founded in 2023 by Sara Beykpour, a former senior director of product management at Twitter, and Marcel Molina, a former senior engineer at Twitter and Tesla. The company has secured substantial backing, including $4.4 million in seed funding and a $10.9 million Series A round led by Lightspeed. This significant investment underscores confidence in their vision for an AI news reader that benefits both consumers and publishers. Particle in the Competitive Digital News Landscape Particle enters a space where several players are exploring the use of AI in news. Yahoo, for instance, acquired the Artifact app (created by Instagram’s co-founders) to enhance its News app with AI features. Other major news organizations like Bloomberg, Gannett, and The Wall Street Journal are also experimenting with AI for article summaries. However, Particle’s position as an independent platform specifically focused on AI summaries and Q&A might give it a different standing with readers. Users may be more accepting of AI-generated summaries and insights on a dedicated platform like Particle compared to seeing AI errors directly on the website of a trusted news source reporting original journalism. Benefits and Future Outlook The launch of the web platform is expected to significantly increase Particle’s reach, offering a new way for people to engage with digital news using AI. For readers, the benefits include quicker comprehension through summaries and quotes, deeper context via entity pages, and the ability to ask questions (though direct web interaction is future). For publishers, the potential for referral traffic through prominent linking offers a different model than pure aggregation. As AI continues to evolve, its role in how we consume information will only grow. Particle’s expansion to the web positions it as a notable player exploring how AI can enhance understanding and potentially create a more sustainable ecosystem for news dissemination.

With price back under the point of control, traders are watching closely for signs of a deeper move or a trap. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price action has stalled at a technically significant region, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, drawn from the most recent pivot high to low. This area is also reinforced by daily horizontal resistance and a descending VWAP, adding to its weight as a decision zone. After several failed attempts to push higher, ETH has now begun to roll over, trading back under the point of control (POC) of the local range. Key technical points Major Resistance Cluster: The 0.618 Fibonacci aligns with daily resistance and a descending VWAP, forming a strong technical ceiling. Loss of POC: Price has fallen below the volume point of control, indicating sellers are gaining control of the short-term auction. Bearish Structure Building: Lower highs and a stalled breakout raise the probability of a move toward the next key support near $1,540. ETHUSDT Chart (4), Source: TradingView Detailed analysis After an impulsive move higher, Ethereum’s price has spent several sessions consolidating below a heavy resistance zone. The 0.618 Fibonacci level, a widely watched retracement marker, is reinforced by daily horizontal resistance and a declining VWAP drawn from the last major high. This confluence attracted notable selling pressure, and ETH has now failed multiple times to break above. What adds further caution to the current structure is the recent loss of the point of control within this region. Price has now dipped below the highest-volume node of the recent range, suggesting that the market is no longer accepting value at these levels. This often precedes range rotation or continuation in the direction of the rejection, in this case, to the downside. You might also like: Bitcoin consolidates below key resistance as lower timeframe trend develops The technical landscape also reveals a clear short-term bearish structure forming. ETH has been unable to print higher highs or maintain higher lows, increasing the probability of a broader correction. The next logical support level sits around $1,540, not only a structural level from previous sessions but also a zone with visible price inefficiencies (e.g., unfilled fair value gaps and single prints) that could act as magnets for price. This setup opens the door for a potential 10% downside move from current levels, especially if the recent swing low fails to hold. Still, traders should remain alert to the possibility of a fakeout, as Ethereum has previously shown sudden strength from similar rejection zones. What to expect in the coming price action Ethereum’s failure to break out above the 0.618 confluence zone and its rejection from the POC suggest a higher chance of rotation toward lower supports. If price breaks below the recent swing low, the $1,540 region could be the next target. However, if buyers can defend current levels and reclaim the POC, this might prove to be a local fakeout before resuming upward. For now, caution is warranted as price hovers near a decisive level.

44257380,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157778,1746580858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Meme Coin Regulation: Explosive Bill Targets Trump’s Political Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/murphy-trump-meme-coin/,"The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly complex, and a recent move by a U.S. Senator highlights the growing concerns around potential conflicts of interest. The emergence of assets like the Trump Meme Coin has sparked debate, leading one lawmaker to take direct action aimed at curbing what he sees as blatant self-dealing in the digital asset space. This development signals a significant moment in the ongoing discussion around Meme Coin Regulation and the broader landscape of US Crypto Regulation . Senator Chris Murphy Takes Aim at Political Crypto U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) has stepped into the spotlight with a legislative proposal designed to prevent U.S. officials from leveraging their positions for personal financial gain through investments like cryptocurrencies and securities. According to reports, Senator Murphy has introduced the “MEME Act,” a bill specifically crafted to address concerns around self-dealing. The acronym ‘MEME’ itself is a pointed reference, clearly indicating the types of assets drawing legislative scrutiny. Senator Murphy’s motivation appears to be directly linked to prominent examples of politicians engaging with digital assets that may benefit them financially. He explicitly cited the promotion of the Trump Meme Coin as a prime example of the kind of behavior his bill aims to prohibit. This move underscores a growing sentiment among some lawmakers that the burgeoning world of Political Crypto requires clear ethical boundaries. The core of the MEME Act, as described, is to ban U.S. officials – a category that includes the President and other high-ranking government figures – from promoting financial instruments in which they have a personal stake. This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies; it extends to traditional securities as well. However, the bill’s name and the context in which it’s being introduced clearly place meme coins and the crypto market at the forefront of this legislative effort. What is the MEME Act and Why Now? The proposed MEME Act seeks to establish a clear legal barrier preventing government officials from using their platform or influence to boost the value of assets they own. While existing ethics rules address conflicts of interest, Senator Murphy’s bill suggests these rules may not be sufficient or explicit enough when it comes to newer asset classes like cryptocurrencies, particularly those with direct ties to political figures. Key aspects of the MEME Act likely include: Defining “U.S. Officials”: Clarifying who is covered by the ban, likely including elected officials, appointed officials, and potentially their immediate families. Defining “Promoting”: Establishing what constitutes promotion of a financial interest. This could range from explicit endorsements to more subtle mentions or actions that could influence market perception. Scope of Assets: Explicitly including cryptocurrencies (with a potential focus on meme coins or politically-themed tokens) alongside traditional securities. Enforcement Mechanisms: Outlining how the ban would be enforced and what penalties officials might face for violations. The timing of this bill is crucial. It comes as discussions around comprehensive US Crypto Regulation are intensifying on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are grappling with how to oversee the crypto market, protect investors, and prevent illicit activity. Against this backdrop, the high-profile nature of assets like the Trump Meme Coin and the public figures associated with them has seemingly accelerated calls for specific rules addressing potential ethical breaches. The Trump Meme Coin Controversy The specific mention of the Trump Meme Coin by Senator Chris Murphy highlights a particular flashpoint in the political crypto space. While many meme coins are based on internet jokes or cultural trends, a subset has emerged directly tied to political figures or movements. These tokens often gain value based on speculation, community hype, and their connection to the personality they represent. The controversy arises when the individual associated with the coin is also a public official or a candidate for office. Critics argue that any action or statement by that individual that could be perceived as positive towards the crypto market, or even just increasing their overall public profile, could inadvertently (or intentionally) benefit the value of a token tied to them. This creates a potential conflict of interest, where an official’s public duties or political activities could be influenced by their personal financial holdings or those of their associates. Senator Murphy’s characterization of the promotion of such coins as “blatant corruption” reflects the strong negative sentiment some feel towards this phenomenon. It raises questions about the ethics of officials holding or appearing to endorse assets whose value is so directly linked to their own political fortunes or public statements. Is Political Crypto Inherently Problematic? The rise of Political Crypto raises complex questions. On one hand, digital assets can be seen as another form of investment, and individuals, including politicians, have the right to invest. On the other hand, the unique nature of meme coins and politically themed tokens, combined with the power and influence wielded by public officials, creates a potential for abuse that may exceed that of traditional investments. Arguments against officials holding or promoting such assets include: Conflict of Interest: Decisions or statements made in their official capacity could impact the value of their holdings. Market Manipulation Risk: A public figure’s endorsement could cause significant, speculative price swings that harm uninformed investors. Erosion of Public Trust: It can create the perception that officials are prioritizing personal wealth over public service. Unfair Advantage: Officials may have access to information or influence that gives them an edge in the market. However, defining the line can be tricky. Does attending a crypto conference constitute promotion? What about simply owning crypto assets? The MEME Act aims to draw a clearer line, focusing specifically on active “promotion” of assets where the official has a personal financial interest. Navigating the Challenges of Meme Coin Regulation Regulating meme coins presents unique challenges compared to more traditional financial assets or even cryptocurrencies with clear utility. Their value is often driven by intangible factors like community sentiment, social media trends, and celebrity endorsements rather than underlying technology or business models. Key challenges for Meme Coin Regulation include: Defining a Meme Coin: How do you legally define a meme coin distinct from other cryptocurrencies or securities? Volatility: Their extreme price swings make them high-risk, potentially leading to significant losses for investors, but also making them attractive targets for pump-and-dump schemes. Decentralization vs. Centralization: While some crypto projects are genuinely decentralized, others have central figures or teams, making it easier to identify responsible parties for regulation. Meme coins often blur this line. Global Nature: Crypto markets are global, making enforcement of national regulations complex. Despite these challenges, the push for regulation, exemplified by Senator Chris Murphy ‘s MEME Act, indicates a growing resolve among some policymakers to bring more oversight to this corner of the market, especially when it intersects with political figures. Broader Implications for US Crypto Regulation The MEME Act, while focused on official conduct and specific assets like the Trump Meme Coin , is part of a larger legislative trend concerning US Crypto Regulation . Congress and various regulatory bodies are actively debating and proposing rules covering a wide range of crypto activities, including exchanges, stablecoins, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). This bill could potentially set a precedent for how officials’ interactions with the crypto market are viewed and regulated. It signals that lawmakers are paying close attention not just to the technology itself, but to the ethical implications of its adoption and promotion, particularly by those in positions of power. The debate around this bill will likely touch upon fundamental issues like free speech, the definition of a security, and the appropriate scope of government oversight in rapidly evolving markets. As lawmakers advance digital asset regulations, the focus on preventing self-dealing and maintaining public trust is becoming increasingly prominent. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Public? For investors in meme coins or other cryptocurrencies, this legislative action highlights the inherent risks, including regulatory uncertainty. It underscores that assets tied to personalities or fleeting trends are subject to unique pressures, including political scrutiny. For the public, the MEME Act is presented as a measure to safeguard against corruption and ensure that officials are acting in the public interest, not their personal financial interest. It’s a reminder that as new technologies emerge, the ethical frameworks governing public service must adapt. Actionable insights from this development: Stay Informed: Keep track of legislative developments like the MEME Act and other proposed US Crypto Regulation . Understand Risks: Be aware that meme coins and political tokens carry significant risks, including volatility and potential regulatory action. Demand Transparency: Support calls for greater transparency regarding the financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest of public officials. Engage in the Debate: Understand the arguments for and against stricter Meme Coin Regulation and make your voice heard if possible. Conclusion: A Crucial Step in Defining Ethical Boundaries? Senator Chris Murphy ‘s introduction of the MEME Act represents a pointed effort to address perceived ethical lapses at the intersection of politics and the digital asset market. By specifically targeting the promotion of personal financial interests through assets like the Trump Meme Coin , the bill aims to draw a clear line against self-dealing by U.S. officials. While the path to becoming law is uncertain and the bill is likely to face debate and potential challenges, its introduction is a significant development. It brings the controversial world of Political Crypto into sharp legislative focus and highlights the growing urgency felt by some lawmakers to establish clear ethical boundaries within the broader framework of US Crypto Regulation . The outcome of this legislative effort could have lasting implications for how public officials interact with digital assets and for the future of Meme Coin Regulation itself.

Richard Blumenthal, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations within the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, sent letters on Tuesday to Bill Zanker of Fight Fight Fight LLC and Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial. Senate panel investigates Trump-affiliated crypto ventures for potential conflicts of interest These letters contained inquiries about the ownership and investment structure of several Trump-affiliated entities, including Fight Fight Fight LLC (the company behind the TRUMP meme coin), CIC Digital LLC (which issued Trump’s NFTs and co-owns Fight Fight Fight), Celebration Cards LLC (another Trump-affiliated NFT entity), DTTM Operations LLC (which manages Trump’s intellectual property), as well as World Liberty Financial and its affiliates. According to the letters, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is conducting a preliminary inquiry into potential conflicts of interest and legal violations involving President Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures and the financial dealings of associated businesses with foreign nationals, foreign governments, and other cryptocurrency firms. One letter referenced World Liberty Financial, while the other pointed to the $TRUMP meme coin. The letters suggested that these businesses “may be enabling the violation of government ethics requirements” and posed several questions for the companies’ executives. These included inquiries on how the companies block investments from foreign governments, their revenue generation, and whether individuals facing prosecution or investigations can participate. Additionally, the letters requested records linked to the Trump-affiliated crypto businesses. Democrats push back as Trump’s crypto dealings trigger legislative resistance As Democrats are currently in the minority in the Senate, Blumenthal lacks subpoena power unless his Republican counterpart, Sen. Ron Johnson, agrees to support the effort. A spokesperson for Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Democrats have sounded the alarm over Trump’s crypto businesses in recent days. Earlie r Tu esday, Rep. Maxine Waters, who leads her party on the House Financial Services Committee, objected to a joint hearing with the House Agriculture Committee to address market structure legislation and instead hosted her own hearing focused on these crypto tie-ups. A weekend statement from Sen. Ruben Gallego and several other Democrats, indicating they would not support the Senate’s stablecoin bill, also appears to be linked to Trump’s crypto activities. In particular, Eric Trump’s announcement that the Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX would use the Trump-affiliated USD1 stablecoin to close a $2 billion investment into Binance has raised concerns. Additionally, Sen. Chris Murphy introduced a bill on Tuesday to ban the U.S. president and other senior government officials from issuing meme coins or other financial assets. Trump’s expanding crypto ventures raise concerns over transparency and foreign influence Donald Trump, who had previously criticized cryptocurrencies during his time as President, has since embraced the digital asset space through various ventures. His financial involvement in the crypto world has expanded considerably from the existing sale of Trump-branded NFTs in 2022 to the more recent endorsement of the $TRUMP meme coin project. While the investments appear to be all about brand monetization, the businesses are controversial because they are owned in a non-transparent manner and linked to foreign investors. The Senate’s inquiry centers around several entities linked to Trump’s digital asset activities. These entities collectively represent a network of financial and promotional tools that have drawn scrutiny due to their potential for foreign funding and political implications. At the heart of the investigation is the question of whether these cryptocurrency businesses could enable influence-buying or foreign interference in American politics. Lawmakers fear that without proper oversight, such ventures might violate U.S. ethics laws and potentially allow adversarial entities to gain backdoor access to a future Trump presidency. Government ethics rules prohibit federal officials from profiting off their positions or using their brand in ways that could present conflicts of interest. If Trump’s crypto ventures are found to be accepting investments from foreign actors or enabling individuals facing legal scrutiny to participate, it could lead to significant legal and political fallout.

While it might sound like something out of a futuristic novel, major financial institutions are starting to explore this very possibility. A recent report from investment banking giant Morgan Stanley has ignited fresh debate, suggesting that Bitcoin U.S. reserve asset status might not be as far-fetched as some believe, though significant hurdles remain. What Did the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Report Reveal? According to insights from The Crypto Basic, the core of the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin report centers on Bitcoin’s sheer size. With a market capitalization hovering around $1.87 trillion (figures can fluctuate), Bitcoin has grown large enough to be considered alongside traditional reserve assets. The report indicates that holding between 12% and 17% of Bitcoin’s total supply could align with conventional standards for national reserves. This isn’t just a theoretical exercise. For an asset to be considered a viable reserve, it typically needs deep liquidity, a significant market size, and a degree of global acceptance. Bitcoin, despite its relatively young age compared to gold or major fiat currencies, is starting to tick some of these boxes, at least in terms of market valuation. However, Morgan Stanley was quick to temper expectations. While the market cap is impressive, the report explicitly highlighted that Bitcoin’s notorious volatility remains a major challenge. Reserve assets are meant to provide stability and confidence, not subject a nation’s wealth to wild price swings. Unpacking the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal The discussion around Bitcoin as a U.S. reserve asset isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s closely linked to a growing, albeit controversial, movement advocating for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . This proposal, gaining traction among some policymakers, suggests the U.S. should proactively accumulate Bitcoin as a strategic national asset. Proponents argue that such a reserve would: Act as a Hedge: Potentially protect against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. Ensure Future Relevance: Position the U.S. at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. Diversify National Wealth: Offer an alternative to traditional assets that may face different economic pressures. Strengthen National Security: Potentially provide a non-sovereign asset base less susceptible to political pressure tied to fiat systems. This idea, however, faces considerable opposition. Critics raise concerns about the risks involved, the lack of historical precedent for a nation holding such a volatile and decentralized asset, and the potential political fallout from significant losses if the market declines. The Double-Edged Sword: Potential Benefits vs. Bitcoin Volatility Risk Let’s delve deeper into the core tension identified by Morgan Stanley: the potential benefits versus the significant risk. The allure of holding a Bitcoin U.S. reserve asset is clear for its proponents: Diversification: Bitcoin’s price movements have historically shown low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, offering potential diversification benefits to a national portfolio. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s fixed supply (capped at 21 million coins) appeals to those seeking a store of value resistant to inflationary pressures caused by excessive money printing. Potential for Appreciation: While risky, the long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin offers the possibility of significant returns, potentially increasing national wealth. Embracing the Digital Future: Holding Bitcoin signals a nation’s readiness to engage with the evolving digital economy and potentially participate in future decentralized financial systems. However, these benefits are shadowed by the substantial Bitcoin volatility risk . Unlike gold or stable government bonds, Bitcoin’s price can swing dramatically – 10%, 20%, or even more in a single day. For a national reserve, which is meant to be a bedrock of economic stability and confidence, such volatility is deeply problematic. Imagine the public reaction if a significant portion of the nation’s wealth were to drop by billions or trillions of dollars overnight due to a market correction. This inherent instability is the primary reason why central banks and treasuries have been hesitant to embrace Bitcoin as a core reserve asset, despite growing institutional interest. Beyond Borders: The Global View on Cryptocurrency Reserve While the U.S. debate is prominent, the idea of a Cryptocurrency reserve is being quietly considered in various forms globally. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and holds some Bitcoin on its balance sheet, though this is a unique case for a smaller economy and differs from a large-scale reserve strategy for a major power. Other nations are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as a digital evolution of their fiat currency, which is a different concept entirely from holding decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a reserve. The global landscape shows a mix of curiosity, caution, and outright skepticism towards integrating decentralized cryptocurrencies into national balance sheets. No major developed nation has yet signaled concrete plans to establish a significant Cryptocurrency reserve based on Bitcoin or similar assets, primarily due to the same risks identified by Morgan Stanley – volatility, regulatory clarity, and security. What’s Next? Navigating the Future of Digital Reserves The Morgan Stanley report, coupled with the ongoing debate around a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , underscores a critical juncture in global finance. It highlights that major financial players are seriously evaluating the potential role of digital assets like Bitcoin at the highest levels. For investors, this ongoing conversation is significant. It suggests continued institutional interest and potential future adoption, which could influence market dynamics. However, it also reinforces the need for caution and a clear understanding of the inherent risks, particularly volatility. For policymakers, the challenge is immense. They must weigh the potential long-term benefits of embracing digital assets against the immediate and significant risks. Key questions revolve around: Developing robust and secure custody solutions for national digital asset holdings. Establishing clear regulatory frameworks. Addressing the energy consumption debate surrounding proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Gaining political and public consensus for such a move. The path forward for a Bitcoin U.S. reserve asset is anything but certain. It involves complex technical, economic, and political considerations. The conversation is evolving rapidly, driven by technological innovation and shifting global economic landscapes. In Conclusion: Morgan Stanley’s assessment that Bitcoin’s market cap makes it large enough to be considered a U.S. reserve asset is a landmark statement, reflecting the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. It validates the scale Bitcoin has achieved. However, the report’s equally strong emphasis on the lingering threat of volatility serves as a crucial reminder of the challenges that must be addressed before Bitcoin could realistically join the ranks of traditional, stability-focused national reserves. The debate over a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will undoubtedly continue, pushing boundaries and forcing a deeper examination of what constitutes value and security in the digital age.

This isn’t just a technical story; it’s about how a leading AI company structures itself, impacts investors, and navigates intense regulatory scrutiny. The latest update involves a major OpenAI Restructuring plan, moving away from its previous, somewhat unusual setup. This shift has big implications, not least for potential IPO Prospects and how the company balances its mission with commercial goals. Why the Shift in Corporate Structure? OpenAI announced a new corporate structure plan following discussions with attorneys general in Delaware and California. These states have been watching closely as OpenAI sought to change its unique arrangement where a nonprofit board oversees for-profit operations. The core of the new plan is to convert OpenAI’s for-profit entity into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). However, this PBC will still remain under the control of OpenAI’s original nonprofit board. This change aims to address concerns from both regulators and investors. Regulators are interested in ensuring AI development benefits humanity, aligning with OpenAI’s stated mission. Investors, who have poured billions into the company, expect a return on their investment. A more conventional Corporate Structure could potentially satisfy both parties, offering greater clarity and potentially simplifying future fundraising efforts. What Does Public Benefit Corporation Mean for OpenAI? A Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) is a type of for-profit entity that is legally required to consider the impact of its decisions not only on shareholders but also on society and the environment. While still focused on profit, a PBC has a broader mission embedded in its charter. In OpenAI’s case, this likely means the PBC will be obligated to consider the benefit of artificial general intelligence for all humanity, echoing the nonprofit’s original charter. Under the proposed structure, the OpenAI nonprofit will control and hold a significant shareholder position in the new PBC. This differs from a previous plan that would have spun the for-profit arm out from under the nonprofit’s direct control. This continued control by the nonprofit, while potentially appeasing some concerns about mission alignment, introduces complexities, particularly regarding asset ownership and decision-making authority. Navigating AI Regulation and Legal Pressure The backdrop to this OpenAI Restructuring is increasing pressure from various fronts, including growing calls for clearer AI Regulation . Attorneys general have been involved, reviewing OpenAI’s plans to ensure they align with legal and charitable obligations. Just recently, former OpenAI employees urged state AGs to block the restructuring, arguing it conflicted with the company’s founding charitable principles. Major investors, including Microsoft and Softbank, are also key stakeholders. Their multi-billion-dollar investments are reportedly contingent on a successful restructuring. Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest partner, is reportedly seeking assurances that its investment is adequately protected under the new Corporate Structure . Approval from these key investors is crucial for the plan’s success. Perhaps the most public pressure comes from Elon Musk, an OpenAI co-founder now competing with the company. Musk has not only filed a lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission but also reportedly made a significant takeover bid for the nonprofit assets to complicate the for-profit transition. A recent court decision denying some of OpenAI’s motions in Musk’s lawsuit was seen as a small win for him and may have influenced OpenAI’s change in course, though OpenAI leadership has reportedly denied this connection. Challenges for OpenAI’s IPO Prospects One significant question raised by the new structure is its impact on OpenAI’s IPO Prospects . While the shift to a Public Benefit Corporation makes a public offering theoretically possible (nonprofits cannot go public, but PBCs can), experts highlight potential hurdles. A major challenge is the ownership of core intellectual property (IP). Corporate governance experts like Stephen Diamond note that if the critical AI technology and IP remain at the nonprofit level, merely licensed to the PBC, what exactly would an IPO represent? Shareholders typically invest in a company that owns and controls its primary assets. If the PBC only has a license to the valuable IP held by the nonprofit, the investment proposition becomes less clear and potentially less attractive to public market investors. Furthermore, the continued control by the nonprofit board means shareholders in the PBC would likely have limited influence over major corporate decisions, unlike in a typical public company. This limited shareholder control could make an IPO much more difficult, according to experts like Rose Chan Loui from UCLA’s Law Program on Philanthropy and Nonprofits. While OpenAI states an IPO is theoretically possible under the plan, they currently have no intention of going public, according to a spokesperson. What Does This Mean for the Future? OpenAI’s decision to pursue this new Corporate Structure is a direct response to the complex web of regulatory scrutiny, investor expectations, and internal/external pressures it faces. The move to a Public Benefit Corporation controlled by the nonprofit attempts to bridge the gap between its mission and commercial realities. However, the path forward is not without challenges. The structure’s complexity, particularly regarding IP ownership and shareholder influence, casts a shadow over future IPO Prospects and fundraising efforts. Success hinges on appeasing regulators, securing investor confidence (especially Microsoft’s), and navigating ongoing legal battles, such as the one with Elon Musk. The outcome of this OpenAI Restructuring will be a critical case study in how leading AI companies balance rapid commercialization with ethical considerations and their founding missions, all under the watchful eye of increasing AI Regulation .

According to a report by Watcher Guru, New Hampshire’s governor has officially signed into law a bill that permits the state to invest portions of its general fund and revenue stabilization fund directly into Bitcoin and other digital assets. This move positions New Hampshire at the forefront of US State Crypto adoption, making it the first state to finalize legislation introducing Bitcoin as a reserve asset at the state level. What Does the New Hampshire Bitcoin Law Actually Do? At its core, the newly signed legislation grants the New Hampshire state treasurer the explicit authority to manage investments in digital assets. This isn’t just a theoretical possibility; the law specifically allows for the allocation of funds from two key state accounts: the general fund and the revenue stabilization fund. These funds are crucial for the state’s financial health, covering everything from daily operations to preparing for economic downturns. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects of this law: Investment Authority: The state treasurer is empowered to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Eligible Funds: Investments can be made using money from the state’s general fund and revenue stabilization fund. Asset Class Expansion: This adds digital assets to the list of approved investment vehicles for state funds, which traditionally include things like bonds, stocks, and other conventional assets. Oversight: While the treasurer has the authority, the management and specific strategies would likely be subject to established state investment protocols and potentially further guidelines. This is a departure from the norm. While some municipalities or public pension funds might have explored indirect exposure or specific blockchain technologies, this is the first instance of a US state directly authorizing investment in Bitcoin as a reserve asset via finalized legislation. Why is This State Bitcoin Investment So Significant? The significance of New Hampshire’s decision cannot be overstated. It represents a tangible step by a US state government to embrace a new and often debated asset class. For years, discussions around Government Bitcoin Adoption have largely been theoretical or focused on national governments (like El Salvador). New Hampshire brings this conversation to the state level within the United States. Consider these points on its significance: First of Its Kind: As the first state with finalized legislation for direct state-level Bitcoin investment, New Hampshire sets a precedent. Legitimacy Boost: A state government treating Bitcoin as a legitimate investment option, even for a portion of its funds, lends credibility to the asset class in the eyes of traditional finance and other governmental bodies. Potential Catalyst: This could encourage other states to explore similar possibilities, leading to a domino effect of State Bitcoin Investment discussions and potential legislation across the country. Reserve Asset Focus: The mention of using funds like the revenue stabilization fund suggests an interest in Bitcoin not just for speculative gain, but potentially as a hedge or alternative store of value, aligning with a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy. This isn’t merely an abstract policy discussion; it’s a concrete legislative action that could influence future financial strategies for public funds. Potential Benefits: Why Would a State Invest in Bitcoin? Investing public funds comes with immense responsibility. New Hampshire’s lawmakers and governor likely weighed the potential benefits against the risks. So, what might be the motivations behind this pioneering New Hampshire Bitcoin Law? Possible benefits include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often touted as a potential hedge against inflation due to its fixed supply. States, like individuals and corporations, are susceptible to the devaluation of fiat currency. Allocating a small percentage to Bitcoin could be seen as a way to preserve purchasing power over the long term. Potential for High Returns: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically offered significant returns over certain periods, outperforming many traditional assets. A prudent, small allocation could potentially boost overall portfolio performance. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk, although Bitcoin’s correlation can change. Attracting Innovation and Talent: By embracing digital assets, New Hampshire might signal that it is a forward-thinking state, potentially attracting blockchain companies, crypto entrepreneurs, and tech talent, boosting its local economy. Exploring Future Financial Technologies: Governments need to understand emerging technologies. Investing in digital assets provides hands-on experience and understanding of this evolving financial landscape. These potential benefits highlight a strategic perspective, looking beyond short-term price movements towards long-term financial health and technological engagement. What Are the Challenges and Risks Involved? No investment is without risk, and digital assets are known for their volatility. The New Hampshire decision is not without its potential downsides and challenges. Key challenges and risks include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods. This volatility could lead to significant paper losses on the state’s investments, potentially drawing criticism. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US is still evolving. Changes in federal or state regulations could impact the legality or viability of such investments. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. State funds would need institutional-grade security protocols. Custody Issues: Securely storing digital assets (custody) is complex. The state treasurer’s office would need to navigate reliable and secure custody solutions. Public Perception: Not all citizens or lawmakers may agree with using public funds for volatile assets like Bitcoin. There could be public relations challenges and political debate. Lack of Precedent: Being the first means there’s no established playbook for a US state managing a Bitcoin reserve. They will be navigating uncharted territory. These risks underscore the need for careful planning, robust risk management, and transparency in how these investments are handled. How Might This Influence Other States? New Hampshire’s pioneering step could very well serve as a case study for other states. Governments often look to their peers for successful models and policy ideas. If New Hampshire’s State Bitcoin Investment proves successful, demonstrating prudent management and potential benefits, it could accelerate discussions elsewhere. States might consider: Forming Study Committees: Legislatures might form committees to study the feasibility and implications of digital asset investments for state funds. Drafting Similar Legislation: Lawmakers in other states might draft bills mirroring New Hampshire’s law, tailoring it to their specific state’s financial structure and legal framework. Exploring Different Digital Assets: While Bitcoin is often the entry point, states might also look into other digital assets or broader blockchain-related investments. Developing Specific Investment Guidelines: States would need to develop clear guidelines on what percentage of funds can be invested, which assets are permissible, and risk management protocols. The US State Crypto landscape is still nascent, but New Hampshire’s action has certainly injected momentum into the conversation. Is This Part of a Broader Government Bitcoin Adoption Trend? While New Hampshire is the first state with this specific law, there have been other instances of government entities interacting with crypto. Cities like Miami have explored initiatives involving crypto, and some public pension funds have gained exposure through investment in companies or funds related to blockchain and digital assets, albeit often indirectly. Globally, El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, a much more radical step than New Hampshire’s investment strategy. However, New Hampshire’s move is significant because it occurs within the US federal system and involves state-level reserve management. This action by New Hampshire contributes to a growing narrative around Government Bitcoin Adoption, suggesting that even within developed economies, public entities are starting to seriously consider how digital assets fit into traditional financial systems and investment strategies. It moves the conversation from ‘if’ governments will engage with crypto to ‘how’ and ‘when’. Actionable Insights for the Reader What does New Hampshire’s decision mean for you, whether you’re a crypto investor, a taxpayer, or just following the news? Here are some takeaways: Increased Legitimacy: This state-level approval adds another layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin and digital assets, potentially influencing broader public and institutional perception. Watch Other States: Keep an eye on legislative developments in other states. New Hampshire’s move could trigger similar proposals elsewhere. Understand Public Finance: This highlights how public funds are managed and the evolving strategies states might employ to ensure financial stability and growth. Risk Management is Key: The risks faced by a state investing in Bitcoin are similar to those faced by individual investors – volatility, security, regulatory changes. This underscores the importance of robust risk management in any crypto investment. Potential for Infrastructure Growth: Increased government interest could spur the development of more secure and regulated infrastructure for holding and managing digital assets. New Hampshire’s New Hampshire Bitcoin Law isn’t just local news; it has implications for the wider digital asset ecosystem. Conclusion: A Landmark Step Towards a Digital Future? New Hampshire’s decision to allow state investment in Bitcoin and other digital assets is a landmark event in the US. By granting the state treasurer the authority to allocate portions of key state funds into this new asset class, New Hampshire has become the first state to enact finalized legislation supporting a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy at the state level. While potential benefits like inflation hedging, diversification, and attracting innovation are clear, the state must also navigate the significant challenges posed by volatility, security risks, and regulatory uncertainty. This move is a crucial development in the broader trend of Government Bitcoin Adoption and could serve as a blueprint or catalyst for other states considering similar steps. It signals a growing recognition of digital assets within traditional finance and governance structures in the United States.

44258666,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157783,1746583244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shock: US Crypto Regulation Hearing Collapses Over Donald Trump Crypto Ties,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-hearing-collapses/,"A highly anticipated joint congressional hearing aimed at tackling the complexities of US crypto regulation recently ended in dramatic fashion, collapsing before it even truly began. This sudden breakdown wasn’t due to a lack of interest in the topic, but rather a deep political rift centered around concerns over former U.S. President Donald Trump crypto connections and the potential for conflicts of interest among officials involved in the digital asset space. Why the House Crypto Hearing Hit a Wall The planned session was intended to bring together lawmakers from different committees to discuss and potentially forge a path forward for comprehensive US crypto regulation . However, according to reports, House Democrats raised significant objections, fundamentally disagreeing with the scope and focus proposed for the joint meeting. Their primary concern? The growing involvement of prominent political figures, including former President Donald Trump crypto activities, in the digital asset market. This fundamental disagreement proved insurmountable, leading to the unprecedented decision to scrap the joint format. Instead of a unified front, lawmakers retreated to their respective corners: Republicans: Proceeded with a separate roundtable discussion focused primarily on the technical and economic aspects of crypto regulation, aiming to understand the technology and potential frameworks for oversight. Democrats: Convened their own meeting, shifting the focus sharply towards ethics, potential corruption risks associated with politicians holding or promoting digital assets, and discussing the possibility of a politician crypto ban . This split starkly illustrates the deep divisions within Congress regarding how to approach the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies. It’s not just about technology or finance; it’s increasingly becoming entangled with political ethics and potential conflicts of interest. The Donald Trump Crypto Connection: A Point of Contention The specific mention of Donald Trump crypto ties as a reason for the hearing’s collapse highlights a growing concern among some lawmakers. As a former president and potential future candidate, his engagement with digital assets – including owning crypto and promoting related ventures – raises questions about potential influence and whether his financial interests could impact future policy decisions should he return to office or continue to be a public figure influencing policy debates. Democrats argued that ignoring these potential ethical issues and conflicts of interest would render any regulatory discussion incomplete or even compromised. They believe that establishing clear ethical guidelines, or even implementing a politician crypto ban on trading or profiting from digital assets while in office, is a necessary prerequisite for developing fair and effective US crypto regulation . The Intensifying Crypto Policy Debate This incident underscores how the crypto policy debate in the U.S. is multifaceted and often contentious. While there’s broad agreement that some form of regulation is needed, there’s significant disagreement on: Key Areas of Disagreement in the Crypto Policy Debate: Area Republican Focus (Generally) Democrat Focus (Generally) Primary Goal Fostering innovation, market clarity, investor protection through defined rules. Consumer protection, financial stability, preventing illicit use, addressing ethical concerns. Regulatory Approach Potentially creating new frameworks, assigning clear agency roles (CFTC vs. SEC). Utilizing existing regulations where possible, strong enforcement, potentially new ethics rules. Key Concerns Over-regulation stifling growth, lack of clarity, U.S. competitiveness. Fraud, scams, market manipulation, systemic risk, political conflicts of interest. Ethics Angle Less emphasized in general regulatory discussions. High priority, focus on transparency and potential restrictions for officials. The collapse of the joint House crypto hearing is a clear symptom of this broader political deadlock. When lawmakers can’t even agree on the agenda for discussing US crypto regulation , passing comprehensive legislation becomes an even more daunting challenge. Pushing for a Politician Crypto Ban The Democrats’ decision to hold a separate session specifically focused on proposing a politician crypto ban highlights their urgency regarding this ethical dimension. Similar to rules preventing insider trading in traditional markets, proponents argue that officials making decisions about crypto policy should not be in a position to profit from those decisions based on their holdings or privileged information. This proposal aims to remove potential conflicts of interest and build public trust in the regulatory process. Whether such a ban gains traction remains to be seen, but its emergence as a central point of discussion demonstrates the increasing scrutiny on the intersection of personal finance, political power, and the digital asset landscape. The concerns over Donald Trump crypto holdings likely serve as a prominent example fueling this push. What This Means for the Future of US Crypto Regulation The failure of this House crypto hearing is undoubtedly a setback for those hoping for swift and clear US crypto regulation . It signals that political disagreements, particularly those touching upon ethics and high-profile figures like Donald Trump crypto involvement, can easily derail progress. Challenges Ahead: Continued Uncertainty: The lack of a unified approach leaves the crypto industry and investors operating in a fragmented and uncertain regulatory environment. Slow Pace of Legislation: Deep political divisions make passing comprehensive crypto bills through both the House and Senate a difficult, time-consuming process. Focus Shift: The emphasis on ethical concerns, while important, can sometimes overshadow broader discussions about market structure, innovation, and consumer protection frameworks. While separate discussions are still happening, they lack the potential impact of a joint, bipartisan effort. Moving forward, bridging this political divide will be crucial for establishing effective US crypto regulation that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring market integrity. The entanglement of the crypto policy debate with the personal financial interests of politicians, highlighted by the focus on figures like Donald Trump crypto connections and the call for a politician crypto ban , adds a complex layer to an already challenging legislative task. Conclusion: Political Gridlock Delays Crypto Clarity The dramatic collapse of the planned joint House crypto hearing is a stark reminder of the political hurdles facing the development of clear US crypto regulation . Deep disagreements, fueled in part by concerns over high-profile figures like Donald Trump crypto ties and calls for a politician crypto ban , have split lawmakers into separate camps with differing priorities. This fragmentation slows progress on a critical issue for the digital asset industry and leaves stakeholders waiting for clarity. Until these political divisions can be bridged, the path towards comprehensive crypto policy debate and effective regulation in the United States will remain challenging and uncertain.

RCO Finance has raised over $31 million from its ongoing presale as its institutional backing continues to surge. Its user signups have also surged considerably in the past few weeks. Read on to see why experts say Dogecoin could become one of the fastest-growing tokens in the market. Dogecoin Struggles with Volatility in Early May Dogecoin holders are now in a tough position as the token struggles to maintain its recent growth. Despite a recovery in late April, Dogecoin has struggled to maintain those gains, yielding to high volatility. Market charts show that Dogeoin is now trading at $0.1731 following its 4.23% drop over the past week. In contrast, Dogecoin’s 30-day chart shows a 2.64% jump. Following Dogecoin’s volatility, some experts have shifted their stance on earlier growth predictions that said Dogecoin would return to the $0.25 mark by June. With Dogecoin struggling to maintain upward momentum, RCO Finance offers AI-powered tools that allow traders to make smarter, more informed decisions, positioning it as an alternative for those seeking a more stable and scalable option. As a result, RCO Finance is quickly gaining attention as a promising option for those seeking more stable and scalable returns. RCO Finance Surges Following Support from a Major Early ChatGPT Investor In a landscape crowded with DeFi projects promising innovation, RCO Finance emerges as a platform that not only delivers but redefines expectations. As a result, a major early investor into ChatGPT has taken notice of RCO Finance. With its AI-integrated trading system, RCO empowers traders with real-time market insights, personalized strategies, and risk-optimized execution—all in a single, easy-to-use interface. At the core of RCO Finance’s appeal is its mission to democratize finance.

This multi-market access is seamlessly powered by AI algorithms that continuously scan and analyze data, providing users with the kind of smart decision-making support typically reserved for institutional investors. These AI algorithms power RCO Finance’s intuitive dashboard, which comes with smart portfolio management, showing asset breakdowns, market values, and growth trends. These features allow traders to track portfolio health in real time while offering easy navigation across devices. RCO Finance users also enjoy an AI-powered dashboard that offers real-time investment analytics powered by AI. Traders can track deposits, profits, withdrawals, and total account value.

With trading volume climbing and features like LaunchLab and perpetuals gaining traction, the big question returns: Can RAY break back to $8 or maybe even $18 before the end of 2025? Raydium has solid momentum, but there’s another name drawing attention quickly. Unstaked (UNSD) , a low-market-cap AI project, just raised nearly $1 million in under a week through its public presale. Unlike many early tokens, Unstaked already has AI agent infrastructure built and planned to launch right after the token listing. Let’s break down where Raydium could go next, and why Unstaked might offer even bigger potential in timing, utility, and return. Raydium Forecast: Solid Growth Ahead, But Some Volatility First Raydium’s April rally brought it back into the spotlight. Analysts tracking key signals like the RSI and MFI are noticing a possible cooldown coming. With RSI at 74.46 and MFI above 80, the data points to overbought territory, and some believe a dip toward $2.20 could be next. That said, the bigger picture still looks good for Raydium. As Solana bounces back and meme coin trading stays strong, Raydium could keep rising. It’s already holding its spot as the third-biggest DEX by volume, at times even beating Uniswap v3. New tools like LaunchLab and upcoming cross-chain moves through Wormhole could push the project even further. Analyst models suggest RAY could close the year somewhere between $3 and $8. Looking ahead to 2030, some bullish projections even call for $15 to $30 if DeFi keeps gaining traction and Raydium keeps improving. Unstaked (UNSD): AI-Powered Growth With Early ROI Potential While Raydium benefits from Solana’s DeFi rebound, Unstaked brings something entirely new: AI agents built to scale Web3 communities with no human input. Unstaked lets users launch smart AI agents that handle tasks like posting, moderating, and boosting engagement on platforms like Telegram and X. These agents aren’t in testing; they’re complete systems set to go live once the token lists, ready to support Web3 projects hands-free. What sets it apart is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) system, a built-in reward system that tracks agent performance and pays in UNSD tokens only when the work meets set standards. Put simply, no work means no reward. This makes for a transparent AI setup where everything depends on real output. Right now, Unstaked is in Stage 2 of its public presale at $0.006695, aiming for a $0.1819 launch price. That means early buyers could see 2,700% ROI, backed by a $20 million liquidity pool already locked. Unlike RAY, which has mostly priced in its big moves since 2021, Unstaked is at the beginning, gaining attention with over $950,000 raised from new buyers. Unstaked and Raydium: A Side-by-Side Look at Potential Raydium is a DeFi/DEX token on the Solana network with uses in governance and liquidity incentives. It is live and fully operational, benefiting from high trading volumes and growing total value locked (TVL). Price forecasts suggest a moderate range of $3 to $8 in 2025, with more optimistic estimates exceeding $15. Unstaked, on the other hand, is an AI Agent Protocol that operates across multiple chains. Its token utility revolves around agent rewards and protocol governance. Although it’s currently in its presale phase, it has already raised nearly $1 million. The projected ROI from its presale price to launch is 2,700%. Its key advantage is being the first to market with functional AI agents and a built-in reward system. Raydium offers scale and liquidity in DeFi, but Unstaked presents a compelling early-stage opportunity in a rapidly emerging AI segment. Why Early AI Access Might Lead to Big Gains Unstaked isn’t here to compete with DeFi giants like Raydium. It’s here to solve a new challenge: how to automate and scale Web3 activity without hiring large teams. With mini apps like Notcoin going viral and most NFT or DeFi platforms relying on X and Telegram, Unstaked’s value is clear. It brings ready-made automation and tracks every result on-chain, offering measurable value that starts immediately after listing. The project has already raised nearly $1 million in just days, showing that buyers aren’t waiting for exchanges; they’re acting now. Raydium Is Proven, But Unstaked Could Multiply Fast Raydium remains strong in the DeFi space, and if markets stay hot, it could reach $8–$15 again with Solana’s rise. But if your goal is to find real upside from a working product, Unstaked may be the stronger play. It’s still early, but presale momentum, working tools, and token setup make it one to watch in 2025. You can still buy in during Stage 2, but once Stage 3 begins, today’s crypto presale price might be gone for good.

ADA Climbs to $0.63 & PEPE Whales Accumulate,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ai-unlocks-massive-1747-roi-potential-ada-climbs-to-0-63-pepe-whales-accumulate/,"Guesswork is being replaced by real-time analysis and smart algorithms. Many crypto platforms now include advanced tools, but only a few provide true data-backed forecasting power. Cardano (ADA) and Pepe (PEPE) are gaining traction, boosted by whale interest and social momentum. However, Web3 ai brings a deeper level of forecasting accuracy. Using technologies like GRU models, LSTM networks, and sentiment scanning, Web3 ai delivers insights that help users make decisions based on solid data rather than hype, giving it a clear predictive advantage. Cardano (ADA) Sees Continued Strength Toward $1.7 ADA recently moved up to $0.63, a 2.6% gain that points to upward momentum. Market analysts are pointing toward a $1.7 target, based on growing institutional attention and slow but steady accumulation. Technical patterns also show a rising structure, including an ascending triangle, which generally reflects strength in the trend. Should broader economic conditions hold steady, ADA’s steady fundamentals and stronger participation levels may fuel further price increases. Many observers are keeping watch on its movement toward the $1.7 barrier. Pepe (PEPE) Price Driven by Rising Whale Activity PEPE has seen a major boost in trading activity, with nearly $1.5 billion added recently. Much of this has come from large-scale buyers, often called whales, who are increasing their PEPE holdings. Such activity often hints at price growth expectations. Chart signals also point to strong momentum. The RSI has broken past 50, suggesting higher buying pressure. Also, the 30-period average closing in on the 200-period line may form the classic bullish pattern known as a golden cross. If these signals persist, analysts believe PEPE could move toward the $0.000015 to $0.000025 level in the coming months. Still, given the unpredictable nature of crypto, it’s wise to remain aware of possible swings. Web3 ai: Where Smart Crypto Forecasting Begins Entering this AI-based crypto platform’s presale gives more than just access, it unlocks tools used to read price shifts before they unfold. With systems like GRU and LSTM combined with sentiment analyzers, Web3 ai scans massive datasets to deliver sharper insights. These features provide a technical advantage for anyone aiming to make decisions with more clarity. Currently priced at $0.0003 during its crypto presale , Web3 ai is set to list at $0.005242, offering a projected 1747% ROI by the time it hits the market. This phase presents a narrow window to access AI-powered predictions before they become common in trading platforms. As more systems turn to automation and data models, early access could be the deciding factor in gaining a head start. Those seeking top crypto coins should take note, this is a path to gain early access to analytical tools that could define future trading. The window to lead before AI becomes the norm is now. Final Say! Navigating crypto trends now requires more than instinct; it calls for tools that decode signals in real-time. While Cardano and PEPE generate movement through whale signals and community buzz, Web3 ai equips users with decision-making support drawn from high-speed data scanning. The platform’s AI-based features don’t just provide entry points; they offer full-spectrum analysis. Web3 ai isn’t just about coin access, it enables clearer planning and faster response to shifts in the crypto market.

SUI is back in the spotlight as price forecasts shift upward, thanks to growing activity in DeFi and the upcoming launch of SuiPlay 0X1. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, holds its ground as a favorite for the long term, backed by rising developer interest and all-time high usage stats. Amid these shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming the talk of the presale space, offering an entry at just $0.0019 for a short time. With CEX listings now confirmed and buyers rushing to secure this rare window, BDAG’s presence is getting harder to ignore. Between gaming developments, strong price forecasts, and presale standouts, this month is packed with opportunity. SUI Price Prediction Grows with DeFi and SuiPlay Launch SUI’s price action has turned heads since it bounced back strongly from its April low. After jumping 40% from $1.93 to $3.60, experts have started lifting their year-end SUI price prediction into higher zones. The push is largely due to rising DeFi usage and the much-anticipated launch of SuiPlay 0X1, a platform focused on gaming innovation. These factors are now central to analyst models, many of which now suggest price targets between $5.05 and $6.25, depending on how fast user activity scales in the coming months. SUI’s edge may come from its unique blend of speed and gaming focus. With more staking activity and gameplay interest building up, SUI could soon challenge bigger names among Layer 1 chains. Traders now see SUI’s strategy as a possible game-winner if conditions align by late 2025. Solana Long-Term Outlook Gains Ground with Key Metrics Solana’s long-term outlook is still solid, even with short-term uncertainty on the charts. Some technical indicators show mixed results, but core fundamentals stay strong. Solana just crossed the $400 billion transaction mark, showing it’s still one of the fastest-growing networks in the space. Supporting that, DEX volume has surged 44% in just one week, and user activity keeps climbing. These metrics are reassuring for traders watching SOL hover around the $145 level. If buying pressure returns, a move toward $157 is likely the next target. Analysts say the Solana long-term outlook depends on whether its dApps can continue delivering real value. If fee generation and user growth continue to rise, Solana may stay at the top of Layer 1 rankings throughout 2025. Listings Announcement Coming as BlockDAG Draws Rush at $0.0019 Price BlockDAG (BDAG) has just confirmed plans for listings on centralized exchanges, pulling major attention toward the project. This confirmation is giving fresh confidence to early supporters, while attracting new buyers rushing to get in before the price jumps. Right now, BlockDAG is offering a limited-time entry price of $0.0019, valid only until May 13. This stands in contrast to the Batch 28 rate of $0.0262 and the planned launch price of $0.05. With over $226.5 million already raised and more than 19.7 billion coins sold, the project is seeing a strong final push in its presale phase. The numbers are hard to ignore. Early backers who bought in during Batch 1 are now looking at up to 2,520% in gains. Miner sales have crossed $6.9 million, with 17,310 units sold, proof of growing network strength and community participation. What’s driving the rush is not just pricing. It’s the momentum building around BlockDAG’s future. As the coin moves closer to public trading, this may be the final opportunity to enter before prices move to the open market. For those watching from the sidelines, time is running out to act before this rare offer closes. Wrapping Up SUI continues to rise on the back of DeFi and gaming potential, while Solana holds its lead with unmatched network stats. But all eyes are now on BlockDAG as it heads to major exchanges and offers its special presale price of $0.0019. With early buyers already seeing strong returns and excitement growing around what’s next, the current entry window is one of the last chances to join before public trading begins. For traders seeking top crypto picks this May, BlockDAG might be the opportunity they were waiting for.

While not directly tied to cryptocurrencies, significant international trade agreements, such as the recently announced US India Trade Deal , highlight the dynamic nature of global finance and political relations, factors that often influence broader market sentiment. Understanding these shifts is crucial for any informed investor, regardless of their preferred asset class. Trump Announces Landmark US India Trade Deal Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently made a significant announcement regarding trade relations between the United States and India. According to a report by Watcher Guru on X, Trump stated that India has agreed to eliminate all tariffs on American products as part of a new trade agreement. This move is reportedly aimed at fostering a more equitable and mutually beneficial trade relationship between the two major global economies. The announcement signals a potential turning point in the trade dynamics between the US and India, which have seen various periods of negotiation and disagreement over market access and tariff structures. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can significantly impact the cost of products, affecting both producers and consumers. Their removal, as suggested by Trump, could open up new avenues for American businesses exporting to India and potentially lower costs for Indian consumers accessing US goods. What Does the Removal of India Tariffs US Goods Mean? The core of this potential agreement lies in the removal of India Tariffs US Goods . For years, tariffs have been a point of contention in US-India trade discussions. The US has often argued for greater market access in India, citing high tariffs on various American products, including agricultural goods, automobiles, and manufactured items. Eliminating these tariffs could have several implications: Increased Competitiveness: American products would become cheaper in the Indian market, making them more competitive against domestic goods and products from other countries. Boost for US Exporters: US companies exporting to India could see increased demand and profitability due to lower costs for their Indian buyers. Potential Benefits for Indian Consumers: Reduced tariffs could lead to lower prices for certain American goods in India, offering consumers more choices and potentially saving them money. Simplified Trade Process: Removing tariff barriers can simplify customs procedures and reduce administrative burdens for businesses engaged in bilateral trade. While the announcement from Trump is notable, the specifics of which tariffs would be removed, the timeline for implementation, and the scope of the agreement would be critical details that are yet to be fully disclosed or confirmed by both sides through official channels. Analyzing the Trump India Trade Perspective From the Trump India Trade perspective, this agreement aligns with his long-standing focus on renegotiating trade deals he viewed as unfavorable to the United States. Throughout his presidency, Trump prioritized reducing trade deficits and pushing partner countries to lower their barriers to American goods. His approach often involved using tariffs as leverage to encourage negotiation. This particular announcement, if it materializes into a formal agreement, could be framed as a significant achievement in securing better market terms for US businesses in a large and growing economy like India. It reflects a continuation of the ‘America First’ trade policy aimed at creating what he describes as ‘fair’ trade conditions. It’s important to note that trade negotiations are complex and often involve concessions from both sides. While the focus of the announcement is on India removing tariffs, the full scope of any potential agreement would likely involve commitments or adjustments from the US side as well. The Significance of a Bilateral Trade Agreement Formalizing a comprehensive Bilateral Trade Agreement between the US and India would be a major development. Despite being strategic partners with significant trade volumes, the two countries have not yet concluded a broad free trade agreement. Negotiations have historically faced hurdles related to market access, agricultural subsidies, intellectual property rights, and digital trade. A potential agreement focused on tariff removal could be a step towards a more integrated economic partnership. Such agreements typically aim to: Goal of Bilateral Trade Agreements Potential Impact on US-India Trade Reduce or Eliminate Tariffs & Trade Barriers Lower costs for goods, increased trade volume. Promote Investment Flows Encourage US companies to invest in India and vice versa. Harmonize Regulations & Standards Make it easier for businesses to operate in both markets. Establish Dispute Resolution Mechanisms Provide a framework for resolving trade disagreements. While Trump’s announcement specifically mentioned tariff removal, a full bilateral agreement would likely encompass a much wider range of trade and investment issues. The successful negotiation and implementation of such a deal could significantly deepen economic ties between the two nations. Examining the Potential Economic Impact The potential Economic Impact of India removing tariffs on US goods is multifaceted. For the United States, increased exports to India could support job growth in export-oriented industries and contribute positively to the trade balance. Sectors that have faced high tariffs in India, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and potentially technology, could see notable benefits. For India, while tariff removal might initially expose some domestic industries to increased competition, it could also lead to lower input costs for businesses that rely on imported American components or machinery. Furthermore, access to cheaper US goods could benefit consumers. A formal agreement could also attract more foreign direct investment from the US, bringing capital, technology, and management expertise. However, economic impacts are rarely one-sided. Domestic industries in both countries might face adjustment challenges. The overall success and impact would depend heavily on the specifics of the agreement, the sectors covered, and the pace of implementation. Global economic conditions and other geopolitical factors would also play a role in shaping the ultimate outcomes. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for US-India Trade? The announcement from Donald Trump introduces a new dimension to the ongoing conversation about US-India trade relations. While the details of this potential agreement are yet to be fully elaborated and confirmed by official sources from both governments, it highlights a continued desire from the US side to secure better trade terms with India. Key questions remain: What specific tariffs are included in this agreement? What is the proposed timeline for implementation? Are there reciprocal commitments from the US side? How will this announcement be received and potentially advanced by the current administrations in both countries? The future of US-India trade will depend on continued dialogue, negotiation, and the political will to finalize and implement agreements that are perceived as beneficial by both nations. Such developments in international trade policy are worth monitoring, not just for those directly involved in import/export, but also for anyone interested in the broader economic trends that influence global markets, including the increasingly interconnected world of digital assets. Conclusion: A Step Towards Stronger Economic Ties? Donald Trump’s announcement regarding India’s agreement to remove tariffs on US goods marks a potentially significant step in strengthening US India Trade Deal dynamics. If realized, the removal of India Tariffs US Goods could offer tangible benefits for American exporters and potentially Indian consumers, driving a positive Economic Impact . This development underscores the ongoing efforts to shape the Bilateral Trade Agreement landscape between these two major economies. While details are awaited, the prospect of improved trade terms reflects a continued focus on fostering a more balanced relationship, aligning with the principles often emphasized in Trump India Trade discussions.

Bittensor (TAO), one of the most discussed names, saw a parabolic rally driven by speculation around decentralized machine learning. At one point, social feeds were buzzing with TAO price updates, and many who caught the early wave witnessed serious gains. But now, momentum is slipping. Trading volumes are thinning out, growth is tapering off, and fresh capital is turning its head elsewhere. With altcoins rotating out and newer narratives dominating headlines, presales are regaining serious traction. One project rising quickly through the ranks is Qubetics ($TICS), a utility-based token currently in Stage 33 of its crypto presale . Its unique combination of cross-border functionality, a developer IDE, and real-world payment integration has many analysts already dubbing it the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential in 2025. Bittensor’s Peak Was a Lesson in Timing When Bittensor first dropped, few expected it to grow from a niche AI play to one of the most talked-about assets in the Layer-1 space. Built on a decentralized intelligence economy model, TAO’s architecture was designed to incentivize knowledge-sharing neural networks. For a moment, it appeared as though it would redefine how data is monetized. But like many breakout cryptos, Bittensor’s gains were largely reserved for those who entered early. Its low-circulating supply model added rocket fuel to its initial surge, pushing its valuation beyond expectations. However, as AI hype simmered down and regulatory concerns over training models increased, TAO faced the natural slowdown that comes when exponential growth collides with market reality. TAO’s price appreciation provided early believers with financial windfalls, but today’s entry points offer far less upside. The asset has matured—and so has its risk profile. Meanwhile, presale-stage projects like Qubetics are drawing attention from traders seeking steep ROI potential rather than incremental gains. Qubetics ($TICS) Has Entered the Chat — With Real-World Solutions Qubetics isn’t selling hype—it’s delivering use cases. The token supports a fully integrated Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, complete with user-defined security layers, seamless token swaps, and staking support. But what truly separates it from typical presale tokens is its real-world application engine. $TICS isn’t just a store of value—it’s a tool for solving everyday payment and development challenges. From logistics firms needing fast, low-cost cross-border settlements to freelancers handling recurring international payments, Qubetics is offering a blockchain solution that works outside the speculative loop. And that’s rare in crypto presale environments. Here are the updated presale details: Stage: 33rd Current Price: $0.2302 Tokens Sold: 511 million Total Raised: $16.7 million Holders: Over 25,800 The current entry point still offers exposure to massive upside. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the return is 334%. At $5, that ROI spikes to 2071%. Analysts forecasting a mainnet valuation of $10–$15 have outlined returns as high as 6414%, making it the definitive Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential this cycle. Real-Life Use Cases That Don’t Sound Like Sci-Fi Unlike coins that pitch vague Web3 dreams, Qubetics has built a practical stack. Its ecosystem includes tools developers can use now—like QubeQode, a smart contract IDE that accelerates build times without requiring Solidity mastery. Then there’s the Qubetics Wallet, which connects directly to real-world payment rails and lets users pay in crypto but settle in local currencies across 100+ countries. Think of a small apparel manufacturer in the Philippines sourcing materials from Vietnam, shipping to Australia, and selling to Canada. With Qubetics, payments, settlements, and currency swaps happen in one tap—without going through costly third-party processors or enduring multi-day delays. Even freelancers and digital creators now have a way to receive crypto payments, convert them instantly, and stake idle funds while they wait for client confirmations. Qubetics removes friction, and that’s what real-world adoption looks like. Because of this, experts now classify $TICS not just as a utility token, but as a Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential thanks to its long-term relevance outside the speculation bubble. Why Timing Qubetics Is Like Catching Bitcoin Under $10 Presale coins that survive beyond hype cycles often deliver the largest returns in crypto history. Bitcoin did it. Ethereum did it. And now, analysts are saying Qubetics is built to follow suit—not just because of timing, but because of fundamentals. The current crypto presale price of $0.2302 is still considered an entry window with explosive upside. As market attention shifts from overbought assets like Bittensor to underpriced utility tokens, $TICS could become the next breakout chart everyone’s talking about. Unlike meme coins that rely on viral trends, Qubetics is backed by an ecosystem that’s already solving problems for thousands globally. And that’s the real takeaway here—while Bittensor marked a powerful moment in AI token history, Qubetics is shaping up to define a new era in cross-border blockchain adoption. Final Verdict: Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential Bittensor was the prototype for decentralized AI. It paved the way, built excitement, and rewarded early entries—but it also capped out quickly for anyone late to the party. Now, attention is turning toward tokens that are early in their lifecycle, backed by real-world use cases, and capable of scaling beyond just crypto headlines. Qubetics checks every one of those boxes. With crypto presale momentum, affordable access, and projected post-mainnet prices as high as $15, it’s no longer a hidden gem. It’s the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential , and entry windows are closing fast.

44259252,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157801,1746584435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI in Biology: FutureHouse Unveils Promising Tool for Scientific Discovery,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/futurehouse-ai-biology-tool/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology and science, artificial intelligence continues to push boundaries. FutureHouse, a non-profit organization supported by Eric Schmidt, is making strides in applying AI to complex fields like biology. Their ambitious goal is to develop an “AI scientist” capable of automating significant parts of the research process within the next decade. Recently, FutureHouse provided a preview of their new AI in biology tool, Finch, designed to support “data-driven discovery.” Understanding the FutureHouse AI Research Tool: Finch Finch is positioned as a powerful new AI research tool aimed at accelerating biological discovery. It operates by processing large volumes of biological data, primarily from research papers. Users provide a prompt, such as querying molecular drivers of diseases, and Finch then executes code, generates visual figures, and analyzes the results. FutureHouse co-founder and CEO Sam Rodriques likened its current capabilities to those of a “first-year grad student.” Data Input: Primarily research papers and other biological datasets. Process: Takes prompts, runs code, generates figures, inspects results. Capabilities: Supports open-ended analysis and directed tasks like differential expression analysis. Speed: Capable of performing complex analyses in minutes. Rodriques highlighted the speed aspect, noting that being able to perform these tasks in minutes is a “superpower.” He also mentioned that Finch has already helped FutureHouse’s internal projects uncover “really cool stuff.” The Promise of AI for Scientific Discovery FutureHouse’s initiative aligns with a broader vision shared by many tech leaders: that AI will fundamentally transform the scientific process. The potential for scientific discovery to be massively accelerated by advanced AI tools is a compelling prospect. Leaders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have articulated bold predictions, suggesting AI could speed up breakthroughs, potentially even aiding in finding cures for major diseases like cancer. The field of AI drug discovery is particularly attractive, with market estimates pointing to significant growth. Precedence Research projected the market value at $65.88 billion in 2024, potentially reaching $160.31 billion by 2034. This growth potential underscores the intense interest and investment flowing into this sector. Navigating Challenges in AI Drug Discovery Despite the optimism and market potential, the path for AI drug discovery is not without hurdles. The article notes that evidence of AI leading to major, novel scientific breakthroughs is still limited. Many researchers remain cautious about the current utility of AI in guiding the core scientific process. Real-world applications have faced difficulties. Several companies leveraging AI for drug discovery, such as Exscientia and BenevolentAI, have experienced high-profile clinical trial failures. Furthermore, the accuracy of even leading AI systems, like Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold 3 for protein structure prediction, can vary. Finch itself, while promising, is not immune to errors. Rodriques admitted that the tool currently makes “silly mistakes.” To address this, FutureHouse is actively recruiting bioinformaticians and computational biologists. Their role will be crucial in evaluating Finch’s accuracy and reliability during its closed beta phase, helping to train the tool and improve its performance. FutureHouse AI: Beta Program and Next Steps FutureHouse’s decision to launch Finch in a closed beta and involve domain experts highlights a pragmatic approach to development. By collaborating with bioinformaticians and computational biologists, they aim to refine the tool’s capabilities and build confidence in its outputs before a wider release. This feedback loop is essential for developing a reliable AI research tool that can genuinely assist in complex biological investigations. While the vision of a fully autonomous “AI scientist” is still some time away, tools like Finch represent tangible steps towards augmenting human researchers’ abilities. The ability to quickly process vast datasets and identify potential areas of interest could significantly reduce the time spent on initial analysis, freeing up scientists to focus on experimental validation and deeper investigation. Conclusion: A Step Forward for AI in Biology FutureHouse’s preview of Finch marks an important development in the application of AI to scientific research. While the tool is still in development and faces challenges common to early-stage AI systems, its potential to accelerate data analysis in biology is clear. The success of Finch and similar tools will depend on continued development, rigorous validation, and effective integration into existing research workflows. As the field progresses, AI is set to play an increasingly vital role in driving future scientific discovery , potentially unlocking new insights into biology and health.

The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins , Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement. If passed, the MEME Act prohibits the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, their spouses and children from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting a security, future, commodity, or digital asset, according to the bill’s description. Today I’m introducing a bill - the MEME Act - to ban a President or Member of Congress from issuing a meme coin.

US Representative Sam Liccardo, another Democrat, introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. However, Trump’s party, the Republicans, controls both chambers, and the legislation will need Republican support. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), said in a May 6 statement that the committee is opening a preliminary inquiry into the Official Trump (TRUMP) token, Trump-backed platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and other associated business ventures. As part of the inquiry, the PSI sent letters to the company behind the Trump coin, Fight Fight Fight, and WLFI, asking for records and communications between the companies and the Trump organization.

Main points of interest flagged by the PSI include fees the president is making on the TRUMP token and the nearly 50% spike in value from $9.40 to $13.65 after the TRUMP coin website announced on April 23 that the top 220 holders of the token would be invited to a gala dinner at the White House. Soon after launch on Jan. 18 , the Trump coin hit its all-time high of $73.43, according to CoinGecko. However, it has since lost 85% of its value and is trading for $11.13. More than half of TRUMP holders in profit Roughly two million wallets have bought TRUMP, with an extra 54,000 adding the token to their stash after the dinner announcement, according to data shared with Cointelegraph from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Around 764,000 of these, most with small holdings, lost money on the coin, while the 58 investors in the token have made profits of over $10 million each, totaling an estimated $1.1 billion. At the same time, Chainalysis says the memecoin creator has made $320 million so far, with an extra $1.3 million coming in since the White House dinner announcement.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com. Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun livestream. Source: Hash The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes. “Being fully doxxed has placed me under constant fear of robbery and physical harm. There have been numerous notable figures in the crypto community which have undergone armed robberies in their homes recently.” “With my address publicly known, I have not been able to comfortably reside in any of my family’s homes for months now.” The letter claimed he would “exit public life and fame” and shift his focus to music, conducted in anonymity. In addition to the unverified letter, Legacy.com removed Yu’s obituary, which initially described him as a Stanford “tech prodigy” who scaled the AI content-powered Zerebro protocol into an $800 million ecosystem at its peak. Source: Vee X user and crypto enthusiast “Vee” also claimed that after Yu’s supposed death, one of his wallets offloaded the Zerebro (ZEREBRO) token for USDC ( USDC ), which was then moved to the same address that created the Legacoin (LLJEFFY) token. Vee’s claims were later supported by blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps, which estimated that $100,000 of ZEREBRO was sold and moved to LLJEFFY.

But many experts and analysts believe that goal is unlikely — at least in the short term. To reach $100, XRP’s market value would need to rise to around trillions, more than triple the current size of Bitcoin’s market cap. While XRP is aiming to disrupt massive industries like global payments, tokenized real-world assets, and carbon credits — which together are worth hundreds of trillions — such a price jump is still a long shot for now. The truth is, XRP is making progress and has real-world utility, especially in international payments. But major adoption takes time, especially when working with banks and institutions that move slowly and are still benefiting from traditional systems like SWIFT. That’s why many are urging the XRP community to manage expectations. Altcoin Bale said that while a $100 target may sound exciting, it’s more realistic to prepare for XRP to reach around $20 in the near term. Hitting that level would still represent a strong return from current prices. XRP Price Prediction (Short Term) XRP is currently trading within a falling channel pattern on the weekly chart, a setup that often signals long-term accumulation. Despite the downward trend, analysts suggest the price may be approaching a key support zone that could lead to a reversal. According to the latest analysis, the $1.85 level is seen as a strong support area. $XRP /USDT Weekly Analysis #XRP Price is still moving inside a falling channel with clear accumulation behavior.

The worlds of high fashion, cutting-edge blockchain technology, and immersive gaming are colliding in an exciting new way. Major brands continue to explore the potential of Web3, and Adidas is stepping back into the spotlight with a significant move in the realm of crypto gaming . This time, they’re setting their sights on the Sui Blockchain , partnering with the upcoming third-person shooter RPG, Xociety, for an exclusive NFT Drop . What Are These Exclusive Adidas NFTs All About? Adidas has announced the launch of 2,600 unique mystery box NFTs designed specifically for the anticipated Xociety Game . These aren’t just digital collectibles; they offer tangible utility within the game world, primarily providing exclusive in-game skins featuring iconic Adidas-branded apparel. Imagine decking out your character in virtual Adidas gear as you navigate the futuristic landscapes of Xociety! This initiative builds upon Adidas’s previous successful forays into the Web3 space, demonstrating a continued commitment to exploring digital ownership and community engagement through NFTs. Partnering with a game like Xociety allows Adidas to connect with a new demographic and integrate its brand directly into interactive digital experiences. The NFT Drop Details: Where and When? Mark your calendars! The minting of these highly anticipated Adidas NFTs is scheduled for May 16th. The chosen platform for this exclusive event is Tradeport, a prominent marketplace within the Sui Blockchain ecosystem. This strategic choice highlights the growing importance of Sui as a platform for large-scale brand activations and digital asset launches. Here’s a quick breakdown of what to expect from the drop: Total Supply: 2,600 Mystery Box NFTs Blockchain: Sui Minting Platform: Tradeport Mint Date: May 16th Utility: In-game skins for Xociety featuring Adidas branding Rarity Tiers: Four distinct tiers, suggesting different levels of exclusivity or visual variations for the in-game items. The mystery box format adds an element of surprise and excitement, common in NFT drops and gaming loot boxes, encouraging participation and speculation on which rarity tier players might receive. Why Sui Blockchain ? Adidas’s decision to launch on Sui is noteworthy. While many initial brand NFT projects gravitated towards established chains like Ethereum or Polygon, Sui represents a newer generation of blockchain technology known for its high throughput, low transaction costs, and developer-friendly environment, particularly suited for gaming and high-volume transactions. This could signal growing confidence in Sui’s infrastructure and its potential to support scalable Web3 gaming experiences like Xociety. Sui’s object-centric model is designed to handle parallel processing, making it potentially more efficient for managing dynamic in-game assets and complex interactions compared to account-centric models. This technical advantage could be a key factor in supporting a smooth experience for Xociety players using their Adidas NFT skins. How Does This Connect to the Xociety Game ? Xociety is shaping up to be an intriguing addition to the crypto gaming landscape. As a third-person shooter RPG, it aims to blend action-packed gameplay with role-playing elements and, crucially, Web3 mechanics. The partnership with Adidas provides significant mainstream brand validation for Xociety even before its full launch. The integration of Adidas NFT skins means players who own these digital assets will have a unique way to customize their in-game appearance, potentially offering bragging rights or visual distinction within the game world. This kind of exclusive, branded content can be a powerful driver for both NFT adoption and game engagement. Beyond Skins: The Revenue-Sharing Model One of the most compelling aspects of this collaboration, as reported by Blockworks, is the inclusion of a revenue-sharing deal. While specific details of the model are often complex and depend on the agreement between Adidas, Xociety, and potentially the NFT holders, this suggests that owning these Adidas NFTs could offer more than just cosmetic benefits. Revenue sharing in Web3 gaming can take various forms, such as a portion of in-game transaction fees, marketplace royalties, or other income streams distributed among NFT holders. This model aligns with the Web3 ethos of rewarding players and early supporters, turning passive consumers into active stakeholders with a vested interest in the game’s success. It adds a layer of potential financial benefit on top of the in-game utility, making the NFT Drop even more attractive. Actionable Insights: Getting Involved If you’re interested in potentially acquiring one of these exclusive Adidas NFTs for the Xociety Game , here’s what you should consider: Research Xociety: Understand the game itself. Is it a game you’re genuinely interested in playing? The primary utility of the NFT is tied to the game. Prepare for the Sui Blockchain: Ensure you have a compatible wallet that supports Sui and have some SUI tokens ready for potential minting costs or marketplace purchases. Monitor Tradeport: Keep an eye on the Tradeport platform as the May 16th date approaches for specific minting mechanics, pricing, and any eligibility requirements. Understand the Rarity Tiers: While details are scarce, be aware that there are four tiers, likely impacting the visual design or perceived value of the in-game skin you receive. Assess the Revenue Sharing: Try to find more detailed information about the revenue-sharing model closer to the mint date to understand the potential long-term benefits of holding the NFT. As with any NFT investment or participation in crypto gaming projects, it’s crucial to do your own thorough research (DYOR) and understand the risks involved. Benefits and Challenges This collaboration presents several potential benefits: For Adidas: Deeper engagement with the gaming and Web3 communities, exploring new revenue streams, staying at the forefront of digital innovation. For Xociety: Significant brand visibility and legitimacy boost, attracting a wider audience beyond typical crypto users, exclusive content offering for players. For Sui: Validation as a capable platform for major brand partnerships and gaming applications, increased transaction volume and user activity. For Players/NFT Holders: Exclusive in-game cosmetic items, potential participation in revenue sharing, ownership of a unique digital asset from a major brand. However, challenges exist: Market Adoption: Will mainstream gamers embrace the Web3 elements and NFTs? Execution Risk: The success relies on both the quality of the Xociety game and the smooth implementation of the NFT utility and revenue sharing. NFT Market Volatility: The value of the NFTs on the secondary market can be highly unpredictable. Technical Hurdles: Ensuring a seamless user experience for acquiring and using NFTs within the game. The Growing Trend of Brands in Crypto Gaming Adidas is not the first major brand to venture into crypto gaming or utilize NFTs, but this specific collaboration highlights a maturing trend. We’ve seen various levels of engagement, from simple collectible drops to more integrated experiences. This partnership with Xociety and the focus on in-game utility and revenue sharing represent a deeper integration than many earlier brand NFT projects. This trend is significant because it brings mainstream attention and potentially millions of new users into the Web3 space. As more reputable brands and high-quality games enter this arena, the perceived legitimacy and potential for mass adoption of blockchain technology and NFTs grow. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Digital Assets The upcoming launch of 2,600 exclusive Adidas NFTs on the Sui Blockchain for the Xociety Game is more than just another NFT Drop ; it’s a clear indicator of the evolving relationship between major global brands, blockchain technology, and the interactive world of video games. By offering in-game utility and a potential revenue-sharing model, Adidas and Xociety are attempting to create a more compelling value proposition for digital ownership. This collaboration leverages the unique capabilities of the Sui Blockchain and positions Xociety as a game to watch in the competitive crypto gaming sector. While challenges remain for widespread adoption, initiatives like this pave the way for a future where digital assets from our favorite brands are seamlessly integrated into the virtual worlds we inhabit, offering both cosmetic appeal and potential economic benefits.

The Federal Reserve, under Chair Jerome Powell, is all but certain to keep the fed‑funds corridor at 4.25 to 4.50 percent; CME Group’s FedWatch tool assigns a 98.2 percent probability to an unchanged stance. That near‑certainty, however, has not muffled political noise. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have publicly pressed for lower borrowing costs, yet Powell’s most recent public remarks on 16 April framed monetary policy as “in a wait‑and‑see mode,” adding that the labor market “is in decent shape” but that the Fed’s “obligation is to keep longer‑term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one‑time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.” In effect, the central bank continues to prioritize price stability even as leading indicators imply a cooling economy and a likely pivot to easing in the second half of the year. FOMC Preview For Bitcoin For Bitcoin, the debate is less about whether the Fed blinks tomorrow and more about how algorithmic liquidity and discretionary positioning react to the tone of Powell’s press conference. Crypto trader Josh Rager told his followers on X, “Expect chop chop until FOMC tomorrow. Then after the rate cut announcement, expect volatility. With a reversal during Powell’s speech. That’s my FOMC playbook at the moment.” Although Rager’s baseline presumes an eventual reduction in rates, his near‑term focus is the intraday whipsaw that typically frames the statement‑and‑Q&A window. Related Reading: Strategy Expands Bitcoin Investments With Latest Purchase, Now Holding 555,450 BTC In Total Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) offered a more probabilistic roadmap, emphasizing that his trademarked FOMC‑reversal model has “consistently provided reversals with an over 85 percent chance. If the mechanics continue to play out for this month, that would mean we would (have) top(ped) out this or last week before a significant move down.” Yet he tempers that historical edge by noting that the prevailing quarterly uptrend in Bitcoin could blunt the signal: “That would mean that this and/or next FOMC meeting both have a weakened reversal effect in the midst of what I expect to be a strong uptrend.” In practical terms, he foresees: “I think the most likely scenario (76% chance) is a move up from here and the FOMC reversal gets completely ignored. The smaller chance (24%) is indeed a rather shallow pullback within our stoploss area.” Related Reading: LMACD Indicator Reveals Where The Bitcoin Price Is After Rejection From $97,000 Columbus (@columbus0x) looks to the microstructure for confirmation. Citing a Hyblock heat‑map of liquidations, he expects “a wick below into the box… below the equal lows and also exactly the area that Hyblock has highlighted as a yellow zone,” a region that coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement from the last significant swing low. Should Powell strike a hawkish tone, Columbus anticipates “a deviation below the range low / a retest of the 200‑day SMA, closing the CME gap between $91.8 and$92.4 k – or possibly even dipping into the high $80’s. Nonetheless: trend is up.” Momentum diagnostics add a final layer. Titan of Crypto observes that Bitcoin “is consolidating between last week’s high and low, awaiting tomorrow’s FOMC meeting and Jerome Powell’s speech. Meanwhile, the daily MACD is crossing bearish, signaling slowing momentum.” A confirmed rollover in the histogram would align with the shallow‑pullback scenario outlined by Astronomer and Columbus, yet the consolidation itself keeps higher‑time‑frame trend traders constructive Taken together, tomorrow’s decision appears binary only on the surface; the real determinant is Powell’s forward‑guidance language and its impact on terminal‑rate pricing. If the Chair stresses patience while acknowledging softer data, the curve could begin to discount a June cut, providing a macro tailwind that validates the bulls’ quarterly thesis. Conversely, any hint of renewed vigilance on inflation would embolden short‑term bears hunting liquidity below $92 k. Either way, the tape has little room for complacency: liquidity is thin, options gamma is clustered around the psychologically resonant $100,000 strike, and the narrative energy surrounding a second‑half‑of‑2025 easing cycle is colliding head‑on with the Fed’s near‑term inflation mandate. At press time, BTC traded at $94,097.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) has made a significant move by withdrawing its appeal against prediction market platform Kalshi. This decision is a game-changer, effectively clearing a major hurdle and allowing Kalshi to proceed with offering contracts based on political events. If you’re following the intersection of digital platforms, finance, and regulation, this development is definitely worth your attention. What Led to the CFTC and Kalshi Showdown? The story began when Kalshi, a regulated prediction market exchange, sought approval from the CFTC to list contracts related to political outcomes. Think questions like “Will Party A win the popular vote in State B?” or “Will Candidate C be elected?” Kalshi’s argument is that these contracts function as economic hedges or forecasts, providing valuable information and trading opportunities, similar to how markets predict interest rate changes or commodity prices. However, the CFTC initially rejected these proposals, citing concerns that such contracts could be deemed “contrary to the public interest” or constitute illegal gambling under existing interpretations of commodity law. This rejection wasn’t accepted quietly by Kalshi. Believing their proposed markets were legitimate and fell within the regulatory framework for derivatives, Kalshi took the bold step of suing the commission in 2023. The lawsuit challenged the CFTC’s rejection, arguing it was arbitrary and capricious. Kalshi maintained that their platform provided a structured, regulated environment for predicting future events, distinct from traditional betting or gambling. This legal battle put a spotlight on the evolving nature of prediction markets and how they fit into established financial regulations in the United States. The Significance of the CFTC’s Withdrawal Fast forward to today, the CFTC has withdrawn its appeal against Kalshi. According to reports, both parties agreed to drop the case and cover their own legal costs. This withdrawal isn’t just a procedural step; it marks a substantial victory for Kalshi and the broader prediction markets industry. Here’s why this is a big deal: Path Cleared for Political Betting: The immediate effect is that Kalshi is now free to pursue offering contracts on political events, which was the core issue of the lawsuit. This opens up a new category of markets for their users. Regulatory Signal: The withdrawal, especially under the leadership of Acting Chair Caroline Pham, suggests a potential shift or at least a nuanced approach within the CFTC towards prediction markets. It signals a possible willingness to reconsider or allow certain types of event contracts that were previously viewed with skepticism. Precedent Setting: While not a court ruling on the merits, the CFTC backing down in the face of a legal challenge from a regulated entity like Kalshi could set a precedent or at least embolden other platforms or exchanges looking to list similar event contracts. Validation for Kalshi: For Kalshi, this is a major vindication of their legal challenge and their business model. They stood up to the regulator and achieved their goal of getting the initial rejection overturned implicitly through the withdrawal. What Does This Mean for Political Betting and Prediction Markets? The CFTC’s decision has direct implications for the landscape of political betting and prediction markets in the US . Until now, participating in prediction markets related to politics for US residents often involved using offshore platforms, which come with significant risks, including lack of regulation and potential for fraud. Kalshi, being a regulated US entity, offers a different environment. Here’s a look at the potential impacts: Increased Accessibility: Regulated platforms can potentially attract a wider range of users who might be hesitant to use unregulated offshore sites. Enhanced Transparency and Security: Operating under CFTC oversight means adherence to rules regarding market integrity, customer protection, and financial stability, offering users more confidence. More Accurate Forecasting? Proponents argue that liquid prediction markets can aggregate dispersed information and provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polling or expert opinions. Allowing more topics, like politics, could test this hypothesis further. Innovation in Event Contracts: This could pave the way for other types of event contracts on regulated platforms, expanding the scope of what can be traded beyond traditional financial assets. However, challenges remain. The line between a legitimate prediction market contract and illegal gambling can still be blurry in practice and subject to interpretation. Public perception and ethical considerations around betting on sensitive political events will also continue to be discussed. The Regulatory Environment: A New Approach? The timing of the withdrawal, occurring under Acting Chair Caroline Pham, suggests it aligns with her stated approach to regulation. While the article source mentions her leadership in the dismissal, understanding her broader perspective is key. Generally, there’s been a growing conversation within regulatory bodies about how to handle novel financial products and technologies, including those related to crypto and event markets. This specific outcome might indicate a willingness within the CFTC to: Engage with regulated entities bringing forward innovative proposals. Perhaps favor allowing markets unless there’s a clear and compelling reason based on market integrity or public interest concerns, rather than a blanket prohibition. Address regulatory questions through dialogue or reconsiderations, potentially avoiding protracted legal battles where possible. This doesn’t mean the door is wide open for everything. Regulatory bodies like the CFTC still have the mandate to protect market integrity and the public. But the Kalshi outcome suggests that regulated platforms proposing well-structured event contracts might find a more receptive audience or at least a fairer fight than before. What Does This Mean for Users and the Market? For individuals interested in participating in prediction markets , this development means more options may become available on regulated US platforms. It’s crucial, however, to understand exactly what you are trading. These are complex instruments, and like any market, they involve risk. Actionable Insights: Do Your Research: Understand how prediction markets work, the specific contracts offered, and the potential outcomes. Understand the Risks: You can lose the money you put into these contracts. Treat them as speculative investments, not guaranteed returns. Use Regulated Platforms: The advantage of platforms like Kalshi is regulatory oversight, offering protections not found on unregulated sites. Stay Informed: The regulatory landscape for prediction markets and crypto-related financial products is still evolving. Keep up with announcements from the CFTC and other bodies. The ability for a regulated platform to offer political betting contracts could also influence other market participants. We might see other regulated exchanges explore similar offerings, potentially leading to more diverse and liquid markets for event-based predictions. Looking Ahead: The Future of Prediction Markets in the US The CFTC ‘s withdrawal in the Kalshi case is a landmark moment for prediction markets in the US . It signals a potential thawing in the regulatory stance towards certain types of event contracts, particularly those on regulated platforms. While challenges and debates about the nature and appropriateness of certain contracts will undoubtedly continue, this decision provides a significant boost to the industry’s hopes for expansion within the regulated framework. The focus will now shift to how platforms like Kalshi implement these new offerings and how the CFTC continues to oversee this evolving market segment. It’s a dynamic space, and this development has just added a fascinating new chapter to its story.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days. Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say. It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin ( BTC ) reaches new all-time highs. “The $95,000 level — currently under consolidation — is a critical pivot point, acting as the lower boundary of a three-month range that defined market structure between November 2024 and February 2025,” Bitfinex said in a May 6 markets report. Bitcoin holding above $95K would signal a “structural shift” Bitfinex said that Bitcoin holding above the $95,000 level would signal a “structural shift” back into bullish territory, with a potential upward trend toward retesting its all-time highs. Bitcoin reached its $109,000 all-time high on Jan. 20, just hours before US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $96,730, up 3.03% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, Bitfinex analysts said if Bitcoin fails to hold above $95,000, it could be headed for further downfall. “Failure to hold, however, could turn the region into resistance once more, raising the risk of a short-term rejection and another leg of corrective price action.” They said the next several days will determine whether Bitcoin will be heading “into a sustained breakout or resolves into a retest of lower support zones.” Bitcoin is up 2% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap However, if Bitcoin continues the rally, it may catch many traders offside. Crypto analyst Thomas Fahrer said in a May 7 X post that $400 million of Bitcoin short positions are at risk of liquidation at the $98,000 price level. “Send it,” Fahrer said. Bitcoin is approaching the timeframe many analysts predicted for new highs earlier this year. On March 28, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts projected a best-case target of $123,000 by June . Related: Bitcoin price rallied 1,550% the last time the ‘BTC risk-off’ metric fell this low Around the same time, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said that Bitcoin has a “50% chance” of reaching new all-time highs before the end of June . Since 2013, Bitcoin’s average performance in June has been slightly negative at -0.35%. The upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision on May 7 could also have an impact on Bitcoin’s price. The announcement often sees crypto market volatility both before and after the results are published. However, the latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicates that the futures market sees minimal odds of a rate cut . Meanwhile, overall market sentiment is becoming more positive as Bitcoin’s price approaches the psychological $100,000 price level. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which measures overall market sentiment, has spiked again over the past 24 hours, further into “Greed” territory, jumping 8 points to a score of 67.

For major players like Tether , the issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. This is particularly true as the industry looks towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, notably through RWA tokenization . A significant step in this direction has just been announced: Tether has integrated Chainalysis’ advanced compliance and monitoring tools directly into its Hadron platform. What Does This Tether and Chainalysis Integration Mean? This integration isn’t just a minor update; it’s a strategic move designed to bake institutional-grade oversight directly into the infrastructure of Hadron, Tether’s platform dedicated to tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). By bringing Chainalysis’ capabilities onboard, Tether is significantly enhancing its ability to manage risk and ensure regulatory adherence across its operations, particularly as it expands into the complex realm of tokenized assets beyond its core Stablecoin business. The integration provides several key benefits: Enhanced Risk Detection: Proactively identifying potential illicit activity or high-risk transactions. Real-Time Transaction Monitoring: Keeping a constant watch on transaction flows to spot suspicious patterns as they happen. Know Your Transaction (KYT) Support: Gaining deeper insights into the nature and parties involved in transactions. These tools are fundamental for any entity handling significant volumes of digital assets, but they become even more critical when dealing with the regulatory complexities associated with RWAs. Why is Crypto Compliance Crucial for Stablecoins and RWA Tokenization? As the crypto market matures, regulators worldwide are increasing their scrutiny. Stablecoin issuers, in particular, face intense pressure due to their potential role in the global financial system. Ensuring robust Crypto Compliance isn’t just good practice; it’s becoming a regulatory necessity for long-term viability and broader adoption. For RWA Tokenization , compliance is perhaps even more critical. Tokenizing assets like real estate, stocks, or commodities brings traditional financial regulations into the digital asset space. Investors, especially institutional ones, demand assurances that the digital representation of their assets is handled with the same level of oversight and security as traditional financial instruments. Compliance tools like those offered by Chainalysis provide the necessary infrastructure to meet these stringent requirements. Boosting Trust and Adoption Through Enhanced Stablecoin Oversight The move to integrate Chainalysis directly into Hadron signals Tether ‘s commitment to transparency and security. For a Stablecoin issuer handling billions in value daily, demonstrating proactive efforts in Crypto Compliance is vital for maintaining trust among users, partners, and regulators. This enhanced oversight is particularly appealing to institutional investors and traditional financial firms considering entering the digital asset space via stablecoins or tokenized RWAs. Think of it this way: institutional players operate within highly regulated environments. They need confidence that the digital assets they interact with meet similar standards. By implementing sophisticated monitoring and compliance tools, Tether makes its platforms, including Hadron for RWA Tokenization , more attractive and accessible to this crucial segment of the market, potentially unlocking significant liquidity and growth. Navigating the Future of RWA Tokenization with Robust Crypto Compliance The Hadron platform is designed to be a gateway for bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain. This involves complex processes, including legal structuring, valuation, and ongoing management. Layering strong Crypto Compliance tools from Chainalysis onto this platform from the outset ensures that the RWA tokens issued via Hadron can meet global regulatory standards from day one. This proactive approach can help Tether and its partners navigate the often-uncertain regulatory landscape surrounding tokenized assets. It positions Hadron not just as a technical platform for tokenization but as a compliant infrastructure capable of handling regulated assets. This could accelerate the adoption of RWA Tokenization by providing a trusted and secure environment for issuers and investors alike. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for Tether and the RWA Space Tether ‘s integration of Chainalysis into its Hadron platform is a significant development. It underscores the growing importance of robust Crypto Compliance in the digital asset ecosystem, particularly for major stablecoin issuers and platforms focused on RWA Tokenization . This move enhances security, transparency, and regulatory adherence, paving the way for greater institutional participation and solidifying Tether ‘s position as a leader navigating the future of finance. It’s a clear signal that compliance is not an afterthought but a core component of building scalable and trusted digital asset infrastructure.

But a new DeFi powerhouse with 122,000 daily users and a Binance listing in view is igniting investor frenzy. With a rapidly expanding user base and whispers of a major exchange listing, the crypto community is asking: Could this be 2025’s breakout digital asset? Dogecoin’s Meme Magic Loses Steam As of now, Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.1708 with a substantial market cap of $25.48 billion. Despite its enduring popularity, a closer look reveals cracks in its momentum. A 3.3% daily price decline pairs with a dramatic 33.5% plunge in trading volume to $668 million, raising red flags about fading retail interest. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) supply is uncapped, inherently limiting its long-term price growth. Analysts from CoinDCX place its Q3 2025 price target at $0.55 , suggesting modest returns at best. While Dogecoin’s (DOGE) community remains loyal, a new contender, a DeFi juggernaut backed by institutional clout, is rapidly gaining momentum and challenging the status quo. RCO Finance, with its cutting-edge AI-driven features and clear road to major exchange listings, has the potential to achieve Dogecoin’s transformational ambition. RCOF’s $31M Presale Draws Tech Titans RCO Finance (RCOF) has already raised $31 million in its presale, currently in Stage 8 with tokens priced at $0.16, up 1153% from its Stage 1 entry. The sale has drawn attention from both individual investors and heavyweight institutions. A $7.5 million capital injection from a leading VC helped accelerate its growth, with all Stage 6 and 7 tokens acquired by one tech-focused firm. Further elevating its profile, a Big 5 Tech company, an early backer of ChatGPT, has reportedly invested in RCOF, boosting credibility and investor interest. These endorsements have helped drive over 282,000 app downloads and a daily user count of 122,000 on its Beta platform . The roadmap shows a Uniswap launch set for May 31, 2025, with Binance and Coinbase listings anticipated in the summer. Projections suggest a price range of $1.50 to $2.00 post-listing. RCOF’s upcoming full team doxxing, including a former Microsoft board member, adds a layer of transparency rarely seen at this stage. AI-DeFi Fusion Unlocks New Horizons What sets RCO Finance apart isn’t just its momentum; it’s the platform’s functionality. Its no-KYC structure makes access seamless for global users, unlocking 120,000+ tradable assets across crypto, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and tokenized real estate. RCOF’s standout features include Smart Portfolio Management with real-time allocation charts, customizable watchlists with alerts via Telegram and X, and a Wallet Management tool that offers intuitive oversight of assets, including NFTs and savings. A SolidProof audit reinforces the platform’s security standards. At the heart of this platform lies the AI Robo Advisor. This tool digests real-time data from Reuters and other market feeds to craft custom trading strategies tailored to user profiles. Looking ahead, the Q3 2025 rollout of AI-Powered Simulated Trading will allow users to test strategies using live data without risking capital. This innovative edge places RCO Finance far beyond the meme-fueled charm of Dogecoin. RCOF’s Binance Path to Millions Dogecoin (DOGE), with its infinite supply and meme roots, faces a cap on investor returns. At its current price, even bullish Q3 2025 targets of $0.55 offer limited upside. Unlike its meme-coin counterparts, RCO Finance is structured for scalability, scarcity, and practical use. With 1.124 billion tokens and a robust burn strategy, its model is geared toward sustained value appreciation. According to predictions, RCOF might hit $2.00 after its Uniswap launch, with the token price currently at $0.16. This represents significant upside for early participants. Upcoming listings on major exchanges and backing from a prominent ChatGPT-linked investor are expected to further accelerate adoption. Don’t Miss RCOF’s Last Presale Shot Time is running out. RCOF presale has already drawn $31 million and continues to attract a growing wave of investor interest. With Big Tech billions and Binance looming, Dogecoin’s meme fades against RCOF’s AI-DeFi revolution. Don’t wait. Stake now. Ignite your wealth.

44260542,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157699,1746586840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,UK Crypto Policy: Crucial Clarity on National Reserves,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uk-crypto-reserves-policy/,"In a move that clarifies the United Kingdom’s position on digital assets, the UK Treasury has firmly ruled out the possibility of establishing national cryptocurrency reserves. This announcement provides crucial insight into the government’s approach to the burgeoning crypto space and signals a distinct path compared to other nations. What Exactly Are National Crypto Reserves, and Why Are Countries Considering Them? Before diving into the UK’s decision, let’s understand what national crypto reserves entail. Conceptually, this would involve a country’s central bank or treasury holding a portion of its foreign exchange reserves or national wealth in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, rather than solely in traditional assets like gold, US dollars, or other fiat currencies. The idea of a government crypto strategy that includes reserves has emerged for several potential reasons: Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class to traditional reserves. Hedge Against Inflation: Some view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Strategic Asset: Accumulating digital assets could be seen as building a strategic position in a future digital economy. Potential for Appreciation: Hoping for long-term value growth similar to other reserve assets like gold. However, the concept is fraught with significant challenges, which likely factored into the UK’s decision. Why is the UK Treasury Saying No to National Crypto Reserves? Speaking at the Financial Times Digital Asset Summit in London, UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Emma Reynolds, delivered the definitive statement. According to Decrypt, she explicitly stated the government has no intentions of building a stockpile of cryptocurrencies. Reynolds directly addressed the approach taken by some entities, particularly noting the US government’s handling of seized Bitcoin (which has sometimes involved holding rather than immediate sale). However, she drew a clear line, stating, “We don’t think that’s appropriate for our market.” She elaborated that while the US strategy might be understandable in its context, it simply “does not align with the UK’s direction.” This stance highlights a key difference in how the UK Treasury crypto team views the role of digital assets within the national financial framework. Rather than viewing crypto as a reserve asset to be stockpiled, the UK appears to be focusing on other applications and regulatory frameworks. What Does This Mean for UK Crypto Policy and Innovation? Ruling out national crypto reserves doesn’t mean the UK is ignoring the potential of underlying blockchain technology. Reynolds confirmed that the UK government is actively exploring the potential use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for issuing sovereign debt. This exploration signals a pragmatic approach: leveraging the efficiency and transparency benefits of DLT for core financial infrastructure, while remaining cautious about the volatility and risks associated with holding cryptocurrencies as a national asset. The focus appears to be on facilitating innovation within a regulated environment, rather than engaging in speculative asset accumulation. This decision reinforces the UK’s broader approach to crypto regulation UK , which aims to balance fostering innovation with ensuring financial stability and consumer protection. It suggests the UK sees its role more as a facilitator and regulator of the crypto ecosystem than as a direct participant in holding volatile digital assets on its national balance sheet. What Are the Challenges of Holding Government Crypto Stockpiles? The UK’s decision not to pursue national crypto reserves likely stems from a careful consideration of the significant challenges involved. These include: Extreme Volatility: The price swings of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are far greater than traditional reserve assets, posing significant risk to national wealth. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of crypto securely is complex and vulnerable to hacks or loss of private keys. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving, creating unpredictable risks. Public Perception: Holding volatile, often misunderstood assets could be politically challenging and raise questions about fiscal responsibility. Market Impact: Large government purchases or sales could significantly impact already volatile markets. Lack of Clear Use Case: Unlike gold or foreign currency reserves used for trade or stability, the immediate practical use of crypto reserves for government functions is limited. These factors make a strategy of accumulating national crypto reserves a high-risk proposition that the UK government seems unwilling to undertake at this time. Conclusion: A Clear Path for UK Crypto Engagement The statement from the UK Treasury provides welcome clarity on a specific aspect of the nation’s stance on digital assets. By ruling out national crypto reserves while simultaneously exploring DLT for sovereign debt, the UK government is defining a path focused on leveraging the underlying technology for infrastructure improvements and fostering a regulated environment for private sector innovation, rather than engaging in direct cryptocurrency asset management. This approach aligns with the UK’s ambition to be a global hub for financial technology, prioritizing stable and secure integration of new technologies over speculative government investment in volatile assets.

On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated . Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet. The firm noted that traditional payment rails, such as credit cards, bank transfers and subscriptions, “were built for a pre-internet world.” They’re slow, expensive, geographically limited, and “riddled with manual steps,” it added. However, x402 embeds stablecoin payments directly into web interactions, requiring minimal code integration, and is designed for both humans and AI agents to transact value as easily as exchanging data. x402 payment flow. Source: Coinbase The head of engineering at Coinbase Developer Platform and co-author of the x402 white paper, Erik Reppel, said, “We’re laying the groundwork for an economy run not just by people, but by software — autonomous, intelligent, and always on.” Related: Coinbase sees first crypto transaction between AI agents Gagan Mac, vice president of product management at Circle, said x402 “elegantly simplifies real-time monetization” and unlocks “exciting new use cases like micropayments for AI agents and apps.” Coinbase is launching the new protocol in partnership with AWS (Amazon Web Services), stablecoin issuer Circle, AI company Anthropic and AI-focused proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain Near Protocol . Big benefits for agentic AI AI agents can achieve economic autonomy by independently transacting without human intervention. The protocol enables AI agents to access paid resources in real-time based on their needs and eliminates dependency on pre-paid credits, API keys, or human-managed accounts. AI agents can also provision and pay for hardware resources in real-time, access specialized data sources through micropayments, and pay other AI systems for services. The x402 protocol essentially transforms AI agents from tools that require constant human interaction into autonomous economic actors that can independently discover, purchase and utilize resources to accomplish their goals. Developers can use the protocol to monetize APIs, create software unlocks and enable metered services that dynamically charge users based on actual resource usage, while content creators can monetize their content without the need for blanket subscriptions or credit card minimums and fees.

According to Avery, this kind of calculated buying, often used by institutions to reduce price impact, could be in preparation for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. When asked why ETF hype isn’t already driving prices higher, Avery responded that the impact may be “more gradual” over time.

In Q1, XRP outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), rallying nearly 50% in early February, according to Ripple’s latest report . The XRP/BTC ratio rose 10%, and XRP investment products attracted $37.7 million in inflows, just shy of Ethereum’s $214 million year-to-date. A leveraged XRP ETF launched in April, and spot ETF filings from Franklin Templeton and Bitwise are pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ripple has also settled its long-running SEC lawsuit with a $50 million payment, but the market reaction has been subdued, potentially because it was already priced in. While the fundamentals point to long-term potential, the technical picture remains mixed. On the bullish side, XRP has defended key support around $2.05 and remains above the 200-day estimated moving average near $1.99. Momentum indicators such as the stochastic relative strength index show oversold conditions. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news A move toward the $2.30–$2.40 range may be possible if there is a clear break above the 10-day and 20-day EMAs, which are at $2.17 and $2.19, respectively. But it’s impossible to overlook the bearish scenario. XRP continues to trade below its short- and mid-term moving averages, and the RSI is neutral at 48.7, showing a lack of strong upward momentum. Momentum and moving average convergence divergence indicators also tilt slightly bearish, suggesting sellers are still active. If XRP loses the $2.05 support level, it risks slipping back toward $1.99 or even lower, which could invalidate the bullish whale accumulation thesis in the short term.

Last around $11 per token, the TRUMP coin price has stabilized just above its 50DMA at $10.50 following a volatile few weeks. Towards the end of April, the Trump coin price doubled from its earlier monthly lows to briefly break back above $16, following US President Trump’s announcement that the top 220 holders of the meme coin would be invited to a White House Gala dinner event. This announcement triggered a major surge in demand for TRUMP , but has also received an intense amount of criticism. Democrat Senator Jon Ossoff recently claimed, in announcing a Gala event for the top 220 TRUMP holders, the President is “selling access”, which could be an impeachable offense. Sen. Jon Ossoff on saying Trump’s conduct has exceeded past standards for impeachment, citing crypto venture. “Oh, I stand by those comments 100%,” he said. “It appears that the president’s business and family are being personally enriched through this cryptocurrency venture.” pic.twitter.com/wfuamlqqJi — Manu Raju (@mkraju) May 5, 2025 Meanwhile, fellow Democrat Senator and arch crypto skeptic Elizabeth Warren has been vocal in criticizing another Trump family crypto endeavor, the launch of the USD1 stablecoin via their DeFi project World Liberty Financial. The Trump family stablecoin surged to 7th largest in the world because of a shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates—a foreign government that will give them a crazy amount of money. The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this kind of corruption. pic.twitter.com/4is9KgpXQb — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) May 4, 2025 In wake of a controversy filled few weeks, its no wonder that the TRUMP coin price has slipped back from late April highs in the $16 area to around $11. The next sources of volatility for TRUMP are likely to be related to broader macro themes, such as tomorrow’s FOMC meeting. However, big volatility could be coming on May 22. Could the TRUMP coin price 10x? Why May 22 Could Trigger a 10x Rally (Or Total Collapse) May 22’s TRUMP diner at the White House has the potential to spark significant TRUMP coin price volatility. If the event gets a lot of coverage – perhaps President Trump attends and makes newsworthy comments, or even talks policy – this could trigger FOMO, producing a major TRUMP coin price rally similar to that seen in April. Could TRUMP rally all the way up to $100? Well, if TRUMP coin is suddenly seen as the best vehicle through which to secure access to the President, maybe. After all, that would broaden the coin’s appeal beyond just retail investors, but to business and potentially world leaders who want to get into Trump’s ear. The TRUMP coin price rose above $70 in January following its launch, so nothing should be ruled out. That said, an even bigger risk if a post-event price dump. Trump’s attendance isn’t guaranteed—attendees may get an NFT instead—potentially triggering a sell-off if expectations are unmet. In simpler terms, the Gala dinner could end up being a “sell the news” event. Against the backdrop of a struggling altcoin market, this seems very plausible. The macro backdrop remains difficult for risk assets like meme coins, with the US economy facing upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth, and the Fed currently not eager to make any major monetary policy shifts as it monitors developments. And with the TRUMP meme coin receiving so much backlash from the Democrats right now, who are using it as part of their excuse to hold up legitimate stablecoin legislation , risks seem tilted to the downside. Investors should expect a lot of two way volatility in the TRUMP coin price in the weeks ahead. Better Alternative to Consider – Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy (SOLX) , a Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, has raised over $34 million in its presale, with tokens priced at $0.0017. HyperSpeed Achieved! 33 Million Raised! pic.twitter.com/HgswKcnnVM — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 3, 2025 Designed to address Solana’s network congestion and high transaction failure rates—evident during the TRUMP coin launch in January—Solaxy processes transactions off-chain, enhancing speed and reliability. Its interoperability with Ethereum facilitates cross-chain liquidity, and a smart contract audit by Coinsult confirms its security. In contrast, TRUMP coin, currently at $11, faces volatility due to political controversy surrounding its May 22 gala and an impending 800 million token unlock, risking price dilution. Solaxy’s focus on infrastructure and scalability may offer a more stable investment compared to TRUMP’s reliance on speculative sentiment, making it a noteworthy consideration for investors.

He called it “earth-shattering” and “a positive development for the country,” but gave no clear details about what it is. He did say it’s not about trade, which has led to plenty of speculation online. Some people believe the announcement could involve Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. There are rumors it could be about a U.S. government crypto reserve or some kind of support for digital assets. One crypto personality said the news will be “game-changing” and should come before Monday. Trump said, “We have a big announcement to make, not about trade but something else but it’s going to be a truly earth shattering and a positive development for this country and for the people of this country.” Others think the announcement may be about international politics. Online AI assistant Grok shared a few possible options based on current global events. These include a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza that could last five to seven years, a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia that accepts some Russian territorial gains, or a new nuclear deal with Iran in exchange for easing sanctions. All of these would be major steps toward global peace, but none have been confirmed.

44261120,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157817,1746588029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,NEAR ETF Excitement: Bitwise Submits SEC Filing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-near-etf-filing/,"Big news is circulating in the cryptocurrency world! Asset management firm Bitwise has taken a significant step towards bringing NEAR Protocol into the mainstream financial landscape by filing an application for a spot NEAR ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development, initially reported by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on X (formerly Twitter), marks a notable moment for the NEAR ecosystem and the broader digital asset market. While the path to approval is often lengthy and complex, the filing itself signals growing interest from established financial players in offering regulated investment products tied to specific cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Does a Bitwise NEAR Filing Mean? When Bitwise files an S-1 application with the SEC, it’s essentially submitting a registration statement for a new security – in this case, shares of a proposed exchange-traded fund that would hold NEAR tokens directly. This is the initial formal step in the process for seeking regulatory approval to list and trade the fund on a national securities exchange. Here’s a breakdown of what this entails: Formal Intent: The S-1 filing clearly states Bitwise’s intention to launch a spot NEAR ETF , demonstrating a commitment to creating this investment vehicle. Detailed Disclosure: The application provides extensive information about the proposed fund, including its investment strategy (holding physical NEAR), risk factors, creation and redemption mechanisms, fees, and the parties involved. Beginning of SEC Review: The filing triggers the SEC’s formal review process. This involves regulators examining the application to ensure it complies with securities laws and protects investors. Transparency: The S-1 becomes a public document, allowing investors and the market to scrutinize the proposed fund’s structure and potential implications. This move by Bitwise, a firm already active in the crypto fund space, underscores the increasing demand for regulated and accessible ways to invest in digital assets like NEAR. Why is a Spot NEAR Protocol ETF Significant? The potential launch of a spot NEAR Protocol ETF is significant for several reasons, primarily revolving around bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market: Benefits for Investors and the Market: Accessibility: An ETF allows investors to gain exposure to NEAR through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need to set up crypto wallets, manage private keys, or navigate cryptocurrency exchanges. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying and selling shares throughout the trading day. Familiarity: The ETF structure is well-understood by traditional investors and financial advisors, potentially attracting capital from individuals and institutions who are hesitant to invest directly in crypto. Regulatory Clarity (Post-Approval): An approved SEC-regulated ETF operates under stringent oversight, potentially offering investors a greater sense of security and trust compared to unregulated avenues. Potential for Increased Demand: Institutional investors, such as pension funds and wealth managers, often have mandates that restrict them from holding direct cryptocurrency but allow them to invest in regulated ETF products. A SEC NEAR ETF could unlock significant institutional capital. Potential Challenges and Considerations: SEC Approval Process: The SEC’s review is rigorous and can take months, involving multiple rounds of questions and amendments to the S-1 filing. Approval is not guaranteed. Market Volatility: While the ETF structure provides accessibility, the underlying asset (NEAR) remains subject to significant price volatility inherent in the crypto market. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can impact overall investment returns compared to direct ownership (though direct ownership has its own costs and complexities). Competition: If approved, a NEAR ETF would compete with other potential crypto investment products and direct NEAR ownership. The filing for a Bitwise NEAR ETF joins a growing list of applications for single-asset crypto ETFs, following similar efforts for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This trend suggests a broader push within the asset management industry to offer diverse regulated crypto exposure. How Does This Relate to Other Crypto ETF Developments? The filing for a NEAR Protocol ETF comes after significant developments in the broader Crypto ETF landscape, particularly the approval and successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year. The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs set a precedent and demonstrated a potential shift in regulatory comfort with spot crypto products. Here’s a brief comparison: Feature Spot Bitcoin ETFs (Approved) Proposed Spot NEAR ETF (Under Review) Underlying Asset Bitcoin (BTC) NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Current Status Approved and Trading S-1 Application Filed, Under SEC Review Precedent Set the precedent for spot crypto ETFs in the U.S. Builds on the precedent, tests SEC’s stance on altcoin ETFs Focus Largest and most established cryptocurrency Focus on a specific, prominent layer-1 blockchain protocol While the Bitcoin ETF approvals provide a hopeful backdrop, the SEC’s approach to approving ETFs for other cryptocurrencies is not guaranteed and will likely involve careful consideration of each asset’s market structure, regulatory status, and potential for manipulation. What’s Next for the Bitwise NEAR ETF Application? The S-1 filing is just the beginning. The application will now go through a formal review process with the SEC. This process typically involves: Public Comment Period: The SEC will solicit public comments on the proposed rule change required to list the ETF shares. SEC Questions and Amendments: SEC staff will likely issue comments and questions to Bitwise regarding the filing, requiring amendments to the S-1. Decision Deadlines: The SEC has specific deadlines to make decisions on such filings, although these deadlines can often be extended. The outcome of this application will be closely watched by the crypto community and traditional finance alike. An approval would not only be a significant win for NEAR Protocol but could also pave the way for ETFs tracking other individual cryptocurrencies, further integrating the digital asset market into traditional investment vehicles. Actionable Insights for Investors and NEAR Enthusiasts For those interested in NEAR Protocol or the broader crypto market, this filing offers several key takeaways: Stay Informed: Follow news from Bitwise, the SEC, and reputable financial news sources for updates on the application’s progress. Bloomberg analysts like James Seyffart are valuable resources for tracking these filings. Understand the Product: If approved, understand that a NEAR ETF is a regulated financial product traded on stock exchanges. Research its structure, fees, and risks before investing. Evaluate NEAR Protocol: An ETF filing doesn’t change the fundamentals of NEAR Protocol itself. Continue to research the technology, ecosystem, and development progress of NEAR independently. Consider Market Impact: While an ETF could bring increased demand, the price of NEAR will still be influenced by broader market trends, regulatory news, and project-specific developments. The filing by Bitwise is a strong signal of increasing institutional interest in NEAR Protocol. It represents a potential future avenue for investors to access NEAR through a familiar and regulated wrapper. Conclusion: A Promising Step for NEAR’s Integration Bitwise’s S-1 filing for a spot NEAR ETF is undoubtedly a significant and exciting development for the NEAR Protocol ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency investment landscape. While the regulatory path ahead involves hurdles and no outcome is guaranteed, this formal step by a reputable asset manager like Bitwise highlights the growing maturation of the crypto market and the increasing demand for regulated investment products. The potential approval of a SEC NEAR ETF could unlock new avenues for institutional and retail investors alike, potentially increasing liquidity and adoption for NEAR. As the SEC reviews the application, the market will be watching closely to see if NEAR will be the next cryptocurrency to gain a regulated ETF vehicle in the United States.

In a significant move for the cryptocurrency and fintech world, Strike, the popular Bitcoin Lightning-based payments application founded by Jack Mallers, has officially entered the lending space. This isn’t just any lending; they’re launching a new Bitcoin-backed lending program, allowing both individual and corporate accounts to borrow funds using their Bitcoin holdings as collateral. This development is poised to offer a fresh avenue for accessing liquidity without requiring users to sell their precious Bitcoin. What is Bitcoin-Backed Lending and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into Strike’s specific offering, let’s quickly cover the concept of Bitcoin-backed lending . At its core, it’s a financial service that allows Bitcoin holders to borrow traditional currency (like USD) by pledging their Bitcoin as security. Think of it like getting a mortgage or a car loan, but instead of real estate or a vehicle, your collateral is your Bitcoin. Why would someone do this? The primary motivation is often to access liquidity without triggering a taxable event by selling their Bitcoin. If you believe your Bitcoin will appreciate further, selling it to cover immediate expenses or investments means losing potential future gains and incurring capital gains taxes. Lending against it allows you to get the cash you need while still maintaining ownership and exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside. Exploring the Strike Lending Program Details Strike’s new program, initially rolling out in select regions across the U.S., brings this concept to their user base. According to reports from The Block, here are the key details: Loan Amounts: The program targets significant borrowers, offering loans ranging from a minimum of $75,000 up to $2 million. This indicates a focus on high-net-worth individuals or businesses rather than smaller retail loans. Loan Term: Loans are structured with a fixed 12-month term. This provides clarity on the repayment timeline for borrowers. Annual Percentage Rate (APR): The loans come with a minimum 12% APR. Borrowers need to factor this interest cost into their financial planning. Collateral Asset: Exclusively uses Bitcoin (BTC) as the required collateral. Availability: Currently limited to specific U.S. regions, with potential expansion expected later. This structure suggests Strike is entering the market with a focused, potentially more conservative approach compared to some other players in the broader crypto lending space, especially concerning the fixed term and minimum loan size. The Power of Bitcoin Collateral Using Bitcoin collateral for a loan is a double-edged sword, but for many Bitcoin holders, the benefits outweigh the risks, provided they understand the mechanics. Here’s why it’s powerful: Accessing Capital Without Selling: As mentioned, this is the biggest draw. You get the cash you need for investments, business expenses, or personal use without liquidating your Bitcoin holdings. Maintaining Bitcoin Exposure: You continue to hold your Bitcoin, meaning you benefit if its price increases during the loan term. Potential Tax Advantages: Borrowing against an asset is generally not a taxable event, unlike selling the asset for a gain. ( Note: Always consult with a tax professional regarding your specific situation. ) Speed and Simplicity (Potentially): Crypto-backed loans can sometimes be approved faster than traditional loans, although the process for Strike’s program is yet to be fully detailed publicly regarding speed. However, the volatility of Bitcoin means using it as collateral introduces significant risk. This is where understanding the terms, particularly the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and potential margin calls, becomes crucial. Potential Benefits of Strike Lending for Users For the target audience – likely high-net-worth individuals and businesses – Strike’s entry into Strike lending offers several potential advantages: Firstly, it leverages Strike’s existing infrastructure and reputation. Users familiar with Strike’s payments app might find the lending service a natural extension. The integration within the Strike ecosystem could potentially streamline the process. Secondly, it provides a regulated on-ramp for obtaining liquidity against Bitcoin in select U.S. regions. Operating within regulatory frameworks is often a priority for larger borrowers. Thirdly, the fixed 12-month term provides predictability. Borrowers know exactly when the loan is due, which can help in financial planning, especially for business use cases. Understanding the Risks in Crypto Lending While the benefits are clear, anyone considering crypto lending , including Strike’s new program, must be fully aware of the risks involved. The primary risk stems directly from using a volatile asset like Bitcoin as collateral. 1. Bitcoin Price Volatility: This is the most significant risk. If the price of Bitcoin drops substantially, the value of your collateral decreases. Lending platforms use a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to manage this risk. If the LTV ratio (Loan Amount / Collateral Value) exceeds a certain threshold due to a price drop, you will likely face a margin call. 2. Margin Calls: A margin call occurs when the value of your collateral falls below the required level. The platform will require you to add more Bitcoin collateral or repay a portion of the loan to bring the LTV back within acceptable limits. Failing to meet a margin call can result in the forced liquidation (selling) of your Bitcoin collateral by the lender to cover the loan balance. This is the worst-case scenario, as you lose your Bitcoin at a potentially unfavorable price. 3. Interest Rate Risk: While Strike’s initial APR is stated as a minimum, potential changes in market conditions could influence future offerings or the overall cost of borrowing. 4. Platform Risk: Although Strike is a known entity, using any platform involves counterparty risk. Borrowers entrust their collateral to the platform. These risks highlight the need for borrowers to maintain a careful watch on the price of Bitcoin and have a plan in place to address potential margin calls. Who is This Program For? Insights from Jack Mallers Strike Given the minimum loan amount of $75,000, Strike’s program is clearly targeting a specific demographic. This isn’t designed for someone looking to borrow a few thousand dollars for an emergency. Instead, it’s aimed at: High-Net-Worth Individuals: Individuals with substantial Bitcoin holdings who need access to significant capital for investments, real estate, or other large expenditures without selling their BTC. Businesses: Companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet and need working capital, funds for expansion, or to cover operational costs. This focus aligns with a growing trend of integrating Bitcoin into more traditional financial strategies for larger players. It reflects a vision, potentially driven by Jack Mallers Strike , to bridge the gap between the Bitcoin economy and traditional finance, offering sophisticated financial products built around digital assets. Actionable Insights Before Taking a Bitcoin-Backed Lending Loan Considering a Bitcoin-backed lending loan from Strike or any other provider? Here are some crucial actionable insights: Understand the LTV Ratio: Know the initial LTV and, more importantly, the margin call LTV threshold. Calculate how much the price of Bitcoin needs to drop before a margin call is triggered. Have a Plan for Margin Calls: Decide beforehand how you will handle a margin call. Will you add more collateral, or do you have alternative funds available to repay part of the loan? Monitor Bitcoin Price Constantly: You must actively track the market price of Bitcoin to avoid being caught off guard by a margin call. Assess Your Need for Liquidity: Is this loan truly necessary? Could you obtain funds through traditional means? Compare the costs and risks. Read the Terms and Conditions Carefully: Pay close attention to interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and the liquidation process. Consult a Financial Advisor: Especially for large loan amounts, getting professional financial advice is highly recommended. The Broader Impact on Bitcoin and Finance Strike’s launch of a Bitcoin-backed lending program is more than just a new product offering; it’s a signal of the maturing Bitcoin ecosystem. It demonstrates that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate form of collateral that can be used in sophisticated financial products. This could pave the way for more institutional and corporate adoption, as it provides tools for managing liquidity without divesting from Bitcoin holdings. While other platforms offer similar services, Strike’s move is noteworthy due to its focus on the Lightning Network for payments and its prominent role in advocating for Bitcoin adoption. Expanding into lending adds another layer to its financial services suite, positioning Strike as a more comprehensive financial platform in the future. Conclusion: A Powerful New Tool, But Proceed with Caution Strike’s foray into Bitcoin-backed lending represents a powerful new opportunity for Bitcoin holders, particularly businesses and high-net-worth individuals, to access significant liquidity without selling their assets. Leveraging Bitcoin collateral allows users to potentially benefit from future price appreciation while meeting current financial needs. However, like all forms of crypto lending , it comes with inherent risks, most notably the volatility of Bitcoin and the potential for margin calls and liquidation. Understanding these risks and having a clear strategy is paramount. As Jack Mallers Strike continues to build out its financial ecosystem, this lending program marks a significant step in making Bitcoin a more functional and integrated part of the broader financial world.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, who often value pseudonymity and decentralized communication, this presents unique challenges. The recent uproar on Reddit highlights a growing concern: how do we ensure genuine human interaction in the face of increasingly sophisticated AI bots? This incident is pushing Reddit towards implementing new measures, specifically focusing on Reddit verification , which could significantly impact user experience and privacy expectations. The Invasion of AI Bots on Reddit The catalyst for Reddit’s impending changes was a large-scale experiment that saw a swarm of AI-powered bots infiltrate the ‘Change My View’ subreddit. These bots were designed to mimic human users convincingly, posting over 1,700 comments and adopting diverse, sometimes controversial, personas. The goal was to test AI’s persuasive capabilities. For Reddit, a platform built on the premise of real people sharing real opinions, this was a serious threat to its core identity and trustworthiness. The company condemned the experiment, calling it ‘improper and highly unethical’. The presence of advanced AI bots isn’t just a nuisance; it risks degrading the quality of discourse and making it difficult for users to trust the information they encounter. This is particularly relevant in fast-moving spaces like cryptocurrency, where accurate, human-driven insights are crucial. Why Reddit Verification is Becoming Necessary Reddit’s decision to explore stricter verification stems directly from the threat posed by these advanced AI impersonators and evolving regulatory pressures. CEO Steve Huffman indicated that the platform would begin working with third-party services to verify user humanity. This marks a significant shift for Reddit, which has historically allowed users to create accounts with minimal personal information. The core reasons driving this change include: Maintaining Authenticity: Protecting the platform’s reputation as a place for genuine human interaction. Combating Manipulation: Preventing bots from being used for spam, misinformation, or political manipulation. Meeting Regulations: Adhering to new laws, particularly those requiring age verification on social media platforms in various locations. While the specifics remain under wraps, this move towards more robust Reddit verification is a direct response to the escalating capabilities of generative AI. The Tension: Online Anonymity vs. Verification Reddit’s historical strength lies in providing a space for online anonymity , allowing users to share sensitive experiences, express unpopular opinions, and engage in discussions they might avoid if their real identity were attached. This anonymity fosters open dialogue and protects users in vulnerable situations. However, the need for verification directly clashes with this foundational principle. The question becomes: how can Reddit verify humanity or age without compromising the anonymity that users value? This is the central challenge the platform faces. Many users fear that any form of verification, even through third parties, could eventually lead to a loss of the protective layer that online anonymity provides. Concerns Over Data Privacy Introducing third-party verification services raises significant concerns about data privacy . These services often require government-issued IDs or other sensitive personal information to confirm identity or age. Sharing this data with social media platforms, even indirectly through partners, carries inherent risks. The fear is that this sensitive information could be vulnerable to data breaches or, more troublingly, be accessed by authorities. The article highlights a stark example involving Meta handing over private messages that led to legal charges, illustrating the potential consequences when platforms hold identifiable information linked to sensitive discussions. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stated the company would be ‘extremely protective’ of user data and push back against excessive demands, but the risk remains a major point of contention for users who prioritize data privacy . The Future of Social Media Verification Reddit’s planned changes are indicative of a broader trend in social media verification . As AI technology advances and regulatory demands increase, platforms are under pressure to find ways to confirm the identity or humanity of their users. While established methods often involve linking accounts to phone numbers or requiring ID uploads, newer, more speculative technologies like ‘proof of human’ concepts are also being explored. The challenge for all platforms, including Reddit, is to implement effective verification measures that combat bots and comply with regulations without eroding user trust, compromising online anonymity , or jeopardizing data privacy . The outcome of Reddit’s approach will likely set a precedent for how other platforms navigate this complex issue in the age of advanced AI. Conclusion Reddit is at a crossroads, forced to balance its founding principle of anonymity with the urgent need to combat sophisticated AI bots and meet regulatory requirements. The move towards mandatory verification, while necessary to preserve the platform’s authenticity and integrity against AI threats, introduces significant friction for users who rely on online anonymity and are concerned about data privacy . How Reddit implements these changes, and whether they can find a way to verify users without revealing their identities, will be crucial in determining the future character of the platform and serve as a case study for the evolving landscape of social media verification in the age of pervasive AI.

Historically, when both assets rally, Bitcoin tends to outperform — and with gold making fresh highs, analysts believe Bitcoin could be next. Kiyosaki Choose Bitcoin Over Gold and Silver “21 million is 21 million.” That’s the message from Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , in a recent post on X. While he owns gold and silver mines, Kiyosaki emphasized that unlike metals, Bitcoin’s supply is permanently fixed at 21 million coins — no central bank or mining firm can produce more. This scarcity, he argues, is what makes Bitcoin the most reliable hedge against inflation, monetary debasement, and global uncertainty. “I can always mine more gold if prices rise,” he said, “but Bitcoin is locked forever.” Gold Hits $3,500 — Will Bitcoin Follow? Gold surged to $3,500 in April before cooling to $3,237 as of May 5 — still a 33% gain YTD. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has remained flat with just a 0.82% rise this year. But this may be the calm before a breakout. Crypto analyst Cryptollica points to historical patterns: from March 2020 to March 2022, gold rose 35.5%, while Bitcoin soared over 1,100%. If a similar trend plays out, BTC could rally to $155,000, especially if it breaks its current resistance range. Fed Rate Decision Could Be the Trigger The upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision is another catalyst. Despite Donald Trump pushing for a rate cut, the CME FedWatch Tool shows a 97% probability the Fed will keep rates steady this week. However, if policy shifts in the second half of 2025, it could unleash a wave of liquidity — boosting both gold and Bitcoin. Why It Matters Scarcity narrative is fueling long-term Bitcoin confidence. Gold is up 33% YTD , while Bitcoin is still consolidating . Kiyosaki joins a growing chorus of investors positioning BTC as a safer, inflation-resistant asset. Kiyosaki’s endorsement is more than just hype — it taps into Bitcoin’s core value proposition.

Recently, Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM, voiced a strong opinion that resonates across the tech sector: federal investment in AI research and development needs to grow, not shrink. Speaking in an interview with Bitcoin World, Krishna made his position clear, especially concerning current proposals impacting Federal AI Funding . Why is the IBM CEO AI Concerned About Funding Cuts? Arvind Krishna, like many prominent figures in technology, sees robust federal investment as fundamental to national competitiveness and technological advancement. “We have been an extremely strong advocate — and this is both the company and me personally — on that federally funded R&D should be increased,” Krishna stated. This is not just a corporate stance but a personal conviction, emphasizing the unequivocal belief that more government investment in R&D is crucial for the future. The concern stems from proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration. These proposals target significant reductions in federal grantmaking and scientific research programs, a departure from previous policy approaches. Key offices focused on AI research, such as the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP) within the National Science Foundation (NSF), have already faced steep budget reductions. Staffing cuts are also impacting institutions like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the NSF itself. The Impact on AI R&D Funding The proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 includes calls to significantly cut the NSF’s funding, targeting billions of dollars currently awarded to AI R&D projects. Other federal agencies that contribute substantially to AI research, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Energy (DOE), also face potential cuts. Beyond direct research funding, there are threats to programs like the CHIPS Act, designed to boost domestic semiconductor production critical for AI technologies. The office responsible for managing CHIPS Act funds saw significant restructuring recently. These potential reductions are viewed with alarm by the tech industry. Groups like The Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) have formally warned that these cuts could severely hobble America’s global leadership position in AI. This isn’t just about academic research; federally funded research has a proven track record of yielding high economic returns. According to the U.S. Joint Economic Committee, the annual return on federally funded research is estimated at 25-40%, a figure that compares favorably to returns from top-tier venture capital funds (15-27%). Investing in AI R&D Funding is not just about science; it’s about economic strategy. Protecting US AI Leadership Krishna highlighted the broader economic and competitive implications. “We believe that [federal R&D funding] right now [is] happening at close to historic lows in terms of percentage of GDP,” he told Bitcoin World. He argued that increasing federally funded R&D has a profoundly positive effect on the economy, stimulating growth, enhancing the competitiveness of the United States on the global stage, and fostering the development of technologies essential for the future. Maintaining US AI Leadership requires sustained, significant investment. Challenges from Government AI Policy Shifts While advocating for increased funding, IBM has also experienced the direct impact of shifting Government AI Policy and budget priorities. During their Q1 earnings call in April, IBM reported the cancellation of 15 federal contracts, representing $100 million in future revenue. While federal contracts constitute a relatively small portion of IBM’s overall business (between 5% and 10% of its consulting practice), these cancellations illustrate the tangible effects of government spending adjustments on even large corporations. Despite these challenges, Krishna expressed optimism about the future. He believes that the importance of R&D funding for critical technologies like AI, quantum computing, and semiconductors will lead to a positive correction. “I expect that in a year federally funded R&D for AI, for quantum, for semiconductors — I expect it to be in as good or in a better shape than it is today,” Krishna stated, suggesting a potential turnaround in funding levels. Summary: The Urgent Need for AI Investment The message from IBM CEO Arvind Krishna is clear and aligns with warnings from across the tech industry: cutting federal funding for AI R&D is detrimental to America’s economic future and global standing. While facing immediate impacts from budget shifts, there remains hope that policymakers will recognize the high returns and strategic importance of investing in foundational research and development. Sustained Federal AI Funding is seen not just as a government expense, but as a vital investment in innovation, competitiveness, and the future of technology.

Several on-chain metrics appear to support Coinvo’s assessment, as ETH accumulation addresses continue to stack the digital asset despite lackluster price performance over the past few years. Ethereum May Be Due A Rally Soon Although ETH has risen 8% over the past two weeks, it remains down 43% over the past year, trading around $1,700 at the time of writing. From its all-time high (ATH), Ethereum is down 63.6%, in stark contrast to Bitcoin (BTC), which is trading just 13.7% below its ATH. Related Reading: Ethereum Capitulation Nearing Its End? Key On-Chain Metric Reveals Insights Ethereum’s relatively poor performance compared to other major cryptocurrencies has raised questions about its long-term outlook. While Bitcoin benefits from its first-mover advantage and broader institutional adoption, Ethereum faces increasing competition from rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL), SUI, and Polkadot (DOT). Despite prevailing negative sentiment, some analysts believe ETH could be on the verge of a turnaround. Coinvo, for instance, claims that Ethereum is significantly undervalued and could be poised for a massive rally. The trader shared the following chart leveraging the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score – a metric used to identify potential market tops and bottoms. According to the chart, Ethereum’s MVRV Z-score has now entered the green zone – between 0 and -1 – a range that historically signals a market bottom and possible trend reversal. Meanwhile, inflows into Ethereum accumulation addresses have surged to historic highs. In an X post, analyst CryptoGoos shared a chart showing record ETH inflows into these addresses in 2025. ​​High inflows to accumulation addresses indicate that long-term investors are actively buying and holding ETH, even during market downturns. This behavior often reflects growing confidence in Ethereum’s future value and suggests a potential bullish sentiment building beneath the surface. In a separate post, CryptoGoos also highlighted that Ethereum’s exchange reserves are at a multi-year low. Diminishing reserves on exchanges point to reduced selling pressure and a tightening supply, which could strengthen ETH’s scarcity narrative and drive prices higher in the near term. ETH Holders Not ‘Bullish Enough’ Noted analyst Crypto Rover drew parallels between ETH’s current price action and BTC’s 2021 trajectory. According to the analyst, if Ethereum mirrors Bitcoin’s past performance, it may be on track to reach a new ATH in the coming months.
